                  CHAPTER I.
                  "AND so we are to have some new neighbors," said Mr. St. John, as the family gathered around a table spread with the substantial luxuries of a Virginia breakfast.
                  "Who are they?" queried Mrs. St. John, pausing in her operation of filling the quaint-old china cups with fragrant coffee from an antique silver urn.
                  "Monsieur and Madame Auguste D'Allure," replied her husband, glancing with an air of mock pomposity at a charming nymph of seventeen, who sat on her mother's right. "These are names to charm your fashionable and French loving ears, Kate."
                  "Charmant!" exclaimed Kate in the same tone. "And pray, most reverend papa, in what direction are we to look for these new neighbors?"
                  "They have purchased Marsden's old place. What a shame, by the way, to part with an old homestead on the plea that it is too expensive to keep up two es- tablishments. Better give up the town house, I think. I don't like Arthur's consent to the sacrifice. However, it is the whim of his mother and sisters, so Kate, don't look so indignant; I know women will have their way, and we must spare poor Arthur. Well, the situation you know is a beautiful one; northern architects are employed, the old house has been demolished, and the new one is progressing, as the Yankees have it, with a speed which astonishes old Virginia."
                  "As they are French, they will doubtless be very gay," said Kate hopefully, "and then think how I can improve my accent in their society."
                  "Your manners and morals likewise," laughed her brother.
                  "We must find out who these strangers are, dear," said Mrs. St. John, with Southern exclusiveness, "ere I permit you to seek their society."
                  "They are doubtless people of wealth," rejoined her husband. "On their personal merits I am not prepared to pronounce. D'Allure, I have heard, has lived in this country since his childhood."
                  "French adventurers are not, I should think, very desirable acquaintances," sneered Miss Prudentia Prim Spitfire, a lady whose position in the family will hereafter be defined; "however, my opinion goes for nothing, of course."
                  "We have no reason to believe them adventurers," returned the younger St. John, quickly. "Delham says he met them in Washington last winter, moving in the best circles as persons of position and affluence. He saw little of D'Allure himself, but thought Madame a charming woman."
                  "When I meet a woman who is pronounced charming by the men, I generally find she has little else to recommend her," retorted Miss Prudentia, with a slight contraction of her thin, leathery lips.
                  "That is quite a sufficient recommendation," commenced Noble; but his father interrupted him with "We should not form our judgment until we can do so fairly, which will not be until we know them personally," and then to change the subject—"Where is Ida?"
                  "I expect Sis is in one of her sublime moods, and cannot condescend to such a common-place operation as eating her breakfast," replied the lively Kate.
                  "Ida is not very well," said the mother, reprovingly. "She is not strong, and last winter's dissipation in the city was too much for her."
                  "Airs!" said Miss Spitfire, under her breath; "nothing but airs."
                  "Well, I don't see how pleasure can hurt any one," rejoined Kate. "As for me, I never think of that dear old Exchange Hotel, without such visions of beaux and balls dancing through my brain!"
                  "That is because it was your first winter," rejoined her brother, with a blasé air, which, in a young gentleman of twenty, was so absurd as to provoke a general smile.
                  "What say you to a ride to see the building operations?" suggested Mr. St. John. "The morning is so fine it tempts one out, and the exercise, I have no doubt, would be of service to Ida."
                  "Delightful! say I for one," cried Kate, gleefully, making two springs from the table into the piazza.
                  There was a universal assent.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER II.
                  HALF an hour afterwards, the family group, with the exception still of Ida, were assembled on the piazza of the stately old mansion. The respectable gray-headed coachman, the equipments of the handsome though old-fashioned carriage, with its fine bay horses, together with the nameless air of pride and refinement about the people and their surroundings, unostentatious, but still unmistakable, denoted an old and wealthy Virginia family.
                  The perfect taste of Mrs. St. John was evinced in the exquisite neatness and simplicity of every article of her morning costume. No robe of Paris pattern, and material "that could not be obtained under five dollars a yard," fell in exuberant folds around her slight figure. A plain wrapper of white muslin, a light black silk mantle, and one of those simple affairs made at home, and of white cambric, rejoicing under the name of "sun-bonnets," was considered quite good enough for the quiet and dignified position of a Southern matron.
                  She looked young for the mother of several grown children, though there was a wan paleness, a fragile delicacy stamped on the small regular features; but the silver threads were not perceptible in the shining tints of the fair hair, and if at times the gentle blue eyes wore the shadow of a past sorrow, they were now filled with the light of a serene contentment. Kate, her dark green riding-dress fitting perfectly her tall symmetrical figure, a light straw hat shading her bright, lovely face, her rich brown hair in close braids, her hazel eyes sparkling with animation, stood idly caressing the silver waves of her pet pony's mane.
                  "Snow-flake," for such was the name of the pure white graceful creature, seemed in nowise averse to the caresses of his lovely mistress. On the contrary, he every now and then evinced his approbation of the proceedings by a gentle shake of the head, and a low intelligent whinny, which Kate called "a polite acknowledgment of the favor."
                  Southerners delight in beautiful horses, and the three now waiting for the riders would have charmed the eye of a connoisseur.
                  For my own taste, I like best the fiery bay of Noble. There is such a lordliness in the powerful symmetry of his developments, in the flash of the eye, the impatient champ of the bit, and then how proudly he curvets, and paws the ground with a fire over which the groom has scarcely any control. In Ida's glossy black Arabian, there is the perfect beauty of form, the exquisite delicacy of the extremities, the graceful arch of the neck, the small symmetrical head, and the large beautiful eyes, with the intelligence almost of a human being in their liquid depths, peculiar to its race.
                  I could write ten pages about a beautiful horse, or a noble dog, without exhausting my enthusiasm, but for the benefit of my readers, who may not share my predilection, will return to the family group—whose pen-limned daguerreotypes I might as well sketch all at once.
                  Mr. St. John, who in a low tone is giving some directions to his coachman, is a man somewhat past middle age, negligent in the arraying of a still fine-looking person, with an air of careless bonhomie breaking through the indolent repose of the Southern manner.
                  Noble St. John, his clear blue eyes flashing with mischief, is alternating his amusements between tickling the ear of a fox-hound sleeping at his feet with the lash of his riding-whip, and teasing Miss Spitfire, who, in garments as grave, formal and severe looking as herself, comes in like a dark shadow, throwing into strong relief the lively tints of the picture.
                  He is a young man of not more than twenty years, of graceful figure and handsome features, with that look of premature manhood peculiar to our Southern youth, like the early luscious ripening of fruit, too often containing within itself the seeds of decay.
                  "Why don't Ida come?" exclaimed Kate, at length, impatiently stamping her little foot, and desisting suddenly from her caresses of Snowflake, who thereupon looked like a much injured individual. As she spoke her sister appeared. It is difficult to describe one who is to be the principal personage of this "ower true tale," and around whose character many a deep observer had declared was thrown a strange interest.
                  Persons generally fall into the error of believing that a person whose character or face presents rare or striking traits, is more easily portrayed than an ordinary passive individual. Never was there a greater mistake. Such faces and characters require the deepest study, the finest touches, the most delicate yet brilliant limnings of author or artist to develope their peculiar beauties, and even then it is often a failure, reminding one of a celebrated artist who, in attempting to paint the head of a great poet, after repeated attempts threw aside the palette in disgust, exclaiming—"I can paint the mortal, but not the immortal!"
                  Of Ida, I would much prefer giving the opinions of others, to my own, for she is a favorite, and I might be considered partial; but so varied were these opinions we fear our readers would form no definite idea from them, for while some declared her without reservation beautiful, others pronounced her not beautiful, but striking, fascinating, and oth- ers again declared that they saw nothing uncommon about her. Were we to quote from her lovers, we should rave of her ruby lips, dazzling smile, and wondrous eyes; and to quote from those who loved her not,—and these were not a few,—wo should shoot still further from the mark, for envy and malice see through distorted mediums, and give to the purest and loveliest a loathsome hue and shape.
                  The wavy masses of dark hair, and rich brunette complexion, denoted a true daughter of her summer clime, and it needed but one glance into the "dusky twilight eye" to tell that her soul was rife with the wild beautiful feelings, the vivid fancy, the boundless capacity for love, which the South gives to her children of genius as lavishly as she strews in their path sunshine, flowers and fragrance.
                  The versatility which gave to her features 
                        
                           "That loveliness ever in motion which plays
                           Like the light upon Autumn's soft shadowy days,"
                        
                      was strongly mirrored in her character. Thus the flippant beaux of her ball-room acquaintance, as they followed her lovely figure through the dance, and caught the bright glances shot from beneath the fringed lashes, pronounced her the most piquant bewitching little coquette in the world; while old men listened with grave interest to the brilliant converse and noble sentiments, that betrayed the true-hearted, thoughtful woman.
                  And there was old Mrs. Brown, the overseer's wife, who loved to pour the complaints of her "dreadful rheumatiz, the children's measles, and the mink which destroyed her chickens," into Miss Ida's sympathizing ear, who listened with such cordial interest as invariably to cause the old lady to remark afterwards to her husband—
                  "That's a good plain sensible girl. I wonder she don't get married raly. She'll make some man a good wife, that's certing."
                  Children could never be made to comprehend that she was a "real grown up young lady," she joined so gleefully in their sports, taught them so many new plays, and told them so many pretty stories. They were quite indignant when the old people claimed their "pretty Ida."
                  As for the servants they worshipped the ground she trod.
                  But all this time the imperious Kate is waiting, so we will leave the reader to fill up this long drawn but feeble portrait to his liking, and return to the remainder of the family group.
                  "We have been waiting for your sultanaship this half hour," said Noble, in a tone of merry sarcasm, as his sister swept through the piazza.
                  With a gracefully expressed regret Ida mounted her beautiful Zuleika, while Noble bounded into the saddle, leaving the carriage to follow at will.
                  As for Kate, she was already cantering down the avenue at a topping pace, waving her veil as she laughingly bade the party "good-bye!"
                  The air was balmy with the breath of April, and earth was beautiful in her fresh Spring hues, as a virgin when the first blush of love is on her cheek.
                  Our party rode gaily onward, meeting occasionally groups of negroes passing from one portion of plantation work to another, their stalwart forms well, though plainly clad, their ebony faces shining with the content which proved that they belonged to a household where the meanest dependent was well cared for and happy.
                  Perhaps there was never a more serenely contented mind than that of Mr. St. John, as he surveyed the broad acres of his ancestral heritage, and the glad faces Providence had called around him, who looked up to him as the loving father, or the kind and provident master.
                  "Really, I was unprepared for this," said Noble, as a turn in the road brought them in view of the object of their ride.
                  Landscape gardeners were busy with the grounds, which had long been left in true Virginia style to their own native and neglected beauty.
                  The thick foliage of the trees had been pruned down to a graceful luxuriance; the shrubbery trimmed and trained over frames; bowers and serpentine walks appeared as if by magic; and to crown the whole, a beautiful villa, with its airy and graceful architecture, had arisen in the place of the tumble-down old mansion, which adorned the spot when they left for their winter in the Capitol.
                  Kate burst into repeated exclamations of delight, and Ida reined in Zuleika and gazed with enthusiasm on a sight which gratified to the utmost her love of the picturesque.
                  "What an addition this villa will be to the neighborhood," said Noble, as they dismounted, "content as most of us are, with the old-fashioned mansions bequeathed by our forefathers, or some straight square pile of more modern build."
                  Kate flew over the house like a bird, from room to room, peeping from the windows to catch the different views of the landscape, admiring the architecture of the building, and finally climbing through the sky-light, to the infinite detriment of the green riding-dress, displayed herself to the alarmed eyes of her mother, on the scaffolding where the workmen were employed in completing the outside decorations of the roof.
                  "My darling!" almost shrieked Mrs. St. John.
                  
                  "Take care, Kate," called her father, "one false step may prove your ruin."
                  "Never mind, I'll be down in a moment," and she was out of sight again.
                  "You are really unfortunate in your children, Katharine," remarked Miss Prim, who always played the part of Job's comforter. "Kate and Noble are such thoughtless harumscarums, and as for Ida, she is a mere bundle of romantic fancies, of no practical use to herself or any one else. You had better take care of yourself, and not stand long on this damp ground. As for me, I am quite satisfied with seeing all that is to be seen, and shall just sit here till you are ready to start." And seating herself in the piazza, the estimable lady mounted a pair of old silver spectacles, unrolled her knitting, and diligently twitched her needles, looking meanwhile with disdainful contempt on the party not yet satiated with the beauty and freshness around them.
                  "It is a sad thought," said Mrs. St. John, as they wound their way through a serpentine walk, the husband occasionally pausing to add a flower to the bouquet his wife had already gathered; "it is a sad thought that sorrow must ever dim a nature so full of sunshine as Kate's."
                  "Nay, my dear; why should we anticipate sorrow for Kate? Hitherto her sky has been without a cloud."
                  "It is for that very reason I fear the change must come. You see how subdued and quiet I am. Time was when I was full of life as she is now."
                  Her husband gazed on her for a moment in silence. There was something of inquiry in the look, and the wife turned hurriedly away.
                  "Where is Ida?" she asked. "I know not what has come over her of late. She is always in those musing melan- choly moods which have from childhood, at times, shadowed her life."
                  "Only maiden caprice, wife, depend on it. I fancy that handsome dare-devil, Cameron Haughton, has more to do with Ida's present pensiveness than any one else."
                  "Oh God! no?" gasped the wife, while a spasm of intense and uncontrollable pain contracted her features; "you do not think so?"
                  "No; not positively," replied her husband, with much concern; "but, my dear wife, you permit your fears of the reckless character of the young man to carry you too far in maternal anxiety. Many a young fellow wild as he, has reformed and made a useful member of society. Besides, I truthfully believe there may, in reality, be nothing serious between Ida and himself."
                  A strange, almost ghastly smile at the first portion of his words, flitted over the pale face of Mrs. St. John, which her husband did not perceive beneath the veil she hastily lowered, but she permitted herself to be reassured, even as one seeks to believe that false, the reality of which is too horrible to contemplate.
                  Kate went in search of Ida, and finally discovered her in a rustic seat bordering the grounds, where the fragrance of vine, tree, and flower, in their first bud and bloom exhaled a balmy freshness, and the river, its broad waves glittering in the morning sunlight, wound curving through its banks, looking in the distance like a succession of lakes, gemmed with emerald islets.
                  Ida started from her rapt enjoyment of the scene as she heard her sister's footsteps, and at the same moment the sound of a hunting horn rung through the woods, followed by the note of a small shrill whistle known as "the recall," signifying that the chase was over.
                  
                  The sound made Ida spring to her feet, with beaming eyes and glowing cheek.
                  The next instant horses' feet were heard dispersing in different directions, and a single horseman appeared, riding towards the spot where they stood, his unwearied charger, black as jet, covered with foam, champing the bit, and tearing the earth beneath him, as he dashed onward.
                  In truth, steed and rider were well-matched, both belonging to that "mixture of the wild and thoroughbred," which, says some shrewd observer, "in a man always turns the head of a romantic girl."
                  As he saw the two ladies, without an apparent effort, he reined in his powerful steed, which stood quivering in every limb, and bowed courteously.
                  He might well have sat in his bold striking beauty for the portrait of the monarch of the chase. The upper part of his face was somewhat of the Indian character; the large black eyes all fire, flash, and daring, and straight aquiline nose, but the curving voluptuousness of the mouth was only redeemed from effeminacy by its expression of pride and determination. He wore no beard, unless the scarcely perceptible line of jet bowing the upper lip, could have claimed the name. The rich waving masses of dark hair were so profuse in their luxuriance as almost to conceal the fine contour of the head, but there was something in the manly symmetry and strength of the figure, the full development of chest, shoulders, limbs, with the careless, apparently untaught grace of every movement, which reminded one still further of those children of the forest whose only mirrors are their native streams, with mother Nature as teacher of the graces.
                  After a glance of quick, passionate intelligence at Ida, and a few gay words with her sister, Cameron Haughton, with an apology for his hunting dress, invited himself with his usual nonchalant independence, to be of the party home.
                  "If mamma thought Ida sick or sad this morning, her fears, I am sure, ought to be dispelled now," said Kate to Noble, as her sister, with flashing eye and glowing cheek, her light laugh ringing on the breeze, swept far in advance of them, as if infused with the wild spirit of her companion.
                  "Yes," replied Noble, smiling significantly.
                  Kate looked back at the carriage.
                  "Mamma is not well, I think. See how pale she looks, and as if in pain. I am glad we are nearly home."
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  
                     
                        
                           "'Tis such a home as we might picture
                           In our dreams of purity and happiness."
                        
                     
                  
                  SELDOM does the eye rest upon a fairer domain than Huntingwild, the home of the St. Johns, and so my readers will say, if on any bright day's sail, they have seen it from the river, in all the luxuriance of its summer wealth of leaf and flower, shadowy vales, and gently undulating hills.
                  The house is a stately, old-fashioned structure, with spacious halls and chambers, and a picture gallery.
                  It was built by St. John, Earl of ——, who, on account of troubles of a private nature, became a voluntary exile from his English patrimony.
                  While boasting none of the wild mountain scenery which gives such a romantic and beautiful character to the upper portion of Virginia, the fields of lower Virginia, particularly the vast old plantations bordering the James, are glowing with the fertile luxurious productions of a choice climate, and with the aid of fine water views, possess a soft and sunny beauty peculiarly their own. Certes, they present a most tempting appearance to the gazer's eye, particularly when the gazer is one who looks upon an old homestead, where in days long gone by the childish feet of his ancestors wandered, and broad acres, which have been swept from the grasp of the present generation by the spendthrift habits of the past.
                  Upper Virginia would have delighted the gloom-tinged, romantic pencil of Salvator Rosa, while lower Virginia demands the glowing tints and fairy touch of a Claude.
                  The character of the people belonging to these two portions of country, differs quite as much as that of the scenery. The upper Virginians, even those who boast "the pure blood of the cavaliers" (of which such an exhaustless stream is supposed to have flowed into our chosen land some century or two ago), have borrowed some portion of the hardy health and energy, and the honest republican principles of the German settlers, who here and there have pitched their tents among them, while the people of lower Virginia retain all the aristocratic prejudices of the old régime, combined, 'tis true, with much warm, generous feeling, and (where they have money enough to keep it up) courtly hospitality.
                  They, the last-named, live a sort of indolent, enervating existence, somewhat like that of the German prince, who, never having looked beyond the domains of his own castle, imagined himself the greatest potentate the world could boast.
                  Of the great battle of the outer world, where man in his moral strength measures himself against man, and where the son of the plebeian struggles side by side with the son of the aristocrat, perchance, nay often, outstripping him in the race, they know not any thing, or if they do, they would prefer their sons and daughters to subsist on the chimerical and windy diet denominated family pride, rather than win wealth by such an ignoble contest with the crowd.
                  Now, to use a strictly polished, and strikingly expressive phrase, I know I shall "catch it" at home for these remarks, but really I have said nothing that is not strictly true, nor have I done half justice to the subject, though I would not derogate a tittle from the many noble qualities of the class of people of whom I have just been discoursing.
                  But to return to the spot where for awhile my reader and myself are sojourning.
                  The ancestor of our St. John brought his English tastes to his new home.
                  The yule log burned brightly in the broad fireplace of the old hall, on Christmas night. By day the baying hound and hunter's horn, and by night, song and wassail, rung out as joyously as ever they sounded in "Merrie England." His stud and kennel were the admiration of the country round. His descendant inherited the tastes, and kept up fully, in this respect, the reputation of his predecessor.
                  A covered piazza, with white sanded floor, and light-spiral pillars of marble, runs the whole length and breadth of the mansion, save on one side, which being the one most exposed to the sometimes burning rays of our Southern sun, is constructed of close lattice work, overhung by jessamine, woodbine, and multiflora roses, through whose shade the breeze wanders, bringing fragrance in every breath. The house stands on an eminence commanding a far and sweeping prospect, and in this piazza the family often assemble amid the soft shadows of the summer twilight, to watch the swan-like, graceful steamers, and white-sailed skiffs, which dot the calm surface of the noble James.
                  
                  The grounds are very extensive, planted with lordly oaks, beneath whose waving boughs the red man sheltered him from sun or storm, centuries ago. There is also an undergrowth of smaller trees and shrubbery; the many-leaved locust, with its creamy blossoms, heavy with voluptuous fragrance, the rich and bursting blossoms of the rhododendron drooping beneath their gorgeous weight of loveliness, the sweetbrier rose, which, as we inhale its pure breath, seems to whisper to us of the gushing streams and wildwood freshness we loved in childhood.
                  Bowers covered with the myriad blossoms of the multi-flora and the snowy petals of the white jessamine, intertwined with the broad green leaves and purple fruit of the wild grape, are scattered here and there, the lattice work decayed, and in some places fallen, from the hand of time.
                  The grass grows wild and luxuriantly, so that the foot sinks as in a soft carpet at every step, ever and anon crushing the sweet daisies and violets, hidden in their verdant bed. The massive old gates have a porter's lodge, but it is unused and falling into decay too.
                  There is a majestic sweep of gravel walk for half a mile in front of the house, curving near the entrance into a circle, enclosing a fountain, with its moss-covered brink, and nymph of stone, brown and defaced by age, but looking only the more antiquated and venerable for that.
                  In the warm summer nights, when allured by the wild weird-like beauty which tree and wave, bower and fountain assumed in the moon and starlight, the girls lingered—loth to close their young eyes in slumber, long after the rest of the household were wrapped in repose—talking as girls are wont to talk with silvery breaks of laughter and soft smothered sighs, pouring out their innocent heart-secrets, and throwing many a yearning glance and rosy hope over the dim waves of the far Future; often in these nights they used to steal forth to the old fountain and lave their fair limbs in its star-gemmed waters. Very lovely they looked, Kate's golden brown tresses, and Ida's shadowy locks, embracing their ivory shoulders and floating over the waters as they sported joyously as sea nymphs, an old "Aunty" holding towels and robes des chambres on the brink, and smiling with delight at their mad gambols.
                  What sculptured image can portray the marvellous symmetry, the warm, living, breathing loveliness of a perfect woman?
                  Music, poetry, painting, all that the vast treasures of creation can furnish is embodied here.
                  What creation of mere art can equal the most beautiful work of the Creator of the Beautiful, warmed by a soul intense, all pervading, fathomless in feeling, yet pure in thought as were the fountains of Paradise ere the sin-stained lip of the Fallen had drunk of their waters?
                  Within the mansion the pale blue hue of the walls inlaid with vast mirrors, the dark shining cornices and wainscoting of carved oak, and the rich old-fashioned furniture, suited well the tastes of the descendants of England's ancient and proud nobility.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  TWENTY years—well, it might have been a trifle more—before the commencement of our story, John St. John was by reputation the most desirable parti in the neighborhood where he lived, in the uninterrupted enjoyment of his ancestral home, an income of ten thousand a year, and single blessedness.
                  
                  He seemed proof against all temptations to matrimony until he met, in a visit of some weeks duration to an old friend, a "little widow" from the far South, gentle, sad, and touchingly lovely.
                  His intimacy with her relatives, with whom she was making a temporary home, threw him much in the society of Mrs. Walton; his kind heart was touched by her sweet pensive sadness, and evident desire to avoid rather than seek attention. His deferential manner and genuine good feeling won her confidence. In short, after a not very lengthened courtship, St. John became "the husband of the widow, and the father of the orphan," in the shape of Mrs. Walton, and her daughter Ida, then scarcely a year old.
                  There were a good many remarks about the marriage at the time, in the way of neighborhood gossip. People thought it a shame that St. John should have sacrificed himself to the arts of that widow, no doubt she was a "wolf in sheep's clothing;" but after it was all over beyond reprieve, you may not believe it, but I assure you 'tis true, there was the most extraordinary revulsion in their feelings, insomuch as that the very people who seemed to cherish the most lively animosity against Mrs. Walton, were the first to order their carriages, and tender their congratulations to Mrs. St. John; and this with a manner which must have convinced a candid and truthful mind, that her happiness was a matter of the deepest interest to them.
                  There are some disinterested people in the world, for Ida Walton was penniless, yet was she wooed by many. From childhood the precocious and attractive girl had been surrounded by admirers enough to turn the heads of a dozen ordinary women, but though linked to all of her kind by that peculiar and loving sympathy which is so beautiful a trait in woman's nature, the "many" had no power to call forth the feelings slumbering in the depths of her rare proud nature.
                  But now in the perfection of matured and glorious womanhood, the feelings attained to their perfect growth, and the soul having developed to the utmost the beautiful creations of its young years, the fountain was touched and the waters gushed forth.
                  And the talisman?
                  One look! one look from the deep dark eyes of Cameron Haughton, which sent a world of mysterious sympathy and intelligence thrilling through her soul till every heart chord vibrated at the touch of the master spirit.
                  It would have been difficult for the most practical reasoner to have convinced her from that moment that she had not met her destiny.
                  It was but a short time before their introduction to the reader that the pair met for the first time.
                  Young Haughton's father had for some years been a resident on the plantation opposite Huntingwild, but Cameron was in the army, and his visits home were like those of angels.
                  Mr. Haughton was said to be a widower, and Cameron his only child. It was rumored that they were not always on the best terms in the world, but be that as it may, he complained of loneliness in his absence, and was at times a frequent visitor at Huntingwild. I say at times, for there were periods when he would absent himself for months, without apparent cause.
                  Rumor reported him as very eccentric, something of a freethinker, and at times subject to fits of the most absorbing melancholy.
                  Mr. St. John attributed his irregular intercourse with his family to his eccentricity, and always gave him, when the caprice was over, a cordial welcome. As for Mrs. St. John, she never expressed an opinion with regard to him, unless forced to do so, and if any thing in her conduct annoyed her husband, this did. He deprecated in his heart the religious, or rather irreligious, opinions of his friend; but as a man of polished, and when he chose, eminently pleasing manners, extensive information, and thorough knowledge of the mysteries of chess (one of St. John's hobbies), he liked and respected him, passed over the freethinking in silence, and felt annoyed at the want of his wife's usual ready sympathy in his likes and dislikes.
                  True, she was always extremely polite, nay, even cordial; but there was at times a restless irritation visible in her manner when Haughton was near, a desire which she vainly attempted to conceal, to avoid him, which perplexed her husband to the last degree, though he attributed it to a prejudice which he was astonished to see her indulge.
                  Hitherto the intercourse between Cameron and Ida had been of such a nature as to awaken no attention from the family; only Mr. St. John suspecting, from one or two little incidents which had fallen under his notice, the turn affairs were taking. Mrs. St. John's time was too much absorbed by the care of an invalid son and her younger children, to give to the rest of the household all the care and surveillance it demanded.
                  Ida's attention was first attracted to Cameron Haughton by the recital of some daring feat of courage in the border warfare of the frontier where he was stationed. Scarcely had the echoes of applause died, ere disgusted with the confined and monotonous life of the soldier, he threw up his commission and returned home. Like most women, Ida's admiration for bravery was a passion, and she longed to see and hear more of the young hero.
                  She had not long to complain of a dearth of news concerning him. He soon became notorious; his feats in the chase, as a shot and a horseman, his fine talents and personal appearance, with his various itinerant, though in some instances valuable accomplishments, giving him that influence over the youth of his acquaintance, which such qualities always confer on their possessor.
                  The old-fashioned worthies of the neighborhood shook their heads, and sagely remarked that "the morals of the young men were at a much lower ebb since Cameron Haughton had come among them."
                  But here the reader will do well to remember that his Satanic Majesty—to paraphrase an old saw—is not always so sombre in hue as he is represented, and form accordingly his impressions of the young gentleman in question.
               
               
                  CHAPTER V.
                  
                     
                        
                           "I will warrant she was a most dainty casket, fair to look upon, and of a sweet and gentle presence, but for the jewel within I cannot say."
                        
                        —OLD PLAY.
                     
                  
                  "MY dear," said the hospitable St. John, about two weeks after the occurrences of our first chapter, "I have met D'Allure several times, as you know, during the last fortnight, and from what I have seen of him, like him very much. Yesterday, at my friend S—'s, in Richmond, I met Madame for the first time, and think her a charming person. S—says he knows them well, and they are unexceptionable. In the course of conversation, Madame regretted very much that she could not in person superintend the operations at the villa, the distance from town—eight miles—rendering it inconvenient. I immediately placed our house at her service. As you go into town to-day, I wish you would call and repeat my invitation. It will be a good opportunity of showing kindness to those who will speedily be among us, and I doubt not we shall find them a delightful acquisition."
                  "I will do so with pleasure, dear."
                  The next afternoon the family were assembled on the piazza to welcome the expected guests. Ida was lost in admiration of a sunset which seemed to have gathered all the brilliant hues of earth and sky into one gorgeous combination, when she was aroused by Kate's exclamation of "Here they come!"
                  A carriage, with two trunks behind, and one in front, swept round the circle to the door. Down jumped from the seat, which he had occupied with the driver, an exceedingly Frenchy looking individual, with dapper figure, and profusion of moustache. Was this M. D'Allure? No, it must be the valet, for the opening of the carriage door was followed by the appearance of a fine-looking man neatly, though plainly dressed, with the slightest perceptible foreign air. Then followed a soubrette, very much resembling, in air and appearance, the approved models on the boards of a theatre; then a dressing-case and valise, then a poodle, carefully wrapped—there having been a shower during the day—and lastly, a lady, whose figure and face in her dark travelling sacque and thick veil, were not very discernible.
                  She did not raise her veil as she bowed to the family introductions, and these over, followed Mrs. St. John—who was expressing her fears that she felt fatigued from her long ride—to the rooms prepared for her reception.
                  "Lor', Sis Ida," cried in a breath the two little girls, Nina and Minnie, as soon as the D'Allures disappeared, "they are some of the nobility, aren't they? A valet and a femme de—what is it?" and off they flew in a polka.
                  The supper table presented a tempting appearance, by the blazing light of six wax candles, in their lofty, old-fashioned silver branches, with its well chosen, not too profuse delicacies, and glittering service of old plate and china, crowned by that greatest charm of earth, the bright faces of a happy family circle.
                  Cæsar and Antony, with their white gloves and handsome dark blue livery, flourished their silver waiters, and assumed their most aristocratic air, preparatory to the entrance of "them furrin quality."
                  When Madame D'Allure appeared her entertainers had an opportunity of gratifying the curiosity each felt, though they were too well-bred to allow her by the slightest indication to perceive it.
                  Apparently she was about twenty-five—in reality, perhaps, a good deal older; her tall, graceful figure, and delicate features were somewhat attenuated by time or dissipation, but this was not perceptible, unless upon a very close scrutiny, for she had the art of dressing so as to heighten every beauty, and conceal or lessen each defect. Her apparent profusion of rich brown hair was arranged in thick, shining curls, falling to her shoulders in front, and behind gathered up under the most coquettish, but least assuming of head dresses. Her arms were good, her hands beautiful, and shown, by a thousand graceful movements, to the best advantage. Her eye of a soft deep blue, was her best feature, melting with feeling, or sparkling with animation at will. Her mouth and teeth were fine also, her figure graceful, and slender enough to "make up well" in mantua-making phrase, and her little feet always cased in the most becoming slippers or gaiters of the best Paris make, and peeping out bewitchingly just as your eyes, falling beneath the speaking glance she knew so well how to use, sought the carpet. A slight soupçon of rouge lighted up a complexion naturally pale, and gave the finishing touch to this charming tout ensemble.
                  
                  M. D'Allure entered with ease and volubility into conversation with the ladies, leaving his wife to the care of St. John and Noble.
                  Madame said little, but replied with the sweetest smile and most graceful bow to the remarks addressed to her.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  
                     
                        "He has the true talisman of power who can read the intricate workings of the human heart."
                     
                  
                  A DAY of cloud and storm succeeded, which precluded the possibility of an out-door expedition. The family assembled in the drawing-room. St. John and D'Allure played chess; Kate's fairy fingers chased themselves over the piano keys, in a succession of brilliantly performed opera gems, while Madame, Ida, and Noble formed a trio apart from the rest.
                  They were discussing the beauties of foreign lands, for Madame had travelled far and near, Ida was rich in the storied records of every age, and Noble listened and joined in with the eager interest the young ever feel in things new and strange.
                  Madame was a good, nay a brilliant converser, for though she had not those rare gifts of nature, wit, eloquence and feeling, which Ida possessed in a pre-eminent degree, she had much general though superficial information, could bring in a quotation prettily, and was possessed of that perfect self-possession and graceful ease, which invariably pleases, and which has the appearance of being perfectly natural, though it is often the result of years of study and practice.
                  Every look, every word, every movement, was arranged to "tell" with that consummate art, which is the illegitimate sister of nature, and so like that they are often mistaken for each other.
                  Mrs. St. John sat by the couch of her invalid child, a boy of about fifteen years, fair and fragile as the most delicate woman. By a stroke of lightning at seven years of age, the fine blooming child was rendered a cripple for life, and the after effects led to total blindness. But the stroke which deprived him of physical power, had left untouched the perfect beauty of his features rendered ethereal in appearance by the refinement of years of suffering, borne with uncomplaining gentleness. His beauty, his misfortunes, his martyr-like resignation and clinging affection, rendered him an object of the tenderest devotion in the family, and the name of Willie, the blind boy, was a talismanic sound conveying the spirit of love, holiness and forbearance.
                  He could not rise from his couch, but, propped on pillows, it was his delight to be wheeled from room to room, or in the bright sunshine without wherever he could hear the dear tones of those, the light of whose countenances had long been darkened to him, never again to be revealed till spirit met spirit in the Eternal Home.
                  From time to time, when it could be done unperceived, the eyes of Madame D'Allure rested on the different individuals composing the family group, with that keen, searching gaze, which takes in more in an instant than a dozen casual glances. The same thing might have been remarked of the husband. The glances of the wife were particularly directed towards Noble.
                  Not a lineament of form or feature, from the light brown curls, wreathing his frank, open brow, to the tips of his small, aristocratic extremities escaped her, and occasionally, when he was listening with unusual interest to what she was saying, her glance melted into his with a magnetic fascination.
                  About cleven the weather brightened; a clearing up was predicted, at twelve it clouded, and at one it poured.
                  Kate, in despair, commenced a romp with the children in the hall. The other ladies were about dispersing to dress for dinner, when in burst Nina and Minnie.
                  "Oh, papa! oh, brother Noble! here are Mr. Delham and Mr. Marsden, as wet as two drowned rats, and Cæsar showed them right into the hall, where they caught Sis Kate with her hair all down, and her dress torn nearly off."
                  "Awful catastrophe!" laughed Noble, hastening out to welcome the unexpected visitors.
                  "Too bad that Kate will romp," said Ida. The ladies met the two young men, on their descent in fresh toilettes to dinner.
                  A merry laugh and a blush, on the part of Kate, were the only signs that she had met them before.
                  Delham was a young man who rejoiced in a handsome face, slender figure, faultlessly dressed, dark rich locks, ditto moustache, trimmed in the extreme à-la-mode, and dazzling teeth.
                  Yet notwithstanding the care employed in the arrangement of a toilette which even the Parisian taste of Madame D'Allure pronounced "comme il faut," he was entirely free from coxcombry in manner. Gay, easy, conversant, with that ready kindness of heart which made him ever willing to sacrifice self to oblige others, Charlie Delham was a universal favorite.
                  Marsden's daguerreotype presents a commanding figure and fine features, which, with an unmistakable air of high-breeding and cultivation, make up a most presentable person.
                  The late dinner concluded, the party adjourned to the drawing-room, where the evening passed charmingly, with the aid of Kate's musical talent, cultivated to the highest extent, and joined to a voice of marvellous sweetness, Ida's rare powers of conversation, Noble's joyous flow of spirits, and the easy, agreeable manners of the remainder of the party.
                  Those were happy days at Huntingwild—dear, old Huntingwild! home of peace, joy, and love! May the strangers welcomed within thy hospitable halls be to its gentle fold angels of good, rather than of evil.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  MORNING arose, bright and cloudless.
                  The family lingered over a late breakfast.
                  "What is the programme for to-day?" asked Kate, balancing her teaspoon on the edge of her petite cup of transparent porcelain.
                  "Are we to stay in doors all day as we did yesterday? If I have to practise through another twelve hours, Meer-back will think me wondrously improved when I take my next lesson."
                  "Stay in doors," echoed Noble, "this superb day? Why, we will ride to the villa of course."
                  "Ah! yes, what say the party to a pic-nic there and a return by moonlight?"
                  "You can't do that, Kate," put in her mother, "for some friends are to dine with us, so I shall expect you home by half-past twelve or one."
                  "Then you have no time to lose," responded her husband. "Noble, order the horses."
                  "In a moment, father. Perhaps you would prefer my driving you in my buggy," across the table to Madame. "I should like to show you how beautifully my horses travel together. Broke them in myself."
                  Madame raised the fringes of her blue eyes languidly, and setting down the cup of coffee she had been sipping, smiled and glanced a graceful assent.
                  Notwithstanding their promise to return early, the party had barely time to change their toilettes for dinner after their arrival from their morning excursion. They had however the advantage, to which Madame at least was not insensible, of meeting the company with freshly gathered roses, and spirits exhilarated by their ride.
                  The dinner passed off as dinners—dull things!—generally do, namely, amid a subdued light, the quick movements of the well-trained servants, the clatter of knives and forks,—the tedium of several courses, a great deal of eating, and a very little stupid talk.
                  And for the company—there was Mr. Carlton, Mrs. St. John's uncle, with his snowy locks and portly presence, a fine specimen of the cavalier of the ancient régime now fast becoming extinct, men whose failing fortunes bring with them no diminution of pride or social position; the Bonfords, "a new family, rolling in wealth," but to do them justice—showing nothing of the parvenu in look or action, being quite as well dressed, and well mannered, as if their ancestors had been spendthrifts for centuries, instead of earning an independence by honest toil.
                  Marsden, with his lady-mother and sister from the city —Charlie Delham, and last but never least, Cameron Haughton, completed the party.
                  Ida was placed between young Haughton and Delham, rather an embarrassing position, all things taken into consideration. She was too much accustomed to society, however, to betray in her manner the slightest preference for one above the other.
                  Censorious people said that Charlie Delham had too much fickleness and volatility of character, ever to make more than a mere man of society, and the only thing which seemed to contradict this, was the changeless unobtrusive devotion which for years—notwithstanding it was returned only by a sister's pitying affection—he had cherished for Miss Walton.
                  Marsden was Kate's left-hand neighbor, and no unpleasing one, as was evident from her flushed cheek and sparkling smile.
                  Madame D'Allure in a superb dinner toilette, dazzled the eyes of the gentlemen, and threw completely into shade the modest dignified matrons around her.
                  The evening was devoted by the younger portion of the company to dancing, by the elder to cards or conversation.
                  Ida complained of headache as an excuse for not dancing, but her indisposition did not prevent her sitting in the deep embrasure of a window, where the moon stole softly in, and the early spring flowers steeped the air in perfume, listening to the low tones, and drinking in the eloquent glances of Cameron Haughton; while her heart beat an echo, and her pulses throbbed with tremulous ecstasy.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER VIII.
                  THE golden days of early spring flew on; new leaves, new buds, burst each hour into bloom, and earth was lit with a smile of gladness, like the joyous hopes and bright blush of youth. The stay of the D'Allures at Huntingwild was protracted to several weeks.
                  Rides, pic-nic excursions to the different points of interest in the neighborhood—music, dancing,—each was called in to add its quota to the enjoyment of the guests, united with that frank cordiality, those warm, generous feelings, which gave renown to the well-known hospitality of the St. Johns.
                  It was an evening or two after the departure of the D'Allures, when most of the household had not yet recovered from the nameless fatigue and depression occasioned by the departure of company, and the sudden relaxation from excitement.
                  Mrs. St. John was slowly pacing to and fro her chamber, the door of which was locked as if for security against intrusion. There was in her face that wan look of sadness, which at times flitted over it in her gayest moments, but which now, indulged in without restraint, gave to her features a corpselike hue and expression.
                  We have said that Huntingwild was a happy home, but is there a home on earth, upon which no shadow rests?
                  Never was there apparently a more devoted couple than Mr. and Mrs. St. John, but there was a mystery never explained between the hearts of the husband and wife.
                  St. John could not be blind to the deep-rooted sadness in which at times the very being of his wife was absorbed, but he attributed it, as did the rest of the household, to a vain, too passionate clinging to the past, and though the thought pained him, he had too much delicacy to question her of the cause; particularly as she seemed to shrink with nervous timidity from any allusion to the loved and lost of her youth. She paused at length, opened a private cabinet which stood in a recess rarely disturbed, took from thence a casket, and touching a secret spring disclosed a miniature, and some old faded letters tied with a bit of blue ribbon faded too. Opening the medallion she gazed long and mournfully upon the face it disclosed.
                  It was the face of a cherub boy scarce two years old. The light golden curls, the glowing flush of health on the cheek, and even the chiselled contour of the features, might have belonged in childhood to Willie or Noble, but the eyes assuredly could not be claimed by either; those large liquid night-black eyes, joyous and wild in their expression as those of the sportive fawn.
                  It was a life-like picture, the hues marvellously fresh, for the date—long years back—inscribed in small characters beneath it. Well might the mother gaze upon it with earnest, intense, mournful passion.
                  "Oh! my boy, my brave! my beautiful!" she murmured, in accents of thrilling feeling, "I would give all these broad lands, all this luxury,"—and her eyes glanced from the miniature to the rich antique furniture of the apartment—"to lay my hand but once on your head, and murmur a mother's blessing. My prayers have been unceasingly yours, but never on your wild and wandering path, from youth to manhood, has shone the blessed light of a mother's influence.
                  "Alas! how can I wonder that your footsteps stray into the evil ways of temptation! Oh God! Thou who alone knowest the yearning struggles, the all-sacrificing love of a mother, save and bless my boy. 'In Thee alone do I put my trust.' Thy love, thy protecting mercy alone can guard him 'mid the perilous paths of an evil, reckless life!"
                  She started at some slight noise without. Trembling with fear lest her voice, which she had raised in the fervor of supplication, should have been overhead, she hastily restored the miniature to its hiding-place, and listened for a tap at the door.
                  None came, and she walked to the window and threw it open, that the fresh air might cool the feverish flush which had succeeded her former paleness.
                  The lordly old oaks threw long-slanting shadows on the grass, and caught on their gorgeous autumn foliage the last beams of the setting sun.
                  Gradually the intense look of sadness passed from Mrs. St. John's face, and with the gathering shades of "twilight's dim religious veil" came a look of calm resignation.
                  The murmuring sound of voices arrested her attention, and started her from the train of thought into which she had fallen. She was about to turn from the window, when the forms of Cameron Haughton and Ida, emerging from a cluster of tall, thick shrubbery, rooted her to the spot.
                  They passed immediately beneath the window, little suspecting the anguished gaze fixed on them.
                  Ida's velvet cheek was the hue of carnation, and her eyes sought those bent so earnestly, lovingly upon her, with a glance which, beautiful and trusting as it was, went like red-hot steel to the mother's heart.
                  They turned presently into another path, and their forms were lost to sight.
                  Mrs. St. John watched for the last glimpse of their retreating figures, and then with clasped hands and bowed head stood as if in silent prayer.
                  Seating herself after this brief supplication at her escritoire, she hastily wrote:
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "IDA,—Is it possible that you have thoughtlessly permitted yourself to become interested in Cameron Haughton? Could you imagine for a moment that my sanction would ever be given to your love for a man, whose character,"—she paused here, as if struggling with herself; then, as if thinking aloud, murmured "yes, 'tis the only pretext I can use, but yet that I should condemn him thus," and her hand moved slowly on, as if with an effort,—"whose character is stained with vices, which must inevitably deprive you of all happiness, should you be so rash as to contemplate a union with him? But you are not surely so reckless as this? Ida, daughter of my youth and love, would you break your mother's heart by such a sacrifice? Let me entreat, nay, I will use a mother's privilege, and command you to think of him no more. If you do—mark my words—nothing but misery can be yours, such misery as you could not picture in your wildest dreams.
                              "I feel that 'tis better to write than to converse upon this topic, but whenever your heart rebels, read this, and remember—if you persist in this affair—your mother's prophecy,—a prophecy which you might recall hereafter with a remorse which years of repentance would scarce suffice to wash out."
                              
                                 CATHARINE ST. JOHN.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  Folding and sealing it, she rang for a servant. "Has Miss Ida returned from her walk?" she inquired of the servant girl who answered the summons.
                  "No, ma'am."
                  "Go find her, and say from me, the evening dews are too chill for her to be out longer."
                  As the servant departed she crossed the hall hurriedly to her daughter's room, and laid the note on her dressing-table, then paused a moment in that sanctum of maiden innocence.
                  She glanced at the snowy pillow where Ida's beautiful head rested in her bright slumbers; at the soft muslin draperies so gracefully arranged by her hands; at the bouquet of fresh roses embalming the air of the apartment, and at the various works of the best authors scattered on the table, denoting a refined and cultivated taste in their selection.
                  There was an air of sweet seclusion about the peaceful retreat, and as the mother thought of the pain she was about unwillingly to inflict on its occupant, a stifled sigh burst from her lip; but with a mighty conquest of self she went forth, and busied herself with her household concerns.
                  She was recrossing the hall to the dining-room, followed by a plump, smiling negress, with clean white apron and majestic turban, bearing a tea-tray loaded with "goodies," when she met Ida.
                  "Where is Mr. Haughton, love?"
                  "He had an engagement which prevented his spending the evening."
                  "Ah! I am sorry. Your hair seems to be falling. Had you not better go to your room and arrange it."
                  "I will, but kiss me first, dear mother!" and Ida clasped her mother in her quick, warm embrace, and without heeding the coldness of the lip she pressed, bounded to her room with a step light and free as air.
                  At first, she did not see the note, for throwing open the window, she drew a pile of damask cushions beneath it—her fancy instead of a chair—and throwing herself on them, crossed her little feet a la sultana, and sat half veiled in the muslin draperies, gazing out on the evening star.
                  Long she sat there, her great, dreamy eyes radiating light, and her heart full to overflowing with delicious, tremulous revery.
                  Very lovely she looked in her graceful, half-reclining posture; her light muslin dress confined around the girlish waist by a cherry sash; the tiny sleeve looped in infantile style with coral, revealing the perfect symmetry of the rounded arm; her dark, wavy tresses escaping from their confinement, as if longing to kiss the dimpled shoulders, peeping bewitchingly from the soft thread-lace edge of her dress.
                  What thought was it that subdued the piquant curve of her cherry lip into a softened tenderness? Of whom is the little maiden dreaming? Not surely of "that great brigand," as Kate called him,—that piratical-looking cruiser, that fence-leaping, fox-chasing, Indian-killing Cameron Haughton, of whom all the young ladies in the neighborhood were warned by their careful mammas, as being by no means a good, safe chance?
                  Yes, it was of no other person. The evening star, upon which her gaze was fixed, shone not upon her with half so soft a light as those "terrible black eyes" which one hour before had melted into her inmost heart. No music tones to her had ever been so sweet as those first words of love, from that haughty, reckless lip.
                  Ah! Ida, Ida, it's no use talking, you are lost beyond redemption.
                  Well, it is always so.
                  Show me a little, delicate, sensitive, exotic of a woman, with a nature as fanciful and finely strung as the faintest notes of a wind-harp, and the first thing you know she is off with some monster, whose soul, if we believe in transmigration, must in its former stage of being have inhabited the body of a lion, or, perchance, a great Newfound—ahem! dear me! what a terrible cough I have.
                  
                  "Supper's 'most ready, Miss Ida," were the matter-of-fact sounds which recalled our heroine from dream-land, as her maid, a respectable-looking colored woman, of perhaps forty, with a fat, brown, pleasant face, entered with candles.
                  Miranda bustled about, replenished the pitchers with cool, fresh water, opened a new parcel of soap, "Lubin's violet," placed the snowy damask towel, and proceeded to arrange the stained glass flâçons of perfume on the dressing-table, when her eye fell on the note. "Here's a letter, Miss Ida. Have you seen it?"
                  "No, give it me; and you may leave the room, Aunty, I shall not want you." The note was read. A look of appalled astonishment, then a flush of indignant passion! then crushing sobs—the wailing bursts of the heart's agony broke upon the still, calm air. Unheeding the repeated summons to the dining-room, unheeding aught save the bitterness of this sudden crushing of her heart's deep happiness, Ida crouched motionless on the sofa, her face hidden, the only signs of life the occasional convulsive quivering of her frame.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IX.
                  MISS PRUDENCE PRIM SPITFIRE was, by no means, a rare character. Too envious and ill-natured even in her younger days to retain the regard of the most enamored swain for any length of time, in her declining years she was forced to the unpleasant alternative of "making her home among friends," and this she did without the slightest regard to the taste or convenience of the unhappy beings whose households were subject to her incursions; making herself perfectly at home, and interfering, without leave or license, with the most private concerns of the family of which she was for the time being a member.
                  Finding Huntingwild more agreeable than most of her other stopping points, she often, at different periods, spent as much as six months during the year there, and Mr. St. John being too indolent, and Mrs. St. John too benevolent to displace her, she had grown to be somewhat of a privileged character.
                  Her strong imaginary claims on the family, were founded on what she was pleased to consider the near relationship existing between Mr. St. John and herself, she being the step-daughter of his mother's sister. It was supposed that, at one period of her life, Miss Prudence entertained a visionary hope that the not very musical sobriquet of Spitfire might be changed for the more euphonious name of St. John. Be that as it may, she was one of the most strenuous opposers of that "artful widow's" claims; and, indeed, it was rumored that an anonymous letter or two was dropped in Mr. St. John's way, not complimenting the character of Mrs. Walton in very extravagant terms, but that, of course, was all talk.
                  True, every now and then, even at the period of which we speak, a latent spite against the innocent, forbearing woman, who had borne with her ill-temper and caprices for years as none other would, was very perceptible in Miss Prudie's actions.
                  A few days after the events of our last chapter, that most exemplary specimen of her sex entered the store-room, where Mrs. St. John, in the midst of raisins, sugar, cut-glass, jelly, etc., was superintending the preparations for the dessert.
                  She came in, head tied up and duster in hand, by way of illustrating her domestic virtues and untiring industry, qual- ities, by the way, which no one, save herself, had ever been able to discover in her composition.
                  "What's the matter with Ida," she began, "that she can't be civil to decent people? Here she has been moping about the house like a ghost, for these two or three days past, and just now I found her in the back parlor buried in a volume of Byron's high-flown, foolish trash, or that nasty, immoral Bulwer she's so fond of, I don't know which. I asked her ladyship what was the matter, and sat down to have a good, long, confidential chat—but not a word could I get out of her."
                  "Good, long, confidential chat," thought Mrs. St. John, "Heaven forbid;" but she only glanced at Miranda, who was busily weighing cake, and said,
                  "I am very much engaged now, Miss Prudence, but can send Miranda away, if you wish any private conversation with me."
                  "Oh! no. I want no private conversation. Miranda's no fool, if she is a negro. And as for that matter, any body can see how things are going on. Well, in my time young ladies were brought up differently. They didn't consume their time dawdling over novels, or hanging over the piano pretending to practise, and flirting with harum-scarum fellows not worth the shot 'twould take to shoot 'em.
                  "If you are not in favor of a match with that rowdy Cameron Haughton, it's time you were looking after your eldest daughter. She's old enough to know better; but she's no more discretion than I had at ten years old. Why, I might have been married forty times, if I had chosen to take up with the like of that."
                  "Ida, Miss Prudence, has quite discretion enough to quiet a mother's fears on the score of her conduct; and as for Mr. Haughton," and there was a repressed warmth in her tone, "so far from being a rowdy, he is a young man whose manners and appearance would render him distinguished in any assemblage."
                  "Distinguished for what? gambling and horse-racing? I believe those are his principal accomplishments. Well, that's just like you. You always justify your children, no matter what they do. You'll see what it will come to at last. If I had had the raising of my cousin John St. John's children;—well, I'll say no more about that! but Ida, nobody to advise her. What a fate hers will be!"
                  Even Mrs. St. John's patience was threadbare. Miranda gave a torrent of blows to the cake-batter in her indignation which, no doubt, materially enhanced its lightness, and, on pretence of asking for further directions, whispered,—
                  "Mistress, how can you stand and let that 'oman aggravate you so? Why don't you tell her to mind her own business, it's no affair o' hers."
                  Mrs. St. John took up her key-basket as if to leave the room, and said with calm dignity—
                  "I would be very much indebted to you, Miss Prudence, if you would choose some more private opportunity to canvass the affairs of my household, that is, if you deem your interference necessary, which I must say I do not."
                  "Well, upon my word! As good as to tell me to mind my own business. Well, you'll not have occasion to do that twice. I'll rid you of my presence, Madam, this evening, if you'll allow me the carriage. I can find plenty of places, as good as my cousin John St. John's house, where I will not be ordered to hold my tongue."
                  "I am not aware of having given you any such order; but the carriage is at your disposal this evening, if you wish it, of course."
                  Miss Prudence burst into a torrent of virtuous indigna- tion, while Mrs. St. John quietly left the store-room, and two hours afterwards the injured saint was encountered by Mr. St. John in the hall, following Cæsar and Antony, who, bearing between them a huge trunk, with every mark on it of thirty years' long service, were grinning with ill-concealed delight at the new prospect of affairs.
                  "Why, what now, Prudence? You are not going to leave us?"
                  "Yes; I've been as good as turned out of doors by your lady-wife. Well, it will be long before I darken her doors again."
                  "Pshaw! this is nonsense. My wife never ill-treated any one intentionally in her life."
                  "Oh! I can't expect but what you'd take up for her. Well, I've got nothing against you, cousin John, and you'll find I've left a pair of socks as a parting gift on my table for you. The white ones are Noble's, the blue mixed, with white toes, are yours," and the carriage rolled off, bearing away the martyred Prudence.
                  "Here, Dash! Old fellow, you can come in now without being assailed by Miss Spitfire's trumpet tones," said Noble, whistling to his dog. "By what stroke of diplomacy did you get rid of her this time, mother?"
                  No one expressed the slightest surprise at her movements. She was in the habit of making her exits and entrances by jerks and starts, leaving at some fancied offence with the unfailing declaration "never to darken those doors again," and returning again whenever it suited her convenience with the utmost coolness, and making no allusion to the past.
               
               
                  CHAPTER X.
                  MAY had come, and earth wore her robe of green velvet, spangled with myriads of balm-breathing flowers; the stars shone with a deepened light, and the young moon held her court of love, and sent soft messages to young hearts by every passing zephyr.
                  Cameron Haughton was absent in Washington, transacting some business affair connected with his resignation in the army, and for a few weeks at least, the mother was released from his presence.
                  Not one word had passed verbally between Ida and herself. There was a mutual dread of the topic, equally strong, though from different causes, in mother and daughter.
                  Alas! for human weakness; had Mrs. St. John spoken then, how much—but let us not anticipate.
                  She felt pained to see a shadow growing each day deeper on her daughter's brow, but with that pain was mingled the satisfaction of knowing that her note had produced its effect, of which that shadow was the evidence.
                  The D'Allures were established at Paradise Villa, and scarce two days passed without the meeting of some portions of the two families.
                  All was cordiality and good feeling. Ida's love was always a passion in its intensity, that love so fatal in its nature, so easily deceived by its object, undreaming of wrong, and blind to defects. Such love she lavished on her new friend. Kate's feelings were quick and lively in their character; but notwithstanding she had mixed less in society than her sister, she had much shrewd penetration, and by no means took virtues for granted, because they were apparent on the surface or gave people credit for those which existed only in her own imagination.
                  There was a strange difference in the character of the two sisters. Kate was practical; Ida a dreamer. The one, notwithstanding the quickness of her feelings, and the liveliness of her disposition—a well of unclouded joyousness—which sometimes, though rarely, led her into error—looked far into consequences, and suffered her impulses to be under the control of her good sense.
                  No concatenation of circumstances could ever have made Ida a worldly woman. She might have lived among the coldest, most selfish wretches the world can produce, and warped to wrong by the force of circumstances, died a misanthrope, but never a mere woman of the world.
                  As it was, living much in society, and receiving wherever she appeared, the homage ever rendered to such rare gifts as hers, beauty, grace, and talent, she had not escaped the bitter lessons ever accompanying such a career; lessons of the world's deceit, of malice, hatred, and all uncharitableness; but if they gave to her lips at times a curve of scorn, or to her secret heart a pang, they could not mar the child-like simplicity, the pure trust in the existence of the good and true, which so eminently marked her character.
                  True, she was proud, but it was the pride of nature, not of circumstances, a pride which made her shrink instinctively from contact with the unworthy, however high in power and place, but which never denied to the humblest the boon of a kind word.
                  Kate would never have loved a man of Cameron Haughton's reputation. Judging him from "what the world said of him," she would have checked any dangerous impulse which might have led him to trust her happiness to his keeping Not so with Ida. She saw in even his reputed vices, but the excesses of an uncurbed youth, and feelings too gigantic for the control of ordinary circumstances. She knew, for he had often told her, that he had grown from infancy to manhood, and never known the softening influences of a mother or a sister's love, that he had only his father, and he was strangely cold and stern.
                  She yearned to pour out her hoarded treasures of love at the feet of one whom circumstances had strangely combined to isolate from those household ties, those gentle endearing associations so dear to every human being.
                  She longed to teach him that there was one world of which he was the sole master, a beautiful world of generous impulses and bright pure thoughts and joy-diffusing tenderness—the world of a true woman's heart.
                  Such love as this had been the far-off sweet dream of her girlhood, the vision idealized in her heart from her first years of womanhood, now quickened into reality by the presence of a person peculiarly calculated to call forth these feelings.
                  But now Hope's tints were clouded, and Joy could no more paint on the canvas of life fair pictures of the future; Fear seized the palette, a broad gulf rolled between her and the object of her love, a weary waste of toilsome loneliness stretched before them.
                  Her mother's prohibition, could she defy that? Often when her childish fits of waywardness had given momentary pain to her mother, she had stolen away hours afterwards and wept over her sin in secret; every thoughtless word, or angry glance remembered with the bitterest self-reproach.
                  And now when the crisis of her life had come, could she sacrifice her mother's happiness for her own? No, better far to sacrifice her own feelings, than to think of this alternative. But Cameron?—and strong and clamorous rose the mighty voice in her soul—he must not be forgotten.
                  
                  Might not her mother relent? Ah! surely she would, so gentle and forbearing as she was. "We will wait, we will hope," reasoned Ida, "and all will be well at last."
                  I wonder if love is not a sort of sublime selfishness after all.
                  We love an object, we cling to it perchance through disgrace and misery, we sacrifice every consideration of worldly interest for its sake. Why do we this? Because it secures us the possession of that which is more to us than all besides. Even in our blind idolatry, we consult our own happiness, we seek our own gratification.
                  No, where affection is sacrificed to principle, where for years a patient yoke is borne, and its galling traces hid by smiles, lest their betrayal should wound a fellow-being; where the heart's idols are sacrificed to virtue, to truth, to God, these are the true, the great instances of self-immolation, and these?—occur once in a century—on a liberal calculation.
                  I feel a little as if I had been uttering treason in the above, but let it go.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XI.
                  WE left the D'Allures in the very middle of the last chapter. Very uncourteous treatment to such important personages. With their permission we will now return to them.
                  Well, we were speaking of their intimacy with the St. Johns. For Noble,—we have yet to see the effect this new friendship produced upon him, high-spirited, animated and warm-hearted as he was, quick to resent, but full of the confiding trust of an honorable nature.
                  Madame D'Allure seemed—to use a common expression—to select him as her "right-hand man" from the first.
                  "Noble must bring his guitar and play for them in the evenings; she so doted on the guitar." "Noble must read poetry for her; she was so subject to long, tedious headaches, which nothing could beguile, like the sweet lulling sound of rhyme; and Noble read so well, and Auguste could not bear poetry." "Noble must be her cavalier, in her long daily rides." Now there was not the slightest harm in all this, particularly as Noble was on equally good terms with the husband, who, in fact, seemed delighted that his "sweet wife, who, he feared, was often lonely in his absence," had found a friend whom she could put to so many good uses.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XII.
                  THE department of business of that high functionary, the cook at Huntingwild, presented the usual spectacle of a Southern kitchen, a goodly portion of dirt,—confined, however, principally to the floor, and excluded rigorously from the viands—a great confusion of pots and kettles, three or four small, grinning woolly heads ensconced in each corner of the enormous fire-place—though the day was melting—the cook—a fat woman, privileged to scold, up to her elbows in dough, and alternating her conversation between storming at the unfortunate negro boy who officiated as scullion, and gossip with an aged crone, who, with head enveloped in crimson turban and lips puffing a cloud of smoke from the short corn-cob pipe between her lips, was seated to the infinite danger of falling through, on what was once a split-bottomed chair, but was now very nearly destitute of any bottom at all.
                  "Here I've got all the trouble of gittin supper a hour sooner'n common, cause that Delham and Marsden want the moon to ride home by. Wonder what that Delham come here for so much, any way. No worf while him danglin' arter Miss Ida dis way. She never have him in the 'varsal worl. You Sambo! you outdacious scurf o' de earth, ef you don't make haste dar, I'll break your head wid dis biskit roller. You needn't stand grinnin' at me. I'll do it mun, before you know it. A spilt nigger as ever I did see. No, I don't b'lieve Miss Ida have him."
                  "I reckon you'd think so, ef you had seed what I seed yistiddy, a good deal arter this time in the evenin'," said a tall quadroon, who had stepped in from the wash-house, and stood clapping muslins.
                  "What you see, Dick? what you see?" inquired the venerable specimen of antiquity rejoicing in the crimson turban and unique smoking piece, who seemed from her manner and appearance a privileged character.
                  "Why, jest this," and the quadroon lowered her voice confidentially. "Yestiddy evenin', nigh upon ten o'clock, I was comin' from Dinah's room, whar I'd been stayin' to spin some yarn for my old man's socks, goin' home to my children. I passed not far from the bower down on the border of the yard, and sure as you're born I seed Miss Ida come out o' de bower and go to de house, and Mass' Cameron Haughton wid her."
                  "De lor—or—or!"
                  "Den he lef her at de house door, and—but my lor', here's one de children."
                  The cook, angry at the interruption, turned round with an air of dignified authority as little Minnie entered.
                  "What you want?"
                  "A biscuit, Aunt Cleopatra, please."
                  "Clar out, think I gwine give you biskits, for the white folks come say I steal 'em."
                  "Oh, Aunt Cleo, you know mamma never accuses her servants of stealing."
                  "Well, cause she aint never done it's no sign she never will. Clar out, I say, 'fore I send for your ma. Got no business in de kitchen, no how."
                  Minnie retreated, and Egypt's queen rolled up the whites of her eyes, at what she considered a coup de main.
                  
                  "Go on, Dick."
                  Thus adjured, the effeminate Dick proceeded.
                  "Well, as I was sayin', Mass' Cameron pass right by me, and when he seed me dem black eyes o' his'n flashed worser'n lightnin', and he sorter stopped, but I went on like I nebber seed him, I didn't want him git hold o' me, so he kep' on too. Nebber seed sich eyes in a man's head. Clar, one look he can put on is worser'n a whippin' from some folks. God knows I hope Miss Ida never will have him. If she do, I'll be sorry for her."
                  "De folks at de Park say Mass' Cameron very kind," said the cook, turning a hoe-cake.
                  "Never b'lieve it in de worl. No-body aint good wid sich eyes. Mass' Delham's the man, sich a nice, sweet-spoken gemman, always got a bow ready for white and black. Fact is, niggers, Mistis' was'nt dreamin' last night 'bout Miss Idy takin' that moonlight walk. Leastways I don't b'lieve she was, for Randy says Miss' sooner see Miss Idy in her grave than to marry that man. God knows, I don't blame her."
                  
                  "Hi! hi! what is it you say?" interrupted Judith, the turbaned woman, who had been listening with absorbing interest.
                  "I say Mis' rather see Miss Idy in her grave than see her marry Mass' Cameron Haughton."
                  "Does you think there's any danger of that?"
                  "I reckon I does. I b'lieve Miss Idy likes him fustrate, and as I said I don't b'lieve Miss Idy let Miss' know 'bout that moonlight walk. I see Randy carry in tea to Miss' chamber, say she wa'nt well, and Massa I 'spose was at that everlastin' chist game wid old Haughton. Another white bucra I don't like, walk the earth like the ground wasn't fit for him to tread, got not so much as a word to throw away on a nigger. Miss Kate and Mass' Noble gone to spend the evenin' at the Duboles', or whatever their name is, and so Miss Idy thought she'd steal a march on the old folks. Hi! Aunt Judy, whar you goin'? You don't git here so often; you might stay longer when you does come."
                  "No, thankee, my old bones stiff enough now. Must get home 'fore the dews get too heavy," and taking a crutch from the corner she hobbled off.
                  Aunt Judith had formerly been the favorite and confidential servant of Mrs. St. John, had accompanied her from the far South, previous to her present marriage, and had been Ida's nurse. When age and infirmities displaced her from her office in the household, a comfortable cabin was assigned her, where she contented herself with such light employment as picking wool, knitting socks for "the hands," etc.; receiving occasionally friendly visits from her mistress, and inquiries after her rheumatism from the young people.
                  Old Judith entered her cabin with feeble steps, and sunk down in a chair in deep meditation. At length she rose, and proceeding to a small chest in a remote corner of the room, she produced an old, rusty key from some unknown sanctum about her person, and, opening the chest, took from its innermost recesses a carefully wrapped bundle. Opening this she discovered a baby's dress of blue de-laine, tastefully embroidered, as if the work had beguiled the idle hours of some fair lady, and a tiny chemise of the finest linen, on which was traced, in small, delicate characters, "Emily Carlton." She sat with these clothes open before her, musing, as if in doubt, and occasionally uttering disjointed sentences half aloud.
                  "I thought I'd never tell her, but if things take such a turn, maybe I'll be obliged to do it. Well, I'll watch, I'll watch, and inquire how things go on. It's no use to get myself into trouble for nothing. No it isn't, that's a fact."
                  At last, with an ominous shake of the head, she re-folded the bundle and returned it to its hiding place.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XIII.
                  THE sunny, flower-perfumed air, stole softly through the closed blinds of the lofty and spacious drawing-room at the villa, creating a warm-scented and luxurious atmosphere, the effect of which was heightened by the rich hues of the Persian carpet, the soft, voluptuous character of the paintings, principally of the Titian and Rubens' schools, and the large mirrors reflecting this combination of rich tints, in mellowed loveliness. A mimic fountain in the centre of the room, with its sparkling drops, refreshed the eye and ear, which might otherwise have become sated with the feverish sense of luxury.
                  
                  With the light splash of this fountain, mingled the melodious cadences of Noble's voice.
                  Madame D'Allure was reclining on a sofa in the most tasteful morning négligé, a flacon of exquisite perfume in her hand, with which she every now and then showered her delicate jewelled fingers, and bathed her fair brow. She was, doubtless, suffering from "one of those enervating headaches."
                  Noble, on a low ottoman beside her, was reading from Moore's Lalla Rookh.
                  He paused on the lines, 
                        
                           "Thou for my sake at Alla's shrine,
                           And I at any god's for thine,"
                        
                      and looking up, met a smile beaming with fascination.
                  "That is my ideal of love," said the Frenchwoman, softly.
                  Involuntarily, as it seemed, her hand sought the bright curls clustering around the boy's brow, and played caressingly with them.
                  The touch of those soft fingers thrilled through his frame. A delicious, dreamy intoxication seemed to fill the atmosphere around him, but he moved not, fearful of disturbing the little flutterer among his curls.
                  "I have never felt towards any one before as I feel for you, Noble," said the lady, after a pause, "perhaps because I have never had a brother or a favorite cousin. You supply the place of both. You are very dear to me, Noble. I am always happy to have you near me," then seeing the flush which crimsoned the boy's cheek, she, added quickly, "I am very happy, because I feel that my affection is as pure as that of a sister. Oh! it is delicious to feel thus, particularly to me, to whom such feelings are new."
                  At this moment the subdued light from the blinds of the door, leading into the piazza, was darkened by a form without. Noble's back was to the shadow, and Madame affected not to perceive it.
                  M. D'Allure stood without, and looked upon the scene within, which, from the peculiar formation of the blinds, he could do with ease.
                  He saw the handsome youth at his wife's feet, her hand nestling caressingly in his curls, her gaze full of dreamy fascination bent upon him, but he did not frown.
                  "Such a scene," he murmured with a smile full of scornful mockery, "would make an Othello of most husbands, but for me I have no fear. There is no danger; the fool is mine body and soul."
                  Half an hour after, he entered the room, having given due notice of his approach by sundry coughs, and bowing to Noble with his usual graceful ease, said:—
                  "I am glad to find you here, as it saves me the trouble of sending a message to Huntingwild. I expect some friends this evening, and we will have some wine and perhaps cards. Will you remain and join us?"
                  "With pleasure!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER XIV.
                  THE family circle were collected in the cheerful front parlor at Huntingwild. Mrs. St. John as usual was by Willie's couch, occasionally talking in low and tender accents to him.
                  Kate in an embroidered sacque and skirt of snowy cambric, was seated at her mother's feet, sedulously employed in worsted work. Ida (I always like to know how people are dressed) was in a morning dress of fine de-laine, of the most delicate lemon tint, turned over with white silk, fastened around the waist with a massive cord and tassels, and finished with loose gracefully flowing sleeves.
                  She was pale as marble, but perhaps it was the contrast with her dark hair and the hue of her dress.
                  Her long lashes were bent abstractedly over a pile of harp music, which she was sorting preparatory to having bound. Noble was seated near one of the open windows, with quite an air of ennui, listlessly watching the movements of a humming-bird singing its drowsy song in the honey-suckles overhanging the window.
                  There was an addition to the family circle in the person of a fair girl of some eighteen summers.
                  She was an exquisite blonde, with bright red lips, and a pale pinky tinge on each transparent cheek, teeth like pearls, sunny blue eyes, and a profusion of golden brown hair.
                  Her dress was very simple, arranged with exquisite taste, and an air of gentleness and refinement breathed throughout her person.
                  A slight expression of sadness rested on her features (at the moment of which we speak), and her eyes were fixed on Noble with a disappointed yearning gaze, as if she missed something which she had been accustomed to receive from him. Apparently the glance was noticed by Mrs. St. John, for she exclaimed:
                  "I declare, Noble, you are making yourself very interesting this morning. If you don't feel in a talking mood, do read aloud to us."
                  "I did not suppose young ladies absorbed in the delightful intricacies of worsted work, would have eyes or ears for any thing else," replied her son, with a slight curl of the lip, adding petulantly, with a glance at Kate and her companion, "I cannot imagine how you can chain your minds, day after day, to such a frivolous pursuit, to say nothing of spoiling your eyes. Madame D'Allure says she detests what is generally termed 'fancy work.'"
                  "I declare, Bud, you are really silly about Madame D'Allure," retorted Kate, "she seems to be your model of perfection."
                  "Yes," he replied, suddenly roused into animation, "I never see her without thinking of Pinckney's toast, 
                        
                           "'Her health! and would on earth there stood
                           Some more of such a frame,
                           That life might be all poetry,
                           And weariness a name.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  Fannie Bonford's cheek flushed, and she twitched her work nervously in her fair fingers, revealing, as she did so, the single ring of plain gold, ornamenting the third finger of her left hand.
                  "But Noble," said Mrs. St. John hastily, and as if to change the subject, "you have not said whether you would read to us. Here are Harper's and Graham's, both new, and both unread. Come see now if you can find something interesting."
                  "What a misfortune it is to be a good reader," responded Noble with mock pathos, lazily cutting the leaves of "Graham," and glancing at different articles. "Ah! here is something from this new débutante in the literary world, Cara Bird, a leaf from her own experience, I'll venture. Ida, I have often fancied from your rhyme-scribbling propensities that you might be bitten by the author-mania yet, so I'll read it for your especial benefit." And he commenced
                  
                     
                     THE COUP D'ESSAI.
                     BY CARA BIRD, AUTHOR OF —— ——.
                     The redoubtable little township of T——, the most important place, notwithstanding its vicinity to the metropolis, in a hundred miles round (in the opinion of its inhabitants), was in a state of complete ferment.
                     Two parties, the Lee and Allston factions, divided the hearts and homes of the people, and if no swords were drawn, no blood shed, that unruly member of the human organization, the tongue, was busy in a warfare which does infinitely more mischief.
                     But ere we go further, let us say something of the innocent cause of the tumult.
                     Lettie Lee was not beautiful, though various men told her so, and various women cast murderous glances at her as she swept by. Lettie's mirror told a different tale, and she was simple-hearted enough to believe it.
                     Do not fire up, dear reader, if you are a woman, at the assertion with regard to the murderous glances.
                     It may not apply in any sense to you, for, thank God, there are women too high-minded, too pure, for the extremely small vices of malice and detraction; but that there were those of her own sex, who could stoop even so low as this, Lettie had been made to feel most keenly. Unfortunate for her that it was so, for her heart was filled to overflowing with affection, and required love and praise for its daily nurture as much as food or drink. Many a tear did she shed in secret over coldness which she could not account for, unkindness she had done nothing to provoke. Our readers may think such a proceeding showed a great want of proper spirit on the young lady's part: but whoever looked on Lettie Lee saw that saddest sight of earth,—a woman with all the fair, frail helplessness of her sex, young, and an orphan.
                     Those who are fenced in by the bulwarks of parental love, who can turn to the quiet nest of home joys, and find in the dear ones there, their heartfill of care and tenderness, may pass unheeding by a cold look or harsh word from one of the many; but when did the young heart, thrown upon the sympathies of the outer world, looking for kindness and soul-nurture to that principle of love, which should pervade as one great beating heart, the common mass of humanity, when did such ever meet a cold glance or cutting tone, nor turn away with a mournful vibration of that chord of sorrow which is ever sounding to the desolate, the bitter burden of "alone!"
                     Not that it was strange that Lettie should have met with such things. How many of us have felt the sharp wounds of those instruments of torture, the crafty and malicious use to grind the hearts of their fellow-beings, with no better motive than to humble a lofty spirit, to crush to their own level an aspiring soul; oftentimes, too, borrowing the cloak of God's religion to give a sanction to their frown, or a keener sting to their censure.
                     Out upon such men and women! with their faces of brass and hearts of iron, profaning the name of the Divine, by mingling it with hollow cant and hypocritical falsehoods! moral vampires, sucking the life from noble hearts, to glut their hellish thirst for evil!
                     Whatever may have been Lettie's feelings, she did not betray them to the public gaze; none ever bore a haughtier head, or wore a more careless smile. As may be surmised from the commencement of our story, she was not without her partisans; and between the indiscriminate praise of one party and—just in proportion—the indiscriminate censure of the other, she was in a fair way to become thoroughly spoiled.
                     Fortunate was it for her that she had an inner world, made up of the beautiful ideal; a world filled with lofty aspirations, and glowing dreams, which, while it made her restless and dissatisfied in the every day circumstances around her, and regardless of triumphs which might have satisfied a petty ambition, awakened yearnings after a different sphere of action, which called into service the latent energies of her nature.
                     "My Lettie, do you know that you are a genius?" said a voice at her side, as she stood with flushed cheek, and kindling eye, drinking into her inmost soul the glory and magnificence of a mountain sunset. She turned and gazed up into the face bending over her, at the pale features, so fixed in their proud, mournful outline, that they might have seemed the death lineaments of one who had died of a broken heart, but for the eyes, those dark, burning, ever restless eyes, so sadly, strangely beautiful.
                     The long lashes of the girl drooped, as after a moment's pause she answered—
                     "I know not, Frederick. I know that I shut deep in my hushed heart, thoughts and aspirations which those around me neither feel or comprehend. But, oh! Frederick, I have never dared to hope that I was a genius."
                     "Fear not, Lettie; within that frail casket," and he glanced at her slight, girlish form, "the gem is enshrined. Already the Angel of Destiny points you to the path you are to tread. It is a lone, wild path, Lettie; may God protect and guard you in it. Even to man, with his strong moral and physical power, his advantages of circumstance and position, genius, though a proud, is often a dangerous gift. What must it be, then, to woman,—with her fathomless feelings, her deathless impulses of love, and clinging reliance on the truth, faith, and good feeling of those around her. You must encounter opposition, falsehood, misconstruction, which will crush you to the earth; yet, fainting and weary, you must not pause in the path before you. Your mind will 'grow with what it feeds on,' and the rich soil of your heart, cultivated by thought, and invigorated by action, must bring forth feelings new, wild, and beautiful, like the rich growing productions of a tropic land. Yet, you will be doomed to see these droop and wither in the chilling atmosphere around you; and worse than all, when in some hour of lonely wretchedness, you are thirsting, even unto death, for one kind word, the harsh judgment of the narrow-hearted and ignorant will ring in your ear, 'Such women are made to wonder at, not to love.' 'My beautiful,'" and he smoothed the dark hair from her brow, and gazed earnestly into the face which, to his partial eyes, seemed so fair, "'will not your spirit sink, your heart faint beneath the trials which will beset you?'"
                     "I hope not, Frederick," replied the girl, adding timidly, "I have no career as yet, save in my dreams, and perhaps it were better never to commence one."
                     "Nay, dearest, God has appointed to every one his part in the drama of life, and you must not shrink from yours."
                     He turned away with a sigh, and seating himself at the piano, commenced to improvise strain after strain, so wildly sweet, so pregnant with mournful feeling, that they thrilled the very heartstrings of his listener, like the voice of a prophetic angel.
                     Frederick Falkland, like Lettie Lee, was an orphan. His boundless wealth had not sufficed to make him happy. Difficulties with those appointed to fill the place of parents, strengthened and embittered by the morbid sensitiveness of a poetical temperament, had early disappointed his hopes of happiness, and plunged him into excesses which left him at twenty-five with a shattered constitution, the victim of that most insidious of maladies, a disease of the heart. With a splendid genius for music cultivated to the highest extent, he had found in this pursuit almost the only rational enjoyment of his life. But this resource, appealing as it does to all the softer emotions of the soul, while it soothed his lonely and wasted feelings, increased the refined sensibility of his nature, and strengthened the passionate cravings after the spirit-communion and human sympathy he had never found.
                     True, manœuvring mothers courted him, and fashionable daughters frowned upon non-eligibles and smiled graciously upon him, but he turned from them with the loathing a proud, high spirit feels for the hollow and false. Experience had taught him that he was not the person to be really popular with the crowd. The search for health drew him to the balmy breezes of Lettie Lee's native mountains.
                     I cannot tell the talisman which drew him to her, but to him she seemed the ideal of all he had ever dreamed or sighed for, embodied in woman's form.
                     He bowed before her with that utter passionate abandon, which forgets self, and all things beside, in the one master-emotion. Every thought, hope, feeling, pent up for years within his lonely heart, he gave as offerings to the idol-shrine. And she felt deeply how unworthy she was of the adoration he lavished on her. She knew at the time he met her, that death's invisible mantle of terror was already wrapped about him; that soon the restless spirit must cease its struggles, and the form of Frederick Falkland be no longer a thing of earth; consequently, she could not feel for him the sentiment ordinarily termed love.
                     Her affection for him—and she had much—was made up of the holy sympathy which belongs to woman, and the gratitude she felt for his love. She sacrificed time, thought, feeling, to his happiness, and if it would have availed she would have yielded her life for his.
                     They were betrothed. They had been taking one of those long, woodland rambles, which both loved, and which almost brought the flush of health to Frederick's pale cheek, when he implored her to become his own, to link her spirit to his, though hers might be doomed a denizen of earth, years after his had wandered to the far shores of the brighter land. They had paused in a wild, deep glen, so lone and still that not even the chance note of a bird, or the voice of the water-fall, broke the silence; the twilight fell in weird, mysterious shadows around them, and Lettie shuddered as she thought it was a fitting hour and scene for a betrothal to the grave. But the fond clasp of the hand yet thrilling with life, and the warm kiss of her lover on her brow, chased the shadow from her spirit.
                     "I have a task for you to perform, Lettie," said Frederick, one day. "'Tis to write the libretto to an opera I am composing."
                     "Do you think I can, Frederick?"
                     "I know it, and when your knowledge of dramatic detail is insufficient, I will assist you."
                     The task was commenced. Every day, new forms, new lines, new combinations, sprung to life in the girl's mind.
                     Far into the night, with throbbing heart and burning brain, she worked. The ever-moving power of genius, the desire for human sympathy, the desire to create forms of beauty and gladness, to make the multitude the sharers in the glory and delight of its own inspiration, the belief that many a lip burning for knowledge might drink of her own heart-fount and be cooled, that many a heart might throb in unison with the feelings she wrought, or the hopes she portrayed,—this great moving power seized upon her, and she heeded not the toil, nor the pain it sometimes brought, in the fulfilment of her purpose.
                     She wrote to the inspiration of his music. It was a happy thought that she was to give voice and words to those strains, that the many as well as the few, might comprehend and worship their power, passion, and beauty.
                     Frederick smiled sadly at her enthusiasm.
                     "Do not place your hopes too fondly on this work," he said; "the multitude may not see as you see, or feel as you feel. The very passages upon which you have bestowed most thought, which have most kindled your hopes of critical approbation, may be the very ones they will most harshly condemn, even though they know in doing so they tear your heartstrings. Believe me, the task of the poet is too often a thankless one."
                     The opera was completed, and presented to the manager of the opera house in New York. Perhaps because a demand for an American opera happened to be the fashionable whim of the hour, it was at once accepted, new scenery and the best artists engaged for its appearance.
                     The tale was founded on a circumstance in the history of the Louisiana Creoles, which she had often thought of as replete with dramatic interest. There were scenes and characters she would have preferred to dispense with, but they were necessary to the development of the plot, and were introduced accordingly.
                     As the thrilling story of human love, and human suffering closed, and the last low dirge-like strain, died upon the hearts of the listeners, a burst of applause shook the house to its foundations.
                     And now we come to the period to which we alluded in the opening of this somewhat incoherent narrative.
                     When the news of the successful début of Lettie's play reached the ears of the good people of T——, the whole town was in a state of excitement. Men met at street corners to discuss the engrossing topic, and as for the women, they were frantic.
                     Mrs. L——, the baker's wife, donned her best bonnet and shawl and hastened to Mrs. Dobbins (wife of Dobbins of the dry goods and grocery business, corner of Random Row and Venegar Hill) to tell "the news," assured that such a precious morceau would procure her a favorable reception in that fashionable and aristocratic mansion.
                     Mrs. Squire Jones—far-famed for her neatness—jerked open every bureau drawer in the house, and scattered their contents in wild confusion around, in her frantic search for sundry articles of apparel, to the open-mouthed wonder of six molasses-smeared children, and to the infinite detriment of the finery in question from the digits of the aforesaid representatives of the illustrious family. Unheeding the united caterwauling of these tender pledges of Jones' love, she incontinently locked them up in the sole charge of Patsey,—a little negro corresponding to the description of Topsey in "Uncle Tom," and rushed over in a paroxysm of nervous agitation "to see Lawyer Smith's wife, and talk it over."
                     But the crisis of the furore had not yet arrived.
                     Mrs. Allston, one of the village aristocracy, collected a "select party" of friends to take a dish of tea and——scandal.
                     We say one of the village aristocracy, for such she claimed to be, her pretensions thereto being founded on a few hundred barren acres, which for a century back had been in the possession of ancestors, whose range of information, as far as the men were concerned, was confined to the rise and fall of the tobacco and corn market, that of the women to the retailing of every tale of scandal that could be collected in ten miles round.
                     Mrs. Allston flattered herself also, that her literary pretensions were of the highest order; she having read through Bunyan's Pilgrim Progress, devoured annually for thirty years back the Christian's Almanac, and been actually known at one period of her life to indite a "Sonnet to a Nosegay in a Gentleman's Button-hole," which, by dint of repeated bribes, she had induced the editors of the village papers to publish, to the everlasting glory and edification of her illustrious house.
                     On the afternoon in question, when the company assembled in Mrs. Allston's best parlor, which had been duly soaped, sanded, and dressed with evergreens, the preceding morning for the important occasion—various copies of Lettie Lee's production might have been seen scattered around, and newspapers were handed about for inspection, abounding in such sentences as, "The New American Opera," "Great Sensation in the Fashionable World," "The Beautiful and Talented Miss Lee,"&c.,&c.
                     Now an unsophisticated person might have imagined that the good people of T—— would have felt more or less gratified by these trophies won by one in their midst, and doubtless many such might have been found within the precincts, but this evening we are to encounter the opposition party.
                     "The beautiful and talented Miss Lee, forsooth!" cried Mrs. Allston in a torrent of virtuous indignation. "I do believe the whole American Press is deranged on the subject of pretty women—though as for that matter the description does not apply to Lettie Lee. She has not a particle of beauty that ever I could see."
                     "I suppose you've all read the play," said Miss Higgins, a sister of Mrs. Allston, a young lady verging on fifty-five, who looked as if her face might have been made of a composition of dried leaves, soaked in vinegar.
                     "I have, and think it a very beautiful production," said a very pretty, intelligent looking girl, with soft dark gray eyes, and wavy blacksatinish hair.
                     Glances of horrified wonder were exchanged, suppressed exclamations of "Did you ever?" "Well, I never!" passed through the room.
                     "I have read it," said Miss Higgins, drawing herself up with the dignity of an insulted grimalkin; "but shall certainly never give my countenance to any such production."
                     "I am sorry to hear you say so," said the young lady we have before alluded to, with an arch twinkle of merry sarcasm in her eye, "as I have no doubt it will injure the play seriously. I hope the rumor will not reach New York. It might cause its expulsion from the boards."
                     An irrepressible smile broke from even those ill-naturedly disposed, at the absurdity of the supposition.
                     It was but for a moment, however, and spite resumed his reign in the faces of the majority of the company—spite the more virulent that it was unable to compass its end.
                     "I consider some portions of the play highly immoral, and I am sure if I had grown daughters, not one should ever attend the representation of it," said Mrs. Brown, Black, Blue, or some such name, the mother of an interesting family, who might have answered to the description a celebrated French physiognomist gave an anxious mother. "I cannot tell vot dey will be, for dey have no more expression dan von leetle—vot you call him—pig."
                     
                     "My husband," said a fine, singularly intellectual looking woman, "considers it remarkable for the first production of a young writer."
                     There was a look of blank dismay at this new evidence of enemies in the camp. Certainly there was no higher appeal for judgment or talent in the community than the one the lady had called upon—but bridling her head and smoothing her stiff, gray silk gown, starched and ironed into a most exemplary spirit of combativeness—Mrs. Allston again rushed to the attack, nothing daunted.
                     "Yes, that is just what I say. It is a remarkable production for so young a mind. Look at the profligacy of character portrayed in that play. Now I want to know how Lettie Lee could know any thing about such scenes or characters?"
                     "People of talent comprehend at a glance what an ordinary person would scarce learn in a life-time," was the matter of fact reply.
                     We will not narrate at length the warfare of tongues of which Mrs. Allston's parlor was the scene, until eleven o'clock warned matrons and maids that it was time to seek their respective homes.
                     Frederick Falkland, a morning or two after this, found Lettie in tears. Some officious friend had poured into her ear the stings of malice, by which she had been assailed.
                     "It is not possible," he said, "that you are thus affected by such trifles. My poor little sensitive one, of what avail is your shield of pride if it shelters you no more than this? You must be the target for a thousand arrows like these. Besides, you must attribute as much to ignorance as to malice. It is impossible for the many to comprehend the mighty intuition of genius, its power to grasp, in an instant, knowledge they would scarce acquire in a lifetime; to read human nature, and give voice, body, and hue to every feeling, thought, and action of man's intricate and wondrous life. Moreover, the remarks which have so affected you, come from a set of people whose opinions can never affect your position, as a woman or an author."
                     "I know that," replied the girl, through her tears; "but one suffers from a sting, though it is inflicted by an insect."
                     I met Lettie years afterward in a foreign land, as the guest of the Italian Princess D——, that most charming and cultivated of women, who delights to call around her a society of artists and authors, and who, therefore, may be said to move always in an atmosphere redolent of the fragrance and power of genius. There was a shadow on Lettie's brow; the same shadow which, in the wildwood glen, falls on the grave of Frederick Falkland. It was not a dark shadow, but the quiet hue of a gentle grief which elevated and spiritualized her thoughts and life.
                     I asked if she had forgotten her early home, and alluded playfully to the trifling annoyances which seemed so terrible in the outset of her career.
                     "They were not trifling," she said, gravely. "There is no ill-treatment which wounds us like that which falls upon us in the shadow of the home altar, the place around which our first, most cherished recollections cluster, of which years of absence only serve to strengthen and sanctify the memory—the place which, of all others, we would remember without resentment."
                     "But when the noblest and best were with you, you should not have heeded the carping few."
                     She fixed her full clear eyes upon me with mournful earnestness, as she answered:
                     "When did an orphan hear without heeding, an unkind word?"
                     
                     They had no time for comment on the story, for as Noble ceased, the sound of rapid carriage-wheels was heard on the gravel without.
                     Noble was at the front door in an instant.
                     "No time to alight," said the soft tones of Madame D' Allure. "I merely drove over to say that I dine in town to-day with Mrs. S——, and she begs, as we have a spare seat, that I will prevail on one of you to take it. Mrs. St. John, I know, will not go. Ida, Kate—you have the refusal between you."
                     The young ladies declined on some plea or other.
                     "Then, Noble, suppose you go," suggested D'Allure, carelessly.
                     Noble's eyes sparkled as he stood leaning on the door of the low pony phaeton, making the most solicitous inquiries after the health of its fair inmate. He answered, however, irresolutely:
                     "I don't think I can, very well. We have been planning a long ride this afternoon."
                     "Oh! put off that; you had better go."
                     "I would with pleasure, but——" he paused.
                     Fanny Bonford looked at him eagerly, as if on his decision there rested a confirmation of some unspoken fear.
                     "You will go?" whispered Madame, with one of her syren glances.
                     The look decided him, and he murmured a hurried assent.
                     "All settled, then, and we'll call for you," said D'Allure, slightly touching up the spirited brown ponies.
                     "By the way, how do you like my bob-tails?"
                     "My dear Auguste, don't stay talking of your horses. Remember we have to start in two hours, and I have my dinner toilette to make in the interval. So drive fast. Au revoir."
                     And, with a charming smile, and repeated kisses of the fairy hand, Madame was out of sight in an instant.
                     On pretence that it was time to dress, but in reality to escape any remonstrance, Noble hastened to his room.
                     Fannie Bonford felt as if cold steel had entered her heart.
                     The ride they had been planning that afternoon, was to one of the most charming spots in the neighborhood, a spot, too, connected in the mind of Fannie with very tender reminiscences, and she hoped in that of Noble, also; but now he had carelessly broken the engagement, almost at the sacrifice of common politeness, treating as a matter of no moment that which a short period before he would have welcomed with so much pleasure. To one inured to sterner trials, it might have seemed a trifle, but it was a keen ordeal to a young, untried heart, throbbing with the overflowing fulness of a first affection.
                     Mrs. St. John looked pained, also.
                     "I am sorry Noble accepted the invitation," was her comment. "Mr. S—— is rather a favorite of Mr. St. John; but I have heard it said that his private habits are objectionable. I cannot blame Madame D'Allure for her intimacy with his wife, for she is a sweet, amiable little person, but I dislike very much that Noble should be drawn into association with Mr. S. I wish I could induce my husband to think as I do about it; but he has so much generosity, that he will never believe any one unworthy, until he cannot shut his eyes to the fact."
                  
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XV.
                  M. D'ALLURE was in closet consultation with Madame.
                  "You need not fear," said the lady, after a pause of some length, during which she had apparently been revolving something in her mind. "You need not fear. I have never yet striven to gain an influence over any one and been baffled,—and now with this boy—"
                  "You have done very little, as yet, with 'this boy,' as you call him," interrupted her husband with a slight sneer, "whatever your magnetic powers may have achieved in other cases. A paltry five hundred is all I have been able to extort from him, with all your arts and contrivances. Even this sum is merely registered in my brain, though as for that matter it is safe enough there, notwithstanding my assurances to him that a little money lost among friends should not be thought of as a debt."
                  "Five hundred!" echoed the wife, "surely, Auguste, for the length of time you have been playing this game, that ought to satisfy you."
                  "I play for a bold stake, and must win it. I expected, ere this, he would have been thousands deep; but I've been obliged to lead him on by degrees, to blind him, as it were, to the transgression, before I can induce him to plunge into it. He has been raised a milksop, and acts as if he had only yesterday stopped saying his prayers at his mother's knee. There's Cameron Haughton now, quite another sort of fellow. Could we entrap him, he would—in this odious American slang—'go it with a rush.' I might safely count upon half the acres of the old Park. You might manage him, I think. He has seen enough of the world to suspect me instantly, were I to attempt it, but he has a soft spot in his heart for women."
                  "I can do nothing with him. Remember he is a lover of Ida Walton, and consequently being a good deal with her brother, were I to attempt a double game, an éclaircissement would be almost inevitable."
                  "Diable! c'est vrai. With all his recklessness, he pretends to abhor gaming,—mais nous verrons that may be for effect; but if true, 'tis for that very reason, separate from any desire of gain, I should like to draw him into the vortex. It is singular,—and yet I share the feeling with many, though few trust it from the screen of their own breasts—do you know," and he took both his wife's hands in his own and pressed them tightly—not tenderly—"there is nothing I like so much as to overcome a man's most boasted virtue, to teach a saint how little his vaunted sanctity avails against temptation. Yes, I watch such men or women in their downward path, with an exultation impossible to describe. Comprenezvous?"
                  The woman made no reply in words, but the expression which flitted over her face made her resemble a beautiful fiend striving to seduce an angel from virtue.
                  "But," continued her husband, "to return to Noble St. John. The pigeon is not half plucked. I must count his losses by thousands instead of hundreds. His father is able to lose it, and if I can manage to lure the son on until he fears to own the extent of his losses, I have him safe enough. So see that you make yourself as winning, attractive, and beautiful as possible, chère mignonne. Make the villa a paradise to the boy, and when you have mesmerized his senses, I can—well, you know the rest; 'twould be vulgar to say—pick his pocket."
                  He rose to go, and was about to leave his wife with a courteous bow, but her yearning gaze arrested him. He held out his hand, as if on second thought, and inclined his head to kiss her.
                  The embrace was returned with an eager, clinging tenderness, which proved it was rarely bestowed, and it was with a deep sigh, and a gaze which—intense and earnest as it was—was a strange mixture of contending emotions, that Victorine watched his graceful figure as it retreated from the room.
                  As the echo of her husband's footsteps died on her ear, she folded her arms, and paced thoughtfully to and fro. Strange and varying emotions flitted rapidly over her features—at times a gleam of exultation, followed by a look mournful as despair itself, and this in turn subsiding into an expression of crafty calculation and sinister thought, extremely disfiguring to the countenance of a woman.
                  She had paced the room thus in earnest communion with herself for perhaps a half hour, when a passing glance at the window revealed the form of Ida Walton riding up the avenue, attended only by a groom. Madame paused a moment, thinking she had seldom seen a more beautiful picture than the young girl presented, her cheeks and lips flushed, her eyes bright with excitement, her rich, dark curls blowing back and mingling with the sable plumes of the jaunty little hat set bewitchingly on one side of her head.
                  Hastily smoothing from her features all traces of recent care, and assuming her blandest expression of welcome, she ran with a great appearance of eagerness into the piazza, to meet her friend, and receive her greeting kiss.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XVI.
                  FAR away from the New World, amid the viny fields, and beneath the blue skies of La belle France, grew a fair young girl.
                  Brought up in an old retired chateau, in a remote province, with a careless spendthrift father, who gambled away his winters in Paris, and took little heed of his children, motherless and under the surveillance of a cross old maiden aunt, the demoiselles De Gaspeau grew up to womanhood. Their amusements consisted of an occasional jaunt to the nearest village, in the great rumbling old family coach, which had borne their ancestors half a century previous, (when they were carefully warned by their immaculate aunt not to smile on the handsome clerks from whom they obtained their little supplies of ribbons and laces, "for such bourgeois were beneath the notice of ladies of the noble house De Gaspeau,") varied by a weekly sermon from the stupid red-faced fat curé, of the principal church, which nearly consumed them with yawns, though the lady Violante seemed to find him vastly interesting, and went at least twice as often to confession as any one in the neighborhood.
                  Perhaps the demoiselles Gaspeau would not have objected to the "extreme unction" from which their aunt seemed to derive so much consolation, but certes, it was not to Father Bribeaud they would have applied for it.
                  Perhaps their greatest enjoyment was to wander out in the soft evening air, when the last sunbeam slept in dreamy quietude on the hills, and the shadows fell gently on wild wood and lea, singing in the overflow of that joyousness which is the blessed gift of youth, welling up from the full heart without knowing why.
                  Then they wove bright flowers in their dark hair, and pressed between their fair hands the bursting grapes, till their purple juices stained their slender fingers.
                  Of all the five sisters, Victorine was the fairest.
                  She was just at that sweet dreamy age, when the heart is full of vague fantasies, and that delusive, tantalizing, bewitching boy-god, whispers tales of a paradise, which, alas! lack the crowning gift of heaven, truth!
                  In other words, she was seventeen.
                  "From her English mother she inherited her profusion of blonde hair, just tinged with the darker shades of her sister's, and her soft, clear complexion, while her eyes had caught the violet shadows of the twilight of her own land.
                  Very lovely was Victorine in her pristine innocence, full of quick, warm impulses, glorious, if trained aright, but oh! how dangerous if warped to wrong.
                  It was at this critical period of her life, when spring was abroad on the earth, quickening the great pulse of Nature with a fuller, deeper throb, that her father returned from the capital, bringing with him a young friend, who desired to spend this delightful season at the chateau.
                  There was much pulling of caps among these unsophisticated damsels, for the heart of the handsome distingué stranger.
                  Is it not strange, how many vain efforts we often make, to obtain that which in after years we thank God was with-held from us?
                  It was reserved for Victorine to win the prize, not the heart,—perhaps that was an element wanting in his composition,—but the hand of the Chevalier D'Allure.
                  It was strange that the needy adventurer should have chosen this penniless girl, but perhaps he had encountered some very stout obstacles in his pursuit of heiresses, and furthermore read in her pliable disposition and the full treasure of love she lavished upon him, a nature he could mould to his every purpose.
                  Perhaps, too, it was, after all, not very unpleasant to his blasé heart, to be adored by such a sweet fresh young creature.
                  Years afterwards we meet Victorine. Well has the magician wielded his power.
                  She is now the accomplished woman of the world, the deliberate accomplice of her husband in his hellish profession, with naught left of her stainless youth, save beauty and love for her Evil Genius.
                  True, there were occasional fits of repentance, but like meteors flitting over dark waters, they shone but a moment, and relapsed into nothingness.
                  "Is it not strange," some may ask, "that she could so blindly worship one she knew to be so depraved?" But this inquiry will come from none who comprehends the nature of women.
                  How many of the purest of her sex have exemplified, in their own lives, the truth of the sentiment the poet fitly puts in the mouth of a woman, 
                        
                           "I know not, I ask not what guilt's in that heart,
                           I but know that I love thee, whatever thou art."
                        
                      Nothing delighted D'Allure more, than to tamper with the power he knew was secure. Nothing delighted him more than to open the dark chasms of his nature, and permit her to gaze upon them, through the rosy veil of love, seeing things which to others were hideous, clothed in forms and hues of beauty.
                  
                  He delighted even at times, throwing aside all disguise, to reveal himself the calculating, remorseless villain he really was, without a shade of tenderness to soften the picture, and then, when revolted she started back and would have recalled her better senses from their mesmeric sleep, to bend over, to whisper low music-words, to melt serpent glances into her inmost heart, to fold his arms around her, and call her "sweet wife!" until she would have yielded heaven itself, rather than the delicious draught for which her soul so thirsted.
                  Verily, she had a good teacher in the art of fascination.
                  Oh Love! blessed boon of Paradise, whether seen in the mother's gentle glances, heard in the manly, earnest tones of the father,—whether thou comest in the guise of sister, brother, friend, ever thou bringest healing on thy wings, gladness in thy spirit.
                  But alas! how art thou wronged, bright child of heaven! How often is thy holiness profaned, thy power subverted to life's baser purposes! Better to worship idols of stone, than unworthy human beings, for they cannot lure to evil, though they answer not our adoration.
                  D'Allure might have influenced his wife to good—he might have made her a pure and lovely woman, he made her instead something not very remotely connected with a fiend.
                  Not on this earth, oh man! shall thy punishment be awarded.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XVII.
                  IDA was pacing slowly to and fro the piazza on the night alluded to by the quadroon, dreaming such visions as the moon is apt to conjure up in a maiden's brain, particularly when that maiden is in love.
                  As the quadroon had said, Noble and Kate were absent, mamma was indisposed in her own chamber, and Mr. St. John absorbed in chess. Far into the future roved Ida's thoughts; visions of her mother's displeasure casting dark shadows over every fairy picture of Hope.
                  It was but that day she had sought her, unable longer to preserve silence, and implored her not to judge him too harshly; 'he was not evil-natured, only wild, only reckless; she was sure he would guard her happiness, were she his, as his own life.
                  'He was but sowing his wild oats now. That season would soon pass and with it his boyish follies.'
                  Cold and impenetrable as marble she had found the mother, ordinarily so lenient to every fault, and when she did give vent to feeling, it was but to cling to her daughter, commanding, entreating, with an hysterical violence strange indeed in one usually so calm, that she would never think of Cameron again.
                  As Ida retraced that scene, her mother's agitation, her commands softened into prayers, her refusal to listen to aught which she could urge in her own behalf, a perplexed feeling, a half formed idea that there existed in this determined opposition some mystery she was not permitted to fathom, took possession of her mind. It was but for an instant however, and it was displaced by the remembrance of that mother's jealous unceasing care for her happiness, and her dread of what, to her, seemed a most imprudent alliance.
                  One thing Ida remembered, and it pressed on her soul with the weight of iron; her mother had extorted a promise that she would cease all intercourse save that of friends with her lover. There was a mental reservation for the future certainly,—but for the present the promise was imperative. She had sunk down on a latticed seat, her head bent on her hand, absorbed in such thoughts as these, when a step sounded on the gravel walk, a step she knew too well, and the next moment a low voice thrilled on her ear.
                  "My lady-bird seems sad this evening," was her lover's salutation.
                  She raised her head, and suffered her hand to linger in his warm grasp for a moment. It was very difficult to withdraw it, yet she did so, and said, "I am glad you have come, for I've something to tell you, and yet," she added, "I almost fear to do so. Noble and Kate will return probably, and interrupt us."
                  "Come, then, let us secure ourselves from such a possibility. Let us go to the bower—it is a sweeter trysting spot than this."
                  She walked silently by his side to the little vine-clad enclosure, where, through the balmy rose-leaves, fell the moon-beams, playing at hide and seek with the shadows on the trellised seats.
                  He drew her to a seat. "And now what is it you have to tell me?"
                  "Wait, I will tell you presently." She could not trust herself just then. Cameron did not press it, and both were silent. He drew nearer with a sort of reverent tenderness, passed his arm timidly around her waist, and, for the first time, his lip touched her cheek. Long they sat thus dreaming, happier in that mute caress, that voiceless utterance, than in the most passionate demonstrations of attachment.
                  This is the beautiful life of love; this it is which renders it immortal, that it should be ideal rather than expressed; that there should be nothing gross or familiar about it; ever modest, ever reserved; never pouring out its full and priceless treasures, but still keeping sealed fountains to be thirsted for.
                  Very loth was Ida to break the sweet spell which had fallen upon herself and her lover, and a mighty effort of moral courage it required, when, withdrawing herself gently from the clasping arm, she said sadly—
                  "We must cease our dreaming, Cameron, and awake to the realities of our position. My mother—"
                  "What of your mother, Ida!"
                  "She is afraid to trust my happiness to you—she looks upon you with the eyes of the world, not with those of justice."
                  "And you; you do not share her feelings?"
                  "How can you ask me the question? I have told you that I loved you. You know me too well to think I could speak such words lightly, but loving you as I do—clinging to the thought of being ever near you, as the only one which offers happiness, I cannot wound my mother by continuing this engagement in the face of her entreaties, her prayers to the contrary."
                  Cameron's brow darkened—and his lip was ashy, as he exclaimed—
                  "By heaven! I will go to Mrs. St. John. I will demand from her own lips the crime that renders me unworthy a woman's love. I will question her right to ruin our happiness, to gratify her own prejudices—baseless prejudices as they are."
                  "Will you not be calm? You do not know a mother's love, Cameron. When I would disobey her, I remember the face that bent over me in infancy, calling me blessed names—I remember that from her being I drained the life which supported mine; the pressure of my head upon her bosom, and the soft lullaby of my childhood, come back to me. I remember, too, the bitter tears she has shed for my faults or my sufferings; the ever watchful care, the unceasing prayers for my happiness. Oh, Cameron! holier than all holy things of earth beside, is the name of 'mother.' I cannot wrong her—I cannot trample upon her feelings, for with them I should crush all the dearest, best feelings of my own nature, all the belief in the pure, the good, the immortal, which I have derived from her teachings."
                  Cameron listened in silence to her low, fervent tones, and his voice faltered as he bent his head on his hand, and answered—
                  "No, Ida, I have never known a mother's love—would to God I had, perhaps it would have made me a different being. Do you know, Mrs. St. John's conduct is to me inexplicable. I loved her, Ida. At times I have caught her eyes fixed upon me with such a kind, pitying, almost loving look, that my soul leaped up with a feeling as if she were my mother, too. Yes, Ida, there have been moments when I have yearned in my inmost soul, to kneel at her feet, and say, 'Mother, bless me.' Her words were always so gentle, her tones softer, kinder, than those of any other woman save yourself. Growing up without household ties, save the chain which binds me to a cold, stern, I had almost said unnatural father—with no softening influence thrown around me, how could I be other than I am? I thought Mrs. St. John felt for me, appreciated my position, and I loved her for it; for rugged as man's nature may be to the outer world—sternly, recklessly, as he may battle against men in the great warfare of life, there is a spell in woman's sympathy which will soften the rock, and cause it to melt and flow forth in gushing streams. But your mother, Ida, your mother, whom I had hoped to call mine, has turned against me; she tears from me the angel of mercy who alone can redeem me. Oh! if it had but been some other; the thought of her lends the blow a double force."
                  Ida's head had drooped on her lover's shoulder, and a low sob, every now and then, had been the only interruption to his speech, but as he finished, she looked up, and said, wooingly—
                  "Ah! Cameron, my mother is so kind, so gentle, and yet so firm in what she deems her duty. Retrieve your reputation—give up the excesses she fears, be what you are capable of being, and all will be right, I am sure. Until then we must be as we were when we first met, for I cannot break my word. Let us wait and hope for the future, and remember, dearest, remember, thou whom alone I have loved, whom alone I can love, the motto which the great Magician of hearts has graven on the memory of youth—'Time, Faith, and Energy.'"
               
               
                  CHAPTER XVIII.
                  "TIME, Faith, and Energy!" in how many a dark hour have those words, like bright stars in the far off heaven of hope, lightened the path before me! how often have they been a cooling balm to my fevered brow; fresh drink to my parched lip!
                  One day, far away in the dim past, when I was but a little child, seated in the old library at home, on high chair, feet perched on round, with dreamy eyes, revelling o'er the great thought-world of romance and poetry, I chanced to stumble on a volume left open by some careless reader. I was a child then, but a lone, sad child, sometimes, with strange thoughts and visions ever working in my little brain, and feelings forced into premature warmth and bloom by the exotic nurture of imagination.
                  They said I was a singular, incomprehensible child. Perhaps I was. I cannot remember when the first shadow fell on my young spirit. I only know there was a very dark one there, when I picked up "Night and Morning," and saw the talismanic words "Time, Faith, and Energy," beaming out upon me. Often afterwards when I sat at the old library window, gazing at the blue sky, and painting fair pictures on the bright clouds, the grand old oaks would keep chanting with their breezy voices the blessed words; and when, lulled by the twilight shadows, my head drooped, and sleep came upon me, a beautiful angel bent over the orphan child, and whispered lovingly, "Time, Faith, and Energy!"
                  I used to think the angel was a messenger from my mother, for I always thought she watched over and loved me, and the thought has comforted me many a time. I used to think, she sent me from heaven all my good impulses and feelings. But enough of what the heartless (and there are heartless people in the world, as I have since been doomed to find) might condemn as egotism.
                  The current of daily life had flowed less evenly than was its wont for some time at Huntingwild, and other cares than those of her invalid boy and younger children, threw their shadow over Mrs. St. John's brow.
                  True, the visits of Cameron Haughton had ceased almost entirely, and this might have been a relief to the mother's heart, but for the course of conduct adopted by Ida herself.
                  The old melancholy fits seemed to have grown into a habit, rarely broken in upon by those sunshiny moods, which formed so great a charm in her character, so magnetic in their influence that even the old halls seemed to wear a responsive smile, and every heart was gladdened by the gushing, sparkling life which flowed from her own.
                  The children missed the gay music to which their light feet had kept time morning and evening. They missed the long rambles through forest and field in the bright morning sunlight. Kate always preferred riding; and free air and bending foliage, wild flowers and singing birds, seemed to to have lost their charm for their older sister; or if she sought their influence, it was always alone; they were not permitted to patter after her, asking questions which the kind voice was always ready to answer, receiving sympathy in all their childish sports, and listening to the pleasant instructive lessons she loved to give them of Nature, and Nature's God.
                  They complained to their mother, "Sis' Ida was not a bit like she used to be. What was the matter?" But the quivering lip and tearful eye were the only answers received, and wondering they turned away, grieved for a little while, and transferred their caresses to Kate.
                  Only in society Ida's sparkling moods seemed to return, and then the mother's discernment taught her 'twas but the mask which "les usages du monde" required her to wear. Relieved from the gaze of unfamiliar faces, she relapsed into the same listless melancholy.
                  Even the piano was deserted, save in the twilight hour she loved, and then it was only sought when she could be alone, and warble songs so sad, that the tones smote painfully upon the listener's ear.
                  The household made their own comments.
                  Kate watched her sister in silence, and sought by a thousand delicate acts of kindness to show the sympathy she felt; but to Ida the contrast of her sister's happy love was so great, that she often repressed the confidence which trembled on her lips, and sought some other avenue for its escape. And this she imagined, she found in the ever ready and responsive bosom of her friend, Madame D'Allure, from whose trust- worthy bosom every secret passed into the keeping of her honorable, high-souled husband, to be used by him, should there ever be occasion for it.
                  But Ida's sadness was not the only cause which threw its reflective shadow on the mother's heart. Noble, too, seemed changed from the bright, joyous boy he once was. He had ever been of an unusually confiding nature, and often sought his mother to pour into her sympathising ear, even the trifling details of his boyish sports. But this was past now. It was evident he had something to conceal, and instead of seeking, he avoided her society. It was in vain that she questioned his sisters as to their knowledge of the cause.
                  Noble had been accustomed to dictate to Kate with the imperiousness of a wilful boy, and with the assumption of manhood, so natural to his age, he seemed to think her, though but two years younger than himself, entirely too much of a child to be trusted with any secret of importance; and even to Ida, with whom he had been in the habit of holding consultations on the very important and momentous occurrences of his daily life, he showed no disposition to reveal the cause of the change.
                  Mrs. St. John mentioned it to her husband, but his thoughts were too much occupied by the thousand and one cares which engross a man of large family and estate, not to mention a public-spirited individual and conspicuous county-man, to give much heed to what he set down to the account of boyish caprice. And so it passed; and the wife hushed the vague fears in her heart, and turned sadly to the couch of the blind boy.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XIX.
                  MRS. ST. JOHN entered one morning the sitting-room where the family usually assembled, with a perturbed air, holding in her hand an open note.
                  Noble, in hunting-dress, was making preparatory arrangements with gun and game-bag; speaking occasionally to the noble hound, who stood gazing with an intelligent look in his face, as if he were a sentient being and perfectly able to comprehend him. Ida stood by an open window, the fair morning sunlight kindling an unusual glow on her pale cheek, and the scented breeze playing gently with a stray tress which had escaped its confinement. She was playfully regarding a pet canary, which, perched on her fingers, was nibbling loaf-sugar from her rosy palm,—"A good sign," thought the mother, for even the pet canary had been neglected of late. A moment afterward, the instantaneous gleam of pleasure was displaced by the look of annoyance as she said, "My dears, I have some news which I fear will not be very agreeable to you."
                  "What is it, my dear mother?" asked Kate, entering the room at the moment.
                  "Why, I have just received a note from Miss Spitfire, announcing her intention of returning for a few weeks. You know what that means."
                  An exclamation of horror escaped the lips of the two girls.
                  "Can you not prevent this invasion of the fury into our peaceful habitation in any way?" asked Noble, pausing in the midst of his operations, with a look of blank dismay.
                  "You know I cannot, without appearing both uncourteous and inhospitable."
                  
                  "I'd sooner pack off, bag and baggage, to the White Sulphur, than stay here to receive such a harridan."
                  "Don't speak in that way, Noble. However she may deserve it, a true gentleman will never permit himself to speak disrespectfully of a woman. It is an unerring test of the heart and breeding. I shall resort to no such desperate measures, and even were I disposed, I should have no time to put them in execution. She desires me to send the carriage in to-morrow."
                  "Then I shall pitch my tent in the woods for this week, and take such provender as I can get. And you, Kate?"
                  "Will give Snowflake sufficient exercise to last him for the next six months."
                  "And Ida?"
                  "Books and sketching," she replied, with the rare old smile. "You know I am a wild-wood bird any way, and no one is ever surprised at my wanderings."
                  "And so," said Mrs. St. John, with a tone half amused half annoyed, "in this trying hour, you leave me to all the 'horrors of war alone.'"
                  "Oh! Ma," said Kate, kissing her, "you are so good that you can be gentle and agreeable to any one."
                  "Well, mother, if she must come, she must, as Mrs. Brown would say. Come, Dash, old fellow, I know you are impatient, but never mind, fine sport presently;" and Noble whistled himself out of the room. Taking his horse from the groom, he raised his hunting horn to his lips, blew a cheery blast, and galloped off, followed by a retinue of dogs, who started from every imaginary corner about the building, joining in one prolonged bay of ecstacy.
                  Kate stood watching the retreating form of her favorite brother with fond pride; but the gaze of Ida was arrested by a different object. Walking with his usual slow and stately tread, yet, with even more than his usual air of pre-occupied thought, through the serpentine walk which led to the side entrance, came the form of Cameron Haughton's father. The blood mounted to her brow, while the cold grasp of apprehension clutched tightly at her heart; but she merely turned to Mrs. St. John, and said quietly, "Mr. Haughton is coming, mother." The cheek of that mother vied in crimson with her own for the moment, but the next instant it was pale as death, as she answered hastily,—"He wishes to see your father, probably. Cæsar," to the servant, who at the moment entered with a glass of water for Kate, "say he is not at home."
                  "Pa only rode out, Ma, and probably will be back in a short time."
                  "Never mind, Cæsar, do as I bid you."
                  But the next moment the audible inquiry, "Is Mrs. St. John at home," fell on the ears (appalled or not, as the case might be) in the sitting-room. Cæsar had no instructions to say "no" to this at all events, and the next moment, with his dignified bow and majestic presence, Mr. Haughton entered the room.
                  For the first time in her life, though it had been enacted before her a thousand times, Ida noticed the shrinking eye, and half-concealed aversion with which her mother extended her hand to her unwelcome visitor. Mr. Haughton was a man, as we have said, of majestic presence. He could not be less than fifty; but his haughty form was unbent, and his deep-set, piercing eye, dark as midnight, burned with more than the fire of youth; burned the more brightly, perhaps, from the contrast with the marble brow and cheek. A few gray hairs silvered the raven of his locks; but spite of the predominant expression, pride and passion, his features, though too much sharpened for the regular contour of beauty, were fine, and his manner, stately but condescending, was, when he chose, singularly calculated to please. He was a man who could not fail to leave a marked impression on the mind of the most casual observer.
                  He had scarcely seated himself and made the usual compliments of the day, ere he turned to Mrs. St. John and desired a private interview with her. The lady's cheek again wore its shroud of death-like paleness as, with a slight bow, she rose and led the way to the library. Ida heard the door close upon them with a strange, indefinable sensation of dread and other emotions mixed, and turned mechanically from the spot to the piazza, where Willie, feeling better than usual, was seated on his rolling chair, protected from the sunlight by the shadow of the overhanging woodbine and wild rose, wreathing the pillars and sending grateful tributes of fragrance to the senses of the blind boy. He heard her footsteps. "Ah! 'tis you, my Ida. I have been longing for the music of your sweet voice. Have you not a kiss for Willie this morning?"
                  "Fifty, if you wish, dear bud," and her bright lips were pressed to his with the pure fervency of a sister's love.
                  "I am tired of sitting here, dear Ida; shall we not go to the bower?"
                  "The very thing I would have proposed," and with the assistance of a servant, she rolled the chair down the inclined plain which had been made for its descent from the piazza, and thence to the bower.
                  Here the sunlight fell only here and there, like the saucy glances of a bright-eyed beauty, and the thick trellis-work burdened with roses and honeysuckle created a cool, grateful shade. Zephyr, bird, and bee were whispering, humming, and warbling in concert. The waters of the James flowed broad, calm and bright in the sunlight, and the smile of beauty was on wave, flower, and forest. It was one of those days in which to exist is a joy; when one falls in love with nature, and the heart revels, and the pulse leaps with ecstasy.
                  Depressing as was the state of Ida's feelings, and painful as was the vague fear with which she thought of the interview between her mother and Mr. Haughton, feeling convinced as she did, that it was in some way connected with the future of Cameron and herself, she could not resist influences to which her poetical nature was peculiarly susceptible. She was seated at her brother's side, her fingers playing gently with the light golden waves of his shining hair, weaving some wild romance of the olden time, such as she loved to linger on, and he to hear, when a shadow darkened the entrance of the bower, and Charlie Delham stood before them.
                  "Your pardon for my interruption," he said, in his frank, courteous tones, "but Miss Kate bade me seek you here, and I thought you could not resist my appeal for your society in a drive this beautiful morning. But as you are thus engaged, I will not interfere with an employment I so much admire."
                  Willie extended his hand with a smile of pleasure at the first sound of his friend's voice.
                  "You know you are sure of my forgiveness, Charlie, even for the crime of taking my sister from me, though I never would pardon it in any one else." A slightly mischievous smile played around his lips as he spoke, which brought the blood to Delham's brow, and made Ida avert her head; but he was answered by the kind words, and warm pressure of the hand, so familiar to him, "No, no, Willie, I could not pardon myself for depriving you of a moment's pleasure."
                  "Have your horses put away," said Ida, "and dine with us; and when Willie takes his afternoon siesta, I will accompany you with pleasure."
                  "Come hither, Sis, and put your hand in mine," said Willie, as Delham left the bower, to give the orders consequent on his acceptance of Ida's invitation.
                  "Is not Delham a noble fellow?"
                  "He is indeed," replied Ida, warmly.
                  "Then why is it that my sister withholds the admiration which she admits is so justly his due, and which, for years, it has been the chief object of his life to win?"
                  "The heart cannot control its impulses," replied Ida, briefly.
                  Willie sighed, and then said, earnestly, "Ah! sister, if you could but love Delham, how cheerfully would I, would my mother resign you into his care and keeping. With him," and there was a slight accent on the last word, which brought a rebellious flush to Ida's cheek, "we would have no fears for your happiness."
                  Her reply was arrested by the re-entrance of Delham. He listened to the conclusion of the legend, occasionally adding an embellishment of his own with ready grace; read aloud from Willie's favorite author, and in his gay, pleasant way, and without one look or word that could seem obtrusive to Ida, of his affection, whiled the morning hours away, with pleasure to the whole trio. He had, apparently, become convinced of Ida's love for Cameron Haughton; and while there was occasionally a look or word which burst the bonds of self-control, and breathed of the old, clinging feeling, and while his visits were frequent, they seemed simply those of a devoted friend, and as such, Ida could not repel them. On the contrary, she rather sought them. His cheerful voice drove away sad thoughts, and his kind tones had a magic music in their sympathy. It was a relief to have him to turn to as a brother, friend, nay, almost she felt as a protector. Her smile of welcome was always bright for "Charlie," and the shade on her brow grew deeper when he departed. She did not reflect that she was thus binding closer the tendrils which already twined, with the growth and strength of years, around his manly heart. She did not reflect, that every cheerful word, kind act, or ready sympathy which he yielded her, was as so much warm life drained from his own being, to leave the blank desolation of unrequited feelings.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XX.
                  "NOBLE, my son," said Mrs. St. John, finding him engrossed in a novel in the library, "I would have a few words with you."
                  "Well, mother;" and he laid aside the book with an air of forced resignation.
                  The mother seated herself beside him, and said, quietly, but firmly:
                  "Noble, do you think you are acting as you should do towards Fannie Bonford?"
                  A frown, as deep as his habitual respect for his mother could permit him to exhibit, darkened the boy's face.
                  "I follow but the dictates of my own heart, mother, and I would be a hypocrite did I act otherwise. My love for Fannie was, I am now convinced, a boyish passion, evanescent as warm, and I think I ought not, in honor and justice towards her and myself, to pursue the matter any further."
                  "Nay, Noble, it's vain to talk thus. It is too late now to retract. You are betrothed, with the full consent of all parties; it is generally understood that you will be married in a few years, when you are old enough for such a step; and to desert her now, would not only be an act of heartless cruelty, but would affix, publicly, upon yourself the brand of dishonor."
                  "And is my hand to be fettered, my freedom destroyed by public opinion," broke out the fiery boy. "No, by heaven! it shall not be. Fanny cannot be so weak as to wish, for a moment, to wed a man where honor compels him to the union. In fact," he added, impetuously, "it is pretty much a family match, any way, and people have no right to sacrifice the feelings of their children to the mere worldly consideration of a suitable marriage."
                  "Noble, I little thought to hear you speak thus. Your father requested me to mention this subject to you—he, as well as myself, feeling deeply mortified at the public comments on your pointed neglect of a woman, whose sole right it is to receive your devotion." She emphasized the last words.
                  Noble bit his lip.
                  "I care not for the gossip of the neighborhood. As long as my conduct satisfies my own conscience, I care nothing for public opinion."
                  "'Let him that standeth take heed lest he fall.' Public opinion, Noble, makes the standard of right and wrong, and 'tis useless for one individual to endeavor to oppose the united strength of the masses. But may I ask if you have not some hidden motive? Do you know it has been suggested, that your intimacy with Madame D'Allure may have something to do with this?"
                  "Who has dared to speak thus"—the eyes flashed, and the brow crimsoned. "Who has dared to make use of one expression implying censure of her conduct? Do you sup- pose that she would receive my attentions, save in the most blameless way?"
                  "As my friend, and the friend of your sisters, I should loathe to believe the contrary. But still—"
                  "Still, what, mother?"
                  "Never mind now, the subject excites you. But think of what I have said. I leave you to your own reflections; and I hope that the good feeling and high principle of my son will teach him how to act, and that God may give him strength to pursue the path of right, though it conflict with that of inclination."
                  She drew him to her, pressed a warm kiss on his brow, and left him to his own meditations.
                  Noble's conscience was not altogether so clear of wrong as he would fain have had his mother believe. Beguiled by the syren fascinations of Madame D'Allure, all other women had become to him, by comparison, tame. He sought her at first, because, undreaming of danger, the hours flew rapidly in her presence; at last, because an irresistible impulse drew him to her side.
                  Not that he dared whisper to himself the thought, that he loved her.
                  It had been the Frenchwoman's policy to fetter the boy's senses; to weave, link by link, around him a chain which time and habit daily served to strengthen, until he became the mere machine of her will, but not by word or act to forfeit his respect. This would have been a false move in the game; for, if the loss of his respect would involve a momentary increase of passion, it would also ultimately deprive love of that imaginary halo, which, while it lasts, invests its object with a power that is immutable.
                  It is very rarely that the prose of reality does not kill the poetry of imagination.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XXI.
                  THEY sat by the tall French windows, side by side.—The balmy breeze, whispering soft tales, toyed caressingly with their brown curls; he took the little hand which played coquettishly with the odorous honeysuckle peeping like a saucy child within, he took that hand in his own, and the touch, familiar though it was, thrilled him with a vague ecstasy.
                  "Victorine, my mother spoke to me to-day of my conduct towards Fannie. She is much disturbed about it, and in fact my own conscience echoes all she says. And yet—"
                  "And yet, Noble?"
                  "I cannot, cannot marry her!—but my honor!—Tell me, Victorine, do you think it is honorable to swear allegiance to vows which only death can break, when every throb of your heart gives the lie to your words? To bind a woman's deep, trusting soul to a living falsehood, an unreal mockery of heaven's purest ties?"
                  The eyes were shadowed by their silken fringes, but the low voice, thrilling with music, murmured,
                  "You know well, Noble, what I think of this, but do as you will. I cannot interfere farther."
                  "The time has come for a decision;" he paused, and his cheek grew pale, for in that moment the struggle of a life-destiny was at work in his heart.
                  'Tis said that every man has a good and evil angel, who are continually battling for his soul, and that in his life there comes a crisis which decides the conflict, and he is given irrevocably over to the power of one or the other. Pray God, that this crisis had not arrived in the existence of Noble St. John.
                  "Read this," at length he said, taking a note from his bosom, "and let this be a proof of my confidence, for to no other would I trust the artless revealings of her girlish nature. Ah! she is very pure and good."
                  Victorine read:
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "My Noble, my heart, like a bird of evil omen, sings but one sad song through the long day, and the burden is, 'he loves you no longer.' I have much of late to convince me of this, and yet I so fear to wrong you that I continually torture myself to invent new excuses for your seeming neglect. If you have grown weary of the tie between us, tell me so at once. I will not reproach you, for I know your high, true soul too well not to feel that if you are changed, there is some overwhelming motive thrown into the scale against me. I could not suspect it of being unworthy. I will not ask its nature. I will only pray that if another has won you from me, she may love as I love, cling to you as I would have clung, through weal and woe.
                              
                                 FANNIE."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  Victorine's eyes were beautiful with shining moisture, as she closed the simple, touching appeal, but there was a bitterness mingling deeply and darkly with her sympathy.
                  What a contrast was that young, fresh soul, in its beautiful and guileless love, braving in its untried strength the first great sorrow, to her own hackneyed nature. And yet she was once as fresh and guileless too. Nay, perhaps it was this very recollection that mingled in the pure stream of sympathy, the drop of bitterness which poisoned it at its source, for there is nothing so bitter, as the remembrance of past purity, to a nature which has fallen from its pristine nobleness into the gulf of falsehood and shame.
                  A heart naturally base, has nothing to regret in the past, save that villany does not always succeed, and only the coward fear of detection to darken the future.
                  
                  Noble saw only the look of sympathy, and he construed it into a silent reproach of his faithlessness.
                  He sprung to his feet.
                  "Even you, Victorine, think I am wrong! Even you would scorn me for my dishonor! You have decided me. I will go to her this moment! I will tell her that I have wavered, but am fixed at last. I will teach my heart its old rôle of love; I will utter the old-time words of tenderness, stereotyped in my memory—and she will listen, never dreaming that I am a bond-slave to honor, and that my life, my happiness, is one long sacrifice to the faith I owe her!"
                  He spoke with the quick impetuosity of youth, and his brow grew fevered as he did so.
                  He had been pacing the room rapidly. When he again turned towards Victorine, the small, white hands were clasped on her knees, her head bent, the thick, brown curls shading her half averted face, so that he could not see the expression, but he saw tears, large tears, fall drop by drop on her jewelled fingers. For an instant he stood spell-bound. A sudden thought struck him, and the blood leaped in liquid lightning through his veins. For the first time he realized his own feelings, and he dared to hope hers also.
                  He would not pause; he could not think; he was at her feet, the clasped hands were in his own, and he was gazing into the now blushing and still averted face.
                  "Victorine! is it, can it be possible? Oh! Victorine, guide me, tell me, what must I do? Were you to bid me sell my soul to perdition, I would do it, only to know that you would yield a thought of tenderness in return. If the thought of my marriage to Fannie gives you an emotion of pain, I will never think of it again. Say it is your will, and I will give her up at once and for ever!"
                  He had gone too far. Victorine felt that her rôle was becoming difficult to play; but she was equal to the contest. After a pause, during which the beatings of Noble's heart were almost audible, she heaved one quick, deep sigh, and looked at him with a glance full of mournful reproach.
                  "Noble," she said, and there was a sadness now in her low, musical tones, inexpressibly touching, "these are wild words to use to me. Have I not told you that I love you as a brother? Why, then, should the thought of your marriage with another pain me, save for the interest a sister might feel in your welfare?"
                  Her words sent a thrill of apprehension to the heart of the listener. The quick blood again mantled his brow. He trembled with confusion.
                  "Pardon me—I thought—that is, I dared to hope—I know not what. My secret was revealed to you, in the same moment that it betrayed itself to my own consciousness. You know that I am the last being on earth to cherish a thought which could call a blush to your check. Ere I rise from my knees, let me hear that you forgive me! It was too much to hope that you could love me; that you could so far forget your sense of right as to share my weakness, my blind, until now, unconscious weakness; though God knows if you had, while I would have guarded your secret as my life, and approached you with as much reverence as ever saint brought to the shrine of the Virgin, it would have been a mournful pleasure, a pleasure mixed with the torturing consciousness that I had no right to feel it."
                  As the noble boy thus spoke his remorse for a wrong, to the commission of which she had allured him—the high principle betrayed in every word he uttered, his belief in her purity, brought a blush of shame to the cheek of even that practised woman of the world. It was but a momentary pang, for the next instant she felt for him but the scorn with which the world-hardened look upon what they deem the cowardice of a tender conscience.
                  Noble continued:—"Fear not, Victorine, that you will ever hear from me another word to pain you. Nay, if you wish it, painful as the task would be, I will leave you, to return not, unless bidden by yourself."
                  He gazed into her face, with his clear blue eyes mirroring the depths of his own true soul, pleading as he would have pleaded before an angel for an unintentional offence.
                  She saw that the spell had worked, that from the freedom of his own nature from suspicion, rather than from any evidence on her part, he believed her frigidly correct.
                  There was no necessity for "getting up a scene" to prove it. The crisis had come, and with an inward smile, if we may so express it,—for she felt the smile, though her features betrayed it not,—at "the boy's folly," she turned to him, her eyes still humid with moisture, and beaming the same magnetic look with which she had often lured him before, saying, in tones of tender deprecation,—
                  "Ah, Noble, you will not leave me. You know you are my dear friend, my brother; that I could not do without your numberless little kindnesses, and Auguste," the boy winced, there was the same inward smile, and she went on, "Auguste is so fond of you. No, you must not leave me. I must have your visits every day as usual."
                  "You know that you have but to speak and I obey," replied Noble, in a subdued tone. "I am happy to know that you forgive me."
                  His heart was full to overflowing, therefore his words, as is often the case, were few and simple. He rose to his feet, carrying the little hand to his lips, but the kiss pressed there would not have stained the snow-plume of a seraph.
                  "Now sit beside me, Noble," said Victorine, with a wooing smile, as she smoothed back her curls, and wiped the stray tears from her lashes with an elegantly embroidered, delicately scented mouchoir, "sit beside me, and let us go back to the subject with which we commenced this interview. Speak to me as to your spirit-sister, your other self."
                  "My better self!" he said fervently. "All I have to say now is to implore your counsel. If you say 'tis better to keep my vows in act, though my heart belies them, I will do it."
                  "One word, Noble. You never have betrayed, you never will betray one word of my counsel to another?"
                  His glance was full of reproach as he answered, "Never!"
                  "I thought you might, in some unguarded moment, name it to your mother, and she, prejudiced as you confess her to be in the matter, would probably put on it a wrong interpretation."
                  "I will never give any one the opportunity to censure you."
                  "Then Noble if you will have me speak frankly, I will repeat what I have always said. With your present feelings it would be culpable, yes, actually culpable, in you to marry Fannie Bonford, nor do I think you are acting kindly towards her in continuing the engagement. The sooner she is convinced of the truth, the better for both. Were I you, in answer to this I would tell her all. I will bring my escritoire, and you will write her at once?"
                  He gazed upon the beautiful Temptress, but there was no shadow on the fair brow to warn him of danger. No, the eyes beamed and melted into his own more wooingly, the lip curved more seductively than ever, and an angelic frankness and innocence seemed to him to radiate from her countenance.
                  
                  "Perhaps it would be best."
                  But when the escritoire was brought, the snowy paper placed before him, the delicate gold pen in his fingers, he paused and pressed his hand to his brow.
                  "I cannot, I cannot strike the blow, Victorine."
                  She said nothing, but looked unutterable things. Another pause, and the pen dashed rapidly, recklessly over the paper.
                  "Another point gained," said Victorine to herself after Noble's departure. "If that woman is permitted to possess any influence over him, mine must necessarily be weakened; besides, this step will perhaps create a disturbance in the family, home being thus rendered unpleasant, he will naturally, annoyed by sad thoughts, be more easily led into temptation."
                  "And yet what is all this for?" She walked to the window, but the twilight gloom without was not deeper than that which rested on her spirit—as she murmured, "Auguste! Auguste! how poorly do you compensate the woman who sacrifices time, feeling, principle, all that a woman most values, in your service."
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXII.
                  THE little room might have been inhabited by a fairy, it was so fresh, so neat, so pretty. The muslin curtains were like gossamer folds, so soft and white, the roses bloomed so fragrantly in their crystal vases, every thing was in such perfect order and yet so gracefully arranged. In that apartment, which any one must have guessed at a glance to be that of a refined, tasteful woman, on the snowy couch whose pillow-slip scarce rivalled the cheek that touched it in whiteness, reclined Fannie Bonford.
                  She seemed to be musing quietly but sadly, for the flowers blooming on the stand beside her, the soft breeze stealing through the open window, a messenger of the beauty and gladness without, brought no glow of enjoyment to her cheek. Occasionally the brown lashes closed over the gentle blue eyes, as if to shut back a tear which would come glistening through their fringes, try as she would to prevent.
                  Her musings were interrupted by a light, cautious step, and a mild, fair woman somewhat past life's prime entered.
                  "Do you feel much indisposed this morning, my daughter?"
                  "Not very much, mother. I feel no pain save a slight headache, but a lethargic languor, a sort of aversion to every thing like moving life—every thing like beauty and gladness even, mother. I only wish to be quiet, to nurse my own sad thoughts undisturbed."
                  The mother took her hand in her own, and smoothed the brown hair gently from her brow; as she answered,
                  "I fear, Fannie, you are permitting yourself to grieve over the seeming neglect of Noble St. John. If he can intentionally neglect or seek to wound you, he is unworthy a thought. I hope, however, there is no such thing intended on his part, and that you are tormenting yourself with idle fears. I have a note which has just arrived from him for you."
                  She gave the billet into the eager, tremulous fingers, extended to grasp it, and respecting feelings whose revulsions should ever be private, left the room.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "Dear Noble! this will end my fears, I am sure," cried Fannie; a smile of hope brightening her features as she tore open the envelope.
                              "It is a painful task, Fannie, and yet I feel that I ought, in justice to you and myself, to fulfil it.
                              
                              "Can you forgive me when I tell you that I am changed? Will you not think me the most dishonorable of human beings and regard my very name with loathing?
                              "If so I bow with submission, feeling the punishment, heavy as it would be, more than deserved by the offence. Fannie I will yet say that I esteem, nay, that I love you, if not with the ardent enthusiasm of my boyish dream, with the pure calm affection of a brother, with a world of remorseful tenderness for the past.
                              "If under these circumstances you can forgive an infidelity of heart, you cannot mourn more than I, and will continue my betrothed, I swear to you, no other shrine shall ever receive a vow. I will devote myself unceasingly to your happiness. Forgive me! oh forgive me my early and confiding love, if I now wound you, but I could not press you to a heart which had wronged you without a confession.
                              "I await your answer,
                              
                                 NOBLE."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  The cold and trembling fingers from which the note had fallen, were clasped tightly to the throbbing heart, as if to still its cry—icy drops stood out upon the fair brow as an irrepressible moan burst from her lips.
                  The dagger had struck home—the young heart had learned its lesson of disappointment, and was writhing with the agony of the torn tendrils.
                  Her hour had come, as it must come to all the children of earth, to taste the bitter bread of life, the tear-moistened bread, eaten in silence and loathing, the burning draught which must be drained, though the fainting lip shriek wildly! "Father, if it be possible let this cup pass from me!" She lay pale, cold, and still, save for an occasional low moan for some minutes, when her eyes again fell shudderingly on the fatal missive. She perceived that the paper was the soft fair note paper intended for a lady's use, but this might have passed unnoticed but for the initials faintly stamped on its pages V. D'A. The sight of those simple letters sent a new thrill of pain to her heart. Involuntarily she brought the paper nearer. That perfume! that well-known and yet rare perfume, what a power to torture it had! What poison it sent thrilling through her veins! It brought the vision of the beguiling Frenchwoman, her wooing smiles, her serpent glances. Did it bring too the vision of the betrothed of her youth—kneeling in utter prostration of mind and soul before the false shrine, vowing that one word from her lips would break his plighted faith for ever? No, that at least was spared her, but scarcely less bitter was the conviction which broke upon her as she re-read the letter.
                  "He pities me!" she murmured, with the wrung pride of an injured woman, "he dares to pity me. His inclinations are at war with his honor, and he forces himself to use those few constrained words of affection, 'No longer with the ardent enthusiasm of his boyish dream, but with the calm affection of a brother.' Ah! Noble, how must your very nature have changed ere you could use such words to me," and now the tears gushed wildly forth.
                  It was perchance an hour afterward that she wrote, with a strange composure, the simple words, "You are free," and withdrawing from her finger the slender gold circlet which marked their betrothal, enclosed it in an envelope, and ringing the bell, despatched the note.
                  We leave her to the solitary and aching consciousness of her desolation.
                  Are there not in the experience of every one, moments when he is ready to exclaim, "Is there love, faith, or truth on earth, or was it but the breath of a lost paradise which brought Hope's whisper to our souls?"
                  
                  Drape life as we will, cover its dark, unsightly nakedness in gorgeous garb, hide its deformity by every invention of art and imagination, we cannot blind ourselves to the truth; the spectre haunts us through its brilliant robes, and with loathing lip, and heart thirsting to faintness for all it needs, but cannot find, we turn away, crying, "It satisfies not!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXIII.
                  THE blind boy grew weaker every day; a weakness made known to those around him by the paling cheek and failing limb, rather than by the usual murmuring complaints of the invalid.
                  Their annual trip to the watering-places must be hastened, though it was yet early in the season, being only the latter part of June.
                  They had a cottage at the White Sulphur Springs, and generally kept up an establishment there through the summer. Several servants were despatched to get every thing in readiness for their reception, and the usual routine of shopping commenced; mantuamakers, milliners, etc., were put in requisition, and Ida slowly and unwillingly awoke to the consciousness that the sweet quiet in which she had loved to nurse her "broken dream" was over, and the claims of pleasure alone to be remembered.
                  She entered one day her mother's chamber, which was in all the confusion and disarray of packing, and after asking some trivial question, lingered, amused by the occupation of looking over sundry miscellaneous articles of attire, from trunks just emptied of their old contents to receive new.
                  While doing so, her attention was arrested by a small casket of antique workmanship, in an open cabinet.
                  She would have asked her mother's permission before examining its contents, but she was busy in the dressing-room, and little surmising that in her hands she held a family secret which involved her own welfare and happiness, Ida commenced making sundry efforts to open it. It was not fastened by a lock, and in turning it over, to discover, if possible, the mystic seal which held it fast, she accidentally touched a concealed spring, and the casket flew open. A ringlet of sunny hair, a parcel of faded letters, and a miniature met her eyes.
                  Why did Ida's fingers thrill as she touched the golden ringlet? She could not, herself, account for the sensation; but the next moment she was gazing eagerly on the miniature, to which we have before been introduced in the privacy of this apartment, then sacred to the mother's meditations.
                  An exclamation burst from her, as she gazed into those dark, thrilling eyes, so filled, even in infancy, with the promise of the after power of the man.
                  She had seen in life but one pair like them. And the lineaments, too—was there not the vague, shadowy resemblance which might exist between the child and the man?
                  But no; this could not be. How could his miniature be in her mother's possession?
                  All this time, the letters, with their cold lines revealing clue after clue to the mysteries of a lifetime, lay untouched in the casket. Ida thought not of these in the absorbing interest with which she gazed on the picture. The quiet step of her mother, as she re-entered the room, was unnoticed. Well was it for the mother that it was so; for, as she perceived her daughter's occupation, her flushed cheek and eager gaze, a deadly paleness came over her face, a sickening faint- ness seized upon her, and she grasped the nearest article of furniture for support.
                  Strugling forcibly with her emotion, she overcame it, and, approaching Ida, said with a sad tone, but an outwardly calm demeanor:
                  "My daughter, these are mournful relics for your young eyes. Where did you find them?"
                  Ida answered, by the eager question: "Mother, tell me who this is?"
                  The dark, inquiring eyes were fixed full on the mother's face, and in that moment a confession trembled on her lips. But a sudden recollection restrained her, and she answered:
                  "It is the miniature of my first-born, Ida—your elder brother—lost before your remembrance. I never mentioned him, because I dislike to sadden you with such details; and—and—such was my absorbing love for him, that I can rarely find strength to dwell upon his loss."
                  "Mother, dear mother, forgive me for recalling such sad reminiscences to your mind," replied her daughter, twining her arm around her neck, with the quick impulse of affection, and imprinting a kiss on her cheek. But the next moment, an influence she could not resist prompted her to ask:
                  "Mother, why is it that you never speak to me of my father?"
                  The tremulous tones replied:
                  "You have never known sorrow, Ida, or you would not ask the question."
                  A fever-spot sprung to the girl's cheek, as she answered with a tinge of bitterness:
                  "If to yield our nearest, dearest dream of happiness, to the dictates of another's will, brings with the sacrifice a pang, then I may be truly said to have felt sorrow. And by that sorrow borne for you, mother," she continued, with a kindling eye, "I demand that you reply to my question."
                  Large tears coursed silently down the mother's cheeks.
                  Again the softer feeling triumphed, and Ida said gently,
                  "I did not wish to wound mother, but—"
                  "I know it, my child," interrupted Mrs. St. John, taking her hands and pressing them in her own cold grasp; "but you must be satisfied with this reply to your question, a knowledge of your father would not teach you to love him. And now leave me."
                  She obeyed, subduing her features into a calmness which masked the emotion she felt.
                  A bright tableau met her gaze through the open door of the drawing-room as she crossed the hall to her own room.
                  Kate was standing near one of the open windows, laughing and chatting gaily with Marsden, her eyes beaming with happiness, her cheek as fair and fresh as the roses twined in her brown tresses.
                  Noble had just joined them, and with the flush of health and vigor on his brow, was answering the eager questions of the children as to his success in the chase.
                  Willie's couch, too, was drawn near the window. He was smiling gently at the quizzing replies of Noble, and, as an evening sunbeam fell in a halo of light on his features, Ida thought he resembled a beautiful angel more than a thing of earth.
                  But the shadow fell darker on her own spirit as she marked the happy group.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XXIV.
                  "I SAY, old fellow, do you know whose carriage that is?" said one of a group of loungers, on the piazza of the hotel at the White Sulphur Springs, on a sultry July afternoon.
                  "Not yet, but I'll find out in a short time," replied the bar-keeper, who was the individual addressed, as the jaded horses of a travelling carriage paused at the entrance.
                  "Well, do; I hope it holds some women worth looking at, for there are precious few here now."
                  The thick veils of the ladies defied the utmost scrutiny of the impertinent fop, whose glass was levelled at them, but he imparted to his companions, in a loud whisper, the important information that one of 'em had a devilish pretty foot and ankle.
                  This was Madame D'Allure, who had very coquettishly elevated her travelling dress in descending.
                  A smaller, more open carriage followed, with the curtains thrown back to admit all the air possible. In this were the mother and the blind boy. Then followed two gentlemen in a buggy, drawn by a splendid pair of horses, and lastly a baggage wagon and three servants.
                  "'Pon my life," drawled the dandy, "travel in some style; must be people of consequence."
                  "I've found out who they are," said the bar-keeper, a few moments afterwards. "The St. Johns, of Lower Virginia. They have a fine old country seat on the James, and are a very wealthy family."
                  "How many daughters?"
                  "Two, I suppose. The lady that got out first is registered as Madame D'Allure, probably a friend."
                  "Well, I'm in for 'em, if they've got any money—ain't you, Jem?"
                  "Of course I am."
                  "My dear Ida, you have not commenced dressing, and Madame D'Allure and I are nearly ready. You will make us so late," said Kate to her sister the next evening.
                  Ida sat in the moonlight, stealing through the window, lost in a fit of musing; her half-draped figure, unbound hair, and upturned gaze, giving her in the pale light, the air of a sibyl. As Kate spoke, she sprung to her feet, and in a few moments her toilet was completed.
                  There is a sort of poetry in the toilet of a woman of taste. The artistic blending of hues, so as to produce the most harmonious effect, the graceful disposal of the soft, glossy hair, the glitter of the jewel on the heaving bosom, the perfect set of the robe, to every graceful curve and modulation of figure. There is an art and a poetry in this. At least I thought so, when, but a little child, I used to watch the arraying of a beautiful woman with absorbing admiration, nor turned away until the last jetty ringlet was twined, the last diamond glittered on the taper finger, and the shower of delicate odors, on the exquisite lace mouchoir, announced that the work of destruction was complete. Entre nous, what a misfortune is this idolatry of the beautiful, this horror of any thing gross or ugly. How much wasted enthusiasm over things outwardly charming, but intrinsically worthless,—how many shivering sensations of disgust, at the unpleasant forms and characters sometimes forced on our view, might have been saved me, had I been of a different temperament.
                  Quite a sensation was produced in the thronged and brilliantly lighted ball-room that evening, by the entrance of our heroines. Madame D'Allure, with her graceful and exquisitely attired figure, Ida, with her charming air and bril- liant face, blended with a shade of haughtiness so slight that it was a charm rather than a defect,—it was so sweet to see it vanish, with the bright smile and glance with which she answered some kindly greeting,—and Kate, in her fresh bloom of heart and cheek, her guileless enjoyment, for she was yet quaffing the first sparkling foam on the cup of pleasure. Still her eyes sought her sister; that sister whose brow so often wore a shadow. But there was no cloud on lip or brow now—the light laugh echoed gaily the merriment around her—the cheek burned crimson, and the brightness of the eye vied with the glitter of the diamonds braided in her dark tresses. She seemed to be in one of her old gay moods, tossing the curls carelessly from her cheek, and uttering lightly gem after gem of wit and sentiment.
                  They met familiar faces on all sides, and a shower of recognitions greeted them as they moved on.
                  "Why! you here too?"
                  "When did you arrive? Delighted to see you!"
                  "Is it possible that I have the pleasure—"
                  "Ah! Madame, what happiness the sight of you gives me."
                  "Welcome to the White Sulphur, Miss Walton. Ready to bear off the palm of beauty and grace as usual?"
                  "And this is your sister? A new star I suppose? But you do not dread rivalry—"
                  These and fifty exclamations of the same nature met them at every turn. Ida came with a reputation as a belle, and Kate had the charm of freshness and novelty; but even setting these circumstances aside, the mere whisper—"the wealthy St. Johns," would have been sufficient to procure the homage of that gay and fluttering crowd.
                  Ida turned around during a pause in the dance, to answer with some brilliant sally the compliments of a gallant, mus- tachioed officer, when her eyes met those of Cameron Haughton. The words died on her lips, and a feeling half of pain, half of pleasure, thrilled her veins. He was standing alone in the crowd, at some distance from her, and in the shadow of a recess, but her beating heart told her she could not be mistaken.
                  He did not bow, but with a strange smile turned away, and she saw him no more. That smile pained her more than words could have done. What did it mean? Perhaps he thought her fickle, cold, to be thus light and gay, unmindful of the shadows resting on their future. Perhaps—she knew not what, but the laugh was forced, the light word sprung from a chilled heart for the remainder of the evening, and the eager glance, and distraite air, betrayed that she watched for a form that came not.
                  At length weary with the task of seeming gay, and longing to give vent, in tears, to the bitter thoughts which thronged her brain, she turned away, thinking to leave the ball-room unperceived.
                  "Where are you going, Sis?" said Kate, as she was passing by, all smiles and blushes, leaning on the arm of Marsden, and followed by two or three little cadets, composed principally of gray cloth and brass buttons.
                  "Only to my cabin, darling," she answered in a low tone. "I am weary of dancing, but do not wish to disturb you."
                  Ah! now, Sis, don't go. If you do mother will think I ought to have come too, and I wouldn't leave yet for any thing. Stay for my sake."
                  Ida stayed, and Kate in her happy dreams that night saw not the fevered cheek, the tearful restlessness of the sleepless form beside her. Upon her, at least, the shadow of woman's sorrow had not fallen.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XXV.
                  A DAY of self-control and endurance followed—card after card was left, and impelled by a desire to see or hear something more of Cameron, she consented to take her part with Kate and Madame D'Allure, in the reception of visitors; her mother being too meek and unobstrusive in character to care for company, or to be any thing more than the quiet home-matron, which nine out of ten of our Southern women become after marriage.
                  We may here remark on the singularity of the transformation which marriage makes in a Southern girl. Before marriage, none are so devoted to pleasure, none seem so much women of society, pursuing gayety, as if haunted by the consciousness, that 'tis but for a few years they can enjoy it. Suddenly she marries—the gay, charming belle, Miss Such-a-one, whose presence lent a charm to every scene—is simply Mrs. So-and-so—whose business it is to stay at home, mind the household affairs, and love her husband. If she appears, to chaperone a daughter, or some young friend, she is doomed to the monotony of a sofa for the evening. "Who cares to talk to a married woman," says the chivalric son of the South.
                  The morning wore on, bright smiles mantled the quivering lip, beaming glances and gay tones hid the sad heart beneath, and there was no word, no sign of Cameron.
                  In the afternoon the indefatigable Kate took a ride with her Arthur, while Ida consumed the hours in the vain endeavor to gain a little repose. She arose from the couch as weary as when she first pressed it; but the vision which danced before her eyes in the bright beams of Hope, as she arrayed herself for the ball was—"He will surely be there tonight." But no! lights glittered, diamonds flashed—"Bright eyes looked love to eyes that spoke again,"—on before her eager eyes moved the perfumed mass of lace and jewels, black-cloth and moustachios. Mockingly the music sounded—dance after dance was moved through, as if in a dream, barely conscious that she was herself the centre of a crowd, who listened to her words as oracles. She entreated Kate to leave the ball early, and her sister feeling herself fatigued, yielded the point.
                  As they passed through the piazza, leading from the ball-room, the air breathed so softly and wooingly, the fragrance from the myriad blossoms of the multiflora rose came so seductively to her senses, almost stifled by the heat of the crowd she had just left, that she begged the gentleman on whose arm she leaned, to pause a moment, that she might enjoy it.
                  There was no moon, but the stars beamed brightly above, and Ida gazed up at them, as if she would fain have pierced their pure altar-fires, and sought there for the being so wildly yearned, so vainly looked for. The faint light from within might have revealed two figures near, had not her gaze been bent in another direction; but soon the murmur of their converse was heard, and an uttered name sent the blood thrilling to her heart.
                  "And so young Haughton left this morning," said one, knocking the ashes from his cigar, and breaking, what seemed to be a long pause.
                  "Yes," returned the other, rearing his chair back, and elevating his feet to the balustrade of the piazza, with true Southern nonchalance, "and time too, I think. He stayed long enough to disgrace himself."
                  "Do you think his character is generally known?"
                  
                  "Known! why he is notorious all over the White Sulphur Springs."
                  "Well, it's not so devilish bad to be a gambler, but he is a cheat to boot. He was detected in winning three thousand from that rich booby L——, by unfair means. We had no actual proofs, but every one believed it."
                  "Miss Walton," said her companion to the trembling girl beside him, "had we not better go on?"
                  "No." She stood like one in a spell. She knew that upon a stranger's ear must fall these damning falsehoods; but she must hear all.
                  "They say," resumed the first worthy, "that he is engaged to this great belle from Lower Virginia. What's her name? St. John? no"
                  "Ida Walton."
                  "Walton, that's it. I wonder if it's true?"
                  "Shouldn't be surprised. Just like women. They all have a hankering after those sort of men; they'll fret their lives out about a gambler, or roué, and when a good, honest fellow worth having turns up, they take no notice of him."
                  Compton felt the little hand tremble violently on his arm; he could discern in the faint light Ida's ashy paleness, and he said kindly, "Come, Miss Walton, this night air is too cool for you. Give no heed to such idle gossip," he could not help adding in a low tone, "it is unfit for a lady's ear, and no doubt false."
                  "False, oh! yes, false indeed!" gasped Ida with indignant energy—thinking only of the base charge against her lover. Her companion construed it differently; he thought she alluded to her engagement, and man of the world though he was, he could not distrust her tone of truth.
                  Clinging as she had never before clung to the arm of a stranger, feeling her own strength inadequate to support her, Ida reached her cabin. She heard Kate's lively tones in her mother's room adjoining, relating the events of the ball, and congratulating herself, as "Ma" did not like company, that they had such a charming chaperone as Madame D'Allure. Extinguishing the candle that was left burning, and throwing up the window, Ida leaned her head on the sill, and with the damp air stamping its cold impress on her brow—the quiet watchers of the night alone looking upon her, she gave herself up to a thousand wild conjectures, as to the origin of the slander she had heard. Hour after hour she sat thus, her eyes fixed on the far-off stars, as if she would gladly have flown to their pure depths, there to forget all sorrow and darkness evermore.
                  Light after light in the long range of cabins died out—every footstep and voice was silent, and yet she lingered. At last overcome by exhaustion, her head drooped lower, and with the wild night-wind still kissing her burning brow and a prayer on her lip, Ida Walton slumbered.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXVI.
                  IT was with a throbbing brain, and a heart almost too sick and weary to perform its task of beating, that Ida rose on the following morning; and it was not until she had laved her burning temples in cold, sparkling water, and, the duties of the toilet completed, sought the open air, and felt on her brow the wild mountain breeze, in its exhilarating freshness, that she revived.
                  "Do you feel better, this morning, darling?" said the anxious mother, as she bent over the invalid boy, and placed her cool, soft hand on his brow.
                  "Yes, mother, now that my couch is drawn near the window. How I love the free air, mother—it is my very life! I sometimes wish I was the breeze, riding over the wild sea, warming in the sunshine, lingering on the lone, beautiful mountain-tops, kissing the flowers which I am forbidden to see. Oh! mother, why am I blind? Why am I a cripple?" he added, in a sorrowful tone. "You do not know how I long for a sight of this green, beautiful earth. My spirit is as wild and free as a bird, longing, dying for action—for the glorious life and beauty which the world gives to youth and strength,—and here I am, chained day by day to a fevered couch. Mother, you do not know how my thoughts stray back to those joyous days of my childhood, when I, too, was healthful and strong; when I, too, could drink in with enraptured eyes, the glorious forms and hues of beauty. I see the far, blue mountain-heights—I see the noble river, with its dashing waves—the shining rills, the green corn and waving wheat!—and oh! mother, I come back to darkness and gloom again!"
                  "My child, my Willie, talk not thus!" said the mother, as her gentle tears fell like soft rain on his face.
                  "Mother, forgive me! but those tears dome good,—they refresh my parched heart. I have some blessings yet."
                  "Many, many, my child. Think what a talisman of love is your simple name in our household."
                  "Mother, I do think of it. I do thank God for the soothing and blessed words and deeds of love, that soften my lot. But sometimes I think I am a burden after all, and then I pray that I may go to sleep and wake with the angels. That time will come before long. Will you grieve then, mother?"
                  Her reply to this agonizing inquiry, if indeed she could have made any, was checked by the sound of Madame D'Allure's voice on the piazza.
                  She was saying to Noble, "There is no cause for regret in this."
                  The next instant she was making her graceful morning salutations to Mrs. St. John, and inquiring with tender interest after the health of the invalid. It excited no surprise to see the mother in tears by Willie's side, since his drooping health and flagging spirits warned her that the close of life's struggle might be near.
                  "Dear Noble!" said the sick boy, as his brother stooped over him. "You are always so fresh, strong, and happy. It does me good to have you come near me. My frame seems to borrow a portion of your own glad life. Were you any one else, I might be so naughty as to envy your happiness."
                  Had he seen the shadow which contracted his brother's brow as he spoke, he might have doubted the existence of such perfect happiness. Now, too, the momentary glow of the fresh morning air had faded, and his languid eye and pale cheek looked little like the Noble of the blind boy's dream.
                  Mrs. St. John was too much pre-occupied with other and more painful thoughts, to notice the change in her eldest son, which became more marked every day.
                  He colored uneasily at his brother's remark, and to evade an answer, drew a letter from his pocket.
                  "Oh! mother, here is a letter I forgot to give you yesterday."
                  Mrs. St. John looked at him reproachfully, as she recognized her husband's handwriting.
                  "When will Mr. St. John join us?" asked Madame D'Allure, as she refolded the letter.
                  
                  "Not for some weeks, I fear, if at all. He says, just now his business on the plantation is important, and he will not be able to leave as soon as he expected."
                  Kate, entering at this juncture, summoned her to Ida's room.
                  She found her daughter with her dressing-robe thrown carelessly around her, and her head bent on her hand with an air of profound and listless dejection.
                  "What is the matter with my bird, this morning?" asked Mrs. St. John, bending down and kissing her brow affectionately.
                  "Oh, mother!" was all she could say for a moment, and then the tale of slander was faltered forth. With a depth of emotion she had never before seen her show, Mrs. St. John sunk on a chair and covered her face with her hands.
                  "My God! has it come to this, at last!" were the words which burst from her lips, at length.
                  "Mother! mother! you do not believe it?" cried Ida, rising from her seat, her eyes flashing with indignant feeling.
                  "I know not, my darling," faltered her mother. "You know the reputation for wildness Cameron Haughton sustains, and who can tell where a man given to excess will stop."
                  "Mother, you must not speak thus!" cried her daughter, passionately. "I cannot bear it from your lips. I came to you for sympathy, and you, too, believe these infamous falsehoods,"—she paused, her overpowering emotions mastering her speech.
                  Mrs. St. John arose, and paced the room with unsteady step, her hand pressed to her brow to still its throbbing pain; for at that moment, Ida felt not deeper agony than that which tore her own heart. In those moments, she looked, at least, ten years older than she did in her placid hours of peace,—she seemed to bear the weight of remembered years of sorrow.
                  At last, she turned to Ida, who stood motionless, her arms folded, her eyes cast down in utter, intense mournfulness.
                  "God give you strength, my daughter!" she said in such gentle tones, that they fell like music on the ear. "God grant you, and me, too, strength for this bitter, bitter trial."
                  "Then you feel it, too, mother—you sorrow in my sorrow,—darling mother, forgive me!" and the arms of the impulsive girl were around her mother's neck, and her sobs were breathed out on the faithful bosom.
                  "Oh, God! that I could tell her all!" was the prayer which welled up from the tortured heart; "but I cannot, I dare not,—the shock would be too much for her."
                  Suffering her daughter to weep the flood-tide of emotion unchecked on her breast, Mrs. St. John breathed such words of soothing, as she could, into her ear, without offering hope of Cameron's innocence, or her own encouragement of their love, and left her.
                  "Mother, what do think of it?" inquired Kate, the first moment she found her mother alone.
                  "I know not what to say, dear Kate. This unfortunate entanglement of your sister is even a greater source of grief to me than the state of Willie. Truly, the curse is fufilled," she murmured under her breath," she is a sorrow, rather than a blessing."
                  "But," persisted Kate, "you don't think poor Cameron so bad?"
                  "'Tis a question I cannot answer, my daughter. You know his reputation for excesses. It seems a keen probe for the wound; but, perhaps, after all, it would be better if Ida could be convinced of his guilt. With respect, perhaps, love would be destroyed."
                  "But, oh! mother, 'twould be a cruel blow. Is there no hope that they may be happy yet?"
                  "None on earth. Do not let us pursue this subject farther at present; my nerves have already been too much irritated this morning."
                  Kate looked at her mother with a sort of strange, silent inquiry, and then, turning away sadly, seated herself at her escritoire to write to her father, while Mrs. St. John resumed her station by Willie.
                  He was sleeping; and it was evident, as taking the fan from the servant's hand, she swayed it gently to and fro, that her thoughts were with other, more tumultuous and sorrowing spirits, than the calm, pale face before her.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXVII.
                  WITH characteristic ease and grace, Ida entered, night after night, the ball-room at the Springs. Not a look or tone of embarrassment betrayed her knowledge that her name was intimately connected with one, upon whom, she was soon convinced, was affixed the brand of public odium. Nor did one emotion of fear or shame enter her heart at this conviction. She rather gloried in clinging closer to him in this his hour of darkness; and had she been questioned now of her love, she would, probably, have openly avowed, what, under other circumstances, might have met with a blushing denial.
                  Her position was a trying one. In spite of this report, her reputation as a belle, combined with that irresistible charm of manner, formed by the union of a heart whose impulses were all purity and generosity, with a fine and highly cultivated mind, conferred upon her a degree of distinction which necessarily brought with it much of envy. As a natural consequence, her every movement, speech, word, gesture, was canvassed, her dress criticised, and often the most malevolent constructions thrown on the most innocent actions. If she laughed gaily, it was to show her teeth; if she dressed in the brilliant mode, which became her French style of face and figure, it was "flashy;" her innocent bon mots were construed into double entendres; and many a speech made by those odious examples of our sex, "fast women," that is, women with no regard to propriety in speech or action,—those speeches which go the round of watering-places year after year, now fastened on one, then on another,—were attributed to her; and not altogether by women, for there are always men ready to discharge a volley of poisoned arrows at a woman whose position renders her in any wise conspicuous.
                  
                     Si va le monde. The path where the roses grow most luxuriantly, is also the most thickly planted with thorns. Alas! there are few who find in the cup of flattery, a Lethe for the stings of envy—and proudly unconscious as Ida seemed in public, many a chance arrow struck home which rankled 'neath the bright plumage.
                  With what delight did certain coteries linger over the rumor of her engagement with that "horrid gambler! that notorious profligate!" Even the quadroon's story was wafted on the telegraph of scandal, to the willing ears of these worthies, and the moonlight scene in the bower exaggerated into "nightly walks, clandestine meetings." And yet the very lips which gave readiest utterance to these falsehoods—oh, dear, no—not falsehoods, many of them would have fainted, no doubt—such was their Pharisaical sanctity—at the mere utterance of the word lie,—we will say reports, which these good people, doubtless, hated very much to believe; but, then, there couldn't be a doubt, "So-and-so had seen So-and-so, who had seen So-and-so, who knew So-and-so, who knew all about it,"—these very people, meeting Ida, would heap on her such expressions as "Oh! my dear Miss Walton, how do you find yourself this morning?" "Hope you enjoyed the ball?" "You were, as usual, the observed of all observers!" The haughty head would bend in a graceful bow, the red lips part, with the slightest perceptible curve of scorn, and Ida would sweep on, scarcely suppressing the contempt she felt.
                  Her best consolation was found in the truism, expressed by some clever English writer, "Abuse from the few, is the percentage we pay on popularity with the many."
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXVIII.
                  HUMAN life is made up of sad elements. Before me I have two messengers of disappointment, for trustful, hoping hearts. One is the fiat of the publishing tribunal against the poems of a young author. Perhaps for him it will be a good lesson, for most sadly does he lack that knowledge of the world, which teaches us to place the proper estimate on ourselves. But the other is to find its way to a woman's quiet chamber, darkening its loneliness with the deeper shadow of a crushed hope. If I mistake not, her heart history is a mournful one, and my eyes sadden as they rest on the calm, white missive, whose polite words convey such a sting. Well, after all, it is difficult to tell, in this world, whether the successful are the happy. I know one, par example, who has seldom courted success without winning it; and yet the crown of roses was pinioned to the young brow with thorns, and the bright leaves hid the red drops of agony—the hand, stretched eagerly to clasp the dazzling gem, grasps the firebrand instead, and, with a tortured cry, the coveted prize falls to the ground.
                  How often has the shadowed spirit, the fainting heart, yearned to wear the Martyr's crown, and relinquishing life's dearest hopes, say, pointing to heaven in the glory of beatified trust, "All with be well there." With such thoughts come repose and peace; but it lasts not long. The restless bird folds its wings but for a moment in the bower of green leaves, ere its wings are speeding far and wildly o'er the tumultous waves of Fate's stormy sea, seeking some yet fairer haven, some yet sunnier clime, never found! never found!
                  The season at the Springs flew on, for old Time kept pace with the heart-beatings of pleasure seekers. There were the usual number of morning headaches and evening flirtations, the usual number of drives, promenades, dances, and more than the usual quantity of champagne consumed, for it was a very dissipated summer, even for that dissipated place, the White Sulphur Springs of Virginia.
                  Alexander Compton, Esq., M. C. from Alabama, lord—rumor said—of broad acres and countless slaves, was the declared admirer of Ida Walton. Not to be daunted by the graceful and elegant rebuffs which silenced more sensitive youths, confident of his own powers of conquest, Alexander played the devoted during that lover's age—a fortnight—with an assiduity which drew on him remarks, and even ridicule.
                  Every one declared that it would be a match. "She would not be fool enough to discard such an offer;" and when Mr. Compton's magnificent self and dashing greys left the Springs in supreme disgust, every body declared, "It was a shame! such open encouragement, such wily manœuvres to entrap the poor fellow, just to gratify her own vanity. Well, if men would be fools enough to admire such women, it was no matter for them. Why did he not select some good, sensible girl, who would have made him a model wife, and glad of the chance?"
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXIX.
                  FRESH and sparkling, as to the thirsting lip are the beaded gems which mantle the surface of the champagne goblet, is the gush of admiration and gayety which welcomes the career of a young girl, who makes what the world calls a successful début. Pope's description of a belle in the days of our great-grandmothers would apply equally well now, with a slight alteration. In describing the chaos in which her brain might be supposed to exist, he says— 
                        
                           "Swords with sword knots strive,
                           Beaux follow beaux, and coaches, coaches drive."
                        
                     
                  
                  It is only when she has arrived at the climax of her triumphs, the culminating point of the admiration of men, and the hatred of women; when compliments, which like exotics, are prized in proportion to their rarity, have lost their zest, and unless from the lips of a favored one—and favored ones are few in the calendar of a spoiled beauty—at least if you are a favorite to-day, you are that much nearer your dethronement to-morrow—when compliments, I say, have lost their zest, and become as tasteless and vapid as stale soda-water; when love tales, from hearts whose hollowness is but too easily sounded, fall upon the sated ear, and conquests lose the charm of novelty, that she begins to ask herself,—"After all, is there nothing in life better worth the living for than this?"
                  "Is it possible," cries my incredulous reader, "that that mercurial butterfly, that composition of ribbons, gems, and perfumery, that embodiment of caprice, bearing about as her constant companion a monster of the vampire species, called vanity, which lives by extracting from warm hearts their strength, power, and sweetness, and then leaves them as remorselessly as the vampire his victim; can it be possible that a thought like the one expressed above could ever intrude on the giddy meditations of such a being?"
                  Alas, poor belles! adored by one half the men, and abused by the other,—and which, after all, is the most disastrous operation, let those, who know more about it than my humble self, determine,—scandalized by the very women who would give half their souls—if they happen to possess such an article—to occupy your position, can any one of you say your place is a sinecure?
                  It puzzles me that manœuvring mothers should make such unceasing efforts to elevate daughters—giddy-pated enough already—to a pinnacle which tries the steadiest head nature ever gave to woman.
                  While Ida was suffering from those after experiences which come only with the matured and deeper feelings of the heart, Kate was absorbed in the fresh enjoyment of her career as a débutante.
                  
                  Poor Marsden could only look on in silence.
                  No positive engagement existed between Miss St. John and himself, for to this her father objected, until "Kate had seen something more of society."
                  In the delightful solitude of Huntingwild, where, like the habitants of Eden, they lived in an atmosphere redolent of affection, hope, and joy, he could well be content with his fate. But in the world of temptation, frivolity, and dissipation, which now unceasingly occupied her thoughts, and bore them on with its giddy whirl whether she would or not, it was a different thing.
                  There was no solitary walk, no yearned-for privacy, no broken words of whispered tenderness now. There was always an engagement to walk with Mr. Such-a-one, or to ride with somebody else, or half a dozen cards were handed just as he seated himself by her side.
                  "If she were only like Ida, who seemed glad oftentimes of an excuse to retire from some gay scene, or feigned headache to escape a ball."
                  He ought to have remembered that Ida was not the mere girl, for whose follies her extreme youth offered the readiest apology. She was sufficiently matured in years and judgment to look rationally upon life, and while attaching but momentary importance to its frivolous pursuits, search its depths for the thoughts and feelings, deep and pure, which make up the sum of human happiness. She had learned, perhaps prematurely, that the sweetest drop in pleasure's cup is the one which conveys the poison.
                  To Kate, every ball was an era. Her gloves, her dress, her coiffure, objects of the most absorbing attention and study. Her conquests carefully noted down. "If Fan, her dear friend and confidante, had only been there! How delightful it would have been to compare notes!"
                  He began to doubt if ever she had cared for him. It seemed to him now that she was only desirous to rid herself of his presence. He knew there were times when she might have avoided other engagements for his sake, but she showed no inclination to do so.
                  Gradually his attentions ceased. He avoided looking towards her when they met in the ball-room. He was no longer her companion in ride or stroll. Kate returned this estrangement with interest. There was Frank Lawton, with his black eyes, his faultless toilet, his beautiful horses, and his reputation for a hundred thousand, who was ever ready to fill the place of Marsden, and she flirted with him in due proportion, particularly when Arthur was in sight or hearing.
                  "Take heed, Kate," said Ida, "the roses you gather now may plant thorns in your heart hereafter. You love Arthur Marsden, as you cannot deny. If you don't take care you will lose him through your own folly, and what are all these petty triumphs in comparison with the feelings of the man you love."
                  "La! Sis, how you do talk! just as if you never flirted! Arthur is so strange, and has such queer ways. I am not engaged to him, and if I were, I don't see why I should be tied to one man all the time, and never speak to any body else. It is time enough to do that when I am married. I don't believe I shall ever marry Arthur, for it seems to me the breach widens every day between us. I think I should fail in proper spirit, were I to treat him otherwise than I do."
                  There was a smile on Kate's lip, but her eyes filled imperceptibly with tears. Ida saw that a thorn rankled beneath the sparkling surface, but she patted her sister's cheek playfully, as she exclaimed, "Saucy, giddy Kate!" though a moment afterwards she added seriously: "My darling sister, believe me this Lawton is not worth a thought. He is a young man belonging to a class of which you find numerous specimens at every fashionable watering-place. He will attach himself to your train, and pay you the most assiduous attention as long as it suits his amusement or convenience, that is, until he succeeds in driving some true-hearted honest lover from the field, or begins to fear that papa and mamma are wondering what his intentions are, when he will fly off in search of other triumphs, and with vaunting boasts ridicule the 'charming creature' who suffered herself to be so easily gulled."
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXX.
                  A WEEK or two afterward, Ida one morning found Kate seated pensively in the little back porch of the cottage. There was a small grass-plot around it, and a few old-fashioned, but sweet flowers, whose odor was borne refreshingly on the cool breeze. The morning was beautiful; the air, as we have said, fine. Madame D'Allure's pet, Fidele, gambolled, and made sundry efforts to attract Kate's attention; the sunlight wove golden and diamond gems in her shining hair; but neither Fidele or flower, or breeze or sunlight, roused Kate from her reverie.
                  Ida's light touch on her shoulder startled her.
                  "Is it you, Sis?" she said, without turning her head.
                  "Yes, you are sad this morning, Kate. Will you not tell me why? It is pleasant to confide, and perhaps I may be able to recall your smiles."
                  Kate paused a moment. She was not naturally very communicative, but her thoughts had reached that climax, when they must either be forced back, to smoulder painfully on her heart, or relieve themselves by a confession.
                  "Sister, Arthur is very much offended with me; I know he must be. Read that," and she took a note from her bosom, and handed it to her sister, who recognized in the agitated scrawl, Marsden's handwriting.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "I leave the Springs this afternoon, but cannot go without saying one word of adieu. I feel that the remembrance of the few words of tenderness which have ever passed between us, is painful to you—or perhaps irksome, would be the better word—for there can be no union between pain and indifference. Do not suffer any imaginary tie of honor to bind you to one who would sacrifice any thing for your welfare. Be happy with the man who has supplanted me (if indeed I was ever so fortunate as to possess them) in your affections.
                              
                                 A. M."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  "Did any thing pass between you and Arthur last night?"
                  "Why, nothing; except that he came up near the close of the evening, and asked me if I could not see him, this morning alone. I could have done so very well, but he had not been near me before the whole evening, so I answered with what I thought becoming spirit, that it was out of my power, as I had promised to go driving with Mr. Lawton, and I expected that would consume the morning. Well, he frowned like a brigand and turned off, muttering something at which Frank, who had just joined me, laughed quite insolently I thought, though I joined in it for effect; and not satisfied with that revenge, I waltzed and polka'd all the remainder of the evening with him, just to show Arthur that I didn't care."
                  "You have done all this yourself, darling."
                  
                  "Oh, sister! how can you say so! I would never have believed Arthur could have been so cold, false, and cruel."
                  "Hush!" interrupted her sister, pressing her hand lightly on her lips. "You do not feel this, and it is not right to speak so. Have you answered this note?"
                  "No," said Kate, now fairly sobbing, "he does not even ask an answer, and what can I say? If I write coldly and indifferently, I belie my own heart, and do you think I would stoop to call him back?"
                  Ida paused a moment in thought, and then sought her own room followed by Kate.
                  Arrived there, she opened her escritoire, and wrote hastily.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "Dear Mr. Marsden,—Will you give me half an hour of your time if not particularly engaged? I desire very much to see you.
                              
                                 Your friend,
                                 IDA."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  Kate was looking over her shoulder.
                  "I declare, Sis, you shall not send that," and she tried, but not very forcibly, to detach it from her grasp. "You would not make such a concession, nor will I."
                  "Go away, Kate, I know what I am about," and she calmly enveloped the card, directed it to—Arthur Marsden, Esq.,—rung for a servant and despatched it.
                  "Hi!" said Miranda, entering at the moment, "Mass' Arthur gwine away. I come by his room just now, and he got all his trunks packed, and his room in the greatest litter and confusion. I hear him ask Mass' Delham take a parting drink, and a mighty big drink it was too. Dear me, how these gentleman does go on.
                  "Miss Kate, I 'spect you got something to do with this, now, ain't you? Well, 'man is born to trouble like unto the sparks in the chimbley,' so the Holy Scriptur say."
                  At this juncture, the waiter returned with Marsden's answer.
                  "It will give me pleasure to obey your request, I shall wait upon you in a half hour."
                  Kate could not repress the gleam of hope which lighted up her countenance, though she said petulantly,
                  "Well, you may say any thing you please, but he shall find that I have a proper sense of my own dignity."
                  Ida smiled mischievously.
                  "Mr. Lawton waits, ma'am," said Antony, presenting himself with a card.
                  "Oh, sister! what shall I do! I can't ride with that odious fellow."
                  "Hush, Kate! Antony, ask Mr. Lawton in the parlor. Will you break your engagement?" she continued, after the servant was out of hearing.
                  "Yes, any thing to be rid of him."
                  "Why, I thought some time ago, you had neither eyes, nor ears for any one else."
                  "Oh, sister! why will you talk so provokingly? You know I never cared a straw for him; I only did it to tease Arthur, and now that it has caused so much trouble between us, I almost hate him. I have a terrible headache, and am going to lie down and try to get a little sleep," and Kate tossed herself on the bed, and buried her bright head in the pillows.
                  "Then, I suppose I must make your excuses," replied her sister, slightly adjusting her morning dress, and proceeding to the parlor. "My sister is a little indisposed this morning, Mr. Lawton, and hopes you will excuse her," was her apology to the perfumed and mustachioed exquisite, who was eagerly waiting Kate's entrance. Mr. Lawton was immensely sorry, hoped Miss Kate would accept the flowers he had brought, offered an exquisite bouquet, bowed himself out—jumped into his buggy—gave the lash to his blood horses, and consoled himself by taking out, Miss Camille Letrea, the dashing Creole heiress, from Louisiana.
                  Ida awaited Marsden. He entered with a flush on his cheek, and a slight agitation perceptible in his movements, spite of his attempts to conceal it.
                  "Mr. Marsden," said Ida, addressing him, with her usual bland sweetness, and without any reserve or embarrassment, "you and Kate are making yourselves very miserable for nothing."
                  Marsden started, and flushed still deeper; but allured to confidence by his knowledge of the character of her he addressed, he seated himself on the sofa beside her, and said, in a low tone—
                  "I am going to leave, Miss Ida, as I suppose you know. It is solely because I think my absence will be a relief to Kate—Miss St. John I ought to say now, perhaps,—and because I cannot endure the torture of seeing her smiles bestowed on another. It is evident she no longer cares for me."
                  "Pshaw! Arthur, you do not understand women. A girl is almost as apt to avoid the man she loves, as the man she hates. She is fearful lest every eye should read her secret, lest the preciously-hoarded treasure of her heart should become the idle theme of every gossip's tongue. Kate is light and thoughtless," she added, thinking of the flirtation with Lawton; "but she would not intentionally wound you. She thinks you have acted coldly towards her."
                  "I—cold! good heavens!"
                  "Well, it only shows how adroitly you have contrived to torture each other, with the most harmless motives."
                  "Answer me only one question. Does Kate love—does she even cherish any regard for me?"
                  "If your own heart is unchanged, do not tremble for hers."
                  "Dear Ida, what a sweet, kind friend you are, so frank and courageous," said Marsden, clasping her hand fervently, while his whole face was illuminated with sudden light. "Can I see Kate, now?"
                  "No. She fancies her pride somewhat wounded, and might behave foolishly. Besides she is a little indisposed, and had better remain quiet. Shall I say you wish to see her this evening, and hope she will make no other engagement?"
                  "Yes, any thing you think proper. I will trust all to you."
                  "Very well, all shall be right," she responded, with a smile which made her resemble in the lover's eyes the angel of Hope.
                  And all was right.
                  Now, my dear young lady, or gentleman reader, as the case may be, I wish you to draw your own moral from this little history of Kate's troubles. An explanation is often-times the only safe bridge over the gulf of estrangement which loving hearts yearn, and yet will not venture to pass; and it is not every one who has a kind friend to volunteer the task of making it.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XXXI.
                  "KATE," said Noble, coming in with shadowed brow one morning, holding a roll of music in his hand, and apparently relieved to find his sister alone, "sing this song for me."
                  Kate took the music from his hand, and placed it upon the piano before her. It had come through the post-office, and she had stubborn creases to smooth out. As her eyes glanced over the words, she said, quickly, "Noble, where does this come from?"
                  "The handwriting is strange," he replied, "and the postmark I cannot make out, but—"
                  "Your own conscience tells you who it is," finished his sister, with a look of gentle reproof.
                  He said nothing; but his face was very sad, as he leaned his head on his hand, and waited silently for the song.
                  Kate ran over the prelude, and sang a sweet, touching air to the mournful words. 
                        
                           Thou canst not forget me, though fortune may cast
                           A light o'er thy pathway unknown to the past;
                           Tho' beauty may weave her enchantments for thee,
                           Fond memory's dream will still whisper of me.
                        
                        
                           Thou canst not forget me, in Pleasure's gay hall,
                           Though thou art the idol, the courted of all.
                           The sweet tones of woman shall fall on thy ear
                           No more with the magic which once was so dear.
                        
                        
                           And when 'mid the joyous, the fair, and the young,
                           Thy soul shall be thrilled by the magic of song,
                           The present shall fade like the mist of the morn,—
                           Once more thou wilt live in the days that are gone.
                        
                        
                           Thou canst not forget me, in sorrow's lone hour,
                           When 'paled is the light that once burned in thy bower;'
                           And fears for the future their dark shadows cast
                           Before thee, then sadly thou'lt think of the past.
                        
                        
                           Thou'lt think of the young heart, so cruelly tried—
                           The heart thou hast robbed of all refuge, but pride.
                           Yes, strive as thou wilt, cruel one, to forget—
                           Mine image shall haunt thee, and torture thee yet.
                        
                     
                  
                  As the low, mournful cadence of Kate's trembling voice died away, Noble rose and paced the floor hurriedly.
                  "'Tis from her, from Fannie, I know," he said, huskily; and turning suddenly upon his sister, "Oh! Kate, what a heartless villain I have proven to the truest, purest heart that ever beat with the throbs of virgin love. Would that I could go to her now, and revoke all; but she would not receive me; she would cast me from her with the scorn I deserve, and then,"—a pause,—"it is too late."
                  The image of the enchantress rose up before him. It seemed to beckon him on, and he had no power to resist. On, on—where? Did the vision of a precipice, crowned with flowers, flash on the boy's brain? Perchance so, for his brow grew dark with a deeper shadow, and he covered his face with his hands.
                  Kate laid her hand gently on his arm.
                  "Is then all indeed over between you and Fannie?"
                  "All, Kate! She freed me, but it was from my own wish."
                  Kate said nothing, but the look in her eyes told her brother all she could not express in words.
                  "I feel your reproach, though it is a silent one," he said. "Would to heaven I could make the amende honorable, but that is impossible."
                  
                  "Why impossible?" said his sister, imploringly. "Oh, Noble, Fannie is so gentle, so good,—she will forgive you; and you must love her, else why this shadow which seems to have rested upon you ever since your first alienation, even in thought."
                  "No, no,—you judge wrongly; you think better of me than I deserve. It is from other causes,"—he paused, daring not to reveal to his sister the truth.
                  "Noble, my brother, is not your sister worthy of your confidence? If you have any other cause for sorrow, Noble, dear Noble, tell me what it is. It seems so strange, you, who have been so frank, so joyous,—a change has come upon you, and you will not reveal even to your sister the cause."
                  Conquering the struggle at his heart, he turned away.
                  "There are annoyances which it would be improper for you to know, sister, but none that cannot be easily overcome."
                  And ere she could question him further, he was gone.
                  Alas for the evil influence of the artful and fascinating, over the young and thoughtless. When Madame D'Allure found Noble St. John, scarce three months before, he was in the flush and strength of youth, just merging into unsullied manhood; frank, joyous, and generous, not a dishonorable thought ever crossed his mind, not a falsehood sullied his lip. Now, behold the change! Hours robbed of sleep far into the night, have turned the cheek's freshness to a fevered glow; the wine-cup, the blasphemous oath, to him have become familiar things; lost to the pure love of his youth, daring not to reveal to those nearest and dearest the course into which he has been almost imperceptibly drawn; conscience ever lulled in its struggles by the voice of the charmer—are not the seeds of ruin planted in his heart? And he, the pride of the household, the heir of one of Virginia's oldest, proudest names. How has he fallen? Alas! "'tis an old tale, and often told."
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXXII.
                  THAT night in the ball-room, Kate's anxious eyes sought out her brother. He was not dancing at the time, and other bright eyes besides her own, were searching anxiously for the rich and popular Noble St. John. We may be well assured, that before this period thoughtful mammas had whispered: "He is a catch, dear—such a good family, and then, rich too, and so well brought up." And daughters' hearts throbbed a response under muslin and satin folds. "And then, so handsome! and waltzes and polkas so divinely! Well, if he were to propose, there is no telling what would happen."
                  We all pursue that which is beyond our reach. If Golconda's gems were poured at our feet, we would sigh after a worthless stone if it happened to be unattainable.
                  Noble was standing in the crowd, his arms folded, his kindled soul in his eyes, as they were literally fastened on Madame D'Allure, unconscious of all beside. Kate involuntarily felt affrighted at the gaze. It was not the look of affection—timid, though happy in its offering, which she had met in Marsden's eyes; it was not the glance of earnest feeling, the world of soul-thought with which she had seen the wondrous eyes of Haughton radiate light upon her sister; it was the untamed expression of an all-absorbing emotion, the more devouring in its infatuation, that it was uncertain of return. It reminded Kate of the spell-bound gaze with which she had seen patients, under the influence of mesmerism, follow every movement of the mesmerizer. Her pure nature rose up in contradiction of such thoughts; but try as she would to banish it, a vague suspicion hung over her spirit, like a light cloud, all the evening.
                  "Could Noble dare to cherish a passion for a married woman?" she could not help asking herself, "and could Madame D'Allure permit—but no, that was impossible! 'All young men were wicked,' mamma said; but Madame D'Allure, oh, no! she could not be guilty of such imprudence."
                  "I don't know," thought Kate, as her little head turned restlessly on its pillow that night; "but it seems to me, if Monsieur D'Allure would return, and pa would only come, then things might be better; but as it is, every thing goes wrong. And poor Fannie!"
                  She felt as if she had turned over a new leaf in the history of life, and was studying out its first hieroglyphics. At length Fannie's sad song, Noble's fascinated gaze, and Madame D'Allure's winning grace in the waltz, floated in confused mass through her brain, and she slept.
                  Madame D'Allure, too, saw Noble's gaze, and it annoyed her. She had forbidden him to pay her marked attention—"ill-natured people might misconstrue it;" and now she feared that looks might create suspicion.
                  But this was one of those retributive consequences not easily to be avoided, in which wrong often recoils upon itself. A diplomatic thought struck her, and beckoning Noble to her side, by a slight gesture, she begged him to pay some attention to a young lady who looked quite forlorn, no one having paid her any attention during the evening. "And mind, don't look this way, and talk absently, making the poor girl think you are acting from compassion."
                  With a glance of admiration for "her kindness of heart," Noble flew to obey her behest, only pausing occasionally in his assiduous devotion to the pleased young girl, to meet a look of approval. But that look was not given; Madame D'Allure had no idea of betraying an understanding, and she seemed wholly absorbed in the converse of the handsome and brilliant Col. Carleton, one of the lady-killers of the day, with whom she waltzed and waltzed till it it seemed to Noble's frenzied eyes she never would cease; at last, retiring into a convenient recess, where she seemed absorbed in a most engrossing conversation.
                  For several days she had been carrying on what every body pronounced "a decided flirtation," with the gallant Carleton, glorying in being able to chain to her triumphal car, a victim for whom so many hearts were sighing.
                  For the first time in his life, all the latent jealousy in Noble's nature was aroused, aggravated, perhaps, by the excitement of several glasses of champagne. Making an excuse of sudden indisposition to the young girl beside him, he rushed out to the piazza, and thence to the bar-room. There swallowing a foaming goblet, he returned to the piazza, and walked impatiently to and fro, his brow burning as with livid fire, and the blood boiling like liquid lightning in his veins.
                  After a half-hour's promenade he returned to the ball-room, to accompany Madame D'Allure to her cabin, giving Kate in charge of Marsden.
                  The cloud was on his brow, and the storm in his eyes, as he coldly offered his arm.
                  Pooh! what was that to her? she knew how to manage him. They walked to the cabin in silence. At the door, as Noble was about to offer a sullen good-night, she detained him gently, with—
                  "Noble, what is the matter?"
                  He merely answered by the monosyllable "Nothing."
                  "I know there is something," and the Circe tones grew softer; "will you not tell Victorine?"
                  
                  The suppressed fire burst forth.
                  "Victorine, swear to me, that 'tis your honor, your duty to vows already formed that forbid you to answer my love. Swear to me that at least you love no other."
                  "Noble, Noble, do not tempt me." The brown curls drooped so low that the head touched his shoulder, and the jewelled hand extended was pressed passionately, with over-powering ecstasy to his lips. Fearing to trust himself further, he leaped with one bound, from the steps to the ground, and was gone.
                  With what a mocking smile Madame D'Allure turned from the door.
                  "Poor, blind, infatuated boy!" Base, artful woman! better his place, than yours. Could you see now, as you unbraid the jewels from your tresses, and gaze upon the form, where time and dissipation have already commenced their work, smiling triumphantly, as you murmur, "'Tis the power of the mind, the will, not of beauty." Could you see the thunderbolt in the distance, how wildly would you pray to an avenging God to avert the shock.
                  That night Noble's guitar and rich voice floated into Madame D'Allure's cabin,—he, however, having stationed himself, for the sake of appearances, at the window of a Southern belle, who was drinking in the strains with gratified vanity.
                  It was the song which the Italian minstrel sung to as beautiful, but we would fain hope, a less faulty woman than the D'Allure—"Queen of my soul, with starlit eyes."
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXXII.
                  "WHY did you not let me know you were going to ride?" asked Kate, from the open window, as Noble and Madame D'Allure passed under it. Her snowy plumes and bright curls danced in the light breeze, and her smiles were bright as the summer morning, as she answered,—
                  "I wished to do so, but Noble said one of your favored cavaliers had arranged something more pleasant,—perhaps a ramble to the haunted forest, or a visit to some spring, meet to be a fairy fountain. I am very sorry, if you wished to go. Au revoir," and kissing the tips of her gloved fingers, she dashed gaily on—perchance to death!
                  What is there so glorious, so exhilarating, as a ride on horseback, with the proper accompaniments? The joyousness with which you drink into your very being the freshness and strength of the pure air; the consciousness of power over the noble steed which bears you onward. Ah! it is indeed one of life's few, simple, and unhackneyed enjoyments.
                  Their ride was long, for the glorious morning sun, lighting up scenery beautiful as the far-famed vales and hills of Switzerland, would alone have been sufficient to tempt them to linger. Now cantering over a level stretch of greensward, now winding slowly through some dark, romantic ravine, miles were passed unheedingly.
                  Their talk was not of love,—this the Frenchwoman, as an ordinary topic, would not permit. Love, in plain words, (always excepting Noble's outbursts), was never mentioned between them. She feared the boy's dream would lose its sweetness, were it permitted to flow unrepressed in ordinary channels. She knew, too, that a few months of error had not effaced early impressions, so as to deaden him to the consciousness of wrong in such a proceeding; therefore, to permit it would finally be to weaken the charm of their intercourse, and she had her own reasons—as we have seen—for continuing him the slave of her will. These motives accomplished, he might be dropped as carelessly as a hundred others.
                  Still there was a sort of approach to Love's enchanted bower, which only made it seem fairer in the distance; an interchange of thoughts, a communion of feeling, which, though it was the merest tissue of art on one side, was bewildering, and dreamily delicious, on the other.
                  Noble was not an ordinary youth, on the contrary, his abilities were very fair, his accomplishments numerous. With the exception of Cameron Haughton, whose feats of horsemanship, in some instances, approached the terrible, I never saw a more perfect rider; a capital shot, inimitable in ball-room graces; a gay and agreeable converser, with flashes, at times, of Ida's wit and poetry, and much of Kate's genius for music, he was generally considered a very accomplished young gentleman; in fact, quite irresistible to those young ladies who had seen or heard of the lordly domain of Huntingwild.
                  But these accomplishments, though well enough in their way, were not such as fitted him to cope with the consummate tact and talent of the woman beside him. Of course, he never felt her superiority,—trust her for that,—he only thought of her as the most lovely and fascinating of human beings, rendered unhappy by a marriage de convenance, which she, after the usual fashion of French damsels, had no power to obviate.
                  And then, her truth, her gentle and affectionate manner to her husband, notwithstanding the circumstances, was so commendable. Admirable woman! Many a man, far Noble's senior in years and experience, might have flattered himself on his judgment in selecting such a paragon for his dream-idol.
                  "Do you not think we have come very far?" she said at length, in her pretty French accent, and pausing suddenly.
                  "Shouldn't be surprised if we had," Noble replied, like one aroused from a dream. "Yes," he added, looking up to where the god of day showered diamond beams upon them, "from the sun it is past mid-day, and my watch says, four o'clock."
                  "Well, I am not so ethereal as to disclaim an appetite altogether, and I am really afraid we have a bad prospect for a dinner at the Springs."
                  "I fear so too. By the way, a week or two ago, when hunting, I stopped for a drink of water at a very neat little cottage, not far from this very spot. The woman pressed me to alight, as she very feelingly remarked, 'I seemed so heated and tired,' and gave me a very nice lunch. Let us go there now, it will be a nice resting place for us, and I fear you are tired."
                  "That will be charming. Quite a romantic adventure, too, to tell Ida and Kate. Lead on, Sir Knight, I'll follow."
                  They soon reached the cottage. It was a model of neatness, though rude and rustic in its finish; but that had its peculiar charm, in such a wild, romantic landscape.
                  "Noble called quite familiarly, "Mrs. Bonny!" but no one answered. "She has gone out for a moment, probably. Do you wish to alight?"
                  "Yes, for I am almost fainting for a glass of water, or some refreshment, and begin to feel quite conscious of fatigue."
                  
                  "It is my fault," said Noble, remorsefully, and assisting her tenderly to dismount.
                  They wound their way through gay labyrinths of damask roses, hollyhocks, and marigolds, to the cottage door, inhaling the odor of sweet shrubs and balm of Gilead.
                  Their rap at the door was answered by one of those white-haired, white-eyed, white-faced specimens of plebeian juvenility, which seem to be a kind of growth indigenous to the soil of mountain huts.
                  She seemed, however, very polite, in her simple way; invited them to come in, and wiped out a chair with her apron, as she handed it to Madame D'Allure.
                  "Is your mother not in?" asked that lady, graciously.
                  "Mrs. Bonny, you mean? She ain't my mother, but she's went out for a spell. I reckon she'll be in before long. Take off your things," contemplating Madame D'Allure's hat and plumes with intense admiration.
                  "Thank you, no; will you be so kind as to give me a glass of water?"
                  "Yes, I'll bring some fresh," and taking the cimblin gourd and oaken bucket, she dashed off to the spring.
                  Madame D'Allure glanced around the room. It was simply, but neatly furnished. Lying on the bed, as if for its mid-day siesta, was a sleeping child, about three years old. A chance sunbeam nestled in the profuse golden curls, tossed back from its brow, giving them a halo-like brightness. The long lashes slept on a cheek, rivalling in hue the richest damask rose, and the lips, too, were scarlet. The features were as perfect as any thing earthly could be, and Madame D'Allure could not help exclaiming—
                  "Oh, Noble! did you ever see any thing so beautiful? What a likeness to Raphael's infant St. John!"
                  Noble echoed the sentiment, and it seemed to him, that there was something unearthly, something approaching our conception of the angels, in its beauty.
                  Moved by a feeling she could not resist, Madame D'Allure bent down and pressed her lips to the little burning mouth. She inhaled its fevered breath. A sudden faintness seized her. "Good heaven!" she cried, "how warm the child is. The air, too, of this room is stifling. Don't you feel it, Noble?"
                  "A little," he replied. "But you feel faint from fatigue. Here comes the water, at last, and Mrs. Bonny, too."
                  That lady entered the next moment. A cleanly, respectable-looking matron, but with an expression of great anxiety in her comely face.
                  "I am glad to see you, sir," she said, extending her hand to Noble, "and this lady, too. How do you do, Madam? I hope you are well?" Madame D'Allure extended the tips of her daintily-gloved fingers.
                  "I jest stepped out for a minute, to yet some yarbs for the child, from Mrs. Sellin, who's amazin' knowin' about doctor's stuff. I didn't like to leave him, but I knowed Betsey, here, would never ask for the right thing. She's been bound to me these three years, and I ain't never learned her to carry a message yet."
                  She walked to the child, bent over it, and wiped the tears from her eyes, with her checked apron,
                  "Poor little, blessed, beautiful thing!"
                  "Is the child sick?" asked Madame D'Allure, changing color.
                  "Lor, yes! it's the scarlet fever. I don't believe it's ever going to get well, either. I know'd it was too good, and too beautiful for this world. I had another went jest the same way. He's been complaining, you see, these three days, and comin' puttin' his head in my lap, and sayin', 'Mother, my head hurts so;' but I jest thinks it was worms, and give him some worm-seed, which is monstrous good, stewed in molasses, for children; but to-day he come in most faintin', and got in my lap, and moaned himself to sleep. I wouldn't ondress him, thinkin' it might aggravate him, and laid him down here. He's sleepin' mighty sweet now; but I've got no hope—scarlet fever is sich a dreadful disease. I never know'd many people to get well of it. Ah! poor me, this is a sad world, specially for a poor, lonely widder."
                  Madame D'Allure was out of hearing. As soon as scarlet fever was announced, she bounded from the house, with a step singularly in contrast with her usual languid grace of movement. Noble had gone to secure her horse, which had freed itself, and was leisurely cropping grass, at a little distance.
                  "Good heavens, Noble! the child has the scarlet fever! What if we were to take it?"
                  "Don't speak of any thing so terrible. My God! to think I took you there."
                  When Madame D'Allure dismounted from her horse, at her cabin door, she felt completely exhausted—but after partaking of some substantial refreshment, as well as a delicious ice, sent by Noble, with a glass or two of wine, she took her evening siesta, and arose feeling much refreshed.
                  It did occur to her, as she dressed herself for the ball, that it might be better to remain quiet for the evening—perhaps there was danger, and she had been indulging in dissipation to a degree which amounted to imprudence, for the last week;—but her fears were diverted by the entrance of Kate, in fine spirits, with a glowing description of the day's enjoyment.
                  "Quite a pic-nic party—such delightful rambles, over hill and dale, and such a beautiful spot they found, where they dined in true gypsy style—the iced champagne was delicious, and Colonel Carleton," added Kate, with a mischievous smile," was perfectly devoted to me, all day long."
                  That was enough. Madame D'Allure thought she detected an incipient desire in the lady-killer, to transfer his attentions to the sprightly, blooming Kate, in which idea she was confirmed, by some reports in regard to the exhausted state of his finances. But that would not do. She had staked her reputation on his conquest. So kissing Kate, in reply, and mentioning nothing, strange to say, about the occurrences of the morning, she arrayed herself in her most brilliant robes. Kate thought she had never seen her look so enchanting, as when she entered the ball-room. Her triumph was complete; not only was the Colonel chained to her side for the evening, but a perfect buzz of homage, greater even than usual, followed in her footsteps—and she received it as a gracious queen might receive the homage of her subjects.
                  Noble thought, once or twice, as his eyes followed her wherever she went, that she looked restless, and her eyes were strangely bright. The glow on lip and cheek, too, was more than the delicate hue which art generally gave her. It rivalled the bloom of the fevered child.
                  The ball was at its height—the brass band storming at its loudest pitch—flying feet keeping time, with an almost crazed velocity—flirtations, and champagne-drinking, progressing at a furious rate—when Ida heard Madame D'Allure say to Colonel Carleton, as she flew past in the waltz, "Stop! stop! I feel faint!"
                  "Oh, no! not yet; one more turn." The next instant there was a shriek of pain, and she fainted in the arms of her partner.
                  Of course, there was a general confusion, exclamations, hurrying for restoratives, etc., and, in the midst of it, the inanimate form was borne, in the arms of Noble (he had taken her almost forcibly from Colonel Carleton), from the ball-room.
                  He was bending over her, having laid her on the bed in Kate's cabin which happened to be the nearest, giving vent to the most distracted exclamations, when Ida and Kate entered with restoratives, followed by several other persons. He continued, frantically, unheeding the presence of witnesses, "She is dying. It is that fever; and, Oh! God, I carried her into it. Victorine, my beautiful! my beloved! speak to me, look upon me!" "Brother," said Kate, as Ida bathed her brow and lips, "Brother, be silent, you forget yourself," and she glanced around the room. There was a simple majesty in her look and tone, almost a sternness of command, so unusual, that it recalled him to himself.
                  He arose, and stood with folded arms, silent and despairing, by the bedside. "Fresh air! fresh air! for mercy's sake?" continued Kate, and taking the hint, the room was cleared. The swoon was long, but at length the weary eyes unclosed. "Water!" she gasped "for God's sake, water! There is a fire here," and she pressed her hand to her brow.
                  All that weary night, the sisters watched by the couch of the fevered and delirious sufferer, while Noble, forbidden to remain, wandered about the grounds, in a state bordering on distraction, returning, at intervals, to catch a glance, or learn the progress of her illness.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXXIII.
                  THROUGH the weary watches of that long night, words burst from the lips of the sufferer, in the moments of frantic delirium, of such wild and strange import, that the sisters held their breath, and clung to each other with an unspoken fear; a vague, terrible suspicion, throwing its baleful light over the past three months.
                  "Poor Noble! poor, infatuated boy," she would rave. "Oh! Auguste, it is a pity to tempt him so. His ruin may be upon our souls! Nay, do not frown, you know I will not falter, no, not on the brink of hell itself, if you beckon me on. See! see! does he not owe you thousands? 'Tis my glance, my smile, which has won them, and you are not grateful, you will not love me. Auguste! Auguste! where are you? I am dying! my brain is on fire! my heart is bursting! and you are not near me." The ravings, at length, would die in a low, sorrowful moan, like the lull of a tempest, which would last, perhaps, a half hour, and then, as if she had gathered fresh strength, she would start up again, calling wildly for "Auguste!" her eyes glaring with the fearful fire of the tyrant fever.
                  "Auguste! save me; fiends are around me! see how they jeer and scoff! I see the suicide's face glaring upon me, in its death-agony—I see young Thornton cursing you, as the desolator of his hearth and home—cursing you with the broken heart of a mother, with a sister's blighted life—with his own degraded youth. Away! away! ye phantoms! blast me not." And then for the first time the, to her, fearful name of God was uttered, as she prayed to be stricken with blindness, that appalling visions, which glared before her, might be shut out.
                  
                  "Alas! for her. No blindness could shut from the soul, whose hell had already commenced, the harrowing visions of remorse.
                  With an awed silence the sisters watched through the lone night, broken only by those fearful sounds; their eyes revealing to each other the thoughts which had sprung to life within them.
                  All the professional skill of the physician who shared their watch, was powerless to soothe the fever. Nay, she shrunk from him, put away every draught offered her, with a fury, impossible to overcome, save with physical force, and this he thought it dangerous to employ.
                  Finding the endeavor vain to induce the two girls to leave her side, he contented himself with diffusing through the room the odor of a powder, used as a preventive, and, apparently accustomed to such scenes, dozed with enviable quietude in the arm-chair.
                  "Aunt Miranda! awake! awake!" said Ida, endeavoring to arouse their own attendant, from her sound slumbers.
                  It was the early peep of day, which often dawns cold and damp, even in mid-summer, in our mountainous regions. Ida had just left the couch of the invalid, and pale with watching, shivered with cold, as she bent over the recumbent form of the nurse.
                  After sundry shakes and calls, just as she was about to give up in despair, Aunt Miranda condescended to be cognizant of the existence of this real world by starting up with—"Hi, honey! what you doin' here, dis time in the mornin'?"
                  "Get up and dress quickly, Aunt Mirry—Madame D'Allure is very ill—didn't you hear of her fainting in the ball-room last night."
                  "Lor' bless your soul, honey, no. I had a misery in the back, and Missis' tell me to go 'long to bed, and not set up for you all," said the negro, now fairly aroused. "What's the matter with her?"
                  "Scarlet fever. Kate and I have watched all night beside her."
                  "Why in the 'varsal world didn't you call me,"—springing up and donning her garments in a jiffy, not forgetting the everlasting turban. "You know I'se better able to stand settin' up than you is; and den you don't know a thing 'bout nursin', and I is counted the best nurse in the country, at home—'sides I know thing 'bout the fever—I reckon I does—I had it the wuss sort. Go 'long to bed chile. I'll have Madame Lores up, in no time,"—and off she bustled, while Ida turned her weary footsteps to her own room, which Kate had already sought.
                  "Ida!" "Kate," were the ominous words which escaped the lips of the sisters, as they found themselves alone.
                  Kate had undressed, and was in bed; but she rose halfway, and gazed into Ida's face, with a sort of fearful inquiry. Ida seated herself on the bed, and they folded their hands in each other's, and bent their heads near together, speaking in low tones.
                  "Ida, there was the key to a fearful mystery in her words last night, and Noble, our brother, is connected with it. You do not know how I have watched him of late—you have been absorbed in your own grief; mother in watching over Willie—but I, oh! I have seen the change in Noble, which, when I questioned him, he would still deny. Our brother is not what he was, and it is, it must be, the influence of these people."
                  "God grant, that we have not been fearfully deceived in them," responded Ida, as the thought of her own unlimited confidence in her "friend," crossed her mind.
                  
                  "And yet after all, 'tis only the ravings of delirium," continued Kate, in a tone of self-reproval.
                  "The ravings of delirium, Kate, reveal secrets, which the rational brain trusts not to the light of day."
                  "But, how is it? Noble is entangled in some way—I feel, I am convinced now, that he is infatuated with Madame D'Allure; a married woman! How could he fall thus? But then these allusions to losses, I do not understand."
                  "Nor I, Kate, but I suspect. What if D'Allure be a gambler! What if our brother has been drawn in the toils, and dare not reveal it to his family? It is evident, you say, that he has some secret." She spoke with a fearful sort of forced calmness.
                  A low cry burst from Kate.
                  "My God! if it should be so. But let us hope for the best, until our suspicions are confirmed. Shall we tell mamma all this?"
                  "Yes, Kate, we must tell her all. Of whom can we take counsel but of our mother? It was best not to arouse her last night; but she must not, nay, she cannot be kept in ignorance longer."
                  "Poor mamma! I glanced in at her this morning when I came in. She was sleeping so peacefully, so unconscious of our fearful vigil."
                  "Let us try to get some sleep now, darling."
                  And with their arms twined around each other the sisters at length sunk into a fevered slumber; but their visions, akin to each other, were filled with terrors. Now they saw Noble standing on a mine, ready to explode beneath his feet. Now it was the sufferer's chamber, peopled with the fearful shapes she herself had conjured up.
                  They found Mrs. St. John, on seeking her room some hours afterwards, pale and anxious; already acquainted with a portion of their tidings.
                  Miranda had found time to escape from the sick room, to open her budget for her Mistress' benefit.
                  "Lor' Missis, Miss 'Lure's got the fever, and Miss Ida and Miss Kate sot up all las' night 'stid a wakin' me up as they oughter. The way she's ravin' and carryin' on—and the doctor says she's been goin' on so all night, and he can't git her to take a thing. He make me hold her hands this mornin' while he pour somepin' down her throat, and Lord! she turn black in the face as dis," picking up a hat of Noble's, which lay on the table. "And," speaking in a low confidential tone, "she rave about Mass Noble a heap. I don't b'lieve Mass Noble sleep a wink last night neither. I seed him as I pass by de bar-room, and he poured out a tumbler of the real raw brandy, and drink it down jest so. And he look like he ain't teched a bed. He got on de same clo'es he had on last night. I meet him jest now, and he asked me "how she do," he never call her name, and he tell me, she and him stopped to rest ridin' out yesterday at a place where they had the fever, and that's jest the whole secret."
                  "Miranda! called a stern voice, and Noble's haggard face and bloodshot eyes appeared at the window, arresting his mother's footsteps as she was about to follow the garrulous nurse to the sick room. "Why are you not in place?" he asked, with unusual sternness of the servant, and scarcely seeming to notice the presence of his mother. "The physician called you. Go instantly."
                  "Come in, Noble," said his mother, taking him by the hand, and leading him as she might have done a wayward child, her mother's heart sinking within her as she marked his appearance.
                  He followed her mechanically, and as she seated herself in her accustomed chair, dropped down on a low stool at her feet; and covering his face with his hands, laid his head on her lap, as he had been accustomed to do in days gone by, when he sought her as the refuge from all his childish griefs.
                  Nothing could have touched the mother's soul like this simple, childlike action. She knew he must be laboring under some intense sorrow, for which there was great real or fancied cause, ere he would have yielded to what under other circumstances his boyish pride might have condemned as a weakness.
                  She could not but guess the cause, but much as she deplored it, now was not the time for censure. He needed sympathy, and should a mother's heart refuse it?
                  Words at such a time were vain, therefore she said nothing, if we may except the low breathed utterance of such soothing sentences as, "My own Noble. My dear boy," which found their way from her heart to her lips as she softly rested her hands on his head, as she had done in the olden time, when he knelt in prayer at her knee.
                  Anxious fears beset her lest Noble, too, should fall a victim to the fatal malady, but she did not express them, awaiting in silence and meekness the worst.
                  For her daughters she feared not so much, or if she did, she could not have commanded them, if she would, to leave the perhaps dying bed of her they had cherished as a friend, and her faith was strong in that Providence whose mantle of protection is ever thrown around His ministering children of mercy.
                  Noble moved not from his position, as Ida and Kate entered.
                  Once or twice he started, and his whole frame shook with a slight convulsion, as they narrated the sufferings of Madame D'Allure, or touched upon the strange words she had used in connection with himself; but he indignantly repudi- ated the expression of Kate's fear that he had been in some way wronged or deceived by the Frenchwoman.
                  "Her husband may be—I almost believe he is—a fiend, but she?—tell me not, sister, that she is aught but pure and good. Utter no word against her if you love me. For shame, to bring up in condemnation against her the ravings of a dying woman."
                  Kate attempted to defend herself, but it only irritated her brother the more. Mrs. St. John begged him to be calm. He rose impatiently, and left the room.
                  "Noble's whole nature seems changed since he has known Madame D'Allure," said Kate.
                  "I fear we have all been very blind," responded her mother, sadly.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXXIV.
                  THEY were clustered around the dying bed, they who had known her in her power and pride, subduing all who came within her influence by her beauty, her graces, her irresistible fascination, subdued now herself by a power, against which all these availed nothing. It seems ever a terrible thing for the young to die, for so much youth, fresh with hope, to be stricken, from this fair earth, at one blow; for the bounding heart so soon to freeze beneath the icy touch of the grave-king; but how much more terrible is the vision, when it comes to one whose bright gifts have been yielded all to the service of sin, and who, in the glad exultation of evil-doing, is appalled by the apparition of the Dread Summoner to Judgment!
                  
                  Noble shuddered as his eyes fell upon her. He had not seen her for several days. He could not bring himself to look upon her sufferings, and he felt in his inmost soul, when he received the summons which now called him to her side, that it was the last time he should look on her in life.
                  Disease had worked a fearful change. She was much emaciated; her hollow cheeks burned with the purple glow of the fire within, and her sunken eyes were unnaturally bright. Her hair, those sunny tresses which were wont to fall in such graceful clusters, was knotted and tangled, and thrown wildly back from her brow, giving her almost a weird aspect. In the agony of her delirium she had bitten her lower lip, until it was swollen and purple in hue.
                  Little as she resembled now the beautiful being he had worshipped, Noble felt that he would unhesitatingly, had it been in his power, have poured the fountain of life which warmed his own breast into hers, could he thus have restored her to what she was, or lengthened for even a brief space her existence.
                  She had been very weak since the delirium had passed, but now she seemed gifted with a strange strength—the strength Death lends to fulfil Life's last purposes. Mrs. St. John thought it her duty to suggest the offices of a clergyman, but the reply was a movement of the head in the negative, and she thought she could never forget the look with which it was accompanied, its wan despair so plainly seemed to say—"Too late! too late!"
                  The physician had been sent from the room, in obedience to her orders, yet she lay without uttering a word.
                  Mrs. St. John and Kate were weeping violently at the foot of the bed, Ida stood on one side, with one hand of the sufferer between her own, her eyes filling with a flood of moisture, while ever and anon large tears rolled slowly down her cheeks, which were pale from watching and fatigue.
                  Noble stood on the other side of the bed, his arms folded, his tearless eyes set with a mute despair on the sufferer. Occasionally her eyes were fixed on him with an indescribable look of anguish, and then they wandered all over the room, seeming to gaze far into space, oh! with such a yearning agony. Her whole soul seemed to go out in that intense longing gaze. But the form she sought was not there. Vainly she looked for him who should have been first by her side, to whom she wished to yield her last breath, whose arms should have received the marble tenement of the banished soul.
                  "Auguste! Auguste! oh! where is Auguste?" she murmured at length, looking at Ida with such a longing, imploring gaze, that Ida felt her heart yearn in sympathy for her. Where was he, indeed? She had no power to answer the question. She could only press her hand and weep in silence.
                  Then the dying woman turned to Noble, and a mighty tumult seemed at work within her soul, as she murmured—
                  "Must it be? Oh God, pity me! Oh God, have mercy! Must I bear witness against him, or bear a double burden of guilt on my poor soul? It must be, Noble," and she reached out her hand, with an entreating gesture. "Forgive, forgive me!"
                  "I, Victorine," he replied, bending over her, half suffocated with emotion, "what have I to forgive?"
                  She made an effort as if to choke down something in her throat, and then her tones came forth low but firm.
                  "You thought me good and pure—God help me! I was not. You worshipped me as an angel, and I, alas, was false. I lured you on to sin. I used every seductive wile that art or nature gives to woman, to draw your young feet into evil paths. I smiled on you, 'twas to woo you to destruction. I gave you tender words and loving glances, because I knew they gave me a power I could use for your ruin. But—but I was the instrument of another. I loved him—loved him with all my woman's soul, and he used that love to blind my reason, to subvert mind, beauty, heart, all I possessed of power to his designs. Fiend! how have you dragged me to perdition. How have you immolated every pure feeling, every glorious attribute of my nature before the shrine of your hellish purposes, and left me in my last hour alone!"
                  The large drops stood on her forehead, her eyes glared, she became fearfully excited.
                  With a trembling hand Mrs. St. John poured out a teaspoonful of a soothing mixture, and placed it to her lips. She swallowed it mechanically. Then she seemed calm for a moment, but her reason wandered. All at once she burst into a wild sweet song in her native language. An old Provencal air, that she had often told Ida brought back the happiest days of her girlhood. Wildly, and with unearthly sweetness, came forth those dying notes. The listeners stood in spell-bound, silenced grief.
                  Then came a flood of tears, and she seemed to wander in green fields with Auguste. She spoke of leaving her father, and her girlhood's home with him; of her fond trust that all would be well when he was by her side. Then her ideas changed; she raved of a black sea, a fearful stormy sea, a tossing, struggling bark making its way through the waters, and, as it struggled, Auguste, who seemed to possess a strange power, would cast overboard one after another, who made no resistance, to lighten her burden, and then the dying faces in their last agony would rise above the surging waters and curse him. With a wild shriek she covered her eyes, as if to shut out the fearful vision. Thus she raved until she exhausted herself. Life was making its last faint struggle with death.
                  Gradually the look of mingled terror and rage passed from her face, and the old look of yearning despair came back. Her whole soul seemed to go forth in love, as she murmured:
                  "Auguste, my husband, come to me! Ah! he is there; I see him, and he will not come. Let me go to him!"
                  She made a faint effort to raise herself, still gazing wildly, longingly upon vacancy, stretched forth her arms, and fell back heavily into those Noble extended to receive her. Then came the fearful throat-rattle, the glazing eye, and a human soul had passed to its account.
                  A death-bed far from home, kindred, and country. A death-bed without a prayer.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXXV.
                  THEY were all anxious to leave the Springs now, saddened as the place was to them, by its fearful associations. They knew not where to write to D'Allure. He had left the Springs suddenly, his wife said, to be absent but a few days. The impression was, that he had gone to Washington, but repeated letters drew forth no reply. The plan which naturally suggested itself, was to send the corpse home, and have it buried at the villa.
                  Delham undertook the sad office of accompanying it, and the rest made preparations to follow in a few days. Willie seemed to have rallied, and felt stronger, and looked brighter than he had done for some time; perhaps, because, in the exciting scenes of the past week, Mrs. St. John had scarcely had time for the over-nursing, which is sometimes the worst thing possible for an invalid. Madame D'Allure died at four o'clock in the morning. It was about eleven o'clock on the same day when Ida entered the room where lay the corpse.
                  "Me and the nurse is just finished layin' her out," said Aunt Miranda, meeting her at the door. "And a beautiful corpse she is. So young and so beautiful as she was, too, poor thing. Well, I mighty little thought, when I seed her a ridin' about so gay and gallant-like wid Massa Noble, and 'raying herself in fine jewels, and sich lovely clothes—what a power of 'em she had, to be sure, the finest I ever seed—I mighty little thought she'd come to the like o' this, so soon. Well, we all got to die, great folks and rich folks, as well as poor niggers. Nothin' won't save us from that."
                  Ida closed the door, as the nurse and Miranda, in obedience to her command, left the room, and approached sadly the rigid form of the dead.
                  How lone and drear looked every thing in that chamber. Every article of furniture took a strange solemnity, from its association with the awful presence of death. Even the breeze, wandering through the window, seemed to come with strange, weird whisperings, and the sunlight, falling on the stark cold outlines of the spotless shroud, looked wan and ghastly.
                  The fierce expression had vanished from her features, and they looked beautiful in their icy stillness, so calm, so cold, so still. The hand, more perfect than a sculptor's creation, in which she had taken so much pride, whiter in bloodless transparency than the white roses resting between the nerveless fingers.
                  Beauty, power, and pride. Dust to dust, ashes to ashes! An intense conviction of the vanity of life, such as we all feel when gazing upon death, swept over Ida. God grant she remembered it longer than most of us, with whom it survives scarcely the shovelling of the last spadeful of earth on the grave of the departed.
                  She was interrupted in her sad meditations by the entrance of Noble. He still looked pale and worn from excitement, and perceiving her was about to retreat.
                  "Stay, brother, I am going," and she left him alone.
                  It is to be hoped, in that lone hour, beside the marble sacrifice of Life unto Death, as there arose before him the phantom visions of the past—its temptations—its weakness, that he expiated there in prayer, and vowed by the immolated shrine of his false idol, to return to the path from whence she had allured him.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXXVI.
                  JADED and weary were the travellers when the gates of Huntingwild opened wide their hospitable arms to receive them, and the dear old homestead smiled its familiar welcome upon them. The evening was just closing in as the weary steeds paused before the front of the mansion. Mr. St. John was on the piazza with smiling face and open arms to greet them—cheerily the lights beamed from within. The tea-table, with its snow-white tablecloth and shining service of silver, ready for their reception, greeted them on their entrance.
                  One domestic after another glided in with a "Welcome back, Mistis—Miss Ida, all of you. God knows, thought you never was coming back, and de old place got so lonesome. Miss Kate you look just as bright as ever. How you do, Mass Noble?" and so on.
                  "Well," said Kate cheerfully, as, refreshed by a changed toilette and recent ablutions the party seated themselves around the teeming board, "it is a good thing to go from home sometimes, if it's only for the pleasure of getting back again."
                  "There is nothing like home-comforts, after all," responded her mother.
                  "Yes," echoed Mr. St. John, "home, with happy, smiling faces around you, is a very pleasant place, but think how I fared here in my forlorn bachelorhood. Girls, let me help you to some broiled chicken, it will do you good after your long ride, or will you have some of this cold ham? I'll warrant you have not tasted such at the Springs. Wife, I have had no good coffee since you left."
                  "That is because mother was not here to serve it," laughed Ida.
                  "I dare say. Antony, make haste with those hot biscuits. Don't you know we are hungry?"
                  Antony, making a frantic effort to dart after the hot biscuits, caught his foot in the matting, and came sprawling to the floor, followed by a general burst of merriment.
                  This trifling contre-temps gave an impetus to mirth, which lasted more or less all the evening, every one avoiding any allusion to the sad topics which had of late so engrossed them; and when they separated for the night, each felt happier than they had done for weeks.
                  In the conjugal tête-à-tête which took place between Mr. and Mrs. St. John after retiring, she learned that he knew something of D'Allure's whereabouts.
                  He had been connected with a party of travelling gamblers, who made their rendezvous at that celebrated haunt for such characters, Vicksburg, Mississippi—an affair which involved several young gentlemen of wealth and position, in which foul play was proved to have been used—led to the disclosure of various disgraceful particulars. They were even suspected of counterfeiting in Richmond. D'Allure had joined a confederate at Washington, and gone from thence heaven knows where.
                  He left directions with his agent for the disposal of the villa, and that worthy was presumed to be cognizant of his whereabouts, but, of course, was silent on the subject. As for young Haughton, Mr. St. John said in reply to the trembling inquiry of his wife, "he feared there was but little doubt that he played, and played deeply. He could not answer for the truth of the disgraceful rumors at the Springs, but it was a bad fix for a young man to be in, surrounded by such suspicions. As for his playing, his own father substantiated that. He would show her his note on the subject in the morning."
                  "Were you not surprised to find such a smooth-tongued polished villain in D'Allure?"
                  "It is not worth while to be astonished at any thing in this world, wife," and Mr. St. John relapsed into something very nearly resembling a snore.
                  Many vague and anxious thoughts thronged the breast of Mrs. St. John, ere overpowered by fatigue she sunk into slumber.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XXXVII.
                  IN the morning, Kate and Ida walked out to meet the carriage, which had been sent to bring the children and Miss Prudence home, who, not anticipating the arrival of the family, were absent on a visit in the neighborhood.
                  Noble ordered his horse ostensibly for a ride, but in reality to inquire of D'Allure's agent, in Richmond, as to certain notes of hand—honorable obligations from one gentleman to another—which had passed at different times from Noble's hands into those of his quondam friend, and from his, doubtless, into those of the estimable individual above referred to.
                  D'Allure had sailed for Europe, his agent said, and desired him to receive and forward the amount of these "debts of honor."
                  He could no longer defer the confession of his errors.
                  It was not that he feared harsh censure on the part of his father; if he had, he would have summoned a sort of dogged daring to his aid, and boldly confronted him with the truth.
                  But it was a task he had scarcely the courage to brave,—to confess to the father who had ever placed such trust in him, who had gloried in believing him the mirror of rectitude, his heavy losses at play, his intimate association with a man no better than a felon.
                  Now that the scales had fallen from his eyes, he could not but wonder at the infatuation which had led him blindly into habits at which his very soul revolted. He might have known, at first, he was a villain. But no; he was led into wrong so slowly as to lull suspicion; and the syren's spell grew stronger at every step he took. It was very natural, in those well-remembered evenings when released from the spell-bound influence of her society—she always retired from the parlor early—that he should take a hand with a card party formed by the host. He was not alone often. Sometimes sage and reverend worthies kept him in countenance, and got well taken in for their pains.
                  Card parties were usual in the neighborhood. Why should he have thought D'Allure less a man of honor than men he had been accustomed to look up to, with reverence, all his life—who were fond, in a moderate way, of the excitement of gaming?
                  "D'Allure was a devilish lucky fellow!" 'twas often said; but no one accused that urbane model of propriety of any thing more than mere good fortune.
                  If gentlemen lingered longer over his "petite soupers," and drank more wine than usual at his house, it was because both wine and supper were unexceptionable; and if, under these influences, they played a little too deeply, and went home at a later hour than usual to the anxious partners of their bosoms, it was not the fault of "that capital fellow, D'Allure,"—the burden rested on their own consciences.
                  Since things had taken the turn they had, there were some who had "suspected from the first, that all was not right;" but "they took devilish good care, if they did," thought Noble, "to keep it to themselves."
                  Noble was not the only one who had wakened from a dream of pleasure, to find himself on a precipice. This was some consolation; yet it availed little or nothing towards smoothing his way to the task before him, and moodily he made his way homeward.
                  As he gave his horse to the groom, Nina and Minnie came bounding across the lawn, their light straw hats falling off, their sunny ringlets dancing in the breeze.
                  "Oh! dear, sweet brother! We are so glad you have come back. Are you not glad to see us? Nina, I shall have the first kiss."
                  "No! no!—me! me! Bud."
                  He kissed both, with an affectation of joy; and giving a hand to each, suffered them to walk, prattling, by his side.
                  "You have been gone so long, and mamma and all,—oh, dear mamma! I thought she would never come back!"
                  "Nina and I used to steal off and cry, sometimes,—didn't we?"
                  "Oh, yes; and then didn't Miss Prudence give us lots of sugared bread and 'lasses candy, to comfort us, and picture-books too!"
                  "Yes, and Miss Prudence didn't scold us very often,—did she?"
                  No!—oh, Minnie! what a beautiful butterfly! Come, let's chase it!" and off they bounded, much to Noble's relief. He, too, had chased a butterfly. 
                        
                           "A weary chase of hopes and fears,
                           Begun in folly, closed in tears.
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXXVIII.
                  AFTER seeing Noble and the girls off, and hearing the various complaints and petitions which had accumulated among the servants during her absence, with the patience and justice of a true housewife,—Mrs. St. John encountered her husband, as he was lighting a fresh cigar, preparatory to his morning walk. She requested a renewal of their conversation of the previous evening, and they adjourned to the library.
                  "I have little more to say, wife," said St. John, blowing a cloud of smoke, to which long custom had rendered Mrs. St. John heedless. "I have Haughton's note somewhere,"—fumbling in his coat pocket. Ah! here it is. I thought it necessary to write to Cameron, saying, that unless he could clear up the suspicions resting on his character, I felt it incumbent on me, as the natural guardian of Ida Walton, to say, that his visits to my house would not be agreeable. I felt it, I said, the more my duty, in view of the continued and open opposition of my wife, on account of his previous habits, to an engagement with her daughter."
                  "You were not aware, then," interrupted his wife, "that the affair had been broken off?"
                  "Not I. I concluded, from the abrupt cessation of his visits, some time since, that there was some little outbreak; but you and Ida did not take me into your cabinet counsels, nor did I ask it. In the present instance, however, I felt called upon to act, and did so accordingly. By some accident, I left the note unsealed, and received this answer the same evening."
                  Mrs. St. John was already absorbed in Mr. Haughton's reply.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "Finding your note to Mr. Cameron Haughton unsealed, I concluded that it contained merely some request, to which I could attend in his absence, I therefore took the liberty of reading it.
                              "I cannot but approve of the perfectly just course you have taken towards him. Much as I regret, as a father, to say so, I cannot, with truth, affirm that I believe him guiltless of the vice of gaming. On the contrary, I fear, nay I have too much reason to think, he is entirely wedded to it,—too much so to be induced, under any circumstances, to give it up. Connecting this vice with his habits in general, I have always thought, to speak as a frank and honorable man, that an alliance between our families would be any thing but conducive to the happiness of Miss Walton.
                              
                                 "I am, with esteem, yours,
                                 "CHARLES HAUGHTON."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  "Unnatural! cruel!" Mrs. St. John could not help exclaiming, as with trembling hand she laid aside the brief, curt epistle.
                  "Why yes!" responded her husband, "Haughton's stern sense of honor has certainly carried him farther than I could have gone. I could never have nerved myself to be the accuser of my own son."
                  "Nor could any one, with the natural feelings of a parent," responded his wife, with so much warmth that Mr. St. John looked at her in surprise. Perceiving it, she colored, and altered her manner, as she said, "That note is sufficient in itself, to confirm the report that there exists no good feeling between Mr. Haughton and Cameron."
                  "But may it not be the young man's fault? I was never more surprised than when this new phase in his character was revealed, for with all his wildness I always thought Cameron Haughton the soul of honor, and, until now, accused his father of injustice."
                  "And more than ever now," said his wife, in a low, firm tone, and as if the words escaped her lips unwillingly, "more than ever now, do I accuse him of injustice," and without waiting for her husband to request an explanation, she abruptly left the room.
                  Mr. St. John paused a moment, as if in profound thought, and then ringing the bell, ordered his horse.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXXIX.
                  MRS. ST. JOHN retired to her own room, and locking the door, once more brought forth the mysterious miniature, and resting it on the table before her, stood wringing her hands in a sort of silent grief, blinding tears falling so thick and fast as to obscure her view. Then she pressed it to her lips, and returning it to the casket, and the casket to its place in a private cabinet, threw herself in a great easy chair by the open window, and leaning her head on her hand, gave herself up to a thousand conflicting thoughts.
                  Not all the glory of that autumn landscape, its vast fields of golden grain—the dreamy sunlight—the balmy air—the broad, shining water, gleaming through breaks in the thick shrubbery—not all this beauty availed to ease one pang which tore the heart of the mistress of that broad domain.
                  She was aroused from her painful revery by a tap on the door. Casting a hasty glance at the mirror, to see that no tears remained, she opened it, and Noble presented himself.
                  "Mother, do you know where I can find my father?"
                  "He spoke of riding to the Belvoir plantation, to over-look some repairs going on there. I think it probable he has gone," she replied, ringing the bell.
                  The servant who answered it confirmed her conjecture.
                  Noble entered the room, and throwing himself on a chair, sat gazing on vacancy with such a perplexed and troubled air, that his mother went to him, softly put her arm around his neck, and asked what it was that annoyed him.
                  
                  "Mother."
                  "Well, my son?"
                  It would be a relief to confess to her. He wondered he had never thought of it before. She might pave the way by hinting the worst to his father, at all events, her sympathy was soothing in his present perturbed state.
                  "Sit down by me, mother."
                  She drew her chair near him, and with her arm still around his neck, sat quietly listening for what he had to say.
                  And Noble, with bowed head, revealed all; his infatuation—his gradual progress in dissipation, until at the Springs it grew to the nightly haunt at the faro bank, the reckless play, under the excitement of wine.
                  She listened in silence, nerving herself through it all, and when he had finished, said with apparent calmness,—
                  "What is the amount of your losses, Noble?"
                  "Five thousand dollars."
                  She could not repress a start. "Five thousand dollars!"
                  "Yes, five thousand dollars,"he replied, petulantly. "D'Allure never would allow me to pay at the time of losing, else I could not have been drawn so far. He always said, 'Oh! time enough,'—and 'no consequence,'—and, in fact, I scarcely thought, until I reckoned them up, what was the real amount of my losses. But it is not the loss of the money that deprives me of courage, it is the confession I must make to my father, that I have 'sinned against heaven, and in his sight, and am no more worthy to be called his son.'"
                  "I have no doubt, Noble," and his mother smiled faintly, "that like the prodigal's father, he will take you to his bosom, thanking heaven that his son is restored to him. You know your father's kind, generous nature."
                  "Yes, I know it too well." He paused, and then added bitterly, "And I must go deliberately to him, must tell him calmly, that I have abused his trust, and wounded his high sense of honor. Oh, mother! 'tis a hard task."
                  Mrs. St. John reflected a moment. Perhaps it was better that she should first acquaint her husband with the truth. It was painful for her to reveal the errors of their child, and yet as a mother, ought she to shrink from it?
                  Noble looked inquiringly into her face. She answered the look.
                  "Noble, suppose I speak to your father of this?"
                  "I wish you would, mother."
                  "Well, when he returns this evening, I will do so. Until then, try to be as unconcerned as possible. Hush! here is Prudence."
                  That estimable lady entered and seated herself, the ever-lasting knitting in hand, as usual.
                  Noble rose to retreat.
                  "You needn't run off because I've come. It's not so often you are troubled with the sight of me. I thought as I'd taken off my things and got cool, I'd come and sit awhile with Catharine, and hear the news about that French-woman's death. Poor thing, she's gone to her long account, and a bad account, I am afraid it is."
                  Noble rushed out of hearing.
                  "It's just as I said, Kitty, Noble thought more of Madame D'Allure than he had any right to do. Just look at him. Why, he is as black around the eyes, and as pale, and as haggard—he don't look like himself. You may depend upon it, it's nothing but grieving after that woman. Well, let's hear all about it—her sickness, and how she died."
                  Mrs. St. John, with the patience of a martyr, detailed the circumstances.
                  
                  "Well," commented the listener, with a long-drawn breath, "died without even a preacher to offer up a prayer for her poor soul. However, he couldn't have done her much good at that late hour. I don't believe in death-bed repentances, myself. Thank God!" and here Miss Prudence cast her eyes up to heaven with a sanctimonious air—"Thank God! I have made my road to the tomb smooth. I've not thought for many years of laying up treasure, except in heaven. I suppose you've heard how D'Allure has turned out?"
                  "Yes."
                  "Just as I expected. I always thought there was something wrong about both them people, but as you were all so wrapped up in them, I thought I wouldn't say any thing, knowing it would do no good. It's seldom I get deceived, I can tell you."
                  Here Kate entered, followed by the two children, in high glee.
                  "Mamma! mamma! we don't want to play out doors any longer, we want to stay with you. You've been gone so long."
                  "Well, if you're coming in, I'm going out. I don't see how you can stand the noise of these children, Kitty. It drives me distracted. If you only knew the trouble I had with them while you were gone. Running, ripping, tearing, or else moping in the corner crying. And eat!—it seemed to me they'd kill themselves. Bread and butter, day in and day out. Well, I'll go, for I see you don't intend to make them hush. That's the way I'm driven about, from pillar to post, like a poor old dog," and off she went.
                  "Matrimonial music does not suit Miss Prudie's taste," said Kate, smiling.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XL.
                  MR. ST. JOHN came back, heated and fatigued from his ride, relieved himself by a bath and a change of linen, and sat down to the dinner table, fresher and more urbane than usual.
                  Noble, relieved at even the short postponement of the dreaded interview, managed to assume an air of careless cheerfulness.
                  His mother, on the contrary, felt that the sooner all was over the better.
                  "Do you know, Noble," said Mr. St. John, looking up suddenly from his discussion of corn, cucumbers, ham and chicken, "do you know I have some idea of purchasing the villa for you. We should like to have you near us, and it will be a beautiful home for Fannie and yourself when you are married?"
                  Noble colored painfully.
                  The ladies glanced at each other, and Miss Prudie shook her head ominously.
                  "Why, papa," commenced Kate, "didn't you know—"
                  A look from her mother checked her.
                  "Know what, child? I know there has been a silly lover's quarrel between the pair, but they'll make that up before long," and Mr. St. John smiled quizzically at poor Noble, and then continued, "The only thing in the way is, that building this new granary and tobacco house, with other repairs at Belvoir, make me a little short of cash, just at present."
                  "I am sure father, Belvoir is sufficient for me," said Noble, thinking he ought to make some response.
                  
                  "Well, the grounds attached to the villa would form no estate for you, and Belvoir has only an old tumble-down rackety house, that you would not live in. My idea was, that as they join, you could farm Belvoir and live at the villa."
                  "Yes, Bud," said Kate, "that would be admirable."
                  Mrs. St. John and Ida said nothing. The mother, because she knew how improbable would be the consummation of these plans; and Ida, with her intensely delicate perceptions, because she felt how painful a residence at the villa, with the associations of the past and the grave of the present, must be to her brother. Miss Prudie, too, absorbed in giving Minnie an aside lecture, was silent on the subject.
                  "Well," said Mr. St. John, as they arose from the table, "none of you, except Kate, seem inclined to favor my project, but I've set my heart on it. The villa is an Eden-home of beauty; and after that poetical speech, Ida, I suppose I'm at liberty to take myself off. A coal of fire, Cæsar. Noble, have you no better cigars than these?"
               
               
                  CHAPTER XLI.
                  MR. ST. JOHN sought the shady side of the piazza, and throwing himself on a lounge, gave himself up to the enjoyment of his cigar, and the balmy autumn breeze, while he watched the gambols of his favorite hounds on the lawn.
                  "I say, Tom," he said, arresting the footsteps of the gray-headed coachman, as he passed by the piazza, on his way to the kitchen to dinner, "you don't make your boy attend to that kennel properly. I put him there under your directions, and thought it would be all safe. I see it wants cleaning and fresh straw for the dogs."
                  "I does every thing I can Marster to make Moses 'tend to it."
                  "Well, if he doesn't do better in future I'll be after him myself. My stables I will not have neglected. By the way the carriage horses have not looked so well of late, and Noble's horses are perfect contrasts to mine. They are so much better kept."
                  "Mas Noble clean his own horses, often as any other way."
                  "Or pays you extra to do it. Well, I shall not do either, so look sharp and have things in better order. I don't wish to speak of this again. Well, my dear?" An affectionate smile glowed upon his sunny genial face, as he passed his arm round her waist, with the fondness of a youthful bridegroom. "What is it, wee wife?"
                  What a struggle there was in the wife's heart. How she loathed to drive the brightness from his face. And yet it was best to have it over at once. "I fear you will think me very troublesome, dear—but I should like to see you in the library, this afternoon."
                  "What again? more about Cameron and Ida? No? What then? Come I will go now," and he threw aside his cigar; and followed her.
                  She bolted the door to secure herself against interruption. Mr. St. John threw himself into an easy chair, and looked as if his curiosity was fairly aroused. She seated herself on a low stool beside him. Her face was pale, her voice tremulous, and she looked pleadingly in his face, as she murmured, "My husband, I have come to beg your forgiveness for Noble."
                  "Noble, what has he done?"
                  
                  "Promise me not to be very severe with him?"
                  "Severe! am I generally severe? And if I were, I cannot imagine Noble doing any thing, to call forth a very harsh judgment. What is it?"
                  She hesitated, wishing to approach the subject carefully, but no circuitous avenue presented itself to her thoughts, and besides of what avail were preliminaries? It must come to the worst at last. As these thoughts rapidly chased themselves through her mind she lowered her eyes, fearing to meet the change in her husband's face, and said, plunging with an effort at once into the subject—
                  "Noble has been drawn by the D'Allures into gaming, and has lost heavily."
                  Mr. St. John sprung to his feet, as if a cannon-ball had whizzed past him. He stood for a moment in motionless silence regarding his wife, and then as if in a dream, slowly enunciated—
                  "Noble! my son! a gambler?"
                  "Not a gambler, my husband. It was but a momentary indiscretion. I am sure he will never do the like again. Only do not censure him too severely this time?"
                  He seated himself again, supporting his head with one hand, while storm and darkness swept in clouds over his face.
                  "Censure him!" at last he repeated in tones of bitterness. "Is all your compassion for him alone? Have you none for your husband—for the hope, and love and trust he has abused? Oh, God! how proud I was of the boy. How far I placed him in my thoughts above vice, falsehood, and deception—and now to know that he has been guilty of all. 'Tis a bitter blow, wife, a bitter blow."
                  "Dear love, do not speak so. Indeed it was but the mo- mentary rashness of a boy, dearly repented of since, I know. Do not give it such harsh names as vice and deception."
                  "It was not vice to herd with such men as D'Allure and his crew? It was not falsehood of the worst kind—falsehood in action—it was not daily deception, when he went deeper and deeper into the whirlpool, concealing his imprudence from me, so artfully, that I never entertained the slightest suspicion of the reality?"
                  "Wiser men than Noble have been drawn into such things, and by lesser means, than were brought to bear upon him. Madame D'Allure—" she paused. It was a fearful thing to condemn the dead.
                  "Well, what of her?"
                  "She confessed on her death-bed, that she had used every means in her power to make Noble the tool of her husband's designs."
                  "Artful, designing.—"
                  "My husband, profane not the sanctity of the grave. I little dreamed until lately the extent of that woman's influence over the mind of Noble. We cannot but deplore it, but I hope he has seen his folly. God knows how far he might have gone in the path of ruin had it not been for the events of the last month. My poor boy, how blind he was."
                  "Not blind, wife. He knew my horror of gaming. He has often heard me say, that there was no man who revelled, fattened, luxuriated in the sufferings of his fellow-creatures, like the professional gambler. He knew that I considered gaming, even in a lesser degree, a sort of genteel species of robbery, where a fool allows a knave to rifle his pockets, and calls it paying a debt of honor."
                  "Still he was blind. He was infatuated, perfectly infatuated with Madame D'Allure, and you know my husband, I have heard you yourself say, that there was no limit to the influence an artful, designing woman, might gain over the mind of an honorable, unsuspecting man. Think of this, and do not blame our boy so much. You are not wont to be severe. Remember the thoughtlessness, the impetuosity, and the ignorance of the world, belonging to his youth, and be gentle with him for this time."
                  Mr. St. John was touched to the soul. Indignation at his son's misconduct, blended with the crushing sense of misplaced confidence and injured pride, and through all this, the pleading voice of the mother, awoke the father's wish to 'forgive.'
                  "Leave me wife. I am not myself now."
                  She turned to go.
                  "Shall I send Noble," she asked, dreading the answer. When it came it relieved her.
                  "No, I will send for him, when I am ready to see him."
               
               
                  CHAPTER XLII.
                  MR. ST. JOHN did not appear at supper, and fond as he was of this social meal his absence excited remark. Mrs. St. John and Noble alone could account for it, and the former remarked quietly, that she believed he was particularly engaged in the library.
                  "See if he will have a cup of tea in there, Antony."
                  "The door was locked," said Antony returning, "but Marster asked who was there, and I told him what you say. He say he won't take nothin', thank'ee."
                  The mother and son glanced with a painful intelligence at each other.
                  Miss Prudentia caught the glance, but reserved the volley, consequent thereupon, for another opportunity. Kate and Ida saw it also, and connected their father's absence with their brother, but were prudently silent.
                  The autumn evening closed in chill and stormy. A cheerful wood fire blazed in the broad, black marble fireplace of the drawing-room, though the winter carpets had not yet taken the place of the summer matting, and the fresh bouquets of flowers, gathered that day, offered a strange contrast to these wintry appearances.
                  Through the evening the father did not join the family circle. Kate and Marsden, Delham and Ida made up a hand at whist.
                  Willie's crutches rested quietly in the corner, while he listened dreamily to the prattle of Minnie and Nina, who loved nothing better, than to draw their footstools to his side in the evening, and rehearse their 'wondrous adventures' during the day, every now and then pausing to listen to some childish reminiscence, some lingering souvenir of nursery days, which carried the blind boy, as he recited it, back to the bright hours of his own early childhood.
                  Mrs. St. John sat silently, her fingers mechanically employed with some trifling work, occasionally listening with apparent interest, and adding a pleasant comment, to the narrations of Willie, or the children; but her eyes as they rested, with an anxious look, alternately on Noble or Ida, told that her thoughts were busy with the troubled, rather than the calm and peaceful spirits of her household.
                  Ida, however, wore an appearance of cheerfulness, even of gaiety, and there was no betrayal of any hidden emotion, save, perhaps, in the forgetfulness of her usuall skill, or the occasional bending of the head, and hurried pressure of the hand, under the dark curls, to her temples. True, her eyes would fill occasionally with a dreamy, far off gaze, as if other than the objects before her claimed her attention; but for a moment, and she responded to some lively sally of Kate or Marsden, or joined Delham in deprecating their ill luck, with as much apparent interest as any. But Noble seemed the very spirit of unrest. He picked up a volume of Byron, turned over the pages, rested his eyes a moment on them, walked to the window, started as some one entered, looked disappointed when he saw it was only Antony with an armful of wood, paced up and down the floor impatiently, and finally left the room.
                  "Missis, step here a minit, will you?" said Miranda, later in the evening, thrusting her head in at the door.
                  Mrs. St. John obeyed.
                  "I want the key, to get sheets from the linen-closet, for Mr. Delham and Marsden's rooms. I s'pose they ain't goin back to-night in this storm."
                  "The door is not locked, is it?"
                  "Yes, 'tis. I don't believe in folk's honesty, like you. Some niggers thinks they have got a right to what belongs to mistress, and takes things quick enough; so I takes care I locks up what I've got under my charge. I put the key in the little right-hand drawer of your bureau, and that's locked."
                  Mrs. St. John procured the desired key, and as she turned to recross the hall to the drawing-room, opened the outer door, to glance for a moment at the wild night. The rain driving in, warned her to retreat, and she was about to close the door and retire, when, by the lurid flash of the lightning, she saw Noble, seated at the further end of the piazza.
                  There he sat, amid the storm, and darkness, and driving rain, his face buried in his hands, his hair dripping wet, and the lightning playing in fearful coruscations over his form.
                  His mother called "Noble!"
                  No answer.
                  "Noble, darling, do not stay out in this terrible storm. You might be killed by the lightning at any moment."
                  "Mother, is it you? Leave me alone, I am too wretched to care whether I live or die."
                  Heedless of the very danger of which she had just warned him,—moved only by that impulse stronger than life,—a mother's love,—Mrs. St. John approached her son, and bending over him, endeavored to soothe him.
                  They stood, the mother and child, amid the fearful wail of the elements, in the alternate lightning glare, and terrible darkness of the tempest,—the fair, fragile woman, who had climbed life's youthful ascent, and already begun to descend the easy path, which sloped down to the peaceful vale of the tomb.
                  The other with all youth's high aspirations, and bounding strength, to lead him upward and onward;—she, the supporter, soother, comforter—he, bowed in utter prostration before her.
                  Alas! for the man who, when the floodgates of feeling are loosened, and manhood's pride, strength, and energy give way before the torrent, has not the blessed thought that,— 
                        
                           "An angel bows in woman's form,
                           And breathes a prayer for him."
                        
                     
                  
                  "Mother, do not stay here in the cold and wet.
                  "I cannot leave you thus, my child. Will you not come in with me, and banish such despondent feelings?"
                  "Oh! mother, if you had sinned against honor, truth, love, every thing that you had been taught to venerate and worship, as I have sinned against all these, in the likeness of my father, you would then know what I feel. Leave me now, and I will come in presently."
                  
                  Sadly she obeyed, and he was left again to his own thoughts.
                  Before him rose the past; its unsullied purity, his early, happy love, its sunshine brightening the far-off future, so quickly swept from his path by clouds which he himself had welcomed;—the beautiful temptress, with her serpent wiles, her sweet, seductive, wooing fascination, her fearful deathbed and confession,—and Noble shuddered, half with horror, half with a pang he could not repress. He had rushed into blind follies, he had sacrificed the precious trust of another's love, in which he once firmly believed his own happiness intertwined, sullied his honor, incurred the displeasure of a father he almost worshipped, brought care to his gentle mother's heart, all, all, for her! And that idolatry; what madness it was!
                  These were bitter reflections. But how many of us have had the same? Is not the idol, for whose sake we deem no sacrifice too great, often the one who tramples our dearest feelings in the dust, with no more compunction than they would plant their foot on a withered leaf?
                  Half an hour afterwards, he again heard the tones of his anxious mother's voice.
                  "Will you come in now, dear?"
                  He rose, and mechanically followed her up stairs to his own room. As they passed the library, they heard slow, heavy footsteps, as if pacing uneasily to and fro. The sound smote the hearts of both, but neither alluded to it.
                  A cheerful fire burned in his room. The curtains were drawn, to exclude the wail of the tempest. An arm-chair near the fire, his dressing gown thrown over it, and a cup of some fragrant mixture steaming on the hearth. A shaded lamp shed its mellow glow through the well-furnished chamber, with the snowy pillows and Marseilles quilt, which were Aunt Miranda's boast, the large mirror and choice pictures. His favorite books were spread on the table beside him, and his guitar lay on a lounge not far off. He smiled mournfully, as he saw how well his comfort had been cared for. "You will spoil me, dear mother. I shall never be satisfied with a wife, for none can ever equal you in devotion."
                  She assisted him to lay aside his wet coat, saw him comfortably ensconsed in his dressing-gown, and wiped the dampness tenderly from his hair, with her handkerchief.
                  He threw himself listlessly in the arm-chair, and leaned back with his eyes raised. They rested on a picture above the mantel, of his mother, in the early bloom of girlhood. The eye and brow were joyous with the light of an unclouded existence, and the rosy lips were slightly parted, with a piquant curve, as if, even in repose, the sunshine of a smile slept upon them.
                  Noble's attention was attracted to it more than usual, perhaps from the contrast the expression offered to his own thoughts.
                  "Mother," he said, sadly, "you must always have been very happy."
                  The mother turned away quickly.
                  "Every heart knoweth its own bitterness," she answered simply. "But do not let us discuss this subject. You are not well." She took both his feverish hands in her own, and looked into his haggard eyes. "You have exposed yourself recklessly of late, and the"—dissipation, she was about to add, but changed it, and said—"the excitement you have gone through, is too much for you. Here is a warm tea, which will put you in a nice perspiration, and make you sleep well. You will feel better in the morning. Will you take it, and go to bed?"
                  "To please you, Mother, though I'd rather not."
                  "Do now. Good night."
                  
                  "Good night, Mother."
                  She left him, and seeking her own room, paused there, and stood leaning over the dying embers of the hearth—thinking of his words, "But you were always happy mother." How often before the magic talisman of a few simple words, the records of the past unroll themselves before us.
                  A few light words from a stranger, a familiar song, a passing resemblance, a remembered sentiment, may carry us back leagues of life, long since swept over by the wing of Time.
                  We see once more the happy hours when we sported in the flowery gardens of joy—Hope weaving her wreath of spring flowers for our brow. We see, too, the storm and darkness which swept over the landscape, when, like the fierce convulsions which rend asunder mountains, and place awful depths and chasms between, altering the whole face of the earth, came those convulsions of the heart which changed the moral surface of our nature, searing hope, blasting love, and planting precipices from which to leap is ruin, between ourselves, and feelings, once the breath and being of our existence.
                  It is a sad thing to look upon a landscape desolated by earthquake and tempest; but what are these to the moral wrecks of the human heart?
                  Well might the ancients in their dreams of the good and beautiful, image forth a Lethean stream, where the wounded gladiator in the world's arena might drink and forget his sufferings.
                  We cannot pursue the varied tenor of Mrs. St. John's memories; but we can well imagine they were mournful enough.
                  An hour afterwards she again stole softly to Noble's chamber. The gentle opiate she had mixed in his tea had produced its effect. He had retired, and was sleeping, but had left the lamp burning, perchance to chase the dark phantoms of troubled thoughts.
                  The mother stole to the bedside, bent over him, listened to the deep breathing of his heavy slumber, and passing her hand over his fevered brow, pushing back the damp shining rings of his brown hair, kissed him tenderly.
                  "My precious boy!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER XLIII.
                  WE know not the purport of the conversation, if there was any, between Mr. and Mrs. St. John before retiring, but certes, the former appeared at table the next morning with a shadow on his frank brow, and though to the rest of the family his manner was unchanged, to Noble he did not speak, unless compelled to do so, and then, with a coldness and reserve amounting almost to severity.
                  This was the harshest punishment he could have inflicted on his son. Noble could have borne a storm of anger, which would have carried away the clouds and left the moral atmosphere clear and serene; but this reserve, this freezing, silent displeasure was hard indeed to endure.
                  Two days passed thus. Mr. St. John was only seen at his meals, and a sort of vague dread, a heavy sadness, threw a damper over the spirits of the household. Each felt for Noble, and yet disliked to express their feelings by dwelling on the unwelcome subject. Fortunately the Argus-eyed Prudence was called away at this crisis, from the family circle, by a severe illness of a friend, from whom she enter- tained sanguine hopes that she might, by unremitting attention, cajole a legacy—a set of silver spoons, or something of equal profit and importance. Miss Prudie always had a motive for her actions. True, those motives were sometimes insignificant, but they did not, in her own eyes, look so.
                  Noble lounged in his own room, read scattered pages, here and there, of novels, rode, and sketched a little, to wear away time, but all to no avail. He wondered why the autumn sun shone with such a sickening glaring, brightness; and why it travelled so slowly through those long two days. Indeed, we cannot say, but that he felt a spirit of resentment against its laggard movements. Once or twice he caught his father's eye fixed upon his pale cheek, and haggard eyes, with something of relenting, but he turned away too quickly to be sure he had caught the right expression.
                  As the third day after his confession to his mother closed in, unable longer to endure suspense, he proceeded with a beating heart to the library, intending to seek an interview with his father, no matter what the result should be. To his surprise he found the room vacant. Determined to await his entrance, he commenced nervously turning over the books and papers.
                  As he was scanning the names, without thinking of the contents, he drew out a book from a collection which happened to belong to Kate, and in so doing, an old daguerreotype fell from the shelf, where it had rested in some obscure hiding-place. He opened it mechanically, and Fanny Bonford's fair, smiling face looked out upon him. There was the rounded cheek, curved into rosy dimples; the blue eyes, their calm depths filled with earnest trust and affection; the shining bands of auburn gold hair, which he had so often played with in hours of unsullied, confiding tenderness.
                  The evening shadows floated over the daguerreotype, dimming the fair outlines of its pictured treasure; but they could not shut out the sad visions which the sight of these lineaments had brought to the soul of the warm-hearted, erring boy.
                  "How well she had loved him! and how cruelly for a mad fantasy he had torn himself from her! Unfaithfulness to her, had involved him in every misfortune of his life.
                  Gradually his head dropped between his hands, and he sat plunged in a reverie, so mournfully absorbing, that he heard not a quiet footstep, nor knew that any one was near, until a hand was laid on his shoulder, and the manly tones of a beloved voice fell on his ear.
                  "Noble, my boy, look up! You are forgiven."
                  He sprung to his feet! He tried to falter forth his thanks, but he could not; he could only press in silent gratitude the hand extended to him by his father.
                  "Yes," said Mr. St. John, seating himself and motioning his son to do the same—speaking calmly, but with feeling, "Yes, I feel that you have been sufficiently punished, for I have watched you closely, though you did not think it, for the last two days. Probably you suffered much uneasiness long before this affair was mentioned to me."
                  "I cannot tell you how much, sir."
                  "It was a hard struggle, Noble, to forgive. After all my love, all my pride in you, to find that you could thus deceive me. But we will not speak of that. I trust that this lesson will be sufficient, and that I shall never be called upon to overlook such indiscretions, giving them their mildest name, again."
                  "On my honor."
                  "No professions. Actions are the best tests of truth. Here is a check for the five thousand—get it cashed in town to-morrow, and have done with this business. I shall have to give up the Villa. The payments are cash, and I have not enough by a few thousands to meet them. I might, borrow, but that I make a point of not doing. However, you have yourself to thank for that loss."
                  "Believe me, I am grateful for your generous intentions, but I could never have lived at the Villa."
                  His father looked at him as if he understood his feelings. Much longer the conversation continued, and when Noble left the library he felt as if he had taken a leap backward, over the troublous exciting, restless period, embracing the last six months of his life—to find himself at the point where he started a light-hearted, happy boy.
                  He had not in reality leaped backward, he had only gone through one of those fiery ordeals we are all doomed sooner or later to tread, which, try the nerve and temper of the stuff wherewith our souls are made. He had entered that dangerous path a boy; he had come out of it a man, with something of manhood's reflection and experience.
                  A friendly hand, an experienced mariner, had saved his bark, ere his own recklessness had involved it too deeply in the whirlpool. If he could not now steer clear of Life's stormy breakers it was his own fault.
                  There was one more point to gain. Fannie's pictured semblance reposed on his heart, and far in the dim future arose a fairy vision of hope and happiness.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XLIV.
                  THE events which marked the sojourn of the party at the White Sulphur Springs, chased each other in such rapid succession, that we had no time to pause in our breathless narration, to look after the fortunes of characters equally important to this history.
                  We therefore again take up the thread of our narrative at a period some weeks preceding their return.
                  Darkly and drearily the evening of a stormy August day was closing in.
                  The clouds which during the day had chased themselves in threatening masses athwart the sky, now floated far to the north-west, and combined in one huge frowning phalanx, while the vivid lightning, and loud thunder, died into rare flashes, and low portentous murmurs.
                  A heavy storm-pregnant mist brooded in the air, and threw its sombre influence over the landscape.
                  Flowers, already torn by the fitful raging of the storm, drooped their heads, as if in trembling deprecation, the cattle forsook the fields, and with subdued lows, sought the nearest shelter. The negro boys, as they rode the horses to drink, and amused themselves by racing, shouting at each other, or cracking their whips cheerily at the cows as they passed, were the only signs of cheerful life visible.
                  Mr. Haughton, senior, sat by one of the lofty windows of the dining-room at the Park, his eyes fixed moodily on the cheerless scene without, or resting with a glance, which had something of a keen fierceness in its expression, on the countenance of an individual seated opposite to him.
                  This was the overseer of the plantation, a short, dark, burly looking man, with common coarse features, and an expression to which a casual observer might have given the name of honest bluntness, though a close discerner of human nature would have detected the cunning which lurked beneath, and a mind wholly pure, even though unsophisticated, have shrunk from it—without perchance knowing why.
                  The comfortable, not to say luxurious appliances of the apartment, the wines and rich grapes on the stand beside him, together with the softness of the fauteuil on which he rested, and the easy comfort of the brocaded dressing-gown, would seem to have marked the owner of these things as the personification of contentment, but a minute inspection of the lines of his face, the compression of the lip, the ominous wrinkle between the brows, and the subdued flash of the eye—like a lone fire-gleam at midnight—told a very different tale.
                  There was a servile whine in the tone, with which the overseer broke the long pause.
                  "Yes, he is goin' hard on to ruin now, sir. If I hadn't thought you, bein' his father, might have some sort of control over him, and bring him back to the right track, I never would have told you, for to be sure it's none of my business."
                  Mr. Haughton's dark face flushed.
                  "My paternal authority," he said haughtily, "has long ceased to exist."
                  "Well, I hope, sir, if you can't do nothin' with him, you will have the goodness not to mention that I told you anything about this, because I am a poor man, and Mr. Cameron might injure me a heap if he was to try."
                  "You need have no fears," responded his employer impatiently, "but hark'ee, Smith," and he fixed his eyes on him with a look which might have pierced the veil of a demon's art, "you have cause of anger against my son. If all I have heard is true, you vowed revenge against him the day he interfered between you and one of the negroes, whom you wished to punish more severely than the occasion required, thus humbling you—as you chose to term it—in the eyes of the servants. Beware! If this be some plot hatched up against him you have my revenge to fear. My revenge! Mark my words."
                  The man turned uneasily on his chair, and his eyes drooped, as he answered deprecatingly:
                  "If you don't believe me, sir, all you've got to do is to be on the watch, and you can see for yourself."
                  "Enough. I will settle this with my son. I have letters to write now," and with a wave of his hand, Mr. Haughton abruptly terminated the interview.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XLV.
                  THE hour-hand of the clock pointed to one of the small hours of the morning, in the brilliantly lighted saloon of a faro bank, in our good metropolis of Richmond; an establishment, by the way, celebrated for the completeness of its accommodations, and the select character of its habitués.
                  
                  Standing near the faro-dealer, was a gentleman in whom beneath the disguise of a fusty brown wig, a blue coat and brass buttons, a cravat slightly approaching to flashiness, and huge sandy whiskers, our experienced eyes detect the form of Monsieur D'Allure.
                  We are sure no one else will recognize him, for the very tones of his voice are changed, so that they startle our familiar ear; and his air, instead of the quiet, calm, self-pos- session peculiar to it, is rather that of a "fresh one from the country," in for a few weeks of the sights and luxuries of the city.
                  By his side is a man whose splendid height and figure, though his face is averted, seem familiar to us. Look! he turns his head now. Do our eyes deceive us, or is it Cameron Haughton? Yes, he it must be, and without any pretensions to disguise—dressed in the peculiar manner which characterized him, a Spanish hat, worn in true cavalier style, a short cloak, hanging carelessly from one shoulder, revealing fully the manly proportions of his figure, enveloped in what seemed—on careless inspection—a blue military undress coat—buttoned up to the throat.
                  Opposite to these two persons, on the left of the faro-dealer, is a young man of not more than twenty-one years, at most, whose dress and manner is marked by the careless nonchalance, and reckless bravado peculiar to the "fast men" of the Far South; men lapped in luxury from their cradles, who cannot see from their mansion windows the boundaries of their plantations, and who leave their early homes to float on the wild waves of life, with no knowledge of the world as a safeguard, no remembrance of early struggles to teach them self-control, and money to gratify every temptation which sin throws in the path of thoughtless youth.
                  He is evidently but half initiated into the mysteries of the estimable craft in which the worthies before him are engaged, though his manner is assumed with the evident intention to convince the lookers-on that he is an "old hand."
                  We have neither time or inclination to trace the progress of the games, or the wily entanglement of the unsophisticated Southron.
                  Despite his air of recklessness, there was a shadow on his brow that night, as he left the faro-bank with the pleasant reflection that the value of the whole year's produce from the fine plantation just settled on him by his father, would scarce balance the losses of a night.
                  The "fresh one from the country" had been unlucky also, and deplored his misfortunes in the bitterest terms, though we may here mention in confidence to the reader, that a private interview with the faro-dealer, served wonderfully to restore his equanimity.
                  As Cameron Haughton—for who else could it be?—and D'Allure emerged from the faro-bank, the former hastily doffed the Spanish hat, replaced it by a glazed cap, and threw over his mantle an ordinary greatcoat, completely concealing the upper portion of his dress.
                  These movements were closely observed by an individual who looked out from a carriage in the shadow of the opposite wall.
                  The two men observed the carriage, and the one who seemed to be Cameron Haughton, said to the driver, "Waiting for passengers, old fellow? Well, here's two for you."
                  "Private carriage, sir."
                  "Private carriage? Then, what the devil are you doing here at four o'clock in the morning?"
                  "Some rich old fogy out on a lark," rejoined the other.
                  "Come, Haughton, it's only a mile to the hotel. We'll walk it."
                  As Haughton replaced his cigar carelessly in his mouth, and sauntered on with his nonchalant defiant air, laugh after laugh ringing from his reckless lip, he little dreamed of the dark face which had drawn hurriedly back into the shadow of the carriage-curtains when he accosted the driver, but which now again bent forward, and glared with tiger-eyes upon him, until his form, as he turned down another street, disappeared from his sight.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XLVI.
                  "THEN, you deny the truth of the rumors now afloat at the White Sulphur Springs?"
                  "Unequivocally."
                  "You will pardon me," and a sardonic sneer broke out upon the face of the elder Haughton; "you will pardon me if I doubt your word. You will, perhaps, deny also the fact that I saw you in person three nights in succession, emerge from the doors of a faro-bank in Richmond."
                  There was a look of such blank surprise on the face of the younger man at these words, that it might have staggered the belief of some men in the evidence of their own senses, but Mr. Haughton read in it only the perfection of consummate act. In a moment the look faded, and rising from his seat impatiently, while a half-scornful smile curled his proud lip, Cameron replied:
                  "I know not, sir, what may be your motive in bringing charges against me so entirely false in their nature. I have repeated to you (and I feel that I lower myself by condescending to the repetition) a fact of which you were previously aware, that during my absence I was on a half hunting, half exploring expedition, in the wildest mountains of Western Virginia; that I did not once visit, nor was I even in the neighborhood of the White Sulphur Springs."
                  "It is strange, then, that you do not take some pains to prove your innocence," sneered the other. "If it be as you say, a little investigation might, perhaps, clear it up."
                  "An investigation! And do you suppose for a moment, that I would stoop to obtain proof of my good character, innocence of the accusation, or whatever you may be pleased to term it, as an offset against the lying tales of a set of male and female gossips? Believe me, sir, you mistake me. The world may think as it will. I am confident that the falsehood will die of itself, and the truth be proven ere long, without effort on my part!"
                  "Pardon me for interfering with your private habits in any way," continued his father, in cold ironical tones;" but people find little difficulty in believing that a man may play the part of a desperate gambler at a watering place, who is the nightly habitué of a faro-bank in the city."
                  "'Tis false! By heaven 'tis false!" flashed from the impulsive lips of his son.
                  "Then, your father lies!" hissed Mr. Haughton, starting to his feet.
                  "I did not say so," exclaimed Cameron, with a slight recoil; "and yet," he added, "place what construction you will on my words, I will not recall them."
                  They stood for a moment, regarding each other as marble-like, and impassive as two statues, the one stern as iron, the other, with an undaunted boldness flashing from his fierce, dark eyes.
                  At length Mr. Haughton seated himself, motioning Cameron to do the same, but he remained standing, as if impatiently waiting the termination of the interview.
                  There was the gleam of a basilisk light in the eyes of the father, as he slowly enunciated:
                  "From your birth, Cameron Haughton, you have at times been an object of loathing, rather than love to me. Nor do I deceive myself when I venture to assert that you have returned the feeling. Still, we bore to each other the character of father and son, and however regardless you might be of what became the latter, it was my duty to keep up the proper appearances with regard to the former. Do not mock me with that incredulous smile. I repeat that I have done my duty. The time for such considerations is past. You stand before the world already in the light of a dishonorable man. Were I to sever the last tie between us—a tie of interest on your side at least—it would set the seal on the world's opprobrium. Do you understand?"
                  A slight bow was the sole reply, while not a muscle of the calm, haughty face before him moved. Still more irritated by his coolness, Mr. Haughton continued:
                  "I bear in my own person now, the stinging insult of falsehood, which you have cast upon the man you call father. That man retorts by pronouncing you a liar, and a dishonored profligate."
                  Cameron made a start forward, while the impetuous blood mantled his brow.
                  "Father, Mr. Haughton, retract those words, or henceforth we are strangers."
                  "Never, but on one condition."
                  "Name it."
                  The father drew nearer, and hissed into his ear:
                  "That you cease, now and for ever, all further pursuit of Ida Walton."
                  Had one of the old family portraits adorning the walls, suddenly sprung from the canvas, and appeared before him in the likeness of reality, Cameron could scarcely have been more startled. That his father should interfere with an affair of this kind, seemed to him wholly inexplicable.
                  But the lightning thought which chased itself through the lover's brain, was, that his own father stood before him in the character of a rival. Strange, almost ridiculous as the idea seemed, it was the only one which offered the slightest explanation of so remarkable a proceeding.
                  His father gave him full leisure to collect his thoughts, and awaited in silence his reply.
                  A look of scorn blended with the mingling emotions expressed in the sternly beautiful face of Cameron Haughton, and his tones rose clear, distinct and proudly in the silence of the room.
                  "I know not what may be your motives for this interference, nor do I ask them. Perhaps the very fact that in touching upon her name, you wring the tenderest chord of my nature, would be a sufficient explanation for such an act on your part. But let this answer suffice you. As long as Miss Walton remains free, I will never relinquish the hope of calling her my wife."
                  His father looked at him with such a strange expression, and his features worked so convulsively, that Cameron was strengthened in his hastily-formed belief, while suppressing with a strong effort the reply which sprung to his lips, Mr. Haughton answered:
                  "Then, not one slave who calls me master, not one acre of green earth, of which I can claim the title, shall ever be yours. How will your haughty spirit bear the humbling test of poverty? A fair home you will have to offer your bonny bride then. The bare earth beneath, and the blue sky above. A palace home indeed, for two romantic young lovers."
                  "Be it as you will," answered his son, calmly. "Had you ever treated me with the tenderness, usually extended by a father towards his son, this blow might have crushed me, as you intended it should. As it is, you have to thank yourself that it falls upon a heart which your own harshness has tutored into a careless defiance of outward evils. You say you have done your duty," and again the mocking smile to which his father had alluded, flitted across his lip. "If allowing me the shelter of your roof, permitting me to bear your name, be discharging the whole duty of a father, then you have discharged yours. If there be Christian duties of affection and forbearance to practice, examples of good to be set, careful guardianship, and vigilant counsel to be given, then does the curse of an unfulfilled trust rest upon you, and sooner or later you will harvest its retribution. Alternating your treatment to me in childhood, between a blind indulgence and cruel harshness, you, by turns, weakened and embittered my nature, until you drove me from you a reckless spendthrift. Thanks to the kindness of strangers, the better impulses of my nature—crushed into bruised impotence beneath the iron heel of a father's tyranny—revived. I learned to worship the simple goodness, which, to me, appeared the more truly great, that it was not a familiar thing to my untutored eyes. Great deeds awoke a spirit of emulation within me, and I vowed that I would be a man; yes, a man in the best sense of the word. And I have kept my vow. There is not that man living who can say, with truth, that the name of Cameron Haughton was ever, in the remotest degree, linked with dishonor, or that in my wildest excesses I ever stooped to falsehood or petty meanness. And you ask me to give up the woman I love. At any other moment I should feel tempted to laugh at such folly. Disinherit me, if you will; I have a brain and a right arm which can work their way in this fruitful, teeming world, as many an honest man has done before me. Yours will be the sacrifice. I have no desolate hearth, no lonely old age to encounter. Father," and his tones grew softer, "I have loved you,—yes, in spite of the humiliations with which you have at times galled my proud nature, in spite of your tyrannous exactions, I have loved you, and I, your son, beg you to pause, beg you to remember that there shall come a dying hour, when you will long in vain to call the outcast to your side; when your last gasp shall be the bootless echo of the wronged one's name."
                  He paused. The varying changes of pride, passion and surprise swept over the elder Haughton's face, as he listened to this outburst from one whom his own wrong treatment had tutored into a nonchalant defiance of manner in general, totally at variance with the firmness and feeling he now displayed. But, unmoved in his purpose, he spoke with iron calmness, as he laid his hand on the bell.
                  "If your tirade is over, I should like to summon Smith, as I have to see him on an affair of business this afternoon."
                  "Is it thus we part, father?"
                  A bow was the sole reply.
                  With a firm step, and an air of pride, which resembled more the honored heir and cherished son he should have been, than the outcast he was, Cameron left the room.
                  As the last echo of his footsteps died away, Mr. Haughton clenched his hands until the purple blood seemed ready to burst beneath the nails, and with the storm-cloud darker than ever on his brow, muttered,—
                  "He thinks to conquer me by his reckless bravado. No! let him go—let him marry her, and in their bridal hour I will curse their nuptials, with a secret which shall brand the life, and wither the soul of both. How like him, he looked, as he stood there in his devilish beauty, his fierce defiance. His very look and voice too, as he said, 'I have loved you.' The self-same words! I can see now the quivering form stretched before me, the death agony on the brow, the hand extended in forgiveness to me, me, whose soul was stained with his life-blood. Blood! that is a fearful sound! Hist! it seemed a whispering voice echoed the words. Pshaw! I might be taken for a third-rate actor, ranting on the boards of a minor theatre." He paused, as if to collect himself, and then continued: "'Tis strange, that at times I loathe these children, these living monuments of my foolish love, and maddening shame; and, yet, yet, I love her still. Strange phantasy! At times I have yearned for her presence until I could have blackened her name, and blighted her life, to bring her back to me, had not a power stronger than my own will withheld me. And that man called me friend; this man calls me friend. The one wronged me consciously; the other without knowing it."
                  He passed his hand hurriedly across his brow. He could not bear the stillness and loneliness of the room. A nervous shudder crept over the strong man's frame. Already he was beginning to feel the curse of the desolate hearth.
                  He rang the bell hastily.
                  "Hannibal, where is your master, Cameron?"
                  "Gone out ridin', sir, but I dunno where."
                  "Is Smith waiting?"
                  "Yes, sir."
                  "Tell him to come up."
               
               
                  CHAPTER XLVII.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "Do not, do not leave me,
                              By my tears thus falling,
                              Bitter thoughts will grieve me
                              When thou art away.
                           
                           
                              "If thou need'st must wander,
                              Let me wander too;
                              Pity, and forsake not,
                              Thine own, thy poor Hindoo!"
                           
                        
                        BALLAD.
                     
                  
                  IDA was reclining on a sofa at one of the windows of the back parlor, watching, with wistful eyes, the bright hues of the varying autumn foliage, while the plaintive notes of a ballad Kate was practising on the harp, the soft, hazy Fall atmosphere,—which infects one, susceptible to such influences, like the memory of a melancholy dream,—and the fading beauty of nature, blended strangely with sad musings on her own situation. How plainly was the vanity of human hopes typified by the gorgeous beauty of the year's decline. Doomed to fade, when brightest; to-day, clothed in hues of beauty, to-morrow, faded and prostrate on the bleak, bare earth.
                  Her meditations were interrupted by the entrance of Miranda.
                  "Have you seen anything of Miss Nina's flat? She said she left it in here," she asked, bustling about, as if in search of something, and then, as she approached the sofa, begging its occupant to rise so that she could look under the cushion, she slipped a note into the hand of her young mistress, and, suddenly becoming satisfied that the missing hat was not to be found, vanished.
                  Kate was too much occupied with her music to notice her sister's movements, who, hastily opening the note, read the single line it contained,—
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "Meet me in the clump of cedars, at sunset.
                              
                                 "CAMERON."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  Not a word of explanation as to his motives for asking this clandestine interview. Should she grant it? Her heart beat wildly as she asked herself the question. They had been separated, save the chance glimpse at the Springs, for three months. There was so much of mystery which might be cleared up. She hesitated. Prudence struggled with inclination, but, as is too often the case, was signally defeated.
                  The setting sun was bathing the lofty, old-fashioned windows of Huntingwild in a sea of molten fire, when Ida, with trembling footsteps, sought the clump of cedars. They were in the most distant part of the grounds, near a spot which had been the burial place of the former possessors of Huntingwild.
                  The negroes, with the wild superstition of their race, had invested the spot with every association of supernatural horror they could contrive to throw around it, and sedulously avoided it. In the evening rambles of the family, it was rarely or never visited, partly because the young people entertained lingering souvenirs of the nursery tales, of ghost and goblin, with which their sable handmaids, who have a most wonderful imagination in this respect, are wont to gorge the terrified ears of Southern children; but more, perhaps, because we naturally associate gloomy ideas with a spot, where every footstep may be upon a grave.
                  The dark green of the cedars stood out in sombre contrast to the gorgeous foliage of tree and shrub around them, reminding one of those quiet, sober friends, who seem dull and unattractive in the flaunting season of prosperity, but who, when gay ones flee, and the cold winter of adverse circumstances chills our heart, stand by us, bravest and best.
                  Ida knew that her lover had chosen this spot for its privacy, but a feeling of gloom fell upon her spirit as she approached it, which she vainly tried to suppress.
                  Her heart throbbed to an excess that was painful, as she caught the first glimpse of his form. He had thrown himself on the ground in a recumbent posture, and, with his head resting on his hand, was impatiently awaiting her arrival.
                  Ere he discerned her approach, a Newfoundland dog bounded before her, and the next moment saluted her by placing a paw on each shoulder, and rubbing his cold nose on her cheek.
                  "Ah! Bruno, Bruno, what a naughty dog," she ejaculated, gently pushing him from her, yet, scarcely forbearing to caress the dear companion of her lover's footsteps, at the peril of having his endearments rather too roughly repeated.
                  Cameron sprung from his reclining posture as she approached, took both her hands in his own, and pressed them tenderly, gazing meanwhile, with yearning affection into eyes, which answered the gaze as fondly; neither speaking a word. His dress was carelessly arranged. He was very pale, his jetty masses of hair damp, but a fevered light in his eyes, and every trace perceptible about him of recent severe fatigue and excitement, and Ida felt it as her gaze lingered with intense mournful tenderness upon him.
                  At last he drew her to a seat, and placing himself beside her, passed his arm round her waist, and drew her head to his bosom, while his full soul welled forth in the one word
                  "Ida."
                  "Dearest."
                  "I feared you would not come. Nay, do not look so deprecatingly upon me. I remembered your conscientious scruples of old. But I comforted myself with the thought that your confidence in me would teach you that I would not seek a clandestine meeting unless from the most justifiable motives. I lingered about the grounds this morning, at the hour you generally take your morning's walk, and waited in this nook and that corner for two long hours. Just as I was about to give up in despair, I happened to espy your nurse. That accounts for my hasty and unceremonious note. I could not leave you, perhaps for ever, without saying farewell."
                  "For ever?" faltered his startled hearer. "Oh! Cameron, what can you mean by speaking thus!"
                  
                  Hurriedly and with all the self-possession he could muster, he related the occurrences of our previous chapter; suppressing, however, the fact that it was for love of her he had sacrificed an almost princely heritage, fearing lest that knowledge would deepen the agony of parting, attributing his rupture with his father solely to his belief in the slanders which had assailed him.
                  "Yes, dearest, I have felt of late that duty to my country called me to the battle-fields of Mexico, and I have now no longer an excuse to linger."
                  "Cameron! Cameron! you will not, you cannot leave me thus."
                  "And why should I linger? To be in sound of your voice, yet forbidden to hear it; in sight of your form, yet forbidden to approach. What am I now but a tresspasser on a domain which has been forbidden me? For no other cause save the one which brings me here now, no! not even to escape death, should my feet have pressed your stepfather's soil. He believes the reports in circulation about me, and wrote to me that until they were cleared up, my visits, which to some members of his family"—and a slight sneer, suppressed by Ida's reproachful glance, writhed his lip—"had never been agreeable, must cease altogether. My father never loved me, Ida. It seems a strange thing to say, but I believe his feelings towards me are rather those of hatred, for certainly he has seized every occasion which has ever presented itself to persecute me. But I need not pain you by lingering on this. It is enough that I am now an outcast."
                  He spoke calmly and steadily, but his voice was hoarse with suppressed emotion, and the fulness of concentrated despair.
                  "There was one, dearest, who believed you innocent, ere your own word confirmed it, who would believe your simple assertion against the oaths of the world, who will never forsake you, come what will. Yes, Cameron, outcast as you are do not leave me; take me to what fate I care not, so it is shared with you."
                  "Ida, dearest, I beseech you not to unman me thus. If this brand on my honor shall be cleared away, as I feel ere long it must be, I will return to you, and we will brave the world together."
                  "Ah! let us brave it now, Cameron. I told you in brighter days than these, that we could wait and hope. But now when the shadow of the world's frown is upon you, when most you need a woman's holy, consoling tenderness, can I too desert you? You little understand the nature of a true woman if you could for a moment imagine such a thing."
                  Involuntarily she drew nearer. She clung to him as if to convince herself that it was indeed his tangible self, and no vision of her dreams.
                  Cameron hesitated. There was a mighty war within his heart, but Honor rose high above the tumult of feeling, and pointed unwaveringly to the right course.
                  "Dearest, you know not what you ask. You, who can read the innermost depths of my heart, must feel better than I can express it, how I appreciate your noble generosity, your self-sacrificing affection. I have indeed won in you a true woman, but I would be a recreant, unworthy a thought, could I drag such a being from the luxurious comforts and tender care of her home, to share the comfortless life and terrible hardships which await the wife of a penniless soldier. Forgive me, love, but you have only heard of these things. You have no idea what the reality would be."
                  
                  Ida fixed her tearful reproachful gaze upon him as she answered, "You fancy that hardship, suffering, would cause me to repent my resolution. You do not love me as I believed, or—"
                  "Ida! Ida! do not speak thus. You know not how much it cost me to say those words. I love you with the passion, the truth, the romance of my boyhood, with all the strength, the changeless endurance of manhood. In my dreams I have murmured your name, coupling it with the holy one of wife, as I could never breathe that of another. Loving you thus, could I take advantage of your sacrificial devotion? Could I give the world a just right to brand with censure the name which is so dear to you? No, I must go my weary way alone. But you, Ida, you will think of, pray for me sometimes? And by the solitary watchfire, in the dreary march, or the maddening battle-field, I will bear with me an amulet against all danger, the remembrance of the waiting, watching angel of my love. For the last time, perhaps for many a year, Ida, my own beloved, farewell."
                  She spoke not, moved not, as if stricken beyond the power of words. He clasped her in his embrace, gave one long look into those unfathomable eyes, relinquished her, as if with her he gave up life, hope, reason too, and rushed wildly from the spot. Feeling as if her life-blood had ceased to flow, and gathered in cold curdling drops around her heart, Ida threw herself on the damp grass, resting her arm on the wicker seat, and her burning head on her arm, as if she sought to shut out all sights and sounds of earth. The evening shadows gathered darkly and heavily around her, and her hair was heavy and wet with dew, but still she lingered until aroused by the voice of Aunt Miranda.
                  "Lor' bless my soul, honey! you gon't stay here all night? Your ma be uneasy to death 'bout you. Git up and come 'long home."
                  Her words fell on Ida's car with the harsh grating which all indifferent sights and sounds produce, when absorbed by one overpowering grief, but mechanically she rose, and proceeded to the house followed by the garrulous old negro.
                  "I know'd 'twas goin' to be jest so, soon as you see Mass Cameron, but lor' I couldn't help givin' you the note. I say to myself 'poor little thing, for all she laugh and talk so, I know she got trouble hid under all that, and 'twill do her heart good to hear from him. Mass Cameron is as nice a gentleman as walks, I don't cear who the next is. Never mind, honey, it will all come round at last. Miranda ain't no fool nigger mun. She ain't lived so long for nothin', and I tell you 'fore our blessed 'Deemer and all the 'Postles that things will come out all right at last."
                  And thus the good-hearted nurse proceeded to pour her condolences into the unheeding ear of her passive suffering listener, who unobserved gained her own room, locked the door, and sat down to muse over her last interview with Cameron, to recall his every look and tone, to glance fearfully into the troublous uncertain future, and to weep.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XLVIII.
                  IT was indeed true, that the clarion trump of war was sounding far and wide over the land.
                  The brave hearts of the great Republic rose up, some in burning indignation at the conduct of Mexico, some mad- dened by the phantom of glory, which makes the young ever ready to seize the weapon which is to be laved in blood, as brother fights against brother, in the great war of Humanity; others allured by visions of the far off beautiful land, with its fields of ever living verdure, its sunny streams and golden treasures.
                  An exile from his own fair home, an outcast from every hearth where his heart had cherished an affection, or garnered a hope, well might Cameron Haughton be eager to answer the call for "Men and Soldiers!" which penetrated to every home in our broad land. He joined the corps of volunteers about to depart for Mexico, obtaining the command of one of the regiments, with perfect ease, owing to his experience in the army and perfect knowledge of military tactics.
                  To his career in Mexico he looked forward with that feverish ardent anticipation, with which the soul, maddened by the forced severance from all to which it clung closest, rushes blindly in its bleeding agony, to any resource which promises oblivion.
                  The general hilarity with which the troops sought to drown the mournful thoughts of parting, and the warm welcome of many of his boon companions, who were henceforth to be his sharers in danger, as they had once been in chase and revel, sufficed to banish in some slight degree the feelings which oppressed him.
                  The sole relics of the hopes which had lent their evanescent brightness to his dreams of the future, hopes now dying darkly and coldly amid the scenes which had warmed them into life, the sole relics of the bright, but too deceitful past, which were to accompany the exile to a foreign land, was a ringlet of dark hair, nestling close to his heart, and a fair pictured face smiling from its case of virgin gold, with eyes whose gaze was deep and dreamy, with intense love.
                  It was half past one, the night before the departure of the troops, and alone in his room at the Exchange Hotel, the disinherited son sat, with cold hands clasped to his burning temples, musing moodily over the dying ashes of the hearthstone.
                  In this hour all that he had sacrificed crowded upon him. Wild and bitterly thronged the thoughts of his betrothed, the parting scene, her clinging love, his stern sacrifice to what he believed duty and honor; and the desolation of heart to which he had left her. For a moment his own heart rebelled at the course he had taken; but for a moment, and conscience came to his aid. Then uprose the picture of the fair home he never more might see, the lordly forests he loved so well, tossing their green leaves as joyously in the sunlight, as though he still wandered in woodland sport beneath their shades; every nook and stream, hill and glade, familiar to his eyes, and bound to his heart alike by sad and sunny memories, the grey turrets of the old stone house, the dogs which were wont to greet his coming so gladly, the slaves with whom he was a general favorite, and the lonely old halls with their stern cold master. All these things would be just as they were now perhaps, when his bones lay stark and white on the burning plains of the war-land. No one to remember, no one to care, save one lone woman, whose life would be so desolated by the remembrance, that he could only pray that she might in mercy forget, though he felt in his inmost soul how vain was the supplication.
                  Bitter and wounding, even to the heart's core, were these thoughts, and the surrounding circumstances, the waning candles, the dying embers and solitary hour, the wind howling without its mournful parting requiem, all conspired to deepen the gloom of his reflections.
                  A light tap on the door startled him.
                  He did not answer, not wishing to be disturbed.
                  Another and louder rap and Delham burst into the room.
                  Cameron started to his feet.
                  Delham seized the outstretched hand and pressed it warmly. "My dear fellow!"
                  "Why, Del! I thought you were out of town?"
                  "Out of town? I am en route for Mexico to-morrow morning, by your leave."
                  "I'm delighted, my dear fellow! We are sworn brothers in arms from this time forth."
                  "Yes," and a shade of sadness darkened Delham's bright face. "We both love her, Cam; let it be a bond of life and death between us."
               
               
                  CHAPTER XLIX.
                  "FAREWELL, Virginia! Beneath thy cloudless skies I have wept my bitterest tears; from thy rich soil reaped the bread which turned to ashes on my lip; in thee have I found foes where I looked only for friends, and yet I do not curse thee. Thou hast warm hearts and true, which more than redeem thee, and remembering these, I waft a blessing to thy sunny shore, fair land of beauty."
                  'Twas thus that an exile's thoughts breathed themselves into words, as he leaned over the prow of the boat, to give one last look at the fading shores of the noble river, which was fast bearing him away from home and love.
                  At the same moment, at the window of a stately mansion in Richmond, a single form—a woman's—watched with agonized eyes the fleeting track of the vessel.
                  A strain of music, mournful, passionate, wild as the lament over a fallen angel, broke upon her ear.
                  It was the farewell of the band who had witnessed the departure of the troops.
                  Farewell was breathed in every swelling note, and vibrated in thrilling agony on Ida's heart-strings, to be echoed there long, long afterwards.
               
            
            
               
               BOOK II.
               
                  CHAPTER I.
                  I ALWAYS endeavor to preserve in every character and circumstance portrayed, the strict unities of Truth and Human Nature.
                  To a casual observer, the love existing between two such opposites as my hero and heroine, may seem rather opposed to probability; but I am sure one who looks farther into cause and effect, will agree with me in pronouncing it the most natural thing in the world.
                  Ida herself, the perfect type of all that was feminine, delicate in organization, and timid,—notwithstanding her sometime flashes of spirit,—worshipped in Cameron the type of manliness, bravery, health, strength, and energy. Perhaps, in some respects, the intellect of the woman was superior; that is, she had more of those finer gifts of genius to which men in all ages have yielded homage; more of that rare union of ideality and passion, which gives to the harp of poesy the chord which vibrates in the hearts of the multitude; and it was better so: for these qualities, in the exquisite fineness of their moral texture, suit better a woman than a man.
                  
                  The world may drink in the passionate incense, which genius burns on the shrine of feeling, until their whole moral nature becomes purified and elevated; but the "spirits finely moulded," which have given birth to thoughts like these, suit not to come in contact with the jagged edges and rude paths of common life.
                  Within the world of her own home a woman of fine intellect and feelings may, unless opposed by extraordinary adverse influences, create an atmosphere redolent of all that the most dreamy and ideal worshipper of the holy and beautiful could desire; but a man must tread rough paths; he must come in contact with the coarse and vulgar elements which compose a portion of the world; and, alas! it needs not to tell how often the children of Poesy have laved their spirit plumes, in the muddy turbid waters of the world's Recklessness and Vice.
                  It needs not to tell; for their fall, like that of the Children of Light in the olden time, is never forgotten. The remembrance, like a shadowy pall, darkens future ages with its influence.
                  But to return to the more immediate theory of our present discussion.
                  Nature created men and women in pairs. There can be no more doubt of this than of the laws of affinity, in the science of chemistry. There is the essence of truth in the homely saying, "Matches were made in heaven, but they get terribly mixed coming down."
                  There is for every one a spirit-mate; one who morally, mentally, and physically, must gratify every necessity of our being; with whom to live would be happiness: such happiness as would at once ennoble and elevate our nature, bringing it nearer to that of the angels.
                  And in our search for a being like this, we often pass them in our own blind folly, rather than through the influence of that fabled power men call Destiny.
                  Allured by some passing meteor, turned aside by convenience, caprice, passion, we wander from the star whose light in after years we remember, with the vain prayer,— 
                        
                           "Oh! would it shone to guide us still
                           Altho' to death or deadliest ill."
                        
                     
                  
                  What is the ideal cherished, even though vaguely in the mind of every one, but a dreamy sense, an unconscious divination—if I may so express it—of the existence of a being formed by nature to blend with, and become a part of, ourselves?
                  The loves of a lifetime,—what are they but the illusions of an hour, when, deceived by some passing resemblance, we cry Eureka! and think the bourne is found,—until the heart disappointed recoils upon itself, or circumstance mercifully tears the counterfeit from our clinging grasp.
                  God forbid that there should be many loves in a lifetime—for 'tis a sad thing, nay 'tis a sin, to waste on many feelings which should be the hoarded wealth of one; like the scattering drops of a rare perfume which sweeten the common atmosphere, but can never return to the source from whence they emanated.
                  I have sometimes thought there might be an inner fount shut deep in the soul, never to be unsealed save at the magic touch, never to give forth its wealth of thrilling bliss and unalloyed sweetness to aught save the one.
                  
                  'Tis a blessed belief! And yet how sad it is to reflect that many live who are destined never to have the seal removed from the lip of the fountain; many, too, who are surrounded by all the nearer ties of life: ties formed in haste by the force of circumstance, convenience, expediency. Far better to live and die alone, than thus to rebel against the good angel of our nature, clasping the cold corpse of happiness, while its soul sleeps in the unsealed fount of our own bosom, or animates the form of the far-off unseen being, between whom and ourselves we have opened an impassable gulf.
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  WEARILY enough, to Ida, rolled away the days, after the events of the last few chapters. Nor was she alone in her sad feelings. A coming misfortune, long looked for, but growing nearer and nearer, cast its shadow dark and broad over the very portal of the old home. Willie seemed to sink with the first chill of the autumn blast. We will not detail the rapid crumbling of the fair, frail tabernacle, the beautiful passing away of the young spirit, so pure, so gentle, so love-inspired, that it seemed as if he already inhaled the breath of Paradise. Nay, one could almost hear the wings of unseen angels, as they hovered over his couch, whispering sweet messages of the "far off Land" to the dying boy.
                  At last one day he died. The November day was dying too, with its soft golden sunbeams, and balmy breeze, and the last perfumes of drooping flowers. Every thing about the hall was silent with the solemn stillness of death. The servants were assembled without, the family within the chamber, to "see their loved one look his last on earth." Now and then a stifled sob was heard from Kate or the children. A holy unbroken stillness rested on the hearts of the others.
                  Willie's face beamed with a seraphic expression, even his sightless eyes seemed filled with the light of a divine inspiration.
                  "Mother, are you very near me?"
                  "Yes, my child," and she bent over him, and took his fast stiffening hands within her own.
                  "Mother, tell them not to weep. I am only going home. Going home to heaven, mother. If I could only see you all. Only look upon you once more. Come near. Let me touch you."
                  One by one they came around him, and pressed his hand or kissed his brow, while he murmured softly:
                  "This is my father, my dear father, and this is Noble. Good brother, be kind to our father and mother. Comfort and support their old age. And this is Ida. Dear sister, Willie prays for your happiness. Kate, Minnie, Nina, where are you? Ah! there!" And as the two children, in awe-struck silence, pressed their warm rosy lips to his, he passed his thin fingers feebly through their shining hair, as if blessing them, and continued, in tones so faint that they almost died ere they reached the shrinking hearts around him, "Mother, put your arms around me. I would die on your bosom, mother."
                  She obeyed him, drawing his head close to her breast.
                  The last autumn sunbeam threw its halo-radiance an instant over his features, ere it disappeared from earth for ever.
                  It lit up the marble outlines of a corpse.
                  Willie's sun had set too, but it rose again in heaven.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER III.
                  KATE'S marriage was postponed on account of Willie's death, till the following spring, and slowly the winter days rolled onward.
                  Ida could not have corresponded openly with her lover, without incurring the displeasure of her family, and her spirit revolted from the espionage necessary for a regularly clandestine correspondence. Occasionally a friendly epistle from Delham reached her, and, with his characteristic generosity, a portion of it was always filled with praises of Cameron,—his bravery and gallant exploits.
                  The army had already commenced the series of victories which rendered the conquest of Mexico one of the most brilliant campaigns on the records of history.
                  Several times the name of Cameron was mentioned, in the despatches of his commander, in terms which made her heart swell with pride and gratitude.
                  The family went out but little, and at home saw only their intimate friends. Fannie Bonford was much with Kate again. Noble was as devoted now as of old, and if their estrangement was remembered, it was only to add new zest to their present happiness.
                  "By the way, Kate," said Fannie one day, during the temporary absence of Ida from the room, "I have never mentioned to you my meeting with a cousin of Cameron Haughton, a student from Louisiana, during my summer visit at the University of Virginia. I never saw such a resemblance between two persons. I met him full face one day, coming into my cousin Prof. ——'s house, and mistook him for Cameron himself, and thinking his visit was intended for me, I rushed up, held out both hands, and cried, 'Oh! I am so glad to see you! How are Ida and dear Kate, and all of them?' Imagine my confusion, when he drew back with an astonished air, and a strange voice said, 'I beg your pardon. May I have the honor of knowing by whom I am so kindly addressed?' He visited me quite often after that, and I found him excessively agreeable, though, like poor Cameron, he is unfortunately wild."
                  Mrs. St. John's work had fallen from her trembling hands during Fannie's recital, and she listened with fixed eyes and absorbed attention, a lightning thought flashing through her brain.
                  "Why did you never mention this young man before, Fannie?"
                  "Because when I first returned it would have been egotistical, to have intruded on your grief the idle details of my visit, and then, too, I never like to allude to Cameron before Ida."
                  The same thought had simultaneously struck Kate and her mother.
                  "Mamma, may it not be, after all that Cameron is innocent? May it not be, that this young man, presuming on this great resemblance, has palmed off his errors on his cousin?"
                  "Do you allude," said Fannie, rather warmly, "to the reports at the Springs, last summer? I think you are wrong in your conjectures, for Charlie Haughton, except a flying trip North, spent last summer in Charlottesville."
                  The fact is, Charlie Haughton was an admirer of Fannie, and women are weak on those subjects.
                  "Are you sure of that, Fan?"
                  
                  "Certainly. I was there all the time, and he told me about his trip to Niagara."
                  "How long was he absent?"
                  "Why, you would make a good lawyer, Kate. I'm sure I didn't count the days and hours of his absence. Probably it was some three weeks."
                  "You say his habits are bad?"
                  "Well, he is wild."
                  "It is strange, we never heard Cameron speak of his cousin."
                  "Not at all so. Charlie told me he had not met his cousin since the removal of Cameron's father from Louisiana to Virginia, since which time there has been no correspondence between them. They were both children then. I remember too, his saying that as a child he was smaller than Cameron, and very delicate, that he used to wish to be strong and beautiful like his cousin, and how he revelled now, in the consciousness of their great resemblance. But, dear me, it is time for me to go. Ma will wait tea."
                  "Nonsense, ma chère amie. Stay with me. We will have a moonlight ride home, and I'll spend the night with you. Come, I want to show you the budding glories of a Cuban exotic Arthur sent me yesterday."
               
               
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  MR. ST. JOHN had drawn his green morocco easy chair before the bright fire in the library—for the evening was unusually chilly for the season—given a turn to the solar lamp on the table beside him, and in dressing-gown and slippers, the picture of luxurious comfort, was proceeding to cut the leaves of a new "Southern Planter," when Mrs. St. John entered with her usual quiet step, her little key basket on her arm, which, like many Southern housewives, she habitually carried, though admittance to every receptacle in the house was open to the servants.
                  There was a look of anxious thought on her brow, and Mr. St. John's "Well, my dear?" and laying aside his pamphlet, was answered by the rather abrupt query:
                  "My husband, the innocent are often condemned on circumstantial evidence. Do you not think it best—if possible—that we should possess ourselves personally of the facts in young Haughton's affair at the Springs, rather than judge him by hearsay?"
                  Mr. St. John looked straight into the fire for a moment, and then answered her question by another.
                  "Admitting his innocence in this case were once proved, would you then consent to his union with Ida?"
                  "Never! never!"
                  The delicate features grew rigid as marble, and the small white teeth were clenched.
                  Her husband gazed on her intently, but he was unskilled in reading the deeper emotions.
                  Had he resembled in character the father of Cameron Haughton, he would have read enough, in that one expression, to bid him probe to the heart-depths of its betrayer. But a life little alternated by fierce excitement, or overwrought feeling, had never taught him to lift the veil of the outer life, to gaze upon the mysteries of the inner.
                  Brought up, for the most part, in a quiet country neighborhood, he had mixed too little with the great world at large, to reflect that what appears on the surface is often but a stage show, and that 'tis behind the curtain we must look for realities.
                  How little such things depend on time.
                  Many a city youth of eighteen or twenty, might have taught the staid country gentleman of forty-five, knowledge of the world.
                  He did not question his wife further, but listened quietly while she detailed the substance of the conversation with Fannie.
                  "Certainly, my dear wife, nothing could be more proper than your idea that this affair should be investigated. I will ride over to the Park to-morrow, and confer with Mr. Haughton on the subject."
                  His wife laid her hand entreatingly on his arm.
                  "Nay, my husband, you know what a strange person Mr. Haughton is. Say nothing to him, but attend to this matter yourself."
                  "Why, it is his affair, not mine."
                  "If we depend on him," exclaimed Mrs. St. John, despairingly, "I believe the affair will remain as it is. Remember you have been Cameron's friend, you have been his father's friend. How much delicacy, how much generosity and kindness of feeling it would show, were you to undertake yourself this mission of justice, which might probably end in the reconciliation of father and son."
                  "Very true, and most eloquently argued. The best plan then to pursue, would be to see young Haughton in person,—letters always involve uncertainties,—and possess myself of the facts. I have no doubt, in my own mind, that he is the real Simon Pure. I will go to Charlottesville to-morrow."
               
               
                  CHAPTER V.
                  MR. ST. JOHN arrived in Charlottesville in a driving rain, and securing a carriage, proceeded at once to the University, too much absorbed in the object of his journey to heed the dreary comfortless atmosphere, the dark misty landscape, or the few mud-stained, dripping pedestrians, which were the sole objects that met his gaze.
                  Learning from the janitor the number of young Haughton's room, and proceeding down the long arcades, and following the numbers on the doors, he reached the narrow smoky domicile, six feet by ten, yclept a student's dormitory, which bore on a small tin plate the name he sought, and knocked.
                  Within this room, lounging in dressing-gowns, and cigars in mouth, a party of young men were seated at cards. Several black bottles adorned the table, which was further decorated with tumblers emitting a not very savory odor, and a cloud of smoke obscured every object.
                  "I say," said one, "don't open that door. It may be the Chairman himself."
                  "Pooh! C—— is too much of a gentleman, to break in on us, a wet day like this, when a fellow is obliged to keep up his spirits. It is that d—— janitor, after me to go before the faculty, I'll wager a V."
                  "Let him in! Let him in! We'll have some sport. We'll make him take a hand, or else tie him to the bedpost."
                  The knock was repeated.
                  The door was opened, and a young man, so like Cameron Haughton, as to stagger Mr. St. John, presented himself to the view of the latter.
                  He took the card extended to him, and read in substantial capitals, "John St. John."
                  "And your name is—?"
                  "Charles Haughton, sir, at your service. Come in, and be seated. I'm sorry you find my room in such confusion. Bad day this to be out. Take something to drink? Here, Butler, you've emptied this bottle. Look in that closet, and hand out the brandy."
                  "I beg your pardon, I will take nothing, but will call again, when I can have some private conversation with you."
                  "Private conversation, the devil!" thought Haughton. "What does the old cove mean?" but he said aloud, "Oh! you can have it now," then turning to the others, with the air of a privileged character, he added:—"I say, boys, this gentleman wishes to have a private talk with me; so oblige me eternally, by vanishing, without further notice, from the premises."
                  The half-fuddled collegians, in no wise disturbed by this unceremonious request, rose, helped themselves to fresh cigars, cast a lingering look at the black bottles, and departed.
                  "Now, sir, I am ready to hear what you have to communicate."
                  Mr. St. John was not a man to trouble himself with many words, when a few would answer the purpose. Besides he was convinced of the identity of the individual before him, with the pseudo Cameron Haughton, of the Springs; so he calmly replied,—"Are you aware, sir, that your career at the White Sulphur Springs, last summer, has done great injury to your cousin, Cameron Haughton, with whom you were by some mistake identified?"
                  Haughton started from his chair with astonishment.
                  "It's no use denying the truth," thought he, "for it is evident that he is in possession of all the facts." He then answered with assumed carelessness. "I was at the Springs last summer, and was mistaken for my cousin,—an illusion, which in the mere spirit of mischief, I kept up, or rather submitted to, without making any strenuous efforts to disprove the charge; but as to my bringing disgrace on the name of Haughton," and he drew himself up haughtily, "it is not my father's son who would be likely to do that. To what rumors do you allude?"
                  Mr. St. John acquainted him briefly with the reports afloat concerning Cameron Haughton, and also informed him of the unhappy estrangement between the father and son, which he believed originated from no other cause.
                  Spite of the reckless and prematurely depraved character of Charles Haughton, there was a latent spark of nobleness in his nature, which was aroused by the conviction of the full extent of wrong his criminal course had inflicted on an innocent man.
                  "By heaven! this is too bad. You will see, sir, that if I have wronged him, I know how to make reparation. I will accompany you home, and announce in person the true offender. As to the report of my stooping to win money from any one, by unfair means, it is an utter falsehood. For the rest, my cousin's character is none of the steadiest, and, therefore, I thought a few fresh sins would not injure it materially, and the truth was, I wanted to preserve an incognito, that no inkling of my whereabout might reach my infernal duns, until I obtained the funds to satisfy their demands."
                  He was as good as his word, and but a few days elapsed before the innocence of Cameron Haughton was substantiated, in the eyes of all, who refusing his own testimony, had so bitterly condemned him.
                  So prone are we to admire the magnanimity which induces a person to atone for an error, that we often feel more kindly towards those who have sinned against us, and repented, than those towards whom we have never been called upon to exercise the virtue of forgiveness.
                  Thus Charlie Haughton was received kindly at Hunting-wild, and pressed to extend his visit a week in length; an invitation which he with the utmost sang froid accepted.
                  "I suppose," he said with a shrug, "I ought to stay with my monastic old chip of an uncle; but by Jove, the hermit life he leads in those old cloisters (I can find no better name for the Park) would put an end to my existence in a week. When I announced, with all due meekness, my little masquerading frolic, expecting to be overwhelmed with a torrent of virtuous indignation, he merely looked a little colder, no, that was impossible, he was an iceberg before,—well, a little stiffer, and said,—'I am glad to have received this explanation. My house is at your service during your stay.' "I couldn't stand that, so I broke in with, 'Well, I suppose it will be all right between Cameron and yourself now?' Slap, dash! in my face, like a bucket of cold water on a frosty morning, came the words, 'I do not recognize the right of any one, sir, to inquire into my private affairs.' I'll let you know I was not long in escaping from that atmosphere. Ugh! what a man! It makes me shiver to think of him."
                  Charles Haughton possessed much of that careless light-toned gayety and agreeable manner, which often buys forgiveness for very grave faults, and the worst sin he had committed towards his cousin—for the report of unfair play at the Springs, was in reality false—the assumption of his dress and name at the faro bank in Richmond, was as yet unknown to the St. Johns.
                  He joined in Noble's sports and pursuits during the day, with the heartiest enjoyment apparently; listened admiringly to Kate's ballads in the evening; gave up Fannie with the most ready grace in the world to her betrothed; and in short rendered himself such an agreeable inmate of the family, that his departure created quite a little vacuum in the household. The emotions he caused Ida were strangely mingled with pleasure and pain.
                  His resemblance to Cameron threw around him that charmed halo, with which we invest any object in the remotest degree connected with or resembling the one beloved, but she felt that he was but a counterfeit after all, a portrait which, however correct in other respects, the artist Nature had forgotten to stamp with the seal of nobility so plainly set on her lover's brow.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  A CALM, deep sense of joy pervaded the breast of Ida, now that the innocence of her lover was established in the eyes of the world. She could not find it in her heart to deny herself the pleasure of being the first to communicate the intelligence to him, and she did so in a letter, filled with fair, hopeful prophecies for the future, and all her true heart's burden of tenderness. She could not but believe that a reconciliation must take place between the father and son; and unable to fathom the motives of her mother's continued opposition, attributing it to an idle, though deeply- rooted prejudice, she resolved, no longer sacrificing her feelings to filial duty, to become the wife of Cameron Haughton, should the fortunes of war ever suffer him to return.
                  Sometimes she thought of naming this resolve to her mother, but day after day passed away, and often as the confession of her purpose trembled on her lips, it never went farther. At last she came to the conclusion, that to disclose it thus prematurely would be to involve herself in a family controversy, which would not only render her unhappy, but prey upon the yet drooping spirits of Mrs. St. John. And then came a new resolve, to postpone it until the crisis of its fulfilment arrived; and that might be, alas! a long time off, nay, perhaps it might never come.
                  And thus the winter wore slowly away, until the brilliant battle of Buena Vista trumpeted once more to the world the triumph of American arms; and again was the name of Cameron Haughton among the list of heroes, whose fame was borne on every breeze.
                  Distinguished by his perfect knowledge of l'art militaire, his invincible bravery, and universal popularity, he had already risen in command, was high in the favor of the Commander-in-chief; and the highest honors of war seemed within his grasp.
                  An interval of time, sufficient to have brought Ida an answer to her letter, had elapsed, before these "glad tidings of great joy" had come. To her, one line from the beloved hand, one word which his eyes had rested on, would have been more than volumes of intelligence from any other source. Her letter might never have reached him. In the uncertainty of his present position nothing was more probable.
                  The usual talk and excitement, consequent on the announcement of any great public event, succeeded the news of the battle, and for a time all again was quiet.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  SPRING came. The peach and apple blossoms opened their rosy treasures to the wooing bee, the breath of violets stole softly up from every grassy nook, the deep, glad inspiration of the broad free country, braced the being and kindled the life-blood, and "our Kate" was a bride.
                  On a day as sunny and gladsome as herself, 
                        
                           ——"That light and girlish thing,
                           Gave up her maiden feeedom for a name and for a ring."
                        
                     
                  
                  The family being yet in mourning, the wedding was quiet, and amid the troops of friends, congratulations, tears, and smiles, the happy pair set out on their bridal tour to Europe.
                  These were sad hours at Huntingwild. Noble and Fannie, absorbed in the happiness of their betrothal, gave little time or heed to aught beside.
                  The sparkling life, which had at times given to the society of Ida a fascination which exorcised all grief in her presence, had given place to an absorbing thought, a quivering, painful suspense, which fevered her cheek, and made her brain at times feel wild and strange. The parents took not so much note of this as they might, for their thoughts were with the child on the wild sea, whose laugh had scarcely yet ceased to echo in her girlhood's home, whose tears of parting were scarcely yet dry; but yesterday, a child, dancing at her mother's knee, to-day, a wife, with all the responsibilities of the woman's mission to fulfil.
                  Would she be equal to the task? Would the young, high-spirited lover be the tender, forbearing husband, whose love, like the lone star which shone above their bark, should guide her through all dangers to the Haven of Rest and Peace? Would his tenderness never fail?—his voice be always gentle to reprove, quick to speak the sweet words of forgiveness?
                  "God grant it!" implored the mother in her nightly prayers.
                  And thus passed time, and no tidings came to Ida, no tidings from the far-off one; not even a line from the friendly hand of her old, true friend Delham. This moral atmosphere of suspense was sombre enough and hard to endure, but she might have thanked God for the mist of uncertainty which shut from her gaze the heavy lightning-charged cloud which gloomed darkly in the horizon of the future.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VIII.
                  THE long hours numbered themselves into days, the days into weeks, until a month, nay almost two, had passed, and brought no news from Mexico.
                  The mails from the far South had failed, the telegraphic lines at some points were out of order, etc., etc., were the explanations volunteered by Noble and his father.
                  The incessant watching and distressful agitation Ida had gone through by the death-bed of Madame D'Allure, combined with the painful circumstances which at the same time surrounded her in other respects, and the after loss of her brother (whom she loved with all the tenderness a nature like hers feels for that which, helpless and lovely, demands unceasing care and protection), though they pro- duced no violent effects at once, told deeply, if gradually, on a physique far too delicate to bear the wear and tear of intense mental excitement or silent corroding care.
                  From the absorbing and changing nature of their outdoor pursuits, there are few men who understand from experience the feelings we seek to describe, but there are fewer women who have not at some period of their lives been victims to that painful thought, that ever present sorrow, and wearing suspense, which drains the fountain of the heart's life, and makes even the ordinary avocations and necessities of our daily existence a burden too heavy for the fainting spirit.
                  Who has not turned away from the family meal—ordinarily a pleasant reunion—from the familiar walks, from the light fancy-work which once so pleasantly beguiled time, from book, bird, and flower, with that weary sickness of the soul, which robs life of any power to bestow pleasure?
                  Who has not felt that even from the morning sky of youth the rose light may fade away? from its garden of sweets the brightest flowers be rifled? And what is left us for consolation? Tears! woman's secret, bootless tears!
                  'Twas thus Ida felt as the hours "dragged their slow length along," prolonged as she thought, into an infinity of torture.
                  Pale as marble, and utterly spiritless as she was, it needed but some sudden shock to arouse the fever-fiend which slumbered in her veins.
                  Cameron had left Bruno—his old and faithful companion—at Huntingwild—ostensibly to the care of Noble, with whom he had ever preserved the friendliest relations.
                  Ida understood and appreciated the delicacy of the act.
                  The noble dog was her daily, almost hourly companion—for when they returned from their solitary walk, he crouched at her feet and slept, or sat idly with forepaws extended and crossed over each other, and great kindly eyes fixed upon her, with a sort of protecting expression, as she languidly sketched, read, or explained her picture-books to little Nina.
                  Often, even during the depths of winter, with Bruno by her side, she had sought the clump of cedars, and from the drear aspect of Nature, the keenness of the fierce blast, as it swept over her cheek, the wild, superstitious character of the spot itself, she had derived a sort of mysterious sympathy.
                  Now that spring had come, her visits were increased in frequency, since her absence was not so likely to excite remark; but there is something in blue sunny skies, and green-robed hills and balmy breezes, which seems to mock sorrow, even as a smiling face insults a mourner's grief.
                  How changed was every thing since spring had last rained fragrance and blossom and dew on the earth. Then the future offered such golden promises! Now the friend who had then seemed so guileless and true, from whom she had afterwards learned such a fearful lesson of deceit, but whom nevertheless—returning good for evil—she had wept by to the last—the trusted friend, the false woman—was in her grave, the violets were blooming over Willie's narrow earth-bed too; Kate, her beloved sister, was in a foreign land, happy, 'tis true, but still with land and sea and time between her and the fond hearts calling her home. And Cameron, ever nearest, ever dearest, where was he, amid blood and strife and death,—dangers she dared not dwell upon, lest the fearful picture should drive her to madness.
                  With a pardonable deception, proceeding from her old fear of causing pain, she never confided to her mother all her sadness, nay, she even strove to appear gay in her presence.
                  The season was unusually warm, the breath of April dur- ing some days vying with that of July, and with the first breath of hot air which reached her, came a fever flush to Ida's cheek.
                  Her indisposition daily and rapidly increased, but still she strove to conceal it, until nearly a week after she had felt the first symptoms, it grew to such an alarming extent that she felt it imperatively necessary to seek her mother's advice.
                  Striving to forget or overcome her unpleasant feelings, she had wandered in the morning, with the children, for an hour or two in the woods, but the warm sun only increased her fearful headache and fever.
                  Returning thoroughly exhausted, she threw herself on her cushions at the open window, and leaning her head on the sill, watched for Noble's return. He had gone into town, and was to return to dinner. Perhaps he would bring a letter!
                  O! faint, long deferred, sickening hope!
                  At last, weary of watching, she took a book and strove to read, but the letters swam before her, her brain reeled, a sickening oppression rose in her chest, and in a paroxysm of pain she dropped the volume from her cold, clammy hands, and with tottering steps sought her mother's chamber.
                  Mrs. St. John was not there, but feeling unable to proceed farther, Ida staggered to the little sleeping couch of the children, and falling exhausted upon it, sunk into a lethargic, troubled sleep.
                  In the day-time, to keep it out of the way, the couch was always wheeled into the recess between the wall and the large old-fashioned bedstead of the parents.
                  With that spirit of procrastination, for which Southern families are famous, the heavy winter curtains of damask, had not been removed from the larger bed, and this, together with its height, entirely shut the little couch from view.
                  
                  Added to this fact, the couch was never used except at night, the children preferring for their afternoon siesta a lounge in the more airy sitting-room.
                  In warm weather the blinds of the chamber were always closed during the day, to exclude heat and flies, and render it a pleasant sleeping room, and thus it was seldom entered by any one but Mrs. St. John.
                  Ida could not have chosen a more effectual spot for concealment, had such been her design, but of this she little thought.
                  She had fallen into one of those troubled, fevered visions, which sometimes take so strangely the hues of reality.
                  It seemed in her dream that Noble, looking pale and distressed, galloped rapidly to the door, threw himself from his horse, asked hurriedly "where is Ida?" and handed his father a packet of papers bearing different dates, and a letter, sealed with black.
                  
                  She saw her father's lip quiver as he read the first lines. She heard him speak a few torturing words to her mother. She heard that mother's burst of wailing agony, and started wildly from her sleep.
                  The groan, at least, was reality. Ida listened as if spellbound. The room had another occupant, and that occupant was giving vent to low moans, so replete with human torture, that the cold walls might almost have echoed a response.
                  But what were the words which scorched with lightning scathe the senses of the hearer.
                  "Cameron, my son! my son! My first-born! My best beloved! So young! So brave and true—to die thus! Stricken to the dust without parent or friend beside him. To die all alone! all alone. Oh, God! did I deserve this, too?"
                  Was it a delusion of her burning brain? Was it an un- real vision, as starting up she parted in breathless silence the curtains, and saw her mother's form kneeling prostrate at the opposite side of the bed, her head buried in the clothes?
                  With one bound Ida was by her side, her icy fingers grasping her arm with unnatural strength, her fevered eyes glaring upon her.
                  "Mother! mother! What meant those words? What did you say?"
                  "Ida!" shrieked Mrs. St. John, "how came you here?"
                  "Answer me! answer me! I implore, I command you, what meant those words. Is Cameron dead? Is he indeed—Oh, God! you know what—speak."
                  Terrified and distressed beyond measure, scarcely knowing what she said, the mother faltered forth:
                  "Cameron was indeed my son, your own brother, and was killed at Cerro Gordo."
                  One wild, spirit-maddened cry, and Ida fell senseless to the floor.
                  The echo of that fearful scream, and the violent lamentations of the unhappy mother, brought the family to the door.
                  Mrs. St. John had barely strength to answer their repeated and agitated summons—and meeting the pale, startled faces of her husband, children, and servants, sunk overpowered into the arms of Mr. St. John.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IX.
                  AND now came the hush of the sick-room, the low murmurs of the anxious watchers, the stifled footfall, the drawn curtains, the solemn array of mysteriously labelled bot- tles, and the monotonous tick of the clock, stealing like a death-watch to the ear in the breathless stillness; the daily, almost hourly visit of the physician, and the midnight vigils beside the couch of the fevered, delirious sufferer.
                  The morning after the scene narrated in the last chapter, Mr. St. John found a packet directed to him in his wife's handwriting, on the little round table in the library.
                  In another instant his eyes ran eagerly and rapidly over the small, agitated characters within the enclosure. 
                        Ida's sick chamber Four o'clock in the morning.
                     
                  
                  At last, for a brief space, the physician has succeeded in bringing repose to the frantic brain of my poor Ida. Even in this fearful hour, when her life hangs on a hairbreadth chance, as some atonement for my error to you, and to her, I would pour forth, my husband, a confession of the past.
                  Had I spoken sooner, the suffering of this crisis might have been spared me. As it is, may I hope for your pardon, your forbearance with my weakness—I had almost said my sin, though God knows I don't think it amounts to that?
                  I was not a widow when you first met me, but a divorced wife.
                  Long ago, when I was young and guileless, I met Cameron Haughton's father.
                  I was alone in the world, so far as love nurture and kind friends were concerned, and the sole guardianship I received, was that of a cold, severe stepmother. He told me that he too was alone in the world. I afterward found wilfully so, for his spendthrift youth and ungovernable passions had driven him from the home of his fathers.
                  He never seemed to lack money, and though we knew nothing, even by hearsay, of his family, it was evident his associations must have been those of birth and breeding.
                  Hush! she stirs, she murmurs "Mother." Oh! that low, pain-fraught cry, it goes to my heart of hearts. Again she is quiet. Let me soothe my troubled pulses and proceed.
                  Owing to the circumstances mentioned above, my stepmother offered no objection to the match. On the contrary, she was but too glad to be rid of me on such good terms.
                  No bridal, it seemed to my unsophisticated eyes, ever offered so fair a prospect of happiness as ours.
                  My husband purchased a beautiful cottage, elaborately furnished with luxurious conveniences and elegant trifles. He practised law in the neighboring village, and for a time all went well.
                  It was not long, however, ere I discovered the tiger-like peculiarities of his temper. I was naturally of a very gay disposition, and it was my delight to mingle in the village balls, and the ofttimes brilliant entertainments given in our large, hospitable and wealthy neighborhood.
                  More than once what he chose to term my lightness and levity on such occasions, drew on me a storm of anger from my husband, which I, feeling conscious of no wrong, felt very much inclined to resent, and, as a matter of course, persisted but the more firmly in what I considered my rights. I am subdued now, but there was flash and steel about me then, such flash and steel as you only find in our blue-eyed, golden-haired women, all the Madonnas of poet and painter to the contrary notwithstanding.
                  At last he told me, with look and tone and gesture which branded themselves as with scorching lightning in my soul, that he had once been deceived by a woman, and was a skeptic as regarded the virtue of the sex.
                  
                  I shall never forget that day. I thought my heart would break then, but worse was to come.
                  My husband's feelings seemed aggravated in violence towards me, from the fact that though far more than a sufficient time had elapsed since our marriage, I gave no symptoms of maternity.
                  I said I was alone. I was, for none of my relatives were near me, but one bright summer's day a cousin came back from sea.
                  Honest Carlton, brave, true-hearted Carlton, I can see your manly, beautiful face beaming upon me now, so full of genuine goodness, of pure affection, even as in those sad years.
                  He had been raised by my father. We had spent our childhood together, and every fond association of my early life was linked with him. Was it to be wondered at that I gladly welcomed the storm-tossed, wave-weary man to my own home?
                  A wound he had received in some naval action, incapacitated him for the present from service, and he was now, he said, cruising around among his friends, dropping his lines longest in the most pleasant spots.
                  He spent nearly three months with us, I treating him as a dear and only brother.
                  I knew my husband did not share my affection for him, but this only drew me nearer to him. I never dreamed that the man I had married would be so vile as to cherish a suspicious thought in connection with us. He never said so, and if he watched I knew it not. I did not then know, that like a wild beast he awaited the best moment for the fatal spring. It was during this period I became pregnant with Cameron.
                  At last Carlton left us to visit his relatives in Virginia.
                  Oh! how the days dragged after his departure. Seeing but little of my husband, for he always left the cottage, after an early breakfast, for the village, and ofttimes did not return until late at night, and finding him, even when he gave me an hour of his society, seldom otherwise than morose and stern; prohibited by my situation from social enjoyments, and missing the kind voice, the cheery smile, the loved companion of many happy hours, sick and weary I pined daily.
                  This did not seem to touch my husband, nay, I fancied that when he noticed my pale cheek and laggard step, his eye would flash, and he would set his teeth with a fiendish expression.
                  His was a strange nature; there was a sort of ferocity even in his love. At times he would devour me with caresses, and avow, that cold proud man, that his whole existence was wrapped in me, and the next hour perchance the hurricane of his wrath would spend its tyrant force upon me. One great reason of this last was my own coldness towards him, for as soon as I learned his real character I ceased to love him, and how could I feign love, how could I yield kindness to one whose bitter burning words scorched my heart and brain? Carlton went off to sea again. Cameron was born, my bright! my beautiful! and bending over his cradle, catching his first infantile lisps, I tasted somewhat of happiness. Yes, absorbed in my child I felt more kindly towards the father, to whom equally with myself he owed his existence. I strove gently, yea, tenderly, to woo him to better ways, and I thought I succeeded. His conduct towards the child was on a par to that he used towards his wife, sometimes a show of love amounting to idol-worship, and then causeless coldness, or perchance harshness. Three years passed, and Ida, the poor suffering being before me, was born. I suffered much after her birth, was excedingly nervous and depressed in spirits, partly from physical causes, partly from anxiety for my babe, whose extreme delicacy gave me constant fears for her life.
                  Instead of sympathizing with and endeavoring to cheer me, the low, nervous depression from which I suffered so deeply, seemed to irritate my husband and arouse all the irascibility of his temper.
                  It was after one of these scenes, when he had left me, maddened with physical pain and crushed in spirit, weak, helpless, with nought on earth to lean upon, that the door of my chamber opened, and Carlton stood before me. Was it not natural that I should rush into his arms? that I should cling to him wildly? that I should weep out my desolation on his bosom?
                  After I had repeatedly embraced my cousin with a fervor which was warmly and tenderly returned, I drew him to the cradle, and pointed to my pale sickly babe, and then I turned with a mother's pride to the proud beautiful boy, who stood gazing in the stranger's face, and pushing the bright curls from his brow said, "He is like you, dear Carlton."
                  Scarcely had the words escaped my lips, when the report of a pistol startled my car, and Carlton fell dead at my feet.
                  Horrified, I turned to meet the fiendish glare of my husband's eyes, as he dashed into the room, the weapon of murder in his grasp.
                  "Woman! devil! 'tis you who have done this. And what are you? too weak, too contemptible a thing for such vengeance, else would I lay you dead at my feet by the side of your paramour. Begone from my sight and take his child, his child I say with you."
                  With one glance at the stiffening bleeding form before me, I clasped my children in my arms, and fled from his presence.
                  I cannot linger upon these recollections. My soul sickens at the skeleton which memory has conjured from the tomb of the past.
                  Haughton went through the formality of a trial, but, with the common justice of the world in such cases, was acquitted. The divorce was easily procured—but my child, my Cameron, he tore from me.
                  It was but on a par with his usual inconsistency, to rob me of the child, his base suspicion had alleged to be another's, while he permitted me to retain the one he knew to be his own.
                  Perhaps her sex, however, might have accounted for this. He did not wish to be troubled with a girl.
                  The friend with whom I had taken a temporary refuge, strongly advised me to seek a home with my relatives in Virginia. I did so. Here, people naturally fell into the mistake that I was a widow, and indeed it was the wish of my relatives that they should do so.
                  The rumor of the divorce case had not reached the quiet shores of the old Dominion. In fact, in the excited state of Texas and the whole Southern frontier, at the time of which I speak, such an event could not engross, for more than a fleeting space, the public mind, even on the scene of its occurrence.
                  I was quiet, retiring, I shrunk from observation. But let me be brief. I met you, I loved you ere I was aware of it. Your quiet sympathy, your genuine unaffected kindness of heart, what balm it offered to my bruised spirit!
                  My relatives strongly urged upon me the expediency of my marriage. They represented, too, most forcibly that a confession, before marriage, of my past life, might deter you from the alliance; that after the union when our interests and feelings were alike in common, it could be made with safety. Then came the hour of temptation.
                  My love for you, the thought of my lonely, unprotected state, a thousand reasons combined to overthrow the conscientious scruples which prompted me to tell you all.
                  Principle yielded to feeling. I kept my secret and I became your wife.
                  'Twas then I saw my error. How could I tell you in the face of all your love, all your confidence, that I had indirectly deceived you, with regard to my true position?
                  Week after week, month after month, and at last year after year passed, and I had not strength to make the confession.
                  How often have I trembled, lest some vague rumor, distorted and blackened by slander, might reach you and drive you home with a poisoned arrow in your heart.
                  And yet I kept my secret still.
                  Poor weak trembler that I was! I feared lest you, too, might doubt me when I told the tale.
                  Oh, my husband! thou, upon whose warm, true heart I have pillowed my head for years, whose unfailing love and manly protection have been my shield against care, and sickness, and sorrow; thou who hast bent with me over the couch of our children and called me 'dear wife' and 'best earthly treasure;' thou from whose lips no word save those of kindness have ever fallen, can you doubt—will you not forgive me?
                  Alas! now there wells up from my inmost soul the vain prayer, "Would to God I had confessed all before."
                  But I must on with this incoherent narrative. Years passed, and but for that one shadow, sweet years of sunshine.
                  My children blossomed about me, and the present seemed anxious to atone in the brightness of its gifts for the past.
                  Do you remember that I turned pale, and fainted, when you told me that a gentleman from the far South, named Haughton, had purchased the Park. I had not recovered from the birth of Nina, and you attributed it to physical weakness.
                  For days after that intelligence, I lived in a feverish dread, impossible to describe. I felt that the serpent had traced me to my Eden, and was about to blight with his envenomed poison, every flower which the hopes of years had garnered there.
                  My movements were watched, and at last in a solitary walk one day a letter was placed in my hands.
                  It was from him. He said that motives of interest had induced him to take up his residence in Virginia, and vowed if I ever dared to reveal our former connection that a vengeance too terrible to utter should be his. He said, too, that Cameron was ignorant of the fact that I was his mother. He added, with a sort of brute tenderness (so to speak), that he had never been able entirely to recover from his foolish love, but that while it would be a pleasure to him at times to gaze upon me and upon his child, he would never unveil himself to her, or make revelations, which could only end in his own misery.
                  I hurriedly traced with a lead pencil on the margin of his letter the required promise, and returned it to the servant.
                  Am I not justified now—aye, fearfully justified—in breaking the promise? And can you wonder at my avoidance, my apparent dislike to Mr. Haughton? Yes; I shun his path as I would the slimy trail of the viper.
                  I leave all in your hands. If I have erred, I have bit- terly expiated my sin. Be merciful, my husband, for our children's sake be merciful; and may God, in His infinite justice and wisdom——
                  Here the manuscript came to a broken, hurried close. It was perhaps interrupted by some paroxysm of Ida.
                  Tears, heavy tears had fallen from the eyes of John St. John, during the perusal, and his manly frame shook with emotion. After finishing it he rose from his chair, and, pale as death, paced the floor with troubled steps for perhaps an hour. At last his countenance cleared, and seating himself, he wrote a line, and ringing for a servant, despatched it to his wife.
               
               
                  CHAPTER X.
                  IT was morning in the sick chamber, but the fresh air without, found no entrance to the parched lip, and burning temples of the sufferer. Ida had waked from the heavy slumber produced by opiates, with unabated fever. Not for a moment had her mother left her side, not once had she closed her eyes in even momentary forgetfulness during the long night.
                  Miss Prudence, who, to do her justice, was an excellent nurse, had been hastily summoned, and having just arrived was conferring in a low tone with Mrs. St. John.
                  "Air! give her air," cried the physician as he entered the chamber, and inhaled its close stifling atmosphere.
                  Miss Prudence hastened to throw up the window and open the blinds slightly, so that the fresh air, and one stray gleam of sunshine could penetrate within.
                  The Doctor laid his cool hand on the sufferer's brow; the movement startled her from a sort of stupor, and she raised her wild eyes to his face, but without one token of recognition.
                  He took out his watch, and counted the beatings of her pulse.
                  "Is she better, Doctor?" the mother ventured to ask.
                  "My dear madam, you could not expect her to be better as yet. The crisis of the fever will not arrive for several days. The opiate has lulled the delirium somewhat, I perceive. There is a great deal in keeping her quiet. It is a severe case of brain fever, but with care may, yes will," he added, reading the agonized look on the mother's face, "yield to proper care and treatment. Dr. —— will be here this afternoon. I have called him in as consulting physician. I shall not leave her to-day myself."
                  At this moment there was a slight tap on the door, and Miranda entering softly, handed Mr. St. John's note to her mistress. "Come to me, wife," was all it said.
                  Commending Ida to the care of the physician, and Miss Prudence, she arose trembling, so that her limbs could scarcely support her, and made her way to the library.
                  Her husband was standing in the middle of the floor as she entered. He opened his arms to receive her, and clasped her closely to his bosom.
                  For several moments neither spoke. At last she found voice to murmur, "You forgive me, then, for not telling you this long ago?"
                  At the moment that his arms received her, she felt convinced that his trust in her purity was unshaken.
                  All the nobleness of John St. John's nature beamed in his face, as holding her a little way off, he looked fondly in her face, and said with fervor, "It would be but a poor return for all the long years during which you have been to me the precious treasure which has shed freshness, and dew, and tenderness over my life,—a poor return to the fond, faithful wife, the good mother of my children, to refuse forgiveness for this one fault. We will be happier for this confession. The hearts of husband and wife should be as the mirror of truth, reflecting in unsullied confidence, the shadow and sunshine, each of the other's life. Believe me the heart that truly loves, is never harsh to the error of the loved one."
                  He kissed her. She gratefully and tenderly returned it, and her heart burdened with tearful gratitude, stole forth to her chamber, there to pour out her full soul in prayerful thanks to Him "who doeth all things well."
               
               
                  CHAPTER XI.
                  MR. ST. JOHN continued buried in profound reflection for some time after his wife left the library, and then rising rung the bell, ordered his horse, and rode off in the direction of the Park.
                  At another time, as dismounting from his horse, he entered the ferry boat, and glided rapidly over the tranquil waters, he would have been struck by the soft, gentle beauty of the May-day, but now the murmur of the waves, the spring sunshine, and fragrant air, the rich deep green of the shore, laden with the luxurious wealth of shrub and tree peculiar to the season, had no power to recall him from his abstraction.
                  Nor did he notice, as remounting his horse he rode slowly through the domains of the Park, the many evidences of decay and neglect, the want of a careful master's watchful eye, visible on the fine old estate.
                  As he approached the front entrance of the old grey stone house, he saw that the doors and windows were alike closed, and the only signs of life visible were a yelping cur or two, who attacked his horse's heels.
                  Dismounting, he rapped repeatedly with the heavy butt end of his riding whip against the huge door, but all in vain.
                  Finding he was likely to receive no answer to his summons, he proceeded around the house, and finding the back entrance closed also, took his way to a long range of buildings at some little distance, comprising kitchen, wash-house, etc.
                  In front of these, two negro women were lounging over their soap-suds, gossiping with the chambermaid, who, seated on a low stool, under the shade of a tree, seemed enjoying herself very pleasantly with a bit of fancy work. Sam, too, the principal waiter, stretched upon a bench, was idly basking in the sunshine, while the cook, who might have vied in size with Falstaff disguised in petticoats, standing in the immense doorway of the kitchen, flourishing her wand of empire in the shape of a spit, completed the picture.
                  Aunt Nancy seemed in no very amiable mood for the mellifluous sounds which greeted the ears of Mr. St. John as he approached were,—
                  "Yer a pack o' lazy curs! You feel the want of a master a'ready. Yer no better 'n a passel of nasty free niggers, that's what you ain't. I got to work save as ever to feed yer. I wish master 'd stayed whar he belonged—"
                  She paused, interrupted by the approach of Mr. St. John. Sam sprung to his feet, and touched his hat, or rather his wool, with a courtly air.
                  
                  "Can you tell me where I can find Mr. Haughton?"
                  "Law, Mass St. John!" broke in the cook, who seemed grievously afflicted with loquacity, "don't you know Master gone away? Well he is. He ain't been like heself no how lately—kind o' mopy like ever since Mass Cameron went away—and so when he heerd of his deth, he jest packed up and cleared out. Lord! I didn't think any thing could ha' made Master take on like that ar' news, but may be his conscience prick him for the way he treat Mass Cameron 'fore he went to that outlandish place where folks, they tell me, make nothing of runnin' knives through one 'nother, and hangin' other folks up on trees like dogs, for nothin'. Poor Mass Cameron, sich a beautiful young gemplan as he was too, so proud and gay-like as he used to come dashin' up on his fiery horse, hollering for Sam. And if Sam didn't come right off, my eye! what a cussin' he'd git, but then the next minnit he'd throw him a dollar to make up for it, and much Sam cared for the hard words. Ah! he was a good young master for all. Many's the time he's throwed me the money to get me a fine new dress, and as for my rheumatiz, he never forgot to ask about it. Ah! we all miss him, God knows. He was the one that kep' Smith in order, and wouldn't let the nasty white buccra impose on we servants."
                  By this time the negroes were all moved to audible expressions of grief by Aunt Nancy's pathetic harangue, and Mr. St. John, after offering them a few words of condolence, was about to turn away—wondering at the new turn affairs had taken, when Sam addressed him with,
                  "I was goin' to tell you, sir—only Nancy never lets any body else speak where she is—that Master left a letter for you, sir, and I was goin' for to take it to you to-day. If you will please to walk into the house, I'll git the note and set out some wine."
                  Mr. St. John followed him to the house, and through the lonely, deserted rooms into the dining-room, where on the table he found a note addressed to himself. He hastily tore it open, and read
                  "Sorrows which have gnawed at my heart-strings, until they have devoured the very pith of my existence, and rendered me a weak, perhaps a remorseful man, have at last induced me to become an exile, perhaps for years, from my native land.
                  I have of late become convinced that my son was guiltless of the charges imputed to him, and it was my intention to recall what had passed between us, and restore him to his rights, when the news of his death reached me."
                  Here there was a large blot, and the remainder of the writing seemed to have been traced with a trembling hand.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "Smith, for amply sufficient reasons, I have discharged, and appointed an efficient steward to take charge of the estate during my absence. May I ask of you the favor occasionally to ride over, and see how affairs are progressing?
                              "I am not given to asking favors, but I make this request because you are one of the few men I ever met whom I believe to be possessed of true moral worth, one of the few of my kind, whom I could safely trust.
                              
                                 C. HAUGHTON."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  This cold, brief business-like epistle was his sole farewell, and yet as Mr. St. John left the melancholy home of the exiled master, and the dead heir, he felt as if a burden was lifted from his spirit.
                  His intention in seeking him was to acquaint him with the fact that he knew all, and to place an interdiction on all future intercourse with him.
                  
                  Now he was gone for years, perhaps for ever, and he thanked heaven that a cold, bleak shadow was swept from his path.
                  It was a strange coincidence—the confession of the wife, and the farewell of the wronger, received the same day.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XII.
                  COLDLY the moon looked down on the battle-field of Cerro Gordo; on young boyish faces, with fair hair dabbled in blood, and the death murmur of "home, loved ones!" scarce cold on their lips; on manly forms, noble features, convulsed with the fiery agony which the last pang had moulded into eternal rigidity; gray-haired veterans, locked in their last repose, husbands, fathers, brothers, mangled, prostrate, heaped in wild confusion, beneath that midnight moon, little heeding that their last bed was on a stranger soil, little heeding the agony their fate would carry to their far-off homes.
                  Every now and then, breaking the awful stillness, rose the wild vulture's shriek, or the long howl of the wolf-dog, as he ceased for a moment his fearful banquet on the dead. Nay, if you listened closer 'mid the wailing requiem of the night wind, you might have heard a groan, a faint cry, a gasp, as some unfortunate closed his eyes for ever on the terrible scene. Among those in whom every pulse of life was not yet stilled, was a young soldier, who awoke from a long trance-like swoon, to meet the sights and sounds we have described. He lay for some time in all the horrors of such a scene, and in the fiery torture of heart and brain, produced by his undressed wounds, when his faint eyes espied the light of a lantern slowly moving amid the corpses.
                  A wild hope that the light belonged to some friendly searcher for the living, broke upon him; with a fearful effort he raised himself on one elbow, but instantly fell prostrate, overpowered by weakness. Slowly that light moved on, now pausing long, and now passing rapidly from body to body. Would it ever reach him?
                  Oh, for one moment of life! Oh, for strength but to say one word! At length the light neared him, and he saw that it belonged to two Mexican ruffians. They were rifling the dead, tearing even the blood-stained clothes from the stiff cold limbs.
                  A shudder froze the heart of Cameron Haughton, and all of life seemed concentrated in the groan which burst from his lips.
                  "Hallo!" said the bearer of the lantern, swaying it over the recumbent form, and speaking in the vilest Mexican patois, which we will not pretend to give. "Here's another not dead yet. I think this is about the fiftieth we've lighted on in the same fix. However he can't help himself."
                  He was about to search his clothes, when a sudden thought struck him. He drew a bowie-knife from his bosom. It gleamed over Cameron. It was about to descend, when the arm of the murderer was arrested.
                  "What the devil are you about?" was the unceremonious query. "It's no use to murder as well as steal. Hallo! I know this fellow! He is one of Scott's favorite officers. I say, Jose, 'twould be a good thing if we could save his life. I'll warrant some of our captains would pay us handsomely for such a prisoner."
                  "A good thought, Juan. Well, we've done a fine night's work already, and if this poor devil don't get something done for him soon, he's a prize for Satan instead of us. Bring some water."
                  
                  Juan ran to a rivulet near, and returned with his oilskin cap full.
                  They presented the not very savory vessel to the lips of the sufferer. He drank eagerly, and his rough attendant bathed his temples with the refreshing fluid.
                  "And now we'll have to carry him to the Bandit's Cave between us. And look here, handle him lightly. Remember the pistoles.
                  And forsooth they raised him gently enough, and proceeded perchance half a mile from the spot, their way lying through the narrow mule-paths and winding mazes, which thread the picturesque heights of Cerro Gordo, taking care to avoid every path where they might encounter any stray enemy of Mexico. Their fears, however, were needless; the sentinels trod sleepily their stated rounds, and, with the exception of these guardians of the night, the foe slept in happy consciousness of freedom from danger, for the Mexican army had retreated, broken in numbers, and faint and weary in spirit.
                  Ah! could Delham, the faithful friend, starting from the heavy slumber, into which pain and exhaustion had subsided, have marked those stealthy forms stealing in the midnight stillness, through friendly shade and embowering foliage, bearing between them the motionless form of him he mourned as dead, how quickly would he have flown to the rescue.
                  The gentle motion through the cool night air produced a slightly reviving effect upon the sufferer.
                  After going the distance we have described, the two men turned into a ravine as dark as Erebus, and, threading, what would have seemed to an unpractised individual, endless labrynths, they paused before a large rock.
                  Laying down their burden, who swooned again from the shock, they rolled away the rock, after sundry efforts, and, clearing a quantity of brush and dirt aside, disclosed a broad aperture through which, with Cameron borne between them, they entered the Bandit's Cave.
                  A dark, damp passage brought them to a large circular room formed by nature.
                  Here there were some rude attempts at comfort. The earth-walls were overhung by blankets; the most beautiful, pure crystalline stalactites hung from the ceiling, and to these was suspended here and there a lantern. Two pallets, not very tempting in appearance, being merely heaps of straw overspread by tattered not extra clean covering, occupied the farthest corner of the roomy and a sort of drawbridge ladder, led up a steep ascent of some six feet into another apartment. Valises, trunks, and such like articles of plunder were scattered around. The room was further occupied by some six or eight men, some of whom, stretched at lazy length, were recounting their late successes and discomfitures, or discussing the battle. Yet another group, seated at a table formed of a rough board, balanced on two rocks, were engaged over a soiled pack of cards.
                  "What have you got there?" was the unanimous inquiry, as Jose and Juan entered.
                  "Why a real live officer of that d—d United States army, and a prize he'll be to some of our captains. I shall ask a high price be sure for him.
                  "So ho! that's your game, is it?" they replied, as the two bearers softly rested the motionless form on a pallet. "But he's in a swoon."
                  "Yes, and the whiskey won't revive him. What the devil shall I do?"
                  "Here's something that will do him good, soul and body," said one who seemed to be the leader of the gang, rising and opening a small safe, and taking from thence a pint bottle. "I keep it for myself if I should be caught in a tight place. I'll warrant its virtue, for 'twas given me by Dr. Manquez. His name is enough."
                  He poured a small quantity of the cordial into a tumbler, and forced it between the motionless lips of the slowly reviving Cameron.
                  They then proceeded with more practical skill than science to dress his wounds.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XIII.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              For she was Passion's child, born where the sun
                              Showers triple light, and scorches e'en the kiss
                              Of his gazelle-eyed daughters."
                           
                        
                        BYRON.
                     
                  
                  BRIGHT and golden, swept the sunlight, and balmily wandered the south wind, through the open windows of a spacious apartment in one of the most stately palaces of Mexico.
                  Rare old pictures, and exquisite sculpture, filled the atmosphere of the room with the inspiration that genius alone can give; the downy tread of the Persian carpet, the frescoed ceiling, the splendid mirrors, the silken curtains, with their gorgeous golden fringes, made up a picture of luxury a sybarite might have envied.
                  Reclining on a couch drawn near the open window, is Cameron Haughton. The manly proportions of his figure are almost lost in the multitudinous folds of his rich, cashmere dressing-robe, and the languid, recumbent position betrays that he is yet a victim to indisposition. His right arm is in a sling. His brow, from which the masses of jetty waves are tossed back, as if oppressive, wears almost the ashen hue of death, and there burns in his eyes, none of their characteristic fire.
                  On a low ottoman near the couch, her fair hands wandering carelessly, and yet with witching skill, over her harp-strings, breathing every now and then rich, low bursts of song, more like the spontaneous melody of the wild bird than a mere artistic performance, sat a Spanish girl, beautiful as a poet's fancy would image one, born in that clime whose air is the 'breath of love,' and brought up amid every association of elegance and refinement.
                  Her posture was grace itself as she leaned over the harp, her figure tall, mingling the slender graces of girlhood with the mature development of the woman. Her dress, with its full sweep and flowing train, was of black lace over white silk, relieved here and there with scarlet trimmings, such a costume as we would not dare to wear save in a ball-room. Her rounded arms, smooth and fair as ivory, are bare to the shoulder, the slight sleeve looped up with rubies. The dress is low to the point, where the perfect shoulders melt into the delicious swell of the bust. A necklace and cross of gold and ruby burn like fire-gems on the fair bosom, and her midnight tresses gathered into a classic knot behind, fall here and there in stray curls of heavy richness.
                  Her complexion is of that extreme transparent paleness, peculiar to her clime, yet the pouting lips are red as the passionate blood which warms her heart, the teeth are small and dazzling, and the eyes, so intensely black that the iris cannot be distinguished from the pupil, melt and swim in a bewildering softness.
                  It seems a strange indifference that can prompt one to turn away from such a vision of beauty, and soft allurement as is embodied in the form of the lady Inez, and yet Cameron's gaze is not upon her. It rests with a sort of dreamy lux- ury, half sad, half pleasurable, on the gardens beneath the window, where is gathered all the wealth of leaf and flower belonging to that beautiful land; the breeze, wandering over beds of roses, and freshened by the diamond spray of marble fountains, coming gratefully to his languid brow.
                  Was he forgetful of Inez? An ingrate then was he, for during the long weeks which had elapsed since her brother brought him a stranger, wounded and faint, to his palace-home, she had been his ministering angel. It was her hand which had smoothed his pillow, her hand which had pushed back the tangled masses of hair from the fevered brow, tendered to the parched lips the cooling draught. It was she who had drank in with charmed ear, the tales of his gallant and reckless daring, until, in his fatal beauty and chivalric spirit, he had become to her the embodiment of those knights of old, whose deeds in poesy and romance she loved to dream over, in many an hour of virgin idleness.
                  Unasked, unwooed, with all the generosity of her Southern nature, Inez had cast forth the rich treasure of her heart, on the treacherous waves of uncertainity. We know not the moving power which prompted her to do so, perhaps the influence which Cameron Haughton seemed at will to exercise over women, perhaps the charm of novelty, which is the gate by which love oftenest enters.
                  Did he know that she loved him? She knew not. There were such eloquent looks of gratitude, such tender pressures of the hand in return for kindly offices, that while her lashes drooped and her cheek crimsoned beneath them, the blood went thrilling to her heart sometimes, with the hope that she was something to the heart, to which her own had yielded so much. Once she remembered in an hour of delirium she had heard him breathe another's name, coupled with words of tenderness, and she shuddered at the recollection, but then there had been a thousand incidents and associations since, to lessen its effect on her mind, and, while she would not trust herself to look back on the past, hope planted bright blossoms in the path of the future.
                  She rose at length from the harp, and, seating herself by his side, lightly touched him upon the shoulder, while she said half petulantly, and yet with a tremulous accent,
                  "Of what are you dreaming, truant? For the last hour the light of your eyes has been turned from me."
                  "Of what could I be dreaming, Inez, but of all your kindness. I fear, fair lady, that it will so enslave my soul, that I shall not be fit for the hardy soldier's life to which I hope ere long to return."
                  The cheek of Inez blanched yet paler as she replied,
                  "In spite of all I have done to render you happy, you are yet desirous to leave me."
                  "I would but little deserve the name of a soldier of 'The Great Republic,' lady, if I could forget my duty, even for the silken chain of the fairest of women."
                  She was not displeased at the implied compliment, as the smiles lurking around the full red lip betrayed, but she answered quickly,
                  "Were you at your post, you are not yet able for service."
                  "Ah! but I trust it will not be long before I am myself again."
                  Tears of indignation at his apparent indifference to her evident concern for him, filled the eyes of Inez.
                  "Cameron!" Those dark orbs bent their full flood of liquid light upon him. The soft taper fingers resting on the cushion beside him, almost touched his cheek. He could not resist the temptation to clasp that little hand in his own. His voice insensibly took a softer tone as he said, "And does it grieve you so much, sweet one, that I should leave you?"
                  "Grieve me?" the tears came faster, the enunciation grew indistinct—"Cameron, I shall die, that is I—oh! I would rather you would not, indeed. But you do not care," she added, indignantly, "how soon you leave me. Perhaps you are weary of my attentions. If so I will relieve you of them. I will trouble you no more," and she was about haughtily to rise to her feet.
                  Cameron detained her gently. She must not leave him in such a mood, and perhaps his desire to soothe and reassure one to whom he owed so much, gave an unconscious warmth to his manner, as he said,
                  "Inez, dear Inez, do not leave me thus. Do you believe I could be such an ingrate as not to appreciate your untiring, gentle care? Ah! if you only knew how grateful I am—how my heart rebels at leaving you, you would not be thus cruel to one who loves you dearly."
                  The blood rushed to the cheek of the Spanish girl; one passionate glance was lifted to his, and then her head sunk lower, lower, until it rested on his bosom, and her long curls swept his lips, their perfume intoxicating his senses. The impetuous abandon of the action was too much for Cameron. The magnetic influence of her touch vibrated like lightning through his frame. He raised her head, drank in one glance from those maddening eyes, and pressed a passionate kiss on the melting lips.
                  Now had Cameron been a model hero of romance, such as never existed in real life, he would have contented himself with "pressing the pure kiss of a brother on her brow," and then launched off into a moral homily, comprising some twenty long-winded pages, as to the indiscretion of her conduct; but as he was real warm flesh and blood, and none of your perfectibilities, he did what you, reader, or any other warm-hearted man would have done under the same circumstances. For my part, I don't blame him. If a woman won't take care of herself, she can't expect a man to do it for her. Inez was wholly forgetful of virgin dignity, and therefore ought to be duly censured. And yet, poor girl, she was very innocent, in that ill-timed burst of feeling.
                  Cameron pitied her from his soul, and reverenced her, too, nor did he make the slightest effort to detain her, when recalled to a sense of the impropriety of such an overture on her part, hastily and full of blushes she withdrew herself from his embrace, and left the room.
                  His senses had recovered from their tumult, and he was inwardly cursing himself for having taken the slightest advantage of her weakness, when an hour afterwards, she re-entered the room with a freshly gathered bouquet, placed it in a vase of water on a little ebony stand near him, put one of his favorite volumes beside it, and finally sat down on an ottoman at a little distance, apparently to read, but in reality to dream over the scene just enacted, the thrilling words, "I love you dearly."
                  He did not interrupt her. There was one flower in that cluster of exotics from every land whose perfume swept over his senses, with an intoxication which brought a vision of Ida, home, a thousand recollections fraught with early passionate feeling upon him—the Eglantine rose.
                  It was her favorite flower. It grew at Huntingwild all over the grounds, scattered amid the evergreen hedge, clambering in at the windows. She loved to twine its pink flowers in her dark hair, and its fragrance like a spirit of freshness and sweetness, was ever faintly hovering around her.
                  Ah! could the proud lady have read aright those darkly mournful eyes, she would have found there, not her own image, for the soldier's heart sickened at the luxury around him, and wandered once more wild and free in the forest glades of "Home!" or nestled in the dim moonlight in the bower, with the Virginia girl by his side—while, as he once more gazed with her on the rippling waves of the beautiful river, one of her own sweet songs floated like far-off music through his brain. 
                        
                           Does the moonlight shine as golden
                           O'er that spot, as long ago?
                           And the waters like the olden
                           Murmured song, as silvery flow?
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  CHAPTER XIV.
                  DAYS, nay weeks, passed, and still Cameron lingered in inglorious captivity, at the Palazzo Del Moro. Pedro Del Moro, the brother of Inez, and the young captain to whose tender mercies he had been consigned by the robbers, had paid but one short visit to the castle, which was far from the scene of war, since Cameron's pseudo imprisonment.
                  He then assured the latter that negotiations were pending with Scott for his exchange for General ——, then a prisoner in the hands of the Americans. But time passed, and brought not the anxiously expected reprieve.
                  Though daily he felt his strength and health returning, he was forewarned by his physician, that his mutilated arm would for some time incapacitate him from active service, and this in some degree reconciled him to his situation in other respects.
                  And in truth, few prisoners could have chafed at such a captivity, nay, would not have welcomed its sybaritic luxury, more especially when laurels already won, were blooming thick and freshly around their brow.
                  And yet for him there were many sad hours. The memory of the past could not be easily torn by the power of conflicting circumstances, from a heart with whose very life-chords, strong and powerful as they were, it was interwoven. He loved, leaving Inez with some vague excuse, to wander through the rose-mantled gardens, and pausing where the eglantine grew in wild luxuriance, suffer its perfume to float over his senses, bathing his soul in the sunny visions of the olden time.
                  In such hours as these he would draw forth the miniature of Ida, and gaze far down into the heaven of those shadowy eyes, so darkly blue, so deeply fraught with feeling. He could not but contrast them with the "orbs of fire" belonging to Inez. Those of the Spanish girl, filled with the glow of passionate, but evanescent feeling; those of the one beloved, with the brooding tenderness, the holy self-sacrificing devotion of a true woman's love. Then would he lose himself in happy dreams, until some careless sound in the shrubbery, or the deep-toned voice of the Sentinel on guard, recalled him to a sense of the reality that he was a captive in a foreign land.
                  Inez permitted as little time as possible to a solitude which she felt might be fatal to her new-born hopes, and with the innocent diplomacy of her sex was continually inventing some new amusement; some novel and pleasurable pursuit, which, if it had not the power to fix his thoughts upon herself, at least distracted them from other, and foreign objects. She was a perfect horse-woman, and nowhere was her grace, her haughty carriage, and striking style of beauty so well displayed as in this exercise. A magnificent barb was every day brought from the stables for Cameron, and her own beautiful, graceful Senora by its side.
                  Together, while the evening breeze floated in balmy freshness over their path, they wound over the beautiful plains belonging to the vast domain of the Palazzo Del Moro, together they rode through forests whose luxuriant beauty reminded Cameron, but too forcibly, of the poet's apostrophe: 
                        
                           "Oh! Love, in such a wilderness as this,
                           Where transport and security entwine,
                           Here is the empire of thy perfect bliss,
                           And here thou art indeed a God divine."
                        
                     
                  
                  There was something in the fanning of the breeze on his temples, the lightning motions of his steed as they flew onward, that infused a sort of electric joy into the bounding pulses of our hero, and drove, for the time being, every cloud from the horizon of life.
                  Then there were pic-nics in the orange groves, when no one would have imagined that the blue sunny sky which smiled down on these festal gatherings, the music, the dance, the dark-eyed maids of Mexico, with their castanets, their siren grace, their softly flowing accents, looked down on portions of the same land desolated by war, and reddened with the blood of sire and brother.
                  And as Inez and Cameron lingered at eve in some dim star-lit bower, softly to his ear came the soul-full accents of song, and the music of unseen minstrels, while the beautiful girl sat at his feet, gazing up into his face with her darkly burning eyes.
                  Cameron felt all the romance of his boyhood rekindled amid such scenes, and he would scarcely have been human, had his senses been dead to influences so dangerous in their nature.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XV.
                  WRAPPED in this luxurious and dreamy species of existence, Cameron's time flew more rapidly than he could once have taught himself to believe possible, under such circumstances.
                  He was one day lounging idly in the apartment we have before described, sipping languidly some cool, delicious mixture prepared by Inez, as a refreshment from the warmth of the morning, and lost in meditations, to which a murmuring fountain near played a gushing, musical accompaniment, when the door opened suddenly, and Delham was announced. In an instant the two friends were locked in each other's embrace.
                  "My dear fellow, what brought you here?" was Cameron's astonished inquiry, as soon as he found breath to speak.
                  "An order from the Commander-in-Chief to deliver General —— into the hands of his countrymen and see you safe back to our camp. Did you not hear the bustle of my arrival? Don Pedro accompanied me, and I left him locked in the arms of—by heaven! the most beautiful houri that ever strayed from Mahomet's Paradise."
                  "His sister," responded Cameron with a smile.
                  "And you have been basking in the light of those eyes for the last month! By Jove! but you are a lucky fellow. You must have been well nursed, for I never saw you looking better, bating that arm in the sling, and your being a trifle or two thinner. And to think of my expending seven shillings of my scanty supplies, in crape, to do honor to your memory, besides shedding tubs of tears—all a sheer waste of ammunition."
                  
                  "I am sorry I can't return the compliment by saying you are looking well."
                  "Me! I'm just out of that cursed fever, which has turned our camp into a hospital."
                  "You are now at Puebla?"
                  "Yes; and a glorious place it would be if a fellow were situated so as to enjoy it. Indeed, it is a pleasant relief as it is—with its stately palaces, broad streets, and last not least, dark-eyed demoiselles,—after our marches and counter-marches through desert waste, sun-baked moor, and other horrible places too numerous to mention. But I am forgetting that I have something to deliver to you," he added, with a sudden change of countenance, and drawing from his bosom a letter. It was a telegraphic despatch to Cameron, care of Delham, and dated Richmond, Virginia, a few days before.
                  "I wrote them that you were dead," said Delham, speaking now in a low, subdued tone, "as you are aware you were for some time supposed to be. But the instant the news reached us that you were alive, I telegraphed to them, and this reply came almost immediately."
                  The paper fell from Cameron's hands.
                  "Ida is dying," he faltered huskily, while his cheek grew ashen.
                  "Dying!" echoed the horror-stricken Delham, and raising the letter, he read the fatal words, which had caused his friend such emotion.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XVI.
                  MOTIONLESS, with clasped hand, and haggard, despairing eyes, the mother bent over her child. Her own cheek was pale and thin from ceaseless vigils, but not so pale as the one upon which her eyes rested.
                  How wan, how fearfully attenuated were the delicate outlines of the sharpened features, how large and unnaturally bright the feverish eyes.
                  Ida lay in the stupor which invariably followed the violent paroxysms of delirium, not sleeping; for the lids seemed to have lost the power of closing, but still, apathetic, unconscious of every thing around her.
                  Mrs. St. John glanced at the watch on the stand beside her. It wanted yet an hour to the time of the physician's visit. Miss Prudence had left the room to—using her own expression—"snatch a morsel of breakfast," and the mother and child were alone.
                  Wearily Mrs. St. John's head dropped on the coverlet, and as her lip strove to frame a prayer, sleep closed her exhausted eyelids.
                  A hand plucking at her dress, startled her from her light doze.
                  "What is it? Does Ida want any thing?" she exclaimed, starting up. But Ida moved not, and Mrs. St. John's eyes fell on the form of old Judith, who was kneeling at her feet, with a piteous expression in her withered countenance.
                  "Oh! Mistis, Mistis, don't think hard o' me Mistis."
                  "Think hard of you! What are you doing here? What do you mean?" exclaimed her bewildered mistress.
                  
                  "Mistis, tell me first whether you goin' to forgive me for not tellin' you before?"
                  "Speak plainly, Judith. I don't understand you. Get up and sit down," motioning to a chair, "and tell me what you mean?"
                  Judith slowly rose from her knees, dropped helplessly in a chair, commenced nervously pulling at her turban, and gazing at-her mistress with an air of comic distress, which, at any other time, would have been ludicrous in the extreme.
                  "Come Judith, what is it you have to say. Speak low, so as not to disturb Ida."
                  "Well, Mistis, I got to tell you sometime, and I might as well begin, but I mighty 'fraid you never will forgive me. Well, to begin at the beginning," and she drew her chair nearer, and spoke in a low ominous whisper, "I hear all of 'em in the kitchen talkin' 'bout how sick Miss Ida was, and how nobody but you and the Doctor warn't allowed to see her; and I think to myself she's the same as my own child. I nursed her, and took care of her when she was a poor little baby, and couldn't help herself, and I've got a right to see her! But then I thinks again—'maybe Miss' won't let me go in!' but lor' me, I thought I'd steal in any how, without askin' any body any odds."
                  "If you have nothing more than this to say, Judith," interrupted her mistress impatiently, "you had better leave the room. It was very thoughtless in you to interrupt me at such a time as this."
                  "Wait, my dear Mistis, you ain't heerd what I have to say. Well, I crept in here behind Miss Prudence, this mornin', and I got behind the curtains 'fore you all notice me, and I been here ever since. I heerd Miss Ida ravin', too, and I thought I could understand some words she said, which seemed to distress you mightily, and which Miss Prudence didn't seem to know what to make of. Mistiss, don't Miss Ida think Mass' Cameron is her brother?"
                  "Judith!" exclaimed her startled mistress, glancing hurriedly around, as if to be certain she was not overheard.
                  "Mistis, I would not have asked you this, but I thought may be 'twas that troubled poor Miss Ida's mind, and I knowed he warn't no brother o' hern, and I thought I ought to speak and let the truth be known."
                  "Judith, what do you—what can you mean?" and Mrs. St. John grasped her arm wildly, and looked upon her with the same expression that Ida had worn towards herself on a similar occasion.
                  "Oh! Mistis, if you'll just forgive me, I'll tell you all about it."
                  "Well, go on. I will forgive any thing if you will only speak."
                  "Don't you remember when Miss Ida was a little baby, soon after we come in here from Texas, how poor your health was, and how you couldn't nurse Miss Ida, and how the overseer's wife, who had lost her little baby, used to nurse her for you? And don't you remember how they made you leave Miss Ida in her care and mine, and took you off to the Springs, whether you would or no? Well, poor little Miss Ida, she was such a weakly baby, she took sick and died soon after you went away,—not this Miss Ida, mind. Your little baby. Stop, don't say nothin'—let me go on. Don't you remember your cousin Mr. Charles Carlton, had gone to furrin parts, where he died afterwards? And don't you remember he went there because he was nearly run mad about his young wife, who had a little baby and died when she had it? Well, he never took no account o' the child. In fact, look like he couldn't bear the sight of it, and so, in course, old Mr. Carlton bein' a widower, and thar bein' no other lady on the plantation till you come, the overseer's wife took care of the poor little cast-off thing. Well, when your baby died, I thought die I should, too, anyhow; for thinks I, the baby was the hope and blessin' of Mistis' life; and to think it's gone and died, while she's away. If she had been here, it wouldn't have been so bad; but now she'll blame herself for leavin' it, and she'll think, may-be, I didn't take the cear I might have done, though God knows I did every thing I could to keep life in it, but seems like it must go anyhow. Well, I took on so, that Mrs. Bennett, the overseer's wife, you know—she tried to comfort me, and at last, after thinkin' awhile, she says to me: 'Judy, it'ill most kill Mrs. Walton, the death of this baby.' With that I screeched out, 'I know 'twill, Miss Bennett—I know 'twill,' and fairly got down, and rolled over the floor in my torments. So she says, mighty solemn-like—'Get up, Judy, and listen to me. Do you see this poor little thing in my lap?' And I looked at the little plump thing, with its bright blue eyes, laughin' and crowin' in her arms, and then at the little thin, white corpse in the cradle, and I said, mad enough, 'How can you call that child a poor little thing, by the side of this one?' 'Because,' says she, still more solemn, 'it is the most to be pitied of the two. That little one there is a happy angel in heaven, and this is a motherless thing, with a father as takes no account of it, but leaves it to the care of strangers. Now, as I was sayin', the death of her baby will most kill Miss Walton, ef she knows it.' 'Knows it!' says I, openin' my eyes wide. 'Why, yes,' says she; 'but we can keep it from her. 'Sposen' now we say 'twas this child as died, and let Mis Walton think this is her baby.'
                  "Well, I wouldn't listen to her for a long time. I says, 'Hil you 'spose a mother won't know her own child?' 'Well,' she says, 'as for that matter, there's no great difference in 'em, they're both the same age, and same colored eyes and complexion, only this one looks so fat and well; but that's in its favor; for if Miss Walton should notice any change, she'll be mighty apt to think it all for the better. But depend on it, she won't know any better, or if she does, I'll take all the blame, and this child will have a good mother to take cear of and raise it, and she won't have nothin' to grieve after about it.' Well, when I come to think of it, I felt like a great mountain was lifted off my shoulders, and so we fixed it all up between us. Old Mr. Carlton had gone down to Richmond for a week, it being election time, so when he came back, the baby was buried, and we had no trouble that way. But, Lor' bless my soul, when you come from the Springs, after you'd been gone two months, and fust thing when you seed me, 'Judith, my child! where is my child?' and I went and woke up Mas Carlton's bright, pretty baby, and brought to you, I thought my knees would drop from under me; and when you clasp her in your arms, and says, 'How well she is looking. Ah! good Judith, you and Mrs. Bennett have taken such care of my precious babe. Why, she does not look like the same puny, pale thing I left behind.' I thanked my God. I couldn't hardly wait to get out the room, before I fall down on my knees and thank Him. So I never told you no better, and never would, if every thing hadn't turned out as it has; for you know, Mistis, I never did in my life say one word about all your troubles in Texas."
                  "I know it, my dear Judith. I feel it," Mrs. St. John found breath to say, pressing, as she did so, the hand of her faithful attendant, her senses, meanwhile, nearly stupefied with bewilderment, at the astounding intelligence she had just received.
                  "Well, I intended to tell you this," continued Judith, "when I come in this mornin', so I brought these things for the more proof of the truth of what I tell you. These are the very clothes the little thing had on when I changed her for your poor little blessed baby;" and with this she unrolled a bundle which, in her perturbation, Mrs. St. John had not before noticed, and produced the tiny chemise, and dress of which we have once before had a glimpse.
                  Mrs. St. John took them from her hands, and gazed on them like one in a dream, her eyes resting longest on the delicately-traced name, "Emily Carlton." A thousand varied thoughts rushed wildly upon her. Ida, the child she had cherished more than, perhaps, any other, the child for whom—save Cameron—her warmest prayers had been breathed—Ida, over whose couch she had hung so fondly in infancy, with whom she had smiled and wept in after years, she was not her own.
                  But she did not love her the less for this revelation, no; the thought which gleamed brightest amid the chaos of thought, was, that if God were pleased to spare her life, there could be now no obstacle in the way of her happiness. And what a blessed boon would it be to her to promote that happiness by every means in her power.
                  She was startled from her reverie, by a light cry from Judith, whose eyes, in the mean time, had wandered towards the bed.
                  "She turned hastily in that direction, and her appalled eyes rested on the raised form of Ida, her head supported by her thin hands, her wild eyes set with a moveless gaze upon Mrs. St. John and Judith.
                  "Ida!" almost shrieked her mother—as we must still call her—springing towards the bed.
                  "Stop, mother," said the girl, in her low, faint tones, while a strange, sweet smile lighted up her whole face. "I am not delirious. I have heard all. Cameron was not my brother. Oh! thank God! thank God!" and she sunk exhausted on the pillow.
                  Mrs. St. John stood silently beside the bed, awaiting the return of the speech and nerve, which had for the moment forsaken her.
                  Judith, too, stood gazing in terrified wonder.
                  It was plain that a lucid interval had come upon her, but whether it was in the natural course of the disease, or whether the strange conversation which had been carried on in her presence, had recalled her scattered senses, was a mystery which remained to be explained. There was no excitement visible about her now. On the contrary, she lay as if almost incapable of motion, her eyes looking dreamy with soft light, and her tremulous lips murmuring at intervals:
                  "He was not my brother. Oh! he was not my brother. This is no dream. Mother, tell me, this is no dream."
                  Her mother bent over her tenderly: "My Ida, you know all then."
                  She raised her weak arms, as if she would have thrown them around Mrs. St. John, but strength failed her, and they drooped powerless at her side.
                  "Mother, you are still my mother? His mother, his mother!" she added, softly, lovingly to herself. And then, turning her head slightly, her sad eyes gazing on vacancy, her tones grew mournful, as she said (very quietly), "But, mother, he is dead; oh, dead! I have been to that far land. I have seen his grave, mother. I cannot weep now. All my tears are gone. I have wept my brain dry. But every day I go to his grave. I have planted violets there, mother."
                  Her senses were again wandering, and it was with a feeling of intense relief that Mrs. St. John heard the physician's tap on the door.
                  Physicians are expected to be blind to family secrets, else might the worthy doctor in question, have gathered food for strange conjecture, from much which had fallen from Ida's lips during her delirium. Fortunately, people in general politely agree to believe, that a delirious sufferer has "no method in his madness."
                  He changed countenance, as he glanced at his patient. In hurried and agitated tones Mrs. St. John stated the occurrence of the last few moments, alluding to a conversation of startling interest to Ida, which had been carried on in her presence, but forbearing to mention its exact purport.
                  Ida, however, continued to murmur at intervals,
                  "My brother? no, he was not my brother!"
                  "That seems to be a strange idea she has taken up," said Mrs. St. John, coloring at the prevarication, "with regard to—to young Haughton." And drawing the Doctor aside, she added, in a low tone, "The conversation between Judith here, and myself, alluded to him—indirectly, but neither of us mentioned the fact that his reported death has been contradicted. Do you think it would be safe to tell her this now?"
                  "By no means, my dear madam. All excitement must, if possible, be avoided for the present. And now, I shall watch beside her, and let me insist that you leave the sick-room, and take a little refreshment and exercise. If you do not, you will be in as bad a state as she is ere long."
               
               
                  CHAPTER XVII.
                  "MY dear Haughton, your fears exaggerate the truth," said Delham, as his eyes glanced rapidly over the despatch which had fallen from his friend's hands.
                  The simple words which had struck such terror to the bravest heart that ever beat, were in Noble's handwriting:
                  
                     "We fear Ida is dying. Come, if possible, for God's sake! If she lives, the past shall be retrieved."
                  
                  Delham glanced from the paper to Cameron. His head was bowed upon his hands, and every nerve in the powerful frame quivered with intense emotion.
                  "Cameron, my dear friend," and the voice of Delham grew soft as that of a woman, as forgetting the pain which wrung his own spirit, he thought only of soothing that of another, "there is something of hope in this. See! they say if she lives the past shall be retrieved."
                  "Nay, Delham, consolation, or rather the attempt at consolation is vain;" and Cameron rose haughtily to his feet, forgetting the kind voice which strove to soothe his grief, in the memory of past wrongs, which in that trying hour rushed upon him like an avalanche. Low and husky, and yet deep and firm was his voice as he continued, "They have killed her. They have waited to see her dying before them, ere they called me back. Do they think their tardy justice can cheat death of its prey? 'The past may be retrieved.' What did I ever do, to provoke the wrongs of that past? They sided with my slanderers against me, they tore from me the woman I loved, they drove me an outcast to a foreign land, and now they would call me back, to look upon the death-struggles of one of their victims, while, to soothe the remorse which affrights their cringing conscience, they say to the other, 'Had she lived, the past should have been retrieved.' Can these hypocritical, canting words soothe a grief like mine? As well might the voice of juggling priest seek to emulate the power which bade the stormy sea be calm."
                  He paced violently to and fro the room, shadows chasing themselves like storm-clouds over his dark, proud face.
                  Delham was silent. What more could he say?
                  As well seek to stem the ocean-tide with straws, as to soothe with argument, the frenzy of awakened passions.
                  "I would be alone," continued Cameron after a pause, and speaking in a more subdued tone. "Make my farewell to the lady Inez—with such explanation of the circumstances as you think proper, together with every expression of gratitude for her kindness—and let us leave here, as soon as possible."
                  Half an hour afterwards, Delham was shown into the presence of Inez.
                  She was in the graceful toilette of a Spanish lady of high rank, and there was a deepened flush on her cheek, as she arose to receive him.
                  If he had thought her beautiful, when in her girlish abandon of feeling, she flew to the arms of her brother, how much more so now, with her queenly air, and self-possessed charm of manner.
                  By her side sat a tall, slight young man, in the uniform of the Mexican cavalry, whom a slight glance—so strong was the featured resemblance—would have identified as her brother.
                  Don Pedro Del Moro welcomed Delham's entrance with the stately urbanity of a Spanish grandee, and after linger- ing a moment, made some trivial excuse a pretext for retiring.
                  Delham commenced the task of delivering Cameron's farewell.
                  "Methinks," said Inez, somewhat haughtily, "that the Signor might have given his adieux in person."
                  "His apology for not doing so," responded Delham, with a low bow, "must be the distress of mind which he is now suffering, from the receipt of the most afflictive intelligence from home."
                  No answer save a slight curve of the arched lip, while the fair fingers tore into a thousand pieces the rich leaves of a magnolia, and scattered its scented petals on the Persian carpet.
                  Her long lashes drooped tremulously, and for an instant Delham's glance rested keenly upon her. Then he added—we know not why—it was assuredly not necessary to enter into details:
                  "I was so unfortunate as to be the bearer to my friend of sad tidings, in the dangerous illness of his betrothed."
                  The chord vibrated now. The proud blood rushed in torrents over cheek and brow; nay, it even tinged the curved throat with its ruby flood. Another instant, and it pressed upon her heart in bursting tide, leaving her features the ashen hue of death.
                  But will was mightier than all beside, and with an empress power, Inez crushed her rebellious passions into submission, and answered with calm dignity:
                  "Express my sincerest sympathy to Signor Haughton, and say that I trust he will find that his fears have exaggerated the danger. Say also, that should the fortunes of war ever again lead him to our poor castle, its inmates will be happy to show him all the hospitality in their power. And to you, Signor Delham, equally with himself, I will extend this promise."
                  And she held out her hand, with a gracious affability, irresistibly captivating.
                  The touch of those fingers thrilled through Delham as he held them for an instant in a timid clasp, while he bent low in acknowledgment of her last remark.
                  Inez motioned him to a seat at her side, and changed the conversation.
                  Often afterwards Delham recalled that hour;—the Oriental luxury of the apartment, with its shadowy wooing light, its rich odors, its dreamy sensuous pictures, and the superb beauty of the enchantress, her thrilling eyes, her ruby lip, from which the soft accents of her Southern tongue dropped like melting music, her midnight tresses, heavy in their luxuriant richness, all these floated through his memory, like the souvenirs which thought borrows from moments, whose intoxicating bliss thrills the heart-strings long after their cup of sweetness has been drained.
                  Alas! 'tis a sad thing that all we know of bliss, in this life, must be counted by moments, not hours.
                  And he was gone, gone for ever,—the dazzling star of her girlish dream,—and Inez was alone.
                  It is useless that we should enter into the detail of her feelings, as she wandered through the vast, rich apartments, and myriad-blossomed gardens, the odorous perfumes of past hours floating over her senses, with the breath of voluptuous flowers. All was lonely; all, like herself, deserted; their warm life fled, their breath of sweetness vanished, their soul-filled music silent. Silent? Yes!—the cold, voiceless silence of the heart's grave.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XVIII.
                  IT is needless that we should linger over the return of Cameron to the American camp (for so in contra-distinction to the Mexican we will call it), nor the warm welcome which greeted the arrival of one deservedly popular with all ranks in the army. We will pass over also the difficulties which surrounded his attempt to return to Virginia, difficulties much decreased, by the fact that the state of his right arm disabled him from all active service for some time to come.
                  In all, he owed much to the active assistance of Delham, and something, perhaps, to the generosity of his commander.
                  A week from the time, when last we parted from him, found him with anxious heart, and fevered pulses, en route for Home!
                  A letter from Mrs. St. John, disclosing all, awaited him in Richmond.
                  He flew to Huntingwild.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XIX.
                  "MOTHER!"
                  "Cameron, my first born! my best beloved!"
                  Mrs. St. John chose to receive her son alone, and it was in the solitude of the chamber, where she had so often wept in secret over the wrongs and sorrows of the past, that these trembling, heart-full words were uttered.
                  The strong man was subdued. He wept. He held the faded fragile form in his arms, and gazed tenderly upon her. He repeated like one in a blessed dream, "Mother! Oh! that one word—mother!" He knelt at her feet. "Bless me! Oh, my mother! bless me! It will sanctify my heart. It will exorcise the demons of sin, and bring back to my soul, its lost angel of purity. You know not how often I have longed for this hand on my brow; how my parched lips have breathed your name, when fever-dreams brought me back the hours of my infancy,—though they never brought me the death of which I had so often been told,—how I have yearned for the soothing spell of your presence. Oh! if you only knew how your name has been the talisman which has kept me, in my wildest excesses, true to honor, and to the hope of better things."
                  Mrs. St. John's thin soft hand, rested on the raven curls of the stately head. Tears rained down her cheeks, as she murmured:
                  "Bless thee, my son! God for ever bless, and keep thee, and the dearest prayer of a mother's heart go with thee, now and evermore!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER XX.
                  "THIS fearful sleep!"
                  "Will she never wake?"
                  "It has lasted forty-eight hours already!"
                  Such were the tremulous murmurs, which fell from the lips of the fearful watchers around the couch of Ida.
                  There was one whose gaze rested with the wildest yearning upon her, and whose full heart beat with such giant throbs, that it threatened to rend asunder the bosom which confined it.
                  It was the alien, the lover, the long lost son.
                  What a strange contrast was there!
                  The manly form, with its stately height and symmetry, rendered more conspicuous by the military garb; the splendid features moulded into that pride which comes from the conscious possession of the glorious gifts of bravery, strength, energy,—and the wan, delicate thing upon whom those dark eyes rested, as if he would fain have torn her perforce from the arms of death, and breathed into her inanimate form some portion of the intense life which fired his own veins.
                  She seemed "too fair a thing for death to feed upon," and yet so little of life was left her, that one feared lest a passing zephyr might waft away her breath for ever. And that breath? So faint was it that the keenest eye could not mark the slightest upraising of the linen band, less pure than the virgin bosom it confined. The physician could barely detect the shadow it left on the surface of the polished mirror. How calm! how unheeding of the misery around her she was, in her deep, dreamless slumber.
                  What inky blackness marked the arch of the eyebrow, contrasted with the marble paleness of the forehead! What a shadow of darkness the long closed lash left on the wan, transparent cheek! And that lip, with its exquisite curve, more clearly defined from its rigid stillness, how fearfully colorless, how like death it was! The wavy masses of rich dark hair, straying in wild confusion over the pillow,—as they were when her eyes closed in the death-trance—alone reminded one of life, for the careless breeze played among them, and lifted them lightly, as if mocking the cold, still sleeper.
                  "It is the last struggle of Life with Death," whispered the physician. "The system is thoroughly exhausted, and thus the entire suspension of its faculties for the time being. She may rally from this repose—fearful as it seems. If she wakes, she will probably live. But," and he turned to Cameron, "you, sir, must not be present should animation suddenly return. That one circumstance might prove fatal."
                  With a stern, voiceless sorrow, Cameron turned to obey the mandate, a sorrow which, perhaps, in this trying hour caused the stout heart to rebel against the Hand which mixed the bitter cup.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXI.
                  IDA lived; lived to wake once more in this breathing world, fair, frail, helpless as an infant. Ere long she grew strong enough to walk about the room, nay, even to recline on her pile of cushions at the open window in the early morning, ere the warm sun had kissed the dewdrops from the roses. But memory did not return with returning strength. She never alluded to the past, never wept now, or talked of a foreign grave. She seemed gentle, passive, sometimes abstracted, but not from any effort at recollection.
                  Her mother, who was her constant attendant, dared not break in upon the quiet slumber of her mental nature, which she hoped was thus striving to rally its exhausted forces. Indeed, had she been so disposed, the peremptory orders of the physician forbade it.
                  While he administered the gentle and soothing remedies suited to the case, he urged upon her friends the necessity of the most perfect moral and mental repose, to which Cameron, the only one disposed to resist the decree, was reluctantly compelled to assent.
                  It was the twilight of a soft, warm summer's day, that Ida, alone for the first time since her illness, sat by her window in the precise attitude in which we described her as being seated there one year before. "Like! yet oh, how different!"
                  Her light muslin robes still fell in fleecy, voluminous folds around her graceful figure, but that figure was light, frail, as the most delicate flower, the complexion too was wan and waxen in its transparent paleness, save where the slight rose-tinge flitted with evanescent brightness over her cheek. There was a delicacy almost ethereal in those attenuated features, something spirituelle, almost angelic in the expression of the large, deep blue eyes, borrowing such a depth of softness from the inky shadow of the curling lashes.
                  Again were her small white hands clasped before her, again her eyes fixed on the far-off star of evening.
                  Was there nothing in that calm, still summer eve, to recall the past; no spell in the "charmed air," no breath of remembrance in the odor of the roses, no tale of past happiness written on that bright orb, to which her heart had whispered its sweet secret one little year ago?
                  Who has not felt the recall of some cherished dream, with the return of those seasons, which were the silent sharers in its evanescent sweetness?
                  Perhaps Ida felt the influence of associations like these, for her mind seemed faintly struggling with some vague emotion, half a thought, half a feeling; and a slight smile, the first that had visited her lip for many a day, illumined her features.
                  Suddenly the sound of a voice without broke upon her revery. She started; a new, strange light broke over her face. She half rose, took one step forward, and in this pos- ture of intense eagerness, stood listening for the repetition of the sound.
                  Again it swept her heart-strings, with a wild gush of melody, which brought back the blessed chimes of the olden time, breathing of hope, joy, love, things which were buried for ever; breathing of the heaven where alone she had looked for their resurrection.
                  With an unnatural strength she bounded to the door, which was slightly ajar, and threw it open. Several persons were standing in the hall, but she discerned one only, and the next instant, with one cry, in which the soul gave vent to its long pent up burden, she was weeping on the bosom of Cameron Haughton.
                  There was a frantic passion in her joy, which made one dread the revulsion; weeping and laughing by turns she clung to him wildly, gazed yearningly into his face, felt his hands, his clothes, his hair, as if to convince herself that he was a living, tangible being, and no visitant from another sphere, all the while giving utterance to such incoherent sentences as,—
                  "Cameron, my Cameron, is it indeed you? They told me you were dead. But you were not dead, you have come back to me once more? Ida, poor Ida," and she hurriedly passed her hand over her brow. "Oh! it has been very dark here. I have been ill, ill. I see it all now. I saw a battle-field, Cameron, heard the clash of weapons, the shrieks of dying men, and, oh God! Cameron, in that scene of blood I saw you fall, saw you die. Ah! die," she shrieked, with an hysterical convulsion. Then suddenly becoming quiet, she gazed upon him with a bewildered expression, as she murmured, "Was it a dream, was it all only a dream?"
                  "My child, my Ida!" exclaimed the terrified mother. "How could this have happened? My God, have mercy on her. She is frantic. See how she raves. Oh! should this shock prove fatal."
                  Cameron Haughton raised his head from the one which rested in momentary quietude on his bosom, and looking upon the alarmed faces around him said, with forced calmness, "Leave us alone. I think I can soothe her."
                  As they silently obeyed him, he bore her gently to her own room, laid her upon the sofa, and bending over her, fixed the full gaze of his dark thrilling eyes upon her, murmuring in subdued tones,—
                  "Ida, my Ida, Cameron has come back to you, Cameron is with you once more."
                  Something of his own strength, his calm power of endurance, seemed to pass from his soul into hers, through the medium of those mesmeric glances, for Ida lay calm, passive, as if fearing lest the slightest movement or word might dissipate the charmed spell, which wrapped her senses in an elysium of happiness. It seemed to her as if she had waked from a wild, dark dream, which had gradually relapsed into a chill, voiceless sleep—the dream of a troublous, passionate world, the voiceless sleep of the tomb—to the glory, the brightness, the unfading bliss of heaven.
                  And all this time, as he bent over her, he restrained, with a giant force, the mighty impulse of his heart, which prompted him to seize her wildly in his embrace, to lavish ten thousand endearing names upon her, to hold her to his heart, and press his lips to hers with a frantic joy, which might have driven her tottering reason from the throne, to which he so labored to recall it.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XXII.
                  AND now we might add they were married, and of course, the happiest of the happy; but that the term married is by no means the usual antecedent to the phrase, happiest of the happy.
                  Yet my reader has, doubtless, discernment enough to anticipate that nothing save happiness, the purest, most perfect that earth can know, could result from a union where the highest and noblest qualities of each character, were so admirably formed to blend into one—a happiness altogether unknown to those ordinary marriages, which are compounded of base passion, and sordid interest. But we will let Ida speak for herself.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 NAPLES, November —.
                              
                              With the balmy air of this beautiful land freshening my brow as I write, amid the world of art, poetry, and beauty, from which reality cannot tear the couleur de rose veil with which our romantic dreams invest it,—in this paradise of my girlish visions, with the sole Adam which the vast world could have tempted me to choose, as the sharer of my Eden, I waft you, dear mother, my heart's best blessing, with a thousand assurances from your far-distant child, that you are not, for one moment, forgotten.
                              You ask me why, in my letters, I dwell so much on "the sights I have seen," and upon my memories of home; why I do not speak more of Cameron and myself. In plain truth, I was afraid of being convicted of a severe case of the honeymoon fever.
                              Indeed, mother, I think too often men make marriages, but I am convinced that God made ours.
                              I cannot describe my happiness. I cannot tell you of the blessed sense of protecting tenderness, of gentle, soothing happiness, that comes with my husband's presence; how his glance, his smile, his touch, seem to infuse into my weaker self the strength, the joy, the warmth of his own manly being; how much more fervently I pray, now that I have him to pray with me.
                              And when I sit on his knee at evening, with my fingers wandering through his dark hair, as we listen together to the sweet chimes of the vesper-bell, I whisper that I feel thus, and beg him to describe how it is, that my woman's nature affects his own. And his eyes—those wondrous eyes, mother—light up with feeling, as he answers: "You teach me to believe in the existence of the angels, Ida, to realize the heaven which before seemed an abstract vision, you make my whole nature higher, purer, you move my spirit to yearnings and strivings after the world, where a union like ours may be stamped with the impress of Eternity.
                              But enough of ourselves. Let me turn, I regret to say, to a sadder theme.
                              We met Kate and Marsden, as we expected, here. Marsden seems in very bad spirits. Of course, you are aware of the fraud by which his agent has embezzled the greater portion of his property in his absence, and escaped, leaving him a bare pittance.
                              Kate bears up wonderfully, in the endeavor to cheer her husband in this severe misfortune. I fear, however, she suffers much in secret. She looks pale and thin; this, however, may be the result of her situation; for, in addition to her other cares—as I suppose she has written you—she expects ere long to become a mother. She begs me to say in this, with every assurance of love, that they have suddenly concluded, in consequence of late news from Virginia, to sail for home in the next steamer. Marsden seems bent on going to California, as the place most likely to retrieve his shattered fortunes, and Kate, like a true wife, vows that she will follow him through whatever hardships he may have to encounter.
                              He is so resolute, that I fear you will have but little chance of inducing him to alter his plans.
                              I am agonized by the thought, that when I bid my sister farewell here, I shall not look upon her again for years, perhaps for ever.
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  
                  Tears were glistening in the mother's eyes, as she closed the letter; tears, half of joy, half of pain, such as its mingled tidings were well calculated to draw forth.
                  "Well," commented Miss Prudence, nervously twitching her knitting-needles, "Ida is just like all brides—run mad about her husband. We'll see how long that will last. She hasn't been married but two months, remember. She's got to see trouble yet, Kitty. The idea of any woman being so foolish as to talk about an eternity of happiness, with a wild scapegrace like Cameron Haughton. Poor Kate, her trouble's beginning already." And Miss Prudence blew her nose with a handkerchief copiously embroidered with snuff, and gave vent to a slight sniffling sound, intended to pass for a sob.
                  "If Ida's married life is as happy as my own, I think she will have nothing to complain of at its close," remarked Mrs. St. John, fondly regarding her husband, who was quietly enjoying his afternoon siesta on the sofa.
                  "Ah! Kitty," responded Prudence, shaking her head ominously, "it isn't every woman that gets such a man as my cousin, John St. John."
                  Perhaps there are young ladies who measure a man's character by the length of his purse, and whose visions of matrimony form themselves into a brilliant trousseau, fine houses, fine carriages, and fine entertainments, who will quite agree with Miss Spitfire in decrying Ida's "romantic affection;" but as for ourselves, we would prefer to live on an ideal vision of the one, rather than the condensed extract of a thousand realities like the other.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXIII.
                  THE newly married pair were not altogether pleased with the lodging they procured in Venice, and after half a day's discontent, Cameron set out in search of those more desirable. As he planted his foot on the broad marble landing of the spacious entrance to a stately Palazzo, a man with the garb and manner of a physician brushed hurriedly by him, while the startling inquiry from the lazy-looking porter fell on Cameron's ear,
                  "How is Signor Haughton now?"
                  "Dying!" was the abrupt reply, as the physician disappeared.
                  "Signor Haughton! dying!"
                  The lightning thought that it might be his father rushed upon him. Nothing since his departure had been heard from him in Virginia, and consequently they were unconscious of his whereabouts.
                  After a short colloquy, requiring all the Italian he could bring to bear, upon the officials in waiting, he made his way to the apartment of the invalid.
                  And thus, by the deathbed of one, in a foreign land, the father and the outcast met.
                  
                  It was a terrible scene. But a few moments before the abrupt entrance of his son, the dying man had been murmuring in agonized accents,
                  "Yes, he told me that his memory would haunt my death-hour, that my last gasp should be the bootless echo of his name. My son, oh! my son."
                  As if the son upon whom he called so wildly, had risen from the grave to answer his appeal, Cameron stood before him.
                  A cold sweat broke out on the sufferer's brow, his eyes glared horribly at the vision, as he almost shrieked, "Away! away! Do you rise from the tomb to curse me?"
                  "Father! father! 'tis I, your living, breathing son, come to receive your last breath, to tell you that all the past is forgiven." And the strong man bowed his head in the clothes, unable to bear the convulsed agony of the countenance before him.
                  The nurse stood in silence, alarmed at a scene she was unable to comprehend, and there was no minister of God in that Catholic land to speak soothing, to the soul of the dying heretic.
                  But the physician comprehended sufficient English to catch, in some sort, the purport of the conversation, and he said kindly,
                  "'Tis no spectre, Signor, but a stranger, a friend from your own country."
                  But nothing seemed to convince the terror-stricken being of the mortal existence of the man before him, until his son took both his clenched hands in his own.
                  As he felt the warm, magnetic grasp on his own cold stiffening members, he gazed for a moment steadily, though fearfully upon him, and murmured with a choking sound,
                  "Then you are alive! You have lived to haunt my death-bed, and brand me with the past."
                  "No, father," faltered his son, "not to brand you with the past, but to say that it was my fault. I was in error; I was to blame. Oh! father, let us be at peace are you die."
                  "Noble boy! Noble boy! I never knew you before. Ah! it is very late now. You were not to blame, all me, only me. God have mercy on my poor soul. Tell her I—I—loved her through all. Cameron, it is very dark. Where are you? Forgive—forgive—"and the old man sank back, dead.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXIV.
                  AND now, reader, if you are one of those impatient beings, who, as soon as they ascertain the fate of the principal dramatis personæ in a play, hustle on their furs or their greatcoats, as the case may be, and "make a break" for the outside of the theatre, without waiting for the grand morale, or the grand tableau, upon which author and actors have bestowed such pains; without benevolently waiting to add your brava! to the applause which calls the star before the curtain; if, I say, you are one of these, you will close this book without the perusal of this last, and, as you may deem it, superfluous chapter.
                  Now, though I do not expect to be called before the curtain to receive the bravos of an enthusiastic audience, or to have bouquets showered on me, as tributes to my entertaining powers; though I am rather content that you should have the benefit of my feeble exertions to assist in relieving you of the tedium of a long hot summer's day (I never knew a warm summer's day yet, they are always hot, overpoweringly hot), with the accompaniment of the luxurious indolence of your closed blinds, your sofa, your iced lemonade (admitting that you take nothing stronger), yet this I must beg of my unknown friend, that you at least bear with me patiently to the end, and if you do me the honor to say afterwards that I have been "absorbingly interesting!" notwithstanding my claims on your time and attention were snatched between those of your last evening's flirtation and this evening's ball, why, so much the greater obligation.
                  Eight years have passed away, and once more our weary wing is folded among the forms we love.
                  Huntingwild is in a ferment of joyous excitement, and the children are trooping and shouting through the old halls of the Park, for mamma has dismissed them from the school-room for a holiday.
                  Every morning, as soon as the customary routine of duties, so important in the household of a Southern matron, are gone through, Ida calls her children around her, and spends three or four hours in their instruction. It is only the two eldest—her tall, noble-looking Cameron, and her pensive, dewy-eyed Ida, whom every one predicts will turn out a genius, that are large enough for this. Little Noble, the youngest born, has but just learned to clap his chubby hands, and scream with joyous delight, "Papa! papa!" at his proud father's approach. Not for worlds would Ida have delegated to French governess, or German master, the task of forming and cultivating the minds of her children, which should be the most cherished and important occupation of every refined and cultivated mother.
                  Nor do her teachings end with the school-room. When the joyous, healthful sports in the open air, encouraged by both parents, are over, and the children gather in the twilight around the mother's knee imploring for "a story," many a Scripture legend, filled with holy lessons of love, is impressed on their childish memories, many a lesson of noble deeds, and self-denying fortitude, sinks deep into their hearts, to be recalled and imitated in after life.
                  The announcement of candles and tea, ends this most treasured hour of the day to the children, but afterwards comes their dance, when "mamma must play, and papa teach them." It is strange to see the proud, reckless man, subdued and softened by the influence of a gentle, loving woman, watching the movements of his children, and joining in their laughter with a fresh happiness unknown to other, and wilder years. But the little limbs flag sooner than mamma's nimble fingers, rosy lips pout for papa's good-night kiss, and in the stillness of her chamber, the mother kneels and prays with her children.
                  Oh! that all mothers would do likewise. It would hasten the coming of the millennium.
                  But, as we have said, the children have a holiday. It is in honor of the return of long absent loved ones.
                  The family bonds of union are again to be reunited, the broken link in the chain is restored; Kate's bright face is to beam on the old homestead once more.
                  The Huntingwild carriage is already at the dépôt, awaiting the arrival of the traveller, and Uncle Tom, with a grayer head than ever, in a high state of what he calls "glorification."
                  "I's glad I goin' to see Miss Kate once more 'fore I die. I thought she never was gwine come back," he remarked confidentially to Noble, through the front window of the carriage.
                  "I is too," was the unasked response of the grinning apology for a footman, in the shape of the little ebony figure at his side. "I 'members Miss Kate, I does."
                  "Hish! you fool," exclaimed Tom in great wrath, "You warn't knee high to a duck, when Miss Kate went away, but you'd go out 'n your way any time, to tell a lie."
                  "Yonder come the cars! Yonder come the cars!" sung the unheeding Juba.
                  Noble rouses himself and looks out. His thoughts have been busy with the past; old shadowy things come back with the return of the wanderers, and mingling with brighter memories came the thought of the precipice he had escaped, and the false woman in her shroud.
                  He was the only one to meet them at the dépôt, the others preferring to give the welcoming embrace in the consecrated shadow of home, apart from stranger eyes.
                  Phiz! phiz! phew! snorted the engine; the cars came to a dead stop, the passengers commenced tumbling and rolling out, Noble caught a glimpse of a dear, familiar, eager face at one of the windows, and the next instant the brother and sister were locked in each other's embrace; while Juba danced a jig in his insane delight, which escaped Uncle Tom's notice, absorbed, as he was, in scraping the ground, and giving the most frantic pulls to his gray locks by way of salutation.
                  "You here too, Uncle Tom?" said Kate, cordially extending her hand, as Noble turned to his brother-in-law and nephew, Master Marsden, a perfect specimen of seven years' growth and bloom in California, "Why this reminds me of my young days."
                  "Young days, 'deed, Miss Kate. You looks better now 'n you did when you went away."
                  "Ain't she done grown fine and portly like?" he added in a confidential aside to Juba, as he mounted the box.
                  "Why, Kate," said Noble, as they seated themselves comfortably in the carriage, glancing, as he spoke, at her somewhat matronly figure, "How fat and rosy you look. Pray, how much do you weigh?"
                  One of the old laughs broke in its well-remembered music on his ear as she answered, "One hundred and fifty, though Arthur declares that I have mistaken the figure, and that it is two instead of one."
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXV.
                  IT is a soft, warm September evening. The reunited family are grouped in the front piazza at Huntingwild.
                  It is a fair picture to look upon, one which, while it gladdens the eye, warms the soul, and nerves the arm with new strength, to wage life's warfare of good against evil.
                  There are our old friends, Mr. and Mrs. St. John, the parents, the grand-parents, the common altar around which all that group clustered, with one feeling of love and reverence.
                  A few more threads of silver shine amid their hair, than when we saw them last; but this is the only change, save that their expression is one of a deeper, fuller serenity of joy. There is still much of the military air of command, in the bearing of the most distinguished member of the group, Col. Haughton, in the bronzed cheek and heavy moustache, and the noble features, where an expression of warm benevolence and good feeling, struggles with the stern pride of darker days.
                  And there is Ida, her little figure crouched childlike on a stool at the feet of her stately husband. Marriage to her has been the perfection of beauty, giving her that roundness and fulness, which her frail girlhood lacked.
                  How sweet it sounds, the old well-remembered tones of Kate's voice ringing clear and joyously as of yore, in the loved atmosphere of home.
                  Arthur has lost some of his aristocratic fairness, but gained in strength and manliness.
                  Noble, too, is stouter, more manly in appearance than when we saw him last, but Fannie is fair and fresh as the bride of yesterday.
                  The children—Noble's two boisterous rosy-cheeked imps, the restless wild Cameron, and little Ida with her pale, clear cheek, and deep dreamy eyes, are grouped on the grass mound surrounding the fountain, listening with absorbing interest to the hero of the hour, Master Arthur, who is giving with great gusto, and the conscious air of the travelled man, sundry spirited and graphic details of life in California, almost as interesting and profound in their nature, as those of a tourist or two, whom we have not read, but heard of.
                  We must not forget to include in the family group, our little friends, Minnie and Nina, who have grown into tall, graceful girls, just trembling on the brink of a début.
                  
                  "Then you think the Villa purchasable?" demanded Marsden of Noble.
                  "Without doubt. The family who have occupied it for several years are going abroad for the education of their children, and the place has been advertised for sale or lease."
                  "Then, Kate, it is ours. By the way, Noble, have you ever heard any thing further of that scamp D'Allure?"
                  Noble endeavored to conceal a slight blush, under a cloud of cigar smoke, as he answered,
                  "Not a word. He is probably pursuing his infamous profession, unmolested, in Europe."
                  There was a pause.
                  Kate's glance lingered as if it would never tire over the beautiful domains of the home, which has for so long been memory's fairest, best-beloved picture.
                  The autumn wealth of fruit and flowers, the lordly river, the myriad skiffs, their white sails flapping lazily in the light evening breeze, how like a dream of the young romantic days of her girlhood it seemed.
                  And as her thoughts roved back to the time when, a bride, she had gone forth to follow the fortunes of her husband, through hardships and privations of which she had scarcely before dreamed, a silent prayer of thankfulness welled up to that kind Providence, who, pouring out his good gifts upon them, had brought her back, at last, from that far land of golden toil, to rest in peace in the home of her childhood. Here every thing reminded her of the golden days of her unclouded youth, for Nature, more constant than man, remains unchanged with changing years, and woos us with her gentle voice, back to hallowed shrines deserted, and old feelings long since altered, or flung from us in weariness. How many a profligate has felt awakened in his breast, aspirations after lost purity; how many a criminal has wept tears of remorse in visiting the shrine of his early joys, the home of his childhood.
                  "By the way, brother Noble," she asked at length, rousing herself from her reverie, "what has become of Charlie Delham, dear, bright-hearted Charlie?"
                  "Oh! he married a fair Spanish Senora, with whom my gallant brother-in-law here once flirted desperately. I have no doubt the match has occasioned much mortification, both to the Colonel and my fair sister," glancing mischievously at them, "who, I suspect, flattered themselves that they had a broken heart apiece charged to their account. However, I have not the least fear but that Delham is very happy, with a princely fortune, and the most beautiful woman on record, if I may believe all I hear." This time the glance was at Colonel Haughton alone. "He is now in Mexico, but speaks of returning to Virginia, though I hope he will not, for Ida will be furiously jealous, and the poor Colonel, who leads a dog's life now with the little termagant, would never have any more peace."
                  Amid the merriment of the party, Ida seized a little riding-whip near, and aimed a blow at him, which he escaped by leaping from the steps to the ground, and upsetting the children, who retaliated by engaging him in a furious romp, which lasted until the ladies implored for peace.
                  "What have you to say to this, brother?" inquired Kate after the noise had subsided, turning with a half serious air to Col. Haughton.
                  A grave smile flitted over the Colonel's lips, and his dark eyes radiated light upon his "little wife" as he replied:
                  "'Her children rise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her!'"
               
            
            THE END.

            Probably no writer has had the same opportunities for becoming acquainted with NAPOLEON THE GREAT as the Duchess D'Abrantes. Her mother rocked him in his cradle, and when he quitted Brienne and came to Paris, she guided and protected his younger days. Scarcely a day passed without his visiting her house during the period which preceded his departure for Italy as COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. Abundant occasion was therefore had for watching the development of the great genius who afterwards became the master of the greater part of Europe.
            MARSHAL JUNOT, who became allied to the author of this work by marriage, was the intimate friend of Napoleon, and figured in most of the BRILLIANT ENGAGEMENTS which rendered him the greatest military captain of the age. No interruption took place in the intimacy which she enjoyed, so that in all these scenes, embracing a period of nearly THIRTY YEARS, the Duchess became familiar with all the secret springs of NAPOLEON'S ACTIONS, either through her husband or by her own personal knowledge and observation at the Court of Napoleon.
            JOSEPHINE, whose life and character so peculiarly attract the attention of all readers, occupies a great part of the first volume. The character and the deeds of THE EMPERORS AND KINGS, THE GREAT MEN OF THE DAY, THE MARSHALS OF THE EMPIRE, THE DISTINGUISHED LADIES OF THE COURT, are described with minuteness, which personal observation only admits of. The work is written in that FAMILIAR GOSSIPING STYLE, and so interspersed with anecdotes that the reader never wearies. She has put every thing in her book—great events and small.
            BATTLES AND BALLS, COURT INTRIGUES AND BOUDOIR GOSSIP, TREATIES AND FLIRTATIONS, making two of the most charming volumes of memoirs which will interest the reader in spite of himself.

               "Every thing relating to Napoleon is eagerly sought for and read in this country as well as in Europe, and this work, with its extraordinary attractions, will not fail to command a wide circulation. Madame Junot possessed qualifications for writing a semi-domestic history of the great Corsican which no other person, male or female, could command."—Life Illustrated.

               Criticisms of the Press.
               "The author is a literary gentleman of Baltimore, no Abolitionist, and we believe the work to be a truthful account of the life of a man who saw much more than falls to the lot of most men."—Commonwealth.
               
               "A remarkable volume is this; because of its undoubted truth: it having been derived by Mayer from personal conversations with Canot, and from journals which the slaver furnished of his own life."—Worcester Palladium.
               
               "Capt. Canot, the hero of the narrative, is, to our own knowledge, a veritable personage, and resides in Baltimore. There is no doubt that the main incidents connected with his extraordinary career are in every respect true.'—Arthur's Home Gazette.
               
               "Under one aspect, as the biography of a remarkable man who passed through a singularly strange and eventful experience, it is as interesting as any sea story that we have ever read."—Boston Evening Traveller.
               
               "Capt. Canot has certainly passed through a life of difficulty, danger, and wild, daring adventure, which has much the air of romance, and still he, or rather his editor, tells the tale with so much straightforwardness, that we cannot doubt its truthfulness."—New York Sunday Despatch.
               
               "The work could not have been better done if the principal actor had combined the descriptive talent of De Foe with the astuteness of Fouche and the dexterity of Gi. Blas, which traits are ascribed to the worthy whose acquaintance we shall soon make by his admiring editor."—N. Y. Tribune.
               
               "The general style of the work is attractive, and the narrative spirited and bold—well suited to the daring and hazardous course of life led by the adventurer. This book is illustrated by several excellent engravings."—Baltimore American.
               
               "The biography of an African slaver as taken from his own lips, and giving his adventures in this traffic for twenty years. With great natural keenness of perception and complete communicativeness, he has literally unmasked his real life, and tells both what he was and what he saw, the latter being the Photograph of the Negro in Africa, which has been so long wanted. A nephew of Mr. Mayer has illustrated the volume with eight admirable drawings. We should think no book of the present day would be received with so keen an interest."—Home Journal.
               
               "Capt. Canot has passed most of his life since 1819 on the ocean, and his catalogue of adventures at sea and on land, rival in grotesqueness and apparent improbability the marvels of Robinson Crusoe."—Evening Post.
               
               "If stirring incidents, hair-breadth escapes, and variety of adventure, can make a book interesting, this must possess abundant attractions."—Newark Daily Advertiser.
               
               "This is a true record of the life of one who had spent the greater part of his days in dealing in human flesh. We commend this book to all lovers of adventure."—Boston Christian Recorder.
               
               "We would advise every one who is a lover of 'books that are books'—every one who admires Le Sage and De Foe, and has lingered long over the charming pages of Gil Blas and Robinson Crusoe—every one, pro-slavery or anti-slavery, to purchase this book."—Buffalo Courier

                  Criticisms of the Press.
                  "This is a volume of elegant and impressive essays on the domestic relations and religious duties of the household. Mr. Osgood writes on these interesting themes in the most charming and animated style, winning the reader's judgement rather than coercing it to the author's conclusions. The predominant sentiments in the book are purity, sincerity, and love. A more delightful volume has rarely been published, and we trust it will have a wide circulation, for its influence must be salutary upon both old and young."—Commercial Advertiser.
                  
                  "The 'Hearth-Stone' is the symbol of all those delightful truths which Mr. Osgood here connects with it. In a free and graceful style, varying from deep solemnity to the most genial and lively tone, as befits his range of subjects, he gives attention to wise thoughts on holy things, and homely truths. His volume will find mary warm hearts to which it will address itself."—Christian Examiner.

                  From Ex-President FILLMORE. I have read "Party Leaders" with great satisfaction and delight, and return you a thousand thanks for the pleasure and instruction I have derived from the perusal.
               
                  From Honorable EDWARD EVERETT. What little I have as yet been able to read of it, has impressed me very favorably in reference to the ability and impartiality with which it is drawn up. I am prepared to read it with interest and advantage, in consequence of the pleasure I derived from "The Flush Times in Alabama."
               
                  From Honorable J. P. KENNEDY. I was greatly delighted with the fine, discriminating, acute insight with which the characters presented in the work are drawn, and with the eloquent style of the sketches. I but repeat the common opinion of the best judges, which I hear every where expressed, when I commend these qualities of the book.
               "The Flush Times of Alabama" had whetted my desire to see this second production of Mr. Baldwin's pen, and I can hardly express to you the agreeable surprise I enjoyed in finding a work of such surpassing merit in a tone and manner so entirely different from the first—demonstrating that double gift in the author which enables him to excel in two such opposite departments of literature.
               
                  From Hon. R. M. T. HUNTER, U. S. Senator from Virginia. I have read "Party Leaders" with great pleasure. It is written with ability, and with freshness, and grace of style, The chapters on Randolph are capital.
               
                  From Hon. JAMES M. MASON, U. S. Senator from Virginia. I have heard "Party Leaders" highly commended by those competent to judge, but confess I was not prepared for the intellectual and literary feast its rich pages have yielded.
               As a literary work, I shall be much disappointed if it does not place its author at once in the first rank of American literature, and even in old England. I shall look for its place next to, if not by the side of, the kindred works of McIntosh and Macaulay.
               
                  From a Distinguished Statesman. It is a noble production, full of profound thought, discriminating judgment, just criticism, and elevated sentiments, all expressed in the most captivating and eloquent style. It is a book just according to my fancy, and, I think, one of the most captivating in our language.

               "It is not only unlike the monstrous mass of efforts which have preceded it—and therefore, attractive in the light of comparison, and for its perfect newness—but it is freighted with such an ardor of style, fervor of imagination, beauty of description, both as regards characters and scenes, and a plenitude of genial spirit, that its reader is sure to be its lover.
               "The story, which commences about the middle of the last century, is located in Virginia, its personæ in dramatis being composed of many choice spirits who figured, or were supposed to figure, at that period. We have not seen its equal for many a day, and heartily apply to it the old verse,

               "The period of the story is about the middle of the last century; the place Williamsburg, Virginia, and its vicinity; the characters Virginia gentlemen of that day and generation, among whom comes Beatrice Hallam, the leading actress of a company of comedians of that ilk, and one of the most striking, truthful, and lovable characters in modern fiction. The interest of the book never flags. The characters are such that we cannot be indifferent to them, and the author absorbs us in their actions and their fate."—Courier & Enquirer.
               
               "The tone of the book is intensely national.

            CALHOUN, CLAY and WEBSTER are three names which will long be venerated by American Citizens. Of the three, Calhoun, during the early part of his life, was perhaps the greatest favorite with the people. His highly cultivated mind, profound views of government, and his pure character, gave great weight and importance to his opinions with all parties. Of the writings and speeches of American statesmen, there are scarcely any which bear so directly upon the great measures adopted by our Government, during the last forty years, as those of the lamented Calhoun. The War, the Revenue System, the Currency, and States Rights, were subjects upon which he took a leading position, and greatly aided the decisions which were made on them. With those who take an interest in our national history, the value of the writings of our public men cannot be too highly estimated.
            
               Opinions of the Press.
               "Mr. Calhoun was a man of noble intellect and pure principles, and was justly ranked among the 'first three' American statesmen of the present century."—Boston Traveller.
               
               "Mr. Calhoun's works form a part of the history of our country, and are necessary to be studied in order to gain a correct notion of many of the most important questions which have agitated parties among us."—Boston Daily Courier.
               
               "John C. Calhoun has been esteemed one of the greatest men in the annals of our country. The foundation of his greatness is based upon a sound and practical knowledge of government, a comprehensive view of national character, and a thorough understanding of the sources from which springs republican strength, true national greatness, and upon which depends the perpetuity of republican institutions."—Highland Eagle.
               
               "He was a man of pure mind, heart and life; and men confided in him because they saw and felt that in him there was an absence of all duplicity. He could be trusted. He was too unselfish to knowingly mislead. He was a man of great mental activity. His mind knew no rest. Such a mind must be housed in a strong physical tonement, or it will intellectualize the body, and break it down, Mr. Calhoun had such a physical system, until age came upon him, and his vital energies lost their recuperative force."—Palladium.
               
            
         
         
            
            CHESTNUT WOOD:
            An American Tale.
            BY LIELE LINDEN.
            Two volumes, 12mo. Paper covers, $1 25; cloth, $1 75.
            "Chestnut Wood will light up many a hearth with pleasure."
            
               PLOT OF THE STORY.
               Chestnut Wood is a country-seat, near Sleepy Hollow, owned and occupied by Mr. Atherton, a man of stern but not unkind disposition. The better feelings of his heart are brought into action, by the circumstances of his young grand-daughter, Sybil, the heroine of the tale, who is thrown, by the death of her mother at a farm-house in the vicinity, where she has been rescued from exposure on the road, upon his protection. The father of Sybil, as may be inferred from the fate of her mother, is a worthless scoundrel, who endeavors, with the help of associates as worthless as himself, to get possession of the child. They succeed in carrying her off, and concealing her in New York, where they employ her as an unconcious agent in the circulation of counterfeit money. She escapes from the wardship of an old misshapen hag, Moll, and is brought back to her home at Chestnut Wood; where, however, she is still subject to occasional manifestations from the same source.
