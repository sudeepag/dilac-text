                        I plant a tree whose leaf
                        The yew-tree leaf will suit;
                        But when its shade is o'er you laid,
                        Turn round and pluck the fruit!
                        Now reach my harp from off the wall
                        Where shines the sun aslant;
                        The sun may shine and we be cold—
                        O harken, loving hearts and bold,
                        Unto my wild romaunt!

            OBEYING THE HALLOWED REQUEST OF The Dear Departed, THAT, WERE
               THESE LEAFLETS EVER BOUND TOGETHER, THEY SHOULD BE INSCRIBED TO HIM, WHO WAS TO HER
               BOTH SKILFUL PHYSICIAN AND KINDEST FRIEND, TO DANIEL SWAN, M. D.

            PREFACE.
            To gratify a sacred, dying wish, have the writings now offered to the public in their
               present form, been gathered. "If you think they are worthy, let them be published
               after I am gone," said a young and lovely being, who lay wasting under the ruthless
               touch of that Destroyer, who loves to mark Earth's fairest beings for his own; and
               thus, with its merits and its faults—its beauties and its blemishes—goes forth this
               book.
            O reader, lingering over its pages, look not for the splendid passion-flowers of
               Life's fervid Summer, nor the hardier ones of the ripened Autumn time; only for
               sweet, tender Spring blossoms! O critic, let not these "Cypress Leaves" wither
               beneath thy touch—for they droop, greenly, above a a grave!

                        "She was born 'mong water-mills;
                        She grew up 'mong flowers and rills,
                        In the hearts of distant hills.
                     
                     
                        "There into her being stole
                        Nature, and imbued the whole,
                        And illumed her face and soul."
                     
                  
               
               MEMORY is a great Alchemist, who transmutes the Past to gold—an Embalmer, who
                  preserves in costly spices remembrances of the dead! And it is well: for, when the
                  loved ones have passed from our sight and we can talk with them no more—keeping a
                  vigil with Memory, only, all the long weary hours—holds the heart a single thought
                  of them, which is not far more precious than perishable earthly dross?
               Extravagant praise of the dead, I am well aware, is an error into which
                  biographers often fall; yet need my pen fear to record too eulogistic a tribute to
                  the memory of the gentle girl, whose earthly life was an embodiment of goodness
                  and loveliness, and whose "Cypress Leaves" are gathered to shed their sad laurels
                  upon her early grave?
               
               Every eye which lingers over these pages—every heart which has thrilled at some
                  token of her worth—every heart in that household band, where 
                     
                        "None knew her but to love her,
                        None named her but to praise,—
                     
                   and beside whose hearthstone standeth a vacant chair where she
                  once sat, will answer—"No!"
               LOUISE J. CUTTER was born at Medford, Massachusetts, August 15th, 1835. In her
                  childhood she was a gentle, delicate girl—the pet of the home circle, and much
                  beloved by her schoolmates. Those days passed to her as all such early days
                  do—pleasantly, speedily, with the myriad little joys and griefs, hopes and fears,
                  which drape with lights and shadows life's rosiest time. As a child, there was
                  little promise of the poetic gift which afterward dowried the life of the young
                  girl, making it so rich with beautiful, earnest imaginings. Not until her
                  fifteenth year did she weave her first poem; nor then, until at the suggestion of
                  another, was it deemed, by her, worthy of publication; but, eliciting the voice of
                  commendation, it was shortly followed by other articles both in song and
                  prose.
               Yet it was with fear and trembling that she entered the realms of authorland. As a
                  young novice takes upon herself the vows which bind her to a new life—bending
                  before the shrine, dropping the beads of her rosary, and murmuring Ave Marias all the while—so the pearls of thought
                  slipped from her spirit's grasp and were uttered in strains of mournful, holy
                  music.
               And then came the voice of praise and public approval, which is so very sweet to
                  all young authors who send forth the tender fledglings of their genius from the
                  home-nest to the outer world. How gratifying, when other voices
                  answered her own, and the "echo-songs" of kindred hearts reached her in her
                  solitude. Her desire for recognition was satisfied. Loving, childlike hearts,
                  lingering over the creations of her pen, wondered if the author of those gentle
                  limnings were not also fair and gentle and good. And such, indeed, was she! In
                  character, Louise J. Cutter was all that was sweet, pure, lovely! There are none
                  perfect on earth—"no, not one,"—but there have been earthly lives which seemed
                  types of the heavenly, and deaths, beautiful, almost perfect in their accompanying
                  angelic Patience, Faith, Hope. Such was the life she led of whom we write—such was
                  the death she died—ennobled by seraphic Love.
               During a period of three years, Louise J. Cutter was a welcome contributor to the
                  press, her stories and poems finding an honored station in the publications of the
                  day. In health, writing was her favorite pursuit; and afterward, when illness had
                  lain its blighting hand upon her frame, still did she strive to breathe forth the
                  earnest thoughts which filled her soul; and not until the later days of her life,
                  when the feeble hand failed utterly to transcribe the visions which floated ever
                  before her—not until then, in the new life which was fast dawning for her, did the
                  "sweet singer" lay down her harp, to
                  sweep its cords no more until they were to be re-touched in Heaven.
               To the true poet-soul there is no death! That which we
                     call Death is but a transition from the Finite to the Infinite—a
                  step over the threshold—from a poor feeble life, to a fuller, stronger, nobler.
                  Says Mrs. Browning, 
                     
                        O, the world is weak—
                        The effluence of each is false to all;
                        And what we best conceive, we fail to speak.
                        Wait soul, until thine ashen garments fall!
                        And then resume thy broken strains, and seek
                        Fit peroration, without let or thrall,—
                     
                   and such insufficiency was felt by the poet-soul of the gentle girl, who, in
                  those last days, when the life-sands were slowly but surely ebbing, looking upon
                  the tender mother who bent above her, whispered, with a faint sweet smile—"Mother,
                  I shall SING in Heaven."
               Her nature was deeply moral; hence, everything she wrote was imbued with a
                  pervading sentiment of the Good and True. Scorning deceit and treachery as she
                  would a baser crime, every creation of her mind taught the final triumph of virtue
                  over the machinations of voice, and breathed of the high aims and purposes which
                  swayed her life.
               With fine feelings, and a loving disposition, she had constant fellowship with all
                  gentle, loving things—with animate and inanimate Nature—birds, flowers, running
                  brooks—but more with tender human hearts. In her friendships she was firm,
                  constant—scorning deceit and falsity; giving out the love of an honorable soul and
                  craving a like return. To such minds there can come no more painful truth than the
                  consciousness that they have been deceived—investing the objects of their regard
                  with imaginary perfections, and then, waking and weeping "to find their idols
                  clay!"
               But it was in the home-circle that the tender emotions of Louise's nature found
                  fullest scope. Gentle, playful, affectionate—the dutiful daughter and loving
                  sister—she was an ornament to the home that enshrined her—the fairest flower that
                  blossomed there.
               To her mother, whose love for her child seemed no common affection—but more like
                  the tie which binds an elder to a younger sister, her whole heart went out. At
                  once child and companion, that relation was very touching and beautiful. Absence
                  from her side was painful always; but after disease had weakened her feeble frame,
                  the shelter of her mother's arms and heart was doubly necessary.
               The love of life is natural to all. The aged crave to stay a little longer here;
                  but how strong the tie which binds to earth the young and beloved! For her of whom
                  we write, life had many charms—the love of family and friends—of mother, father,
                  brothers, sister, all united to her heart by precious links in the chain of
                  home-love; and thus, with such tender arms about her, the stamp of Genius on her
                  brow, and Hope singing sweet songs and gilding her future with rosy light—what
                  wonder that she clung to earth for a season?
               
               To the young and beloved the grave is very drear, until Faith points to the life
                  beyond; and when we mark the first touch of the spoiler's hand, how earnestly pray
                  we that God will turn it aside. But ah, it cannot always be! "His ways are not as
                  our ways."
               In the winter of 1853, an illness which had attacked Louise and confined her to
                  her bed for several weeks, left her in a feeble, delicate state, which caused
                  parents and friends much anxiety.
               Dr. Swan, of Medford, the family physician, who had always manifested a fatherly
                  interest in the lovely girl, recommended a change—country air and exercise; which
                  opinion was also expressed by Dr. Warren, of Boston, to whom the anxious parents
                  carried their child for advice.
               In the spring, finding that she still continued weak, to the health-giving hills
                  of New Hampshire, the mother took her sick girl; but the pure country breezes
                  brought no strength to her. A few weeks went by, and daily she seemed to grow
                  feebler; increasing weakness precluded the equestrian exercise which had been
                  recommended; and, in accordance with the advice of a skilful physician, who,
                  looking upon the wasting girl, said, "My child, you had better go back to the
                  quiet of your own home," the mother returned thither with her.
               And then—but alas, how sad to trace the path of the Destroyer! The kindling eye,
                  the brilliant flush on the still-rounded cheek, the crimson lips—they
                  could no longer deceive; for the painful lassitude of step, the exhaustion which
                  followed undue exertion, the shorten- ing breath, the pallor which at fitful
                  intervals usurped the hectic flush, and, above all, the hollow cough which began
                  to sound a knell to hope—all these woke wildest fears, and whispered a word which
                  has thrilled many and many a heart with agony—Consumption!
               
               Perhaps, until now, no thought of Death and the "cool still grave" had crossed the
                  brain of the youthful dreamer—no thought that her way must wend in
                  the path of the early called; or likelier yet, if such thoughts had intruded on
                  her silent hours, she had never given them utterance, fearing to wound the hearts
                  that cherished her so tenderly; but now, Fear, dark and trembling, stood beside
                  her, and she shrank from the way her feet were treading. But a record, found among
                  her papers, written at this time, will express her feelings better than the pen of
                  another can.
               "LOUISE'S LIFE JOURNAL."
               "Here shall my secret thoughts be traced, and, hidden from unfriendly eyes, rest
                  quietly as in their own heart-home. Aye, rest quietly thou children of my soul!
                  sleep till life's trials come upon me, till life's sorrows encompass me in gloom,
                  till life's darkness gathers upon my brow—then may I come to thee, my soul's own
                  children, and in thine unseen presence, forget life and life's cold world of
                  darkness!
               "——, July 1st. To-day I am sick! sick in body, sick at heart, but ah! not
                     sick of life! The blue heavens look calm and bright in their summer
                  beauty. The pure air comes in at my open
                  window, filling my still chamber with the sweet breath of summer flowers. Ah!
                     last summer the rose bloomed upon my cheek; last summer I walked
                  proudly forth in my own joyous health and strength. God grant that I may yet again
                  walk thus!
               "But now, my cheek is pale and sunken—my step slow and unsteady—and health and
                  strength are gone from me. I feel that my hour of life may be short—and yet I
                  cannot feel reconciled to the decree of heaven. I cannot say in humbleness of
                  spirit, "My Father's will be done!" I fear the icy touch of Death—I fear the
                  passage through the dark valley—and I fear the cold, still grave. Oh! I cannot lie
                  quietly in its narrow depth! I cannot leave the glad bright earth, ere youth's
                  fair roses have perished from Life's wayside! Oh, inexorable Death!
               "My home—my kindred—my sweet mother—how, oh, how can I leave ye all?
                  How can I give up life, when its spring time is upon me? When youthful hope is
                  brightest, and youthful dreams linger so sweetly in my heart? Oh, I cannot,
                     cannot die now. Life seems so sweet, so dear, that I
                  could not rest well in the churchyard; I could not go peacefully to sleep under
                  the cold sod—sleep, to moulder into dust! Oh, gracious Father, grant me life yet a
                  little longer!—yet why do I ask it? do with me as Thou wilt, my prayer shall be
                  for submission to Thy will.
               "And if I die,—if I go down to the dark grave in my youth's rosiest time, I will
                  yet watch over thee, dear kindred ones! My spirit shall come to thee, sweet
                  mother, at the still midnight hour; and though unfelt, unseen, my lips shall press
                  thy brow, blessing thee ever for the love thou bearest thy child. Sweet mother, if
                  God takes me from thy circling arms, do not grieve for me! Think that I am near
                  thee in the hour of quiet and the time of sorrow; think that each night I visit
                  thee with a blessing from the Father's lips—that I love thee still with my olden
                  fervent love, made stronger in the purity of Heaven. And you, my W——, my loved
                  one! Thou wilt grieve for the sister of thy youth—grieve that she will no more
                  walk beside thee in life—that thou canst never again press the brother's kiss upon
                  her cheek. Yet sorrow not, dear one of my heart. Though I walk not with thee like
                  one of earth, my spirit will go beside thee henceforth, and silently love and
                  bless thee still. Yes, yes! I will be with ye all—beloved father, sweet mother,
                  dear brothers and sister! Dear to my heart in life—in death ye shall still be
                  dearer."
               Again—in one of those deceitful pauses in consumption, when, flatteringly, he
                  seems to paint the cheeks with the hue of returning health, and wakens new
                  hope—for a little time Louise seemed stronger; and another journey, with change of
                  air and scene was recommended.
               In the latter part of September, 1853, she was taken to New York by a brother—and
                  there, amid the kind- est attentions of
                  relatives and friends who devoted themselves assiduously to the gentle invalid,
                  for a period it seemed as if the inroads of disease were stayed.
               With revived hope, she again took the exercise which weakness had hitherto
                  precluded; and so, her faltering steps guided by strong and tender arms, she
                  walked forth on sunny days, visiting the places of public interest in a great
                  city—or, riding out into the country, looked upon the face of Nature which seemed
                  always to her like that of a mother.
               No resort interested her so much as the Crystal Palace. The treasures of Art
                  congregated therein—especially the statuary—were sources of inexhaustible
                  pleasure. Standing before the marble into which the sculptor has wrought the
                  dreams of his poet-soul, she seemed to live a new life, enriched thenceforth with
                  beautiful visions. For statuary is but an outward, tangible form of the indwelling
                  grace and beauty enshrined in human hearts. Every poet cannot be a sculptor—but
                     every sculptor is a poet.
               
               An extract from a letter written home during that time will express the emotions
                  she felt upon one of these visits.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              NEW YORK, Nov. 1st, 1853.
                           
                           "DEAR MOTHER:—Yesterday I went to the World's Fair. The day was very
                              beautiful; the air clear and sweet as in summer time. W—— went with
                              me, and he was so tender, so careful lest I should be wearied, that I
                              could not feel fatigued. I was much pleased with everything I saw, but
                              will only mention what interested me most—the statuary.
                              The two little marble, children representing "the Children in the
                              wood," struck me as being particularly beautiful. They lay sleeping in
                              each other's arms, as babes lie in the home-cradle when the mother's
                              eye is watching their slumbers—the plump feet looking so life-like,
                              the little dimpled hands clasped lovingly around each other's forms,
                              the pouting lips seeming as if about to part to ring forth a peal of
                              infant glee; and the sweet, careless innocence hovering in each fair
                              face, made them seem to me like two cherubs strayed from Heaven, who,
                              in wandering over the lower world, had fallen asleep in the arms of
                              Nature.
                           "The "Perfumed Fountain" was very beautiful, but I will not describe
                              it here—but will tell you of the group that pleased me most—"Christ
                              and the Twelve Disciples." W—— wished me to feel the whole effect of
                              this, so he lad me before it with my eyes shut; and when he bade me
                              upon them I drew in my breath with a long inspiration, for it was to
                              me as if I were in holy presence. Those chiselled figures, with their
                              impressive faces, seemed to give the very air a tinge of sacredness;
                              and when I turned back to give a farewell look, a ray of brightness
                              from the calm, sweet smile on the Savior's face seemed to enter my
                              heart and make it purer.
                           "Above stairs, the gallery of paintings interested me much—one
                              picture, especially, representing Wreckers plundering the bodies of
                              the dead and dying whom they
                              had wickedly decoyed upon the reefy shore. And some of those upturned
                              faces—oh, how they pleaded for mercy! It was terribly beautiful—that
                              picture.
                           "I must mention something that I saw which will please the children.
                              It was a figure of Captain Gulliver surrounded by the Lilliputian
                              army. Gulliver was lying down, with mouth and eyes wide open as if in
                              utter astonishment. The army of "little men" were literally all around
                              and over him. One sat upon his elbow, (his arm being thrown over his
                              head,) another had climbed upon the toe of his shoe, one into his vest
                              pocket, a whole host were stationed under his arm, and others had
                              raised a ladder against one of his legs and thrown a thread over
                                 it to bind him down! It reminded me of an ocean of tiny fish
                              striving to capture a whale.
                           "I wish very much that the children could have seen it. There is
                              something here to gratify every taste; and I saw almost everything,
                              for W—— walked slowly, and was so careful that I did not soon get
                              tired. But I have all in my mind's eye, so that, were I
                              able, I do not think I should wish to go again.
                           "Next week, if possible, I expect to be at home—for I long for my
                              little chamber and my home more than you can think, and I know that my
                              mother, too, longs to welcome back her
                           
                              LOUISE."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Shortly after, she returned home; and then the reaction came. Daily her strength
                  failed her; and when the dreary winter days came, and, weak, ill, and suffering,
                  she lay upon her bed—then she listened no longer to the flattering voice of Hope,
                  but knew that she was surely, surely, treading that path, through which, sooner or
                  later, every foot must pass.
               Then came a change. Fear, dark and gloomy, brooded no more above her pillow; but
                  Peace, instead, descended like a white dove, and folded its wings over her heart
                  during all those long hours of fading strength—fading life—and fading earthly
                  hopes.
               The shadow had passed from her soul; the mercy of the Infinite had been granted
                  her, strengthening her with promises of pardon, and of a new life where there
                  should be neither suffering, sorrow, or sighing, nor any more sin.
               And the same gentleness and quiet which had characterized every emotion of her
                  previous life, guided her in this great change. In her dearest earthly loves she
                  was undemonstrative, save by the gentlest tones and looks of affection; and now,
                  in the presence of this very great new Love, Whose rays illumined a life already
                  so near the confines of the tomb, she did not noisily herald the happiness which
                  filled her soul,—but folding Peace, like a mantle, around her, calmly awaited her
                  summons. Yet, by the purer, holier light which dwelt in her clear hazel eyes—by
                  the gentle patience with which she bore sufferings that grew painfully severe as
                  life neared its termination—by the reproachful glances with which she said to the
                  weepers about her bed, "Mourn not for me.
                  I shall soon see Heaven!" by all these blessed assurances, was it known that other
                  than earthly arms were upbearing her then—that the Stay and Comforter
                  was beside her.
               One pleasant, spring-like day in March, 1854, the writer of this biography stood
                  beside. Louise J. Cutter. Lying on a sofa in her darkened sick room, with a face
                  emaciated and scarcely less white than the pillow which supported her, yet still
                  exquisitely lovely in the contour of its
                  features and the spirituelte expression which
                  lay thereon—with clear hazel eyes unnaturally brilliant, and waves of burnished
                  chestnut hair oversweeping a damp white forehead—all this fading loveliness giving
                  token of what she might have been in health and strength—so I found her.
               In her emaciated hand she held a little common-place book, "in which," she said
                  with a faint smile, holding it toward us, "she had been trying to write
                  poetry."
               Ah, it needed no TRYING! for the Poem, traced in faint, trembling chirography
                  there, was a very heart-cry!—the "Last Wish" of her poet-soul. Like the dying
                  swan's, her last notes were the sweetest. This latest poem she never wrote,
                  pencilled during those long weary hours of fading life, is one of the saddest,
                  sweetest things that ever brought tears—telling the whole story of a heart which
                  submits meekly, uncomplainingly, to the decree of the Father, yet implores to
                  linger yet a little upon our pleasant earth until the birds and flowers she had so
                  loved should come again—and then, when Nature was bright and fair, "to die in
                  summer time."
               With aching heart I turned from the meek fair face before me to the written page
                  again; nor did woman's eyes alone grow dim, reading that sad, sweet aspiration of
                  a poet-soul, for manhood's heart questioned the decree which had gone forth for
                  her.
               "Is she not beautiful?" asked my companion, as we went forth and left her there,
                  to look upon her face no more on earth.
               "Yes, very, very lovely!" I replied; but it was not a vision of a fading, dying,
                     earthly being I bore thence with me into the outer world—it was to
                  me as if I had looked upon an angel!
               "The Last Wish," shortly afterward, at the request of a friend who visited her
                  often during her illness, appeared in the columns of the "American Union," a
                  weekly for which she had been a valued contributor, and elicited the following
                  reply which is inserted in these pages in accordance with the wishes of
                  others.

                              WISH."
                           
                              The April skies have wept their fitful tears
                              Into the tender bosom of the sod—
                              And thus, all silently, thy shadowy fears
                              Are laid upon the bosom of thy God.
                              Thou dost not fear to die—to pass away
                              In youth and beauty, and thy girlhood's prime,
                              But only breathe a sweet "Last Wish," to stay
                              Upon the earth till blooms the summer-time.
                           
                           
                           
                              Once, only once, I stood thy pillow by,
                              And saw the crimson flushing of thy cheek—
                              And marked the brilliant glory of thine eye,
                              And heard thy voice in tender accents speak,
                              Oh, were there power by earthly spell or prayer
                              To win thy pathway from the "early dead,"
                              
                                 I had not turned away—and left thee there—
                              My heart so heavy then with tears unshed!
                              
                           
                           
                              I know not if 'twill e'en be granted me
                              To clasp thy hand, or hear thy voice again;
                              We may not meet this side Eternity—
                              Yet was that hour beside thee not in vain;
                              
                              For, where in Memory's halls, are pictures hung—
                              To gaze upon thro' all life's coming years,
                              I look on one sweet face, so fair and young,
                              But oh, so pale! I may not stay my
                                 tears.
                           
                           
                              I mind me now of that oft-chanted strain—
                              The sad sweet words an olden poet sung;
                              It hath been so, and still must be again—
                              "They, by the immortal gods beloved, die young!"
                              And if, Louise, thy gentle feet must stray
                              Blest vallies through, and heavenly kingdoms o'er,—
                              If to the "Silent Land" thou tak'st thy way,
                              We will not call thee "lost, but gone before."
                           
                           
                              E'en now the Spring is here with early bloom,
                              And forest paths are gemmed with trailing flowers;
                              And soon will come the deep blue skies of June—
                              Delicious days of long, bright summer hours;
                              And anthems glad are hymned by singing birds,
                              And glad-voiced waters gush upon the air—
                              And music's tones, and childhood's gleesome words,
                              And balmy winds are floating everywhere.
                           
                           
                              And lovingly bends down the soft May sky,
                              And human hearts are growing glad and light—
                              Ah, woe that with the Summer thou must die!
                              That unto thee hath come the "early blight!"
                              Yet there are climes where endless Summer is—
                              Where flowers are ever vernal, and the skies
                              Bend always blue as June—how blest to live
                              Within the Summer-clime of Paradise!
                           
                           
                              And oh, how blest to sing thy poet-songs
                              In climes where Jesus speaketh lovingly!
                              How blest to strike thy harp among the throngs
                              On whom the All-Father smileth tenderly!
                              How blest to go when years are light and few—
                              Ere the fresh heart hath lost its early prime—
                              To walk with Christ the eternal gardens through
                              Where all is bloom and "Endless
                                    Summer-time!"
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Shortly afterward, there came to me a very touching and beautiful note, written in
                  a weak, trembling hand, which is now given to other eyes as a sacred revelation of
                  the beauty of that heart which prompted such gentle expressions of regard, and a
                  recognition of the interest with which she had inspired others.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "MY DEAR FRIEND,—
                           
                           How can I thank you for the lines you wrote me? They were so
                              beautiful—and they came, too, in time for me to read them ere my eyes
                              are closed forever, for I am lying now upon my sick bed, and my little
                              bark of life is floating silently and surely toward the 'Land of
                              Eternal Summer.'
                           
                           "I am very weak. I have hardly been able, for a few days past, to
                              speak aloud, but to-day feel a little better; and though I thought I
                              should not write again, I cannot let pass the opportunity to thank you
                              for your poem. Ah, my dear friend, you do not know how earnestly I
                              wish that 'earthly prayers' could win me from the 'early
                              blight' which seem awaiting me! I do not dread to die: I have no fears
                              for the life beyond the grave: I know that happiness awaits me there:
                              and yet, though my strength is all departed, and life seems nearly
                              fled from me, if it were God's will, I should wish, oh! so intensely,
                              to linger yet a few more years upon our pleasant earth.
                           "But I fear it cannot be—I fear that I must soon pass away!—but I
                              shall not be forgotten! I know, my friend, that you will cherish my
                              memory—I know that it will steal over you in many an hour of silent
                              revery. You will come sometime to see my darling mother—and if my
                              grave is made in our little churchyard you will visit it. Think, while
                              you stand beside it, that the upturned face beneath is smiling on you;
                              and that the still lips, could they move, would say, 'God bless
                              you!'
                           "I must not write longer. I am growing weary. My heart sends you its
                              last farewell.
                           
                              LOUISE J. CUTTER."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               And now, indeed, her "little bark of life" was floating silently and surely toward
                  "the land of eternal summer!" The blue violets had opened and shut their starry
                  eyes upon the hill-slopes—the sweet May-time was past—the June roses had blushed
                  and faced—sultry days came, when July, hot, panting, lapsed into August's arms—and
                  then, in the prime of the summer, the messenger came!
               The chords of life, so long strained to their utmost tension, would soon be
                  severed, fainter and fainter grew the laboring breath; fierce pang and suffering
                  could no more rack her frame; and the weary heart would soon be at rest; for, on
                  the first bright, warm August day, she lay dying.
               Around her were gathered the household band—mother, father, brothers, sister, all
                  there; and the brother best beloved supporting her head in his arms. There was no
                  fear in her soul that last hour: she spake as only those speak to whom the
                  Comforter hath come—"Mother, father, weep not! I shall soon see Heaven! Brothers,
                  little sister, you will not forget Louise. So live that we shall meet again beside
                  the Saviour's throne."
               Such were the messages, fraught with holy tenderness, her latest breath uttered.
                  That was no gloomy death-bed from which the soul of the poet-girl went up to
                  heaven.
               In the Bible, which was an unfailing companion during the hours of her illness,
                  are three leaves folded down by her own hand, marking passages which had been to
                  her Divine sources of consolation. The 23d Psalm—14th chapter of St. John—and 12th chapter of Ecclesiastes, contain the
                  promises and the exposition of that Faith which made her death bed so serene.
                  Angel Louise!—would that every dying hour were peaceful calm, as thine!
               Mournfully the tidings of her death went out from the place where her life had
                  lapsed into the better. Beyond the home-circle, whose grief no pen of mine can
                  transcribe, the story of her departure brought tears. Many, not having seen, still
                  loved her. The ripples from her poet-soul had circled outwardly over the waters of
                  that sea whereon other barks, freighted like her own, were
                  sailing—and the returning tide had cast many a remembrance and token at her feet.
                  And when her frail tiny skiff had sailed beyond their sight on the
                  waves of the "dark river," there were sad requiems sung for the departed.
               Many touching and beautiful tributes to her memory appeared in the publications of
                  the day, some of which, are transferred to these pages.
               The first given, is from the pen of a lady whose moral worth has endeared her to
                  her personal friends no less than her literary talent has to the reading
                  community.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           LINES,
                           ADDRESSED TO THE FAMILY OF THE LAMENTED LOUISE J.
                              CUTTER.
                           BY MRS. L. S. GOODWIN.
                           
                              Dare I approach within the pale
                              Of grief as sacred, deeply due,
                              As ever woke the spirit's wail,
                              As ever broken household knew?
                              I—who have stayed inert with dread,
                              The while so earnest others aimed
                              To shower fragrance 'round her bed
                              Whom Muses loved and angels claimed?
                           
                           
                              Or what the balm I may impart?
                              Save—parents, brothers—ye will deign
                              Accept the tribute of a heart
                              That fervent mingles in your pain.
                              "Yet let's together lift the gaze
                              From valley clods and pallid bier,
                              And trace her 'mid immortal rays,
                              Whose charms were e'en celestial here.
                           
                           
                              Here was a narrow sea to cross,
                              And soon was gained the pleasant shore—
                              No more on stormy waves to toss,
                              To bear the earthly lot no more.
                              Hers was a mind of rarest gift,—
                              Holdings communion with the stars;—
                              Painting to soar through clouds a-rift,
                              It early burst its prison bars!
                           
                           
                              He wisely rules whose "Name is Love,"
                              And wisely to His will we bow;
                              His tenderest lov'd are called above
                              With youth's fair impress on the brow—
                              
                              As trust we 'neath soft summer skies
                              The cherished plant to outer air,
                              But when autumnal storms arise
                              Within, its fragile sweetness bear.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               From Mrs. Caroline A. Hayden, the authoress of "Carrie Emerson," the following
                  fitting and beautiful meed to the departed was given to the public: 
                     
                        "Young, beautiful and gifted! words like these.
                        Seemed coined to mock life's stern realities;
                        Else why thus early perish? Can there be
                        On earth no sheltered nook for such as thee?
                        Where the young bud may gather for its dower
                        Just strength enough to shield it from the power
                        Of the insidious foe which oftenest flings
                        Its mildew blight o'er earth's most glorious things.
                        The open brow wears yet a purer white;
                        The lustorus eye beams with a holier light;
                        And on the cheek the hectic fever-flush
                        Tinges the rose-tint with a deeper blush;
                        The foot has lost its light elastic tread,
                        The glad voice caught a tremulous tone instead;
                        And the bright dreams that clustered round the heart,
                        Touched by the same mysterious hand, depart.
                        While, like the flame upon some funeral pyre,
                        Flashes the light of genius, higher—higher!
                        And every effort of the fertile brain,
                        Gives out a nobler, more inspiring strain,
                        Till, like the dying dolphin, beauty's gleam
                        Has left its brilliant trace o'er life's dull stream.
                     
                     
                        "Young, beautiful, and gifted! words like these
                        Comes like the footfall of God's messenger, who sees
                        A blight about to fall upon the heart,
                        More deep, more fatal than the poisoned dart
                        Which sin and sorrow flings, when years of care
                        Have taught the mind a hiding mask to wear;
                        Too beautiful and fragile for the strife,
                        With which stern Fate oft mingles common life;
                        Too sensitive and shrinking for the blast,
                        Which comes in fitful changes sweeping past;
                        And all too finely strung the spirit lyre,
                        To bear the touch of aught save spirit fire;
                        Earth is no dwelling-place for such as thou!
                        Too soon its breath would shade thy glorious brow
                        There are no fetters for the free glad soul,
                        O'er which the waves of death but once may roll,—
                        And thou, all pure, etherialized, may blend
                        With the heart-worship of each stricken friend,
                        And by thine unseen presence help them still
                        To bend, submissive, to the Father's will."
                     
                  
               
               "Winnifred Woodfern"—a talented lady contributor to the press—who had once met the
                  gentle girl, addressed to her during her illness the following lines: 
                     
                        Louise! Louise! the many lays now blending
                        Like grand key-notes in harmonies divine—
                        The words of love so many hearts are sending,
                        Fill me with fear,—I come to offer mine!
                        Led by the memory of that day in summer,
                        When, 'mid my tears, I read thy words of love,—
                        When my heart yearned toward the sweet new comer,
                        Now looking towards her glorious home above!
                     
                     
                        Louise, I loved thee, when thine eyes, clear beaming,
                        Sought in my own a kindred glance to find!
                        Louise, I love thee! in my sweetest dreaming,
                        Thine is the form still present to my mind!
                        
                        Yet, since that day of brief and blest communion,
                        When thoughts my heart long pined to say, were told,
                        I sought not, dreamed not, nearer love or union,—
                        And thus perchance, thou deemest me changed or cold!
                     
                     
                     
                        A few last words:—If thou art spared, to show us
                        What angels on this fallen earth may be,
                        Then thy pure spirit well will read and know us—
                        Then thou will learn how I remembered thee!
                        If I must read Death's mystery before thee,
                        Come sometimes where what once has loved three sleeps,
                        Kneel on my grave—shed tears of sorrow o'er me—
                        And I shall know, even in the mold, who weeps!
                     
                     
                        If thy sweet eyes are closed in deathly slumber,
                        And thou are taken home to God and Heaven,
                        Thou, of His saints, will swell the glorious number,
                        And to thy hands the sweetest harp be given!
                        Then fare thee well! When in that blest assemblage
                        Thy strains float earthward, walking the divine,
                        If one the upward air a prayer comes trembling,
                        Bear it to God, sweet angel,—'twill be mine!
                     
                  
               
               "Lottie Linwood," too, wove a tender heart-song in her memory. 
                     
                        As a birdling flies from its nest away
                        To a south-land rich with blooms,
                        Or the brilliant clouds of a summer's day
                        Melt when the evening comes,—
                        Or, as the gentlest rose-leaves fall,
                        When touched by frost's chill breath,
                        So answered she thy meaning call—
                        Oh stern, relentless Death!
                     
                     
                        I knew her net, yet her warbling tone
                        O'er my spirit's lyre hath thrilled;
                        Tho' the harp is loosed, and the minstrel gone,
                        And the pale cold hands are stilled,
                        Yet it floateth out on the dreamy air
                        As I sit 'neath the harvest moon,
                        And I dream of a maiden young and fair,
                        And I weep that she slept so soon.
                     
                     
                        Oh, the young, the good, the gifted!—all
                        Whom best we love, must die!
                        
                           And the flowers wreathe out a folding pall—
                        
                        
                           Winds sing their litany!
                        
                        And the angels chant when the good of earth
                        Lie down in the grave to sleep,
                        And they strike their harps for another birth
                        In the land where they never weep.
                     
                  
               
               Anna M. Bates, a pleasing young poetess, sings of her also— 
                     
                        No more may her fingers awaken
                        The music that breathed o'er love's chords—
                        The bloom from the rose tree is shaken,
                        And hushed are her own charmed words;
                        But still doth there come a faint quiver—
                        Not yet are those sweet echoes o'er—
                        They will float far away down Time's river
                        And alas, we shall hear them no more!
                     
                     
                        Hath the perfumed lamp died on the altar,
                        While blossoms still garland its shrine?
                        And did not the death-angel falter
                        As he listened her notes so divine?
                        
                        Ah no! she is laid in her grave-bed—
                        The gifted, the lovely, the fair—
                        And fame, from his laurels, is shedding
                        Green leaflets to weave 'mid her hair.
                     
                     
                        Weep not for the mind who is lying
                        So silent, so pulseless and pale!
                        Bright forms hovered round her in dying
                        And led her across the dark vale.
                        She hath gone to make songs for the angels
                        
                        Away on a beautiful shore;
                        And never the dirge-notes of sorrow
                        May breath through her melodies more!
                     
                  
               
               Another tribute, from the pen of Lissa M. E. Burrill, follows: 
                     
                        Another harp is broken,
                        Its spell-touched strings are mute!
                        Strive not one strain to waken
                        From that sweet silent lute!
                        On earth its cords are shattered—
                        Forever sadly riven—
                        But 'mid the blessed singers
                        'Tis swept anew in Heaven!
                     
                     
                        Another bird has faltered
                        Upon its weary way,
                        And down with folded winglet
                        Its panting form must lay;
                        But in a home of glory,
                        Where hymns of rapture swell,
                        Hath gone our poet sister—
                        Our sweet Louise, to dwell.
                     
                  
               
               Many other articles of a like nature to the above, appeared after her decease; but
                  we will quote no more to these pages excepting some few from the "Obituary'
                  notices which announced her death in the various papers for which she had been a
                  welcome and valued contributor.
               The pen of William E. Graves, Esq., editor of the American Union, recorded the
                  following token of friendship and respect:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "LOUISE J. CUTTER.
                           "Our readers have undoubtedly all learned, ere this, the sad
                              intelligence of the death of this interesting young lady and
                              accomplished writer, at the early age of nineteen. Young, beautiful
                              and beloved, she died—the victim of consumption! The mournful result
                              has filled the hearts of her many friends with profound grief. There
                              is always something deeply and peculiarly affecting in the death of
                              the young and beautiful. But in the gradual decline of the poor victim
                              of consumption, it has been often remarked— 
                                 
                                    "There is a sweetness in woman's decay,
                                    When the light of her beauty is fading away,"
                                 
                               that renders the scene doubly touching and solemn. A fairer,
                              gentler being, or one of more spotless purity, we have reason to
                              believe, never gladdened earth with her smile. During the latter part
                              of her illness, her sufferings were intense. But she felt prepared to
                                 welcome death, and she
                              longed to be where pain and suffering would be known no more.
                           "Many a reader will at once recall to mind, at this time, the "Last
                              Wish" of the dying girl, published in our columns in early
                              spring-time.
                           "The original copy, in her own handwriting, is before us. And how well
                              these lines portrayed her feelings at that time! Who could fail to
                              sympathize with that gentle being who knew that Death had marked her
                              for his own?—or who could fail to join in the prayer that the last
                              wish might be realized, where she entreats, 
                                 
                                    Let me hear the song of the summer birds,
                                    That is hushed in the wildwood now—
                                    Let me feel the touch of the summer breeze
                                    Once more on my heated brow!
                                    Let me feel once more through my lattice come
                                    The rose's and violet's breath—
                                    Let me see the flowers and the springing grass,
                                    Ere I sleep in the arms of Death.
                                 
                              
                           
                           "That she was fully aware of her situation at the time, is plain from
                              the verse where she says, 
                                 
                                    The crimson flush is on my cheek,
                                    The brightness in my eye!—
                                    And the dark seal set on my brow
                                    That bringeth death's cold sigh;
                                    But I know that the Saviour's open arms
                                    Will take me to his breast,
                                    And his gentle smile beam on me there
                                    In the land of eternal rest.
                                 
                              
                           
                           "Among the most intimate, perhaps, of her friends in this vicinity, we
                              have never entertained a doubt, from repeated interviews, that the
                              hope conveyed in the last four lines of the verse just quoted, cheered
                              and sustained the gentle girl, during many hours of untold anguish and
                              distress. If she—the sinless—had offended any being on earth, she had
                              asked forgiveness. She had made her peace with Heaven; and she longed
                              to go there—to be away from the world, and at rest.
                           "And yet, notwithstanding all this, with the wail of the winter winds
                              drifting coldly and drearily by, how could she help adding, 
                                 
                                    But I long to hear the pleasant sounds
                                    Which the wildwood warblers pour,
                                    And to gaze on the soft blue skies again
                                    Ere I go to return no more.
                                    I long to see the violets bloom.
                                    The wild rose and the thyme,
                                    To hear soft winds go whispering by—
                                    To die summer time!
                                 
                              
                           
                           "And "The Last Wish" was gratified. She lived to hear the birds, to
                              see the violets bloom, and to gaze on the soft blue sky; and she did
                                 die in summer time!"
                        
                     
                  
               
               In her editorial department of the Boston Olive Branch, Mrs. C. F. Gerry gave a
                  gentle, womanly "Tribute to the memory of Louise J. Cutter."
               
                  "It is a sad and solemn task to record the death of another of our
                     contributors—the young and talented Louise J. Cutter.
                  
                  "Many of our readers have never met her, save in the fairy realm of authorland,
                     through which she was beginning to roam with graceful steps, but they will join
                     in our lament for her loss.
                  "They will remember the sweet poems and sketches which appeared in the Olive
                     Branch under her signature, and shed a tear of sorrow for the favorite, now
                     numbered among the early dead.
                  "Fair as a poet's dream, with a heart full of generous impulses, and the
                     glorious gift of genius, she trod the path of life with a thousand bright
                     anticipations. The star of her home, the idolized daughter, the beloved
                     sister—she must have been bound to earth by many tender ties. But consumption
                     placed his dire signet on her brow, and she faded slowly. For many months she
                     failed gradually, till at last the sunken cheek crimsoned with a hectic flush;
                     the attenuated frame, the lustrous eye, told that some hand was slowly, surely
                     unloosing the "silver cord' of life.
                  "There were those who saw this change with fearful anxiety, and clung
                     tenaciously to hope. Spring came with gentle breeze and budding flower and
                     singing bird, but she brought no boon of health to the suffering one, and in
                     the "prime of the summer" she passed away from us to the land of spirits.
                  "Alas! how dark the shadow which has fallen on her home! How the household band
                     will miss the low voice, the love-lit eye, the pale, fair face of the loved and
                     lost! And her mother, to whom she was so dear a treasure—how terrible the grief
                     which fills her heart! We have no language with which we can fifty tell how
                     deeply we sympathize with her anguish. But we would entreat her to turn from
                     the tomb where the sleeper is lying, to that world of bliss whither she trusts
                     the spirit of her child has flown; and, in the thought of endless peace and
                     rest, find consolation in her sorrow.
                  "As for us, we, who have watched her career with interest, will think of her, 
                        
                           "Kindly and gently, as of one
                           For whom 'tis well to be fled and gone—
                           As of a bird from a chain unbound,
                           As of a wanderer, whose home is found—
                           So let it be!"
                        
                     
                  
               
               The Boston True Flag, to which paper she was also a contributor, published the
                  following "Obituary:"
               
                  "The melancholy duty devotes upon us of recording the death of Louise J.
                     Cutter, whilom a graceful and pleasing contributor to our columns. She died, at
                     the residence of her father, in Medford, August 1st, at the age of nineteen,
                     after an illness of upwards of two years, nearly one of which she had been
                     confined within doors. Her disease was consumption, that fearful ill that
                     seizes so often upon the beautiful flowers of earth and withers them in our
                     view, regardless of the outstretched hands and aching hearts that would save
                     them from the de destroyer. She had, from the commencement, seen her doom, and
                     in the words of her spirit, poured through the channel of song, there was a tone of sweet
                     sadness that betokened a consciousness of it; but there was a resignation
                     mingled therewith that revealed a mind at peace. There was no complaining. A
                     sweet serenity rested upon every line—a holy calmness that seemed to borrow its
                     sanctity from the bourne to which she was rapidly hastening—and thus she drew
                     near the final scene of her dissolution, her faith and trust in the glories of
                     the future strengthening as her hold upon life grew weaker, till her angelic
                     spirit rose to its place among the blest.
                  "Her life was a remarkable one. She had been brought up with few advantages of
                     education, and few extraneous incentives to the cultivation of her mind, but
                     the genius which was in her could not be repressed. It prompted her to the
                     development of the mind that was rich with beautiful things. It shadowed a
                     world beyond the one in which she lived, and peopled it with fancies of her
                     own—a world all beautiful and good, with happiness for its aim, and virtue the
                     means of happiness—and her pages glowed with the pencillings of virtuous
                     triumph.
                  "She was a hopeful and loving writer, and what her heart wished she wove into
                     her creations. Hence her contributions for the press were of a character to
                     touch the hearts of the gentle and the good, in which particular they excelled.
                     As a poet, she was earnest and ardent—pouring her thoughts into graceful,
                     verse, though at times careless through excessive earnestness, but always clear
                     and truthful. Had life been continued to her, she would have been a writer of
                     great excellence.
                  "Many will mourn her departure, but such must remember that her blameless and
                     pure life is still continued in a region where sickness and sorrow may never
                     obtrude themselves, and where her sad songs will be changed to those of
                     rejoicing.
               
               To The Mettropolitan—a literary paper published at Washington, D. C., the
                  corresponding New York editor wrote thus—
               
                  "Louise J. Cutter! How often, by the drooping and fading away of some beautiful
                     and gentle being, the conviction forces itself more strong and enduring upon
                     our mind, that "whom the gods love, die young."
                  "With feelings of keenest grief, though tempered by the hope that "that bourne"
                     to which she has gone is the bosom of the Father—God, we chronicle this week
                     the demise of this amiable and talented young lady at the early age of nineteen
                     years. She was one of earth's purest poetic spirits—and loved to roam at will
                     through the bowers of poesy, plucking offerings to cast at the shrine of
                     affection.
                  "Months ago, when the snow spirit was abroad, and flaky emantions from her hand
                     covered as with a mantle the face of Nature, with premonitions of Azreal's
                     coming, she murmured the wish— 
                        
                           "Let me hear the song of the summer birds
                           That is hushed in the wildwood now!
                           Let me feel the touch of the summer breeze
                           Once more on my heated brow!
                           
                           Let me feel once more through my lattice come
                           The rose's and the violet's breath—
                           Let me see the flowers and the springing grass,
                           Ere I sleep in the arms of death!"
                        
                     
                  
                  "Her wish was granted. The snow-white crocus and the blue-eyed violets were
                     placed in her hand when the soft south-wind began to fan her eastern home, and
                     soon the syringa, and rose, and heliotrope mingled their fragrance for her
                     delicate senses. But ah! as Hope "wove a flattering tale" a deeper flush
                     painted the sick girl's cheek, a supernal brilliancy lighted her eye—and
                     by-and-by the "silver cord was loosed, the pitcher broken" for time.
                  "Is is meet for us to repine? 
                        
                           "She was weary—shall we weep
                           O'er a tired heart's soft sleep?
                           Cease, fond nature—hush thy sighs!
                           Angels call her to the skies:
                           Hark! the choral anthems swell—
                           'All is well—all is well!'"
                        
                     
                  
                  "We shall not forget thee, angel Louise!"
               
               Thus, in these extracts from the many tributes which were written to the memory of
                  the departed, have we evidence that worth and talent mourned her loss, speaking in
                  kindest words of their gentle, younger sister.
               It has often been questioned, whether the stormy elements of passion, and
                  intensely vivid feeling, are necessary to the true poet's experience. Such indeed,
                  can say— 
                     
                        "In my large joy of sight and touch;
                        Beyond what others count as such,
                        
                           I am content to suffer much,"—
                        
                     
                   and thus, enjoying much, and "suffering much," they tread their sublime
                  pathway. But there are other souls—sweet, tender,
                     childlike, poetic souls—which go wandering through life—like
                  Goethe's child—friend, Bettine, with the gift of "second sight" upon them—seeing
                  marvellous visions, which poets only see, of all blessed loving things,—and making
                  their lives while on earth types of the pure and heavenly.
               Such was she of whom we write—the humble, sweet, loving poet-girl!
               Louise J. Cutter's was not "a pen of fire," nor were the thoughts, which wove
                  beautiful fancies, prompted to utterance by 
                     "A spirit of mingled fire and dew,"
                   but they were the faithful transcripts of her own soul—gentle, pure, and
                  womanly. "Whatever her loving heart wished, she wove into her creations," and so,
                  wrote no line, "which, dying, she might wish to blot;" and, going down, as did
                  she, to an early grave, was it not far better to leave behind, a record of the
                  purest gentlest thoughts, which, guiding her every act, so beautified her brief
                  life, than a blotted scroll of wild, fitful, tempest-dreams, and unrealized, maddening,
                  passionate longings for the unattainable?
               
               Alas,—the unattainable! Do we not all, 
                     "With stammering lips and insufficient sound,"
                   strive and struggle, "to deliver right, the soul's expression?"—hath not
                  every heart a sense of "Insufficiency?" crying, 
                     
                        "When I attain to utter forth in verse
                        Some inward thought, my soul throbs audibly
                        Along my pulses, yearning to be free
                        And something farther, fuller, higher, rehearse,
                        To the individual, true, and the universe,
                        In consummation of right harmony."
                     
                  
               
               Ah yes! no soul can utter fully its highest aspirations: some, indeed, fail
                  wholly—like the delicate, trembling, shrinking sensitive flower, folding the
                  petals inwardly, thus shutting the fragrance in their own hearts, or
                  withering under the faintest touch which disturbs the air around.
               Louise J. Cutter's writings express, pre-eminently, the aspirations of a beautiful
                  soul which, unmatured, went back to the Hand who gave it.
               She had the faults common to all young authors;—but she had bright promise, too,
                  for future excellence; and had she lived to riper years she would doubtless have
                  improved greatly in polished vigor of style and descriptive power—for, as has been
                  said, "she was often careless through excessive earnestness." But it was not so
                  ordered. Hope could weave no "sweet roundelay" whose charm might stay the step of
                  the Destroyer. She died early.
               Like a sweet tender violet she sprang up in a quiet, wayside nook—making the short
                  spring of a life, which never ripened into summer-time for her, fragrant with the
                  beauty of her harmless life, and quiet, loving deeds—and then she was transplanted
                  to other gardens, 
                     
                        Frail, delicate, and timid,
                        She perished in life's May—
                        And closed her eyes, as violets do,
                        Early in Spring's brief day.
                     
                  
               
               In Medford grave-yard moulders the casket which once, fair and stainless,
                  enshrined the pearl of "a meek and quiet spirit."
               The snows of two winters have draped that grave—but she is not
                  there—she is risen—and for her there is no more winter—for it is always
                  "summer-time" in Heaven!
               
                  
                     Last; year when Autumn's burning, fiery finger
                     Was laid on every trembling forest leaf,—
                     When the dead Summer, ghost-like, seemed to linger
                     Over her orphaned beauties, 'mid her grief;
                     When the bright sumach's fruit was flushed with crimson,
                     And holly berries gleamed from out the wood,
                     And queenly asters flaunted in the garden,
                     And golden rod in regal beauty stood;
                  
                  
                  
                     When brooks went singing on 'mind rows of sedges,
                     And willow osiers kissed the river tide,
                     And red vines clambered over rocky ledges,
                     And hardy wintergreen crept close beside;
                     When oak, and ash, and maple on the hill-tops
                     Flung out upon the winds their crimson banners,—
                     And, washed by Autumn rains, lay spreading meadows,
                     As, in the South, the cool and green savannahs;
                  
                  
                     There bloomed in her rare beauty a sweet maiden
                     As young and fair as any poet-vision,—
                     With all of grace and loveliness rich laden
                     As angels bright who dwell in crimes Elysian:
                     And when the harvest moon walked forth in splendor,
                     And a soft golden haze had veiled the skies,
                     Gazing abroad, she spake in accents tender,
                     The while a few sad tears bedimmed her eyes:—
                  
                  
                     "O, words to me are vain, my gentle mother,
                     "To speak the struggle wild within my soul,—
                     And much I fear to tell thee, noble brother,
                     How soon my feet must tread the 'shore-line goal;'
                     For, redder than the brilliant flush of Autumn,
                     Upon my cheek the tint of crimson lies,—
                     And thicker than the haze that shrouds the sunset,
                     The dimning mist of death within mine eyes.
                  
                  
                     "I love to gaze upon the regal forest—
                     Upon its coronal of gold and fire;
                     I love to watch the round moon of the harvest,
                     As up the skies it climbeth high and higher!
                     Thus oft, grew red my cheek, and lip, and forehead,
                     When love-words smote my ear in whispers tender—
                     And, brighter than the moon which climbs you heavens,
                     Uprose within my heart one rob of splendor.
                  
                  
                     "How blest have been the glad years of my girlhood!
                     What sweets and loves were granted unto me!
                     I had not thought to die when life is dearest—
                     To crush the hopes upreared so tenderly!
                     Yet must it be! for I have felt the warning—
                     A cold hand claspeth mine, and nevermore
                     Can I unloose it, save, when some calm morning,
                     Freed, I wake upon the heavenly shore.
                  
                  
                     "Yet would I die not when the snows are draping
                     A ghostly shroud the death's bosom over—
                     Nor yet, when Spring is born, and skies are weeping,
                     And winds are soft as breathings of a lover:
                     Not when the budding maple's scarlet tresses
                     Flaunt on the air, nor when the scented thyme
                     Gives to the wooing winds its shy caresses—
                     
                        Not then—not then! not till the Summer time!"
                  
                  
                     The bright new years was born—grew strong—was laden
                     With all its richest gifts of balm and bloom,
                     When, without fear or trembling, this pale maiden
                     Walked down the pathway leading to the tomb.
                     Nor had the Summer clasped hands with the Autumn,
                     Nor yielded wearily her perfumed breath,
                     Ere, meekly folding her white hands together,
                     She bowed her golden head, and slept in death.
                  
                  
                     Now, 'neath a mound within a village grave-yard
                     Is hid the gleam of waving golden hair,—
                     And autumn rains are dropping in the turf-sod,
                     Yet will they never harm the sleeper there;
                     For, when, one day agone in bright September,
                     I stood that grave beside—and when the breeze
                     Paused, saddened, with me there, I well remember
                     It seemed to whisper "Thou'rt an angel now,
                        Louise!"
                  
               
               
                  MARY W. JANVRIN.
                  BOSTON, March, 1856.
               
            
            
               
               LITTLE EFFIE;
               OR THE STEP-MOTHER'S LESSON.
               "No, Marion, no! I will never love her; she need not expect it. What! think you
                  that one who has always been petted and caressed, with no wish ungratified and no
                  dull cares to trouble her; one whose very life has been but a gay round of
                  pleasare, and whose every thought and dream has been taught to look, not at home,
                  but to the world for happiness,—think you that one whose whole heart is wrapt up
                  in excitement and ambition, can ever learn to love a child, and that
                  child not her own? No, indeed, Marion. "Just as the twig is bent the tree's
                  inclined." I have never been taught to love children, and I will not love little
                  Effie."
               "Oh, Arabel, how can you speak thus! how will you dare to stand at the altar and
                  breathe the holy vows of wedlock with such a fearful determination in your heart?
                  How will you dare promise to love and obey a husband whose only child you are
                  determined not to love? To know that the little motherless being is yearning for
                  your fond kiss of affection, and yet heartlessly deny her the boon of tenderness?
                  Oh! Arabel, Arabel—I know you cannot be so unjust, so heartless. You will yet love
                  her, for she is very, very lovely; and if you really love the father, you must
                  love his child."
               "Never! Marion—never. She may be lovely as a fairy, yet I should not love her any
                  more. I do love the father, but I am determined not to confine myself
                  to the care of a child while I am yet so young, and once for all I say I will not
                  love her."
               "Stay, Arabel; revoke those fearful words; go not to the altar with such bitter
                  thoughts in your heart. If you—but no; I will not say more. I know that heart
                  better, far better than you know it yourself, and mark me, Arabel, in less than
                  one year from the time you become the mistress of Mr. Landon's home, your love for
                  little Effie will be equal to that which you cherish for the father!" and the fair
                  speaker bent over the little basket of work upon the centre-table, with the air of
                  one who knew that further argument would be useless.
               The speakers were seated in a sumptuously furnished drawing-room in one of the
                  most imposing mansions of our own fair city. Arabel Templeton, she who was first
                  introduced to the reader, was an orphan; but from the time when she was four years
                  old, she had resided with her aunt, a wealthy widow lady, whose every thought was
                  bound up in the lovely being who had been so affectionately confided to her care.
                  She was extremely proud and aristocratic; and from being constantly by her side,
                  the little Arabel naturally imbibed much of the selfish, haughty ambition which
                  characterized her kind but too indulgent
                  aunt. For Mrs. Merton, being herself childless, almost idolized her little neice.
                  She was extremely proud of her exquisite beauty, and of the admiration she excited
                  wherever she carried her; and thus was she early taught to look to the gay world
                  as the only source of true happiness; and had it not been for the unwearied
                  attention and exertion of Marion Aubrey, a relative of Mrs. Merton's, who had
                  resided with her since her marriage, and who watched over the little Arabel with
                  all a mother's tenderness, guarding her with all the kind watchfulness of her
                  amiable nature—had it not been for her restraining influence, we fear the young
                  heart of Arabel Templeton had become so immersed in the dream of worldly pleasure,
                  as to be wholly insensible to every attribute of womanly tenderness.
               And now let us describe Arabel herself. She was very beautiful; possessing a form
                  of faultless elegance, a fine classical face, with dark, brilliant eyes and a lily
                  complexion. But the charm of her peerless beauty consisted in the dark flowing
                  tresses which clustered around the snowy brow and fell in profuse waves over her
                  neck and shoulders; the striking contrast of the raven hair with the clear
                  whiteness of her complexion, rendering the finely moulded features singularly
                  beautiful. She was by education, wilful and selfish; seldom retracting what she
                  had once determined upon. But in her heart, that young, tender heart, which had
                  been entirely overlooked in the ambitious training of her proud aunt—there was a
                  world of hidden tenderness, which needed but the skilful touch of a sympathizing
                  spirit, to gush forth and discover the sweetest notes of the heart's own
                  melody.
               She met with Mr. Landon—her affianced husband—at a party given by one of her
                  friends. He was a gentleman of high standing in the city of Philadelphia, very
                  wealthy, and possessing a person of fine manly beauty, which, together with the
                  singular fascination of his manner, rendered his society eagerly sought, alike by
                  the younger and more elderly portion of society. He had early been called to mourn
                  the death of a beloved wife, and never, until he met with Arabel Templeton, had
                  lie seen one whom he felt disposed to make her successor. But he was captivated by
                  the singular beauty of Arabel; and with the penetrating eye of love, he read in
                  every motion the deep fount of tenderness hidden in her heart. He loved her
                  tenderly, and, as the passion was reciprocated, soon woed and won her for his
                  bride. And it was with the heartless determination which the reader has already
                  heard, that the wilful beauty was led to the altar.
               The bridal was a splendid affair. Beauty and luxury flung the spell of pleasure
                  over the scene, and never a shadow darkened the festive hour. The bride looked the
                  very queen of beauty, with the rich folds of snowy satin falling gracefully around
                  the elegant form, and a simple wreath of orange flowers twined among the raven
                  tresses. The bridegroom, with his handsome face and manly form, looked more noble
                  than ever; and his proud glance fell upon
                  the blooming face of his young bride.
               The parting between Mrs. Merton and Arabel was extremely painful, and the tears
                  flowed down the fair cheeks of Marion Aubrey as she pressed the form she had so
                  long and tenderly watched over, to her faithful heart; and she whispered in her
                  ear: "Think of me often in your new home, and love little Effie for my sake." Try
                  and tell me, when I next see you, that you have been kind to the little being
                  whose mother you have by name become."
               Arabel looked the determined reply she could not utter, and with a full heart and
                  tearful eyes, left the dear home of her childhood for that of him who was now all
                  in all to her.
               The heart of Arabel Landon thrilled with pride as her husband led her up the
                  marble steps of one of Philadelphia's stateliest mansions, and pressed a fond kiss
                  upon her fair cheek, as he seated her upon a crimson velvet sofa in the elegant
                  drawing-room.
               "This, dearest," he said, "is our home. Long has it been without such a star as
                  thee to grace it, but henceforth, the fairest flower in Philadelphia will be its
                  mistress."
               A feeling of tenderness, such as she had never known before, stole over her as she
                  laid her head upon her husband's shoulder, and a tear rolled down her fair cheek.
                  Her husband kissed it off, and gaily reproaching her for weeping the very first
                  day she entered her new home, left the room to give directions to the servant.
               Left to herself, Arabel gazed around the spacious apartment, and her cheeks
                  flushed with pride as she surveyed the rich furniture and costly ornaments. An
                  elegant Persian carpet covered the floor, and the costly mirrors reflected back
                  rich pictures which hung upon the walls. The beautiful works of sculpture, placed
                  in every niche, each held a rich porcelain holder, in which was placed a bouquet
                  of fresh flowers. The sun was shining brightly through the rich crimson drapery,
                  which shaded the long windows, and bathed each object in a flood of mellow
                  light.
               Arabel could scarcely realize that she was the mistress of so much splendor,—and
                  she sat there upon that rich sofa, like one in a dream.
               Suddenly the door opened, and a beautiful child bounded into the room. She was
                  about four years of age, with a fragile, fairy-like form, and a round, bright
                  face, around which clustered a shower of golden curls, which almost hid the white
                  dimpled shoulders. Her eyes were blue, and bright as stars, and her half-timid,
                  gentle expression, revealed the yearning tenderness of her little heart, and the
                  extreme sensitiveness of her ardent nature. She stole softly to the sofa where
                  Mrs. Landon was seated, and stood with one dimpled hand laid on a chair near it,
                  and one tiny finger of the other pressed upon the rosy lips, gazing with childlike
                  earnestness upon the fair face of Arabel.
               Suddenly dropping the little hand, she said: "You are a very pretty lady; prettier
                  than dead mamma was, because she had
                  great blue eyes like me, and yours are black. But papa said you would love me, and
                  be just like my mamma in heaven, and you will, won't you?"
               A feeling almost of tenderness stole over Arabel's spirit, but she quickly
                  banished it, and thought to herself, "If I love her now it will soon wear away,
                  and, besides, I would not have Marion Aubrey know I had altered my determination
                  for the world!" So when little Effie laid her tiny hand in hers, and flung one
                  white arm over her neck to kiss her, she pushed her from her and said, in as stern
                  a tone as she could command: "You must not be so babyish, Effie. I did not come
                  here to take care of children, and of course I cannot love you as your own mother
                  did."
               The child, so coldly repulsed, started from the side of Arabel, as though a
                  serpent had stung her, and the hot tears sprang quickly to her blue eyes, as she
                  said, "Papa told me you would love me, but I shall not tell him you will not,
                  because he would not love you so well, and then you would be unhappy—and dead
                  mother said I must try and make every one happy."
               A pang shot through Arabel's heart, but she did not trust herself to reply, and
                  the little girl stifled a sob as she slowly left the room.
               A week passed by and the greater part of each night was devoted to bridal parties,
                  where the homage paid to the wonderful beauty of the youthful Mrs. Landon,
                  flattered the husband's pride, and made Arabel more vain and heartless than
                  ever.
               Mr. Landon noticed, when at home, that his wife did not appear fond of little
                  Effie, and he was greatly displeased; for though he passionately loved his wife,
                  yet the memory of his first love was still fresh in his heart, and as he had loved
                  her, so now he loved her child, with an affection which neither the caresses of
                  beauty, not the importance of other subjects could diminish. He noticed the
                  mournful expression of Effie's blue eyes, when she timidly looked up into the
                  beautiful face of her step-mother; and he had more than once seen the tears
                  stealing down her little cheeks. She appeared very sad and unhappy, and though she
                  seemed to love him more fondly than before, and would often twine her tiny arms
                  around his neck, and lay her soft round cheek upon his, yet the silvery voice,
                  which formerly prattled so sweetly, was seldom heard singing the childish songs
                  her father and her old nurse had taught her. Her step grew less buoyant, and her
                  blue eyes more spiritual as days sped on; and the doting father grew more and more
                  anxious, for he had tried in vain to discover the cause of the sad change in
                  Effie's usually playful nature.
               Alas! he little thought the sweet child was pining for a mother's love. He heard
                  not the simple prayer she uttered, as nightly she knelt by her downy couch, with
                  her little hands clasped tightly together; if he had, the sweet tones of that
                  childish voice, as she prayed to the Great Being, who, even her young heart had
                  been taught to reverence—"Please make my new mamma love me," methinks the
                  affection of the father for his child would have spurned that "new mamma," and the passionate love he cherished for her
                  been turned to scorn and displeasure. But he heard it not; and attributed the want
                  of affection for his child, to the fatigue she felt after the constant round of
                  parties and operas she attended. But this was not the case. She determined not to
                  love her, and her wilfulness prevented her from showing even the small feeling of
                  tenderness which her little step-daughter had awakened in her heart. So she
                  continued the same frivolous round of gaiety, unheeding the little birdling that
                  was yearning to nestle her dimpled hand in hers, and murmur with that sweet
                  childish voice, the gentle name of mother.
               
               One night, about two months after Mrs. Landon's marriage, she was going with her
                  husband and a party of friends to hear an Italian singer, and her heart beat high
                  with expectation as the hour drew near, for she had long wished to hear the
                  celebrated prima donna. She sat with her husband
                  in their splendid drawing-room, awaiting the arrival of the friends who were to
                  accompany them to the opera—chatting merrily, and every now and then gazing
                  impatiently through the richly draperied window—when little Effie entered the
                  room, and stealing to the sofa, where sat her father, leaned her little head on
                  his lap, murmuring:—
               "Please don't go away to-night, papa. Effie is sick; her head aches very bad. Oh,
                  don't go away to-night!" and she climbed upon his knee, and twined her white arms
                  around his neck.
               He gently raised her head from his shoulder, and gazing into her face, saw how
                  feverishly the pretty cheeks were flushed, and how wildly brilliant were the deep
                  blue eyes. And he could even feel her little heart beat quickly against his
                  own.
               "No, Effie, darling, I shall not leave you to-night," he said, as she once more
                  repeated her request.
               "What!" exclaimed his wife, turning from the window, whither she had retreated
                  when Effie entered, "not going to the opera to-night!"
               "No," he replied, in a mild but firm tone; "I shall not leave my sick child when
                  even her life may be in danger."
               "Fie, upon a sick child; she is as well as I am. 'Tis only a childish whim, and
                  you are very foolish to stay at home just to gratify a mere caprice. But you must
                  go, for I will not stay at home!"
               Mr. Landon gazed upon her in mute astonishment. He had not deemed her capable of
                  uttering such heartless words.
               "Arabel," he said, when he once more recovered his composure—"Arabel, you can act
                  in accordance with your own will; you are free to go if you choose. I shall remain
                  with my sick child, whom your own heart should tell you is dearer to me than my
                  very life." And thus saying, he raised little Effie in his arms and left the
                  apartment.
               Arabel was very angry that he should prefer pleasing his child to her, and
                  determined to attend the opera in spite
                  of his refusal to accompany her. So when her friends arrived, she entered their
                  carriage, and was soon in the midst of the glare and bustle of a crowded theatre.
                  The performance commenced, and Arabel's long-cherished wish was gratified. She
                  heard the Italian singer, but the tones of her magnificent voice fell like a
                  mockery, and the sea of faces around her all seemed blended in one, and that one
                  the little Effie's; while the deep, constant murmur of the assemblage sounded like
                  one voice, uttering in childish tones, "Don't leave me to-night, papa." Even the
                  dark face of the Italian prima donna seemed
                  changed to one of childish purity, with starry blue eyes, and golden hair, and
                  cheeks all flushed with fever.
               "Poor little Effie," she said to herself—"she did indeed look very ill. Oh! I wish
                  I had staid with her!"
               She was restless and impatient until the theatre was over, and she scarcely
                  uttered a word during the weary ride home. And when she reached it, her heart
                  fluttered wildly, and a strange, indefinable emotion caused her to tremble like an
                  aspen leaf.
               There was a light shining from Effie's room, and with an inward dread of
                  something, she knew not what, filling her heart, she noiselessly entered the
                  apartment. For a moment she stood gazing upon the scene before her. Little Effie
                  was lying motionless upon her couch, with her long golden hair streaming over the
                  snowy pillow, and her flushed cheeks burning with fever. Her eyes were closed, and
                  their silken lashes swept the hot cheeks. By the bedside sat the faithful nurse,
                  with the silent tears coursing down her wrinkled countenance; and leaning over the
                  little sufferer, with his arms folded upon his heaving breast, and the anxious
                  glance of his dark eyes fixed upon the face of his child, stood the father—the
                  husband of Arabel.
               "Oh! Charles," was all she could say, and burst into a passion of tears.
               He started from his position, while an expression of utter wretchedness flitted
                  over his face, and said, in a cold, stern voice, whose tone of bitterness went to
                  the very soul of his wife—"Nurse, pass Mrs. Landon a chair."
               Effie opened her blue eyes when she heard her father's voice, and starting up and
                  clasping her little hands, exclaimed in the wild tones of delirium:—"Oh! papa, do
                  pray God to make my new mamma love me! Please do, papa!"
               A tear started to his eye, and he glanced bitterly towards his wife. But when he
                  saw how pale and haggard she looked, and how bitterly she swept, his heart was
                  softened and he really pitied her, when she sprang towards the couch, exclaiming:
                  "Oh, my God! this is too much. Effie, darling, Effie, I do love you, and I always
                  have; and I will be kind and gentle like your own mamma. But don't, don't say
                  those dreadful words again; they burn like fire on my heart!" And she pressed
                  Effie's little form to her bosom, and with her raven tresses mingling with the child's golden
                  hair, she wept long and bitterly, while Effie, exhausted with her wild ravings,
                  nestled her little head closer to her heart, and sank into a calm, quiet
                  slumber.
               Her husband's heart was melted, and his passionate love for his wife returned with
                  even greater earnestness than before, and when his arm stole tenderly over her
                  bowed form, she murmured: "Oh, Charles, forgive me. I have been very selfish; but
                  I do love her, and if God spares her life, she shall never again pray for a
                  mother's love."
               And she kept her word. Long and tenderly did she watch over that little form; and
                  when reason returned once more, and Effie realized how kind and attentive her
                  step-mother had been, and how tenderly she loved her, she looked up into her face,
                  and said, with all the artless innocence of childhood: "I knew God would let you
                  love me, and I love you now almost as well as dead mother!"
               When Effie recovered from that long, weary sickness, and was once more welcomed to
                  the cheerful drawing-room, she was carried there in the arms of her stepmother,
                  whose love for the beautiful child she had watched so tenderly, almost amounted to
                  idolatry; and from that hour the happiness of that little household was
                  perfect.
               Arabel tenderly loved the husband, and admired her little step-daughter.
               Effie, beautiful little Effie! would often leave her play, and, twining her
                  dimpled arms around her mother's neck, and nestling her little cheek close to
                  here, murmur: "Darling mamma, I do love you as well as my angel-mother in
                  heaven."
               And the noble husband was pleased that the deep fount of love in his wife's bosom
                  was at length unsealed, and the heart's music awakened by the hand of his child.
                  His whole happiness was bound up in his wife and child, and he blest them both for
                  making his home a paradise on earth.
               When Marion Aubrey visited her early friend, and Arabel met her at the door of her
                  elegant mansion, with little Effie clinging to her hand, the tears of happiness
                  sprang to her eyes, as she met Marion's inquiring glance. And she said, as she
                  pressed a fond kiss upon Effie's rosy lips—"Yes, dear Marion, you were right. I am
                  proud to say that even as I love the father, so do I love his child!"
               My fair lady reader, if the sacred trust of the stepmother be thine, oh, beware
                  how that trust is fulfilled. Cherish, with all a mother's tenderness, the little
                  beings confided to your care. For the high and gentle mission of woman is indeed
                  blessed, and the sacred wreath of kindred love will bloom as fair beneath the
                  gentle dews of kindness, as if the smiles of angels brightened it.
            
            
               
               AUNT EDITH'S STORY;
               OR THE HISTORY OF A HEART.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           I know myself my own deceit,
                           I know it is a dream,
                           But one that from my earliest youth
                           Has colored life's dark stream.
                        
                     
                     L. E. L.
                  
               
               It was a dark, cheerless night in winter—there was not a star to be seen in the
                  shrouded canopy above, and the large snow-flakes fell upon the ground like one
                  broad, white sheet.
               The keen, chilling blast, howled dismally without, but the iron chill of winter
                  cannot penetrate the closely-draped windows of our snug little parlor. The bright
                  cheerful fire glowed in the grate, diffused a gentle warmth throughout the room,
                  and as I sat watching its soft flickering light, a dreamy, half-forgetful spell
                  stole over me, and I was soon lost in a sweet dream of imagination, with a bright
                  picture of the future for a subject, and the sweet, hallowed wand of memory
                  lending it the glowing spell of inspiration. My head sank back upon the arm of the
                  yielding sofa, and every object within the room disappeared from the mind's eye
                  until I saw nought but the bright, glowing flame as it changed from one strange
                  form to another—brightened and faded with each fresh gust of the sweeping blast
                  without.
               And the wind—the shrill moaning wind—even that seemed changed to a low, sweet
                  melody, sounding from the still, far-off shores of some silvery lake, and stealing
                  upon the quiet air of a calm starry midnight with all that sweet, pure influence
                  which hallows the blessed spell of music. And thus I lay upon the sofa, heedless
                  of all that passed within and without; wrapt in the soul-absorbing dream which had
                  stolen so pleasantly over my spirit.
               One moment I would seem to be in Italy, with the deep-blue sky over my head, and
                  the starry-hued flowers beneath. One moment in a stately palace with marble
                  pillars, and lordly halls, and every costly article which makes the high and
                  mighty works of art seem magnificently beautiful—the next in a vine-covered
                  cottage, in the midst of group of dark-eyed maidens, listening to the silvery
                  notes of some raven-tressed daughter of Italy, with black, starry eyes, and a
                  voice of bird-like sweetness. And imagination would weave such brilliant pictures
                  of love, and pride, and splendor; of palace and of cottage; of ocean and of lake;
                  of beauty and chivalry; and all lit up by that bright, glowing fire-light. Ah!
                  what a sweet, wild dream was that!
               But like every dream too fondly cherished, it was destined to be broken. A stately
                  "air-castle" was just raised over that bright fire, when a low, half audi- ble sigh fell upon my ear. In an instant
                  the dream vanished, and the castle faded from the glowing flame.
               I started up from the sofa, and rubbing my eyes, gazed earnestly around the room.
                  Was it not very strange? I had seen Italy and France—had listened to the sweetest
                  strains of silvery melody—had gazed on scenes of thrilling beauty; and yet, each
                  article of furniture had remained in its accustomed place in the cheerful
                  apartment; and now and then a raindrop pattering against the window pane, told
                  that the same storm was still raging without.
               Yes, 'twas very strange; but once more that low sigh fell upon my ear, and this
                  time I gazed—wide awake—upon Aunt Edith, as she sat in her arm-chair before the
                  fire, apparently absorbed in a revery, deep as had been my own.
               Reader, shall I describe Aunt Edith? mayhap you think her old and eccentric, but
                  you are far from right. She was in the very prime of womanhood, and not a line of
                  silver mingled with the soft, raven hair, parted so smoothly upon her white,
                  unwrinkled brow. Her eyes were dark and lustrous, and every features was perfect
                  in its classic outline. Her form was tall and graceful, and the hand which
                  supported the fair cheek was small and white enough to excite the envy of the most
                  aristocratic came in the land.
               From the first hour she blessed with her gentle presence our little household I
                  felt irresistibly drawn towards her. I admired her queen-like beauty; but there
                  was a calm, sweet dignity in each gentle motion, and a meek, placid expression in
                  her dark eyes, which well accorded with the low, earnest tones of the sweetest
                  voice I ever heard, and completely won my heart; for they seemed to speak of some
                  hidden sorrow, of inward suffering, and a spirit yearning for some cherished boon
                  which had been denied it. It was this same calm, mournful manner which first
                  excited my sympathy; and as I was her pet, the golden link which binds one kindred
                  spirit to another soon bound our hearts with an affection too strong and lasting
                  ever to be broken.
               Dear Aunt Edith! how dearly I loved her, and how sweetly sounded each word that
                  came from her lips. My wilful spirit would not brook advice from those less dearly
                  loved, but when the kind tones of her sweet voice, gently and carefully
                  remonstrated against some little fault, the advice was gratefully received and
                  heeded with all the perseverance my naturally careless nature could command.
               And fortunate was I to receive such advice from one so well fitted to guide my
                  wayward footsteps. But as she sat there in the large arm-chair, with the glowing
                  firelight from the polished grate lending a rosy tint to her lovely complexion,
                  the idea suddenly entered my head, that it was very stranger one so good and
                  beautiful should never marry.
               And then, thought I, what a fine night is this for a story, and a story of the
                  heart, too!
               The wailing wind without, and the cheerful fire with- in, seemed exactly suited to the dream-like spell
                  of forgetfulness which lingers in a low-toned voice while relating a glowing tale
                  of the heart's own joys and sorrows.
               Yes, it was just the hour for a story, and hear one I must. So, stealing up to
                  Aunt Edith, and twining my arms around her neck, I half whispered,
               "Aunt Edith, did you ever love?"
               "Why, Louey," she replied, while a crimson blush made her fair face look yet
                  fairer, "what an abrupt question! What could put such an absurd idea into your
                  head? what could make you think I was ever in love?"
               "Because, Aunt Edith," I replied, "I know that love was made for such as you, and
                  if his, "silver shaft" has left such a heart as yours unharmed, than love has
                  indeed failed to do his duty."
               "Well done, Louey," she said, with a merry laugh, "what a pity you were not born a
                  cavalier. How sweetly you would flatter a fine lady. But if I were to say
                  earnestly, that I had been in love, what would you say then?"
               "Why I should just as earnestly beg you to tell me the story of your early life,
                  and why your heart has never been united to one worthy its rich wealth. Oh! Aunt
                  Edith, I know you have loved. Do please tell me the story of your heart, and of
                  the inward sorrow which makes those proud eyes look so very mournful."
               "Do you really wish to hear the story of my early life, darling?" she said, laying
                  her hand kindly upon my head; "'tis a sad tale of human sufferings and sorrows;
                  and though its recital will awaken the most bitter memories, yet will I tell you;
                  and may the sad history serve as a talisman to keep from your young heart the
                  blighting shadows which my own wilfulness has hung over my spirit."
               "Oh! thank you, Aunt Edith," I exclaimed, delighted that she had granted my
                  request so willingly. So in a moment I was seated at her feet; and laying my head
                  upon her lap, awaited the recital of the heart's history, I so desired to
                  hear.
               "Louey," she commenced; and I felt the hand which rested upon my head, quiver with
                  emotion which memory had awakened; "first let me ask you one question. Should you
                  think the fearful fault of coquetry had caused the sorrow that you fancy you read
                  so plainly in my eyes?"
               "You a coquette! You Aunt Edith! Impossible," I exclaimed; "the heart
                  of a coquette is made of adamant—with not one drop of human kindness in its icy
                  cells. No, no, Aunt Edith. You were never a coquette—you are too noble—too lofty,
                  to stoop to the heartless wiles which form the character of a being so devoid of
                  every attribute, which exalts the noble dignity of woman."
               "Ah, Louey, judge not the past by the present. When you have mingled more with the
                  world, you will learn to distrust the outward appearance. For mark me, Louey, the world—the proud, cold world you love
                  so fondly—is all deceit. Though the outward form may be fair and pleasing, yet
                  within may beat a heart dark as the blackest cloud of midnight. And you will learn
                  in your voyage over life's wild ocean, that the secret breathings of the human
                  heart will not be revealed to the gaze of truth, while the mantle of deceit so
                  effectually covers the world."
               "But I see you are growing impatient, and I will not keep you waiting. Remember,
                  however, I do not tell it you merely to gratify your earnest request, but that you
                  may learn from the sufferings of another to avoid the faults which caused those
                  sufferings," and wiping a tear from her eye, and clasping my hand in hers, Aunt
                  Edith commenced the story of her early life.
               In my youthful days, the world called me beautiful. I was flattered and caressed
                  until with my naturally conquettish nature, I became a finished flirt.
               My mother being a widow, and I her only daughter, lavished all the fond affection
                  of her heart upon me. I was her idol, the star of her widowed life, and no wish,
                  however slight, was left ungratified. She was pleased with the homage the world
                  paid to my beauty, and I soon learned to regard the syren voice of the flatterer
                  as far above that of true, disinterested friendship.
               I would practice all the little arts I could command, to win the love of those who
                  pleased me, for with admiration I was not satisfied. I must have
                  love—the love of the whole heart. And that once gained, the heart was
                  coolly laid aside, and my smiles reserved for the next new face.
               On my eighteenth birthday, my mother gave a large party and among the distingue guests present, was the large son of a
                  wealthy merchant, who had recently taken up his residence in one of the finest
                  country seats of our pretty village.
               He was the lion of the passing hour. Being handsome and wealthy, and his society
                  much sought among my young acquaintance, I rejoiced at the prospect of so
                  desirable a flirtation. In the course of the evening I obtained an
                  introduction.
               It was a lovely night, and my cheek flushed with pride and pleasure, as leaning
                  upon his arm, we stepped forth upon the trellised portico. The moon—the bright
                  beautiful moon of Autumn—shone soft and silvery amid the starry jewels of the
                  night, and its radiant beams fell full upon her faces, while we talked of stars
                  and flowers, of love and poetry, and all the beauteous gifts which God has lent to
                  brighten life's lone pathway.
               He had seen Italy—the dear, glorious Italy I worshipped—and most sweetly did the
                  rich tones of his manly voice described it; its flowers, and its deep blue sky;
                  its vine-covered cottages, and the starry-eyed maidens who sing the beautiful
                  songs of their own glowing nation, beneath the mellow radiant moon; that moon,
                  whose silver beams, even seemed to make the glorious tide of swelling melody sound
                  yet sweeter.
               
               How appropriately did he quote the immortal Shakespeare, when describing
                  sunny-hued Venice, the star-city of my favorite Italy. And how my soul drank in
                  each eloquent word that fell from his lips.
               But yet, I did not love him, and I was well satisfied that I never could. Then why
                  did I trifle with a spirit so high and sensitive? Alas, an unseen power, mightier
                  than myself, impelled me on to ruin.
               I knew that Henry Wilton was one of nature's true nobleman—that he possessed a
                  soul far, far above the common minds of this great world—a soul that nature might
                  well be proud of.
               And as I leant upon his manly arm, and gazed into the depths of his dark soulful
                  eyes, I resolved not to trifle with such a spirit; but when those deep eyes rested
                  with a glance of admiration upon my face, and the rich tones of that eloquent
                  voice grew low and tender, then did my heartless nature triumph. I thought no more
                  of the great wrong I was committing, for I had stifled the voice of the inward
                  monitor, and its warnings were left unheeded. I thought only of the new
                  conquest—of the triumph I should win over the village girls—and how they would
                  envy me for winning the marked attentions of such an acknowledged "lion."
               So I plunged recklessly into the abyss before me, nor stopped to think that the
                  same power which led me on, would leave me to return in darkness and alone.
               From that night, Henry Wilton was constantly by my side. And while with him I
                  exerted all the skill I was capable of, to please his refined and rather
                  fastidious taste. Every art which I had learned so perfectly was called into
                  requisition, and never was the coquette's part played with more consummate
                  skill.
               I soon had the satisfaction of knowing that he loved me with all the fond devotion
                  of his noble soul. His heart was mine—all mine!
               Alas! for the depravity of a heartless nature. I won that noble heart to break it.
                  The high sentiments of that lofty spirit awoke no responsive chord within my
                  breast, and the fond glance of those deep eyes was not returned with the true
                  confiding glance of trusting love. Ah, no, I did not love him; and yet I led him
                  on, but to place the blighted wreath of his fond affections, in cool mockery
                  affection upon his noble brow.
               In party and promenade he was my constant companion.
               I was extremely proud of his wealth and handsome person, and flattered by the
                  preference of one so highborn as Henry Wilton. And thus passed the winter; and
                  spring with its birds and flowers brought change upon its gentle breath. I began
                  to tire of my last conquest, and longed for a change.
               One sunny day, when I was sitting with my mother in our cheerful parlor, the
                  servant brought in a letter, and on my mother's breaking the seal, it proved to
                  contain a most pressing invitation from her only sister, residing in a distant
                  Southern city, to spend a few months with her. My mother had remarked the change
                  in my appearance, and when I earnestly desired it, accepted the kind
                  invitation.
               
               I was almost wild with delight, and preparations were speedily commenced for our
                  journey.
               That evening I was sitting alone in the parlor, thinking of the intended journey
                  and laying out plans for the future, when the door opened and Henry Wilton
                  entered. Surprised that he had entered unannounced, I was somewhat startled, and
                  my embarrassment he attributed—with love's own blindness—to the pleasure I felt at
                  meeting him.
               "How peerless you are looking, to-night, dearest;" he said, as he accepted the
                  vacant chair beside me.
               "Ah, yes," I replied dreamily, while my eyes were fixed upon the carpet. "I am so
                  happy that mother has accepted Aunt Minnie's invitation."
               "What invitation?" he asked hastily, while an anxious expression flitted over his
                  fine face. I related to him the purport of the letter we had received, and that
                  the next morning we were to start for the South.
               He was much surprised at the sudden change in our arrangements, and expressed the
                  deep regret he felt at losing us. Then, taking my hand in his, he said in a low
                  earnest tone,
               "Miss Lacy, I have long wished for this opportunity, and now I dare ask for his
                  hand. Your own heart must tell you how very dear you have become to mine. For your
                  love is the sole star of my existence. 'Tis the only boon I crave to make my
                  happiness complete. I trust it will not be denied.'
               He knelt at my feet, and pressed the hand he held to his lips.
               I hastily withdrew it, and with well feigned astonishment, said in a cold, calm
                  voice,
               "I do not understand you, Mr. Wilton. I was not aware that you cherished aught
                  save a brother's attachment for me. I think I have not given you cause to imagine
                  you were beloved in a different way."
               He started to his feet, as if a serpent had stung him, and never shall I forget
                  the glance of withering scorn which flashed in his proud eyes, as he replied in a
                  low, bitter tone,
               "My God, and is it possible that you—you, whom I thought all purity and truth, can
                  have so deceived me? Have led me on, step by step, until my whole soul is yours?
                  Have lighted the flame which slumbered upon the altar of love in my breast, and
                  then flung over it a shadow whose icy coldness will never departed until the chill
                  of Death removes it! Is it possible that you have won my heart, but to tamper with
                  it like an idle toy, for a few short months, and then give it back, broken and
                  bleeding, to him who would have sacrificed his very life for you! O! my God! I had
                  not deemed it possible that a beautiful woman could be so heartless.
               "Edith Lacy; you may repent what you have done. 'Tis not for denying me the boon I
                  craved, but 'tis for the deception which taught me to think the love in your heart
                  was mine, when no love was there. If it is a satisfaction to learn that I can
                  never love another, then know it now. Your hand has snapt asunder the only chords
                  of tenderness within my heart. May Heaven forgive you!"
               
               Casting upon me a look of unutterable anguish, he left me alone.
               There was a pang of remorse in my heart which prevented my sleeping that night,
                  for the haggard face of the high-souled Henry Wilton was constantly before me; and
                  his prophetic warning was ringing in my ears like a voice, not of earth, awakening
                  the deep hours of midnight with those fearful words,
               "Edith Lacy, you may repent what you have done!"
               But with the golden light of morning and preparations for our journey, the memory
                  of Henry Wilton was banished—to return again when I should indeed have cause to
                  repent the fearful would I gave a soul so noble.
               Ah! what a delightful journey was that. Such a glorious morning, with the bright
                  beaming sun shedding its warm rays from a cloudless sky, and the gentle breeze of
                  spring bearing the perfume of roses upon its soft breath. How I enjoyed our ride
                  in the old fashioned, lumbering stage-coach, which carried us from our own little
                  village. Poor coach! 'twas almost the last of its race, soon to be numbered among
                  the things that were. When we arrived at Aunt Minnie's beautiful residence, I was
                  almost wild with rapture. Beautiful, exquisitely beautiful was that sunny Southern
                  home— 
                     
                        A very paradise on earth;
                        A place too bright for sorrow,
                        And yet too pure for mirth.
                     
                  
               
               I stood leaning against one of the tall columns of the portico, half buried in a
                  sea of flowers, and silently did my soul drink in the exquisite beauty of nature
                  in its pride. Indeed the very queen of nature, must, I thought, have taken up her
                  abode in such a spot.
               Before me was an ocean of foliage and flowers. Above me a deep glowing sky, with
                  the rich beams of a Southern sun flooding in a tide of mellow light, every object
                  of loveliness. At my feet the waters of a marble fountain sparkled like one
                  diamond shower of heaven's own dew.
               I was so absorbed in the contemplation of so much varied beauty, that I had not
                  noticed the approach of Aunt Minnie, until she clasped me to her heart, and in a
                  kind voice welcomed her dear Edith to her home, and gently chided me for making
                  the acquaintance of the birds and flowers ere I sought her kiss of welcome.
               The spell which bound my spirit had faded, and we entered the house. What
                  fairy-like rooms! how well the rose-colored drapery of the long windows
                  correspondent with the soft carpets, and how the polished furniture shone when the
                  gorgeous sun-light stole through those same rosy-lined curtains. And in the large
                  hall which led from the flower-wreathed portico, the silver-voiced birds poured
                  out such a gushing strain of music, from their gilded cages, that lulled by such
                  sweet melody, and the gentle play of the low murmuring fountain, I could have
                  dreamed away life with never a wish to see more of the cold, heartless world
                  beyond the limits of that bird-like nest.
               Days flew swiftly by on golden wings, and the little Southern paradise was becoming so dear to my heart
                  that the only drawback upon my happiness was, that I must leave it. One morning
                  Aunt Minnie told me that a celebrated, singer was to give a concert in the city,
                  and if I desired, she would engage seats at the theater.
               I was delighted at the opportunity of hearing the far-famed prima donna, and
                  readily accepted the kind invitation. I could think of nothing during the day save
                  the opera, and time seemed to drag slower than usual, until we were seated in the
                  brilliant theater. How novel seemed everything to my delighted eyes! The flood of
                  radiant light, and the sea of strange faces around me; the low, deep murmur which
                  sounded in my ears like the sounding melody of the mighty ocean, and the
                  excitement and bustle around, completely bewildered me. When the curtain slowly
                  arose there was a moment of breathless silence till the fair singer appeared upon
                  the stage, and then the storm of applause which greeted her fairly shook the
                  massive building. A shower of bouquets fell at her feet; and when the tumult had
                  subsided there burst forth, upon the excited multitude, the glorious out side of
                  swelling song which so captivated every listener of the gifted prima donna.
               Magnificently did the rich melody of her own glorious land, flow from the lips of
                  the fair Italian. My spirit thrilled with rapture, as I sat motionless, with my
                  eyes fixed upon her radiant face, my soul drinking in the music of that
                  silver-toned voice.
               Suddenly I heard a low voice say in a deep, manly tone, "is she not
                  beautiful?"
               Thinking it referred to the singer, I glanced around, and met two dark, brilliant
                  eyes fixed upon my face with an expression of undistinguished admiration.
               The next moment the owner of those same proud eyes had entered our box, and Aunt
                  Minnie said, "my dear friend, allow me to present my neice, Miss Edith Lacy, Mr.
                  Victor Haverland."
               Without raising my eyes, I murmured a few indistinct words, and turned my face
                  towards the stage. But I saw not the beautiful face of the prima donna—I heard not
                  the tones of her glorious voice. I saw nought save those two brilliant eyes, I
                  heard nought save that melodious tone.
               Was it love? love at first sight, which even then thrilled my very soul? Ah! I
                  knew not, I cared not. I knew that my heart—my cold, proud heart, which had never
                  before trembled beneath the gaze of man, was now fluttering and trembling, and
                  that I, usually so calm and self-possessed, quivered like an aspen.
               What was it that sent the crimson tide, flushing both cheek and brow? Why did my
                  heart leap and bound with emotion never felt before? Ah! time must answer.
               The stranger turned to reply to one of Aunt Minnie's remarks, and once more I
                  glanced towards him. How can I describe him?
               His form was tall and manly and the easy grace of each motion betrayed high birth
                  and breeding. His face was one of the most noble, in its classic outline, that I had ever beheld. A complexion
                  singularly white for a Southerner; eyes large, lustrous and full of soul. His brow
                  was broad and white, and short, glossy curls of raven hair clustered around it.
                  His cheeks were pale, but the firm, proud lip was red as coral; and the jet black
                  moustache contrasted finely with the clear whiteness of his beautiful teeth.
               He was indeed my beau-ideal of manly beauty. Just such a being as fancy had
                  pictured in my dreams. And when he again addressed me with that rich, low-toned
                  voice, and the glance of his deep, proud eyes rested upon my face, something
                  within seemed to say, "you were born for each other."
               I heard no more of that glorious music, and when the opera was over, and that rich
                  voice bade me good night, I could not have told whether it was answered. But as he
                  handed me into the carriage, he whispered,
               "We shall meet again, Miss Lacy."
               How those dear words were treasured in my heart! I scarcely spoke during the long
                  ride home, and I longed for the solitude of my chamber, that I might be alone with
                  my own thoughts.
               "Why, Mary," said Aunt Minnie to my mother, when we arrived at home, "I really
                  believe Edith has fallen in love with the son of my old friend. Well, she could
                  not make a better choice, for he is one of Nature's true noblemen I and, if I
                  judge rightly, already feels an interest, deeper than that of friendship, for our
                  sweet little pet."
               I blushed deeply, and bidding them good night, retired to my chamber.
               How my poor brain whirled, and my heart beat and fluttered when I thought over the
                  events of the evening. I was fairly bewildered! The voice of the Italian prima
                  donna, and that of the noble Southerner seemed mingling together, and those dark,
                  beaming eyes seemed gazing upon me from the flower-covered stage.
               I could see in imagination, that manly form and handsome face, and a low-toned
                  voice seemed whispering, "we shall meet again, Miss Lacy!"
               I dreamed, that night, a dream I had never known before. I reclined my head upon a
                  restless pillow; one filled with blight and shadow—with clouds and sunshine. One
                  where sweetness mingles with the most cutting bitterness, and an icy chill oft
                  destroys the passion flowers of the warm heart's weaving!—the deep, restless
                  pillow of love—wild, feverish love!—the first that e'er had bound my spirit with
                  its spell.
               When I awoke, the next morning, the sun was streaming in at my window; and when I
                  attempted to rise, I found that my head was aching violently. I laid me down once
                  more, and soon dropped into a light slumber, and when I again opened my eyes, my
                  mother and Aunt Minnie were bending anxiously over me. My cheeks were flushed and
                  feverish, and my pulse quick and irregular.
               I had taken a violent cold the previous night, and it had settled upon my lungs.
                  For many weeks I was confined to my bed,
                  and most tenderly did my mother and Aunt Minnie watch over me, and had it not been
                  for the tender nursing I received, I fear my life had indeed been in danger.
               Each morning a beautiful bouquet placed upon my mantel, told how regular the
                  handsome Southerner came to inquire after my health. Dearly did I love those
                  little tokens of his regard and most impatiently would I watch their coming. And
                  when the little vase was brought me. I would select from, each fresh bouquet, some
                  little flower, a rose or violet, and place it upon the snowy pillow, that its
                  gentle fragrance might cheer my heart.
               I was happy indeed, when the kind physician pronounced me able to leave my sick
                  room. And when Aunt Minnie arrayed me in the most elegant morning robe which I
                  possessed, I wondered why she took such elaborate pains with the curls which
                  clustered so profusely over my shoulders; and why she repeated so often to my
                  mother, that the lily on Edith's pale cheek, and the deeper shade in her eyes made
                  her look more interesting than ever.
               The pretty prisoners in their little cages seemed to know me, as I walked through
                  the hall, and poured forth a gushing strain of melody to welcome me. I stepped out
                  upon the portico, and stood gazing upon the scene before me, and thinking how very
                  long it seemed since I had seen the birds and flowers, and the dear little
                  fountain sparkling so brightly in the rich sunlight.
               "How very beautiful," I murmured, half aloud.
               "Beautiful, indeed," said a voice which I had not forgotten.
               I turned my head, and met the dark eyes of the Southerner. Taking my hand in his,
                  he continued,
               "Allow me, dear, Miss Lucy to express the true pleasure I feel in once more
                  beholding you. Did I not say we should meet again?"
               My heart beat wildly, and I felt the crimson blood rush to my cheeks. He perceived
                  my embarrassment, and offered me his arm for a walk in the garden. We reached the
                  arbor, and as I felt much fatigued, we entered and seated ourselves upon its
                  velvet-cushioned seats.
               We sat for some time talking of the events of the few past weeks, and the
                  conversation soon turned upon our first meeting at the Italian opera. His
                  deep-toned voice had grown low and tender while speaking of that, to
                  both,—eventful night. Then as he mentioned my long, weary sickness, and the
                  anxiety he had felt lest he should not again behold me, he clasped my willing hand
                  in his, and said in low, passionate tones.
               "Miss Lacy, since the first night we met, you have been the subject of my dreams
                  and thoughts. I need not tell you that I love you wildly, passionately—you know
                  that already. And O! may I hope—may I dare to ask for such a heart as thine?"
               His low, eloquent tones thrilled my very soul. His hand had swept the delicate
                  chord of the heart-harp, awakening the
                  music which had long slumbered within it. The tide of tenderness was unsealed, and
                  my own heart beat responsive melody with the kindred spirit which thrilled for me
                  alone.
               Weak and childish from my late sickness, I laid my head upon his shoulder and
                  burst into a flood of tears.
               "Edith, dear Edith," he said; "is it possible that you weep? Oh! then I am indeed
                  beloved! Deceit may lurk beneath smiles and protestations; but tears, the pure,
                  blessed dew-drops of the soul, can never flow from a treacherous heart. But let
                  that dear voice of thine tell me I am beloved. Edith, darling Edith, say that your
                  heart is mine, all mine!"
               "Yes, Victor," I replied, "thy hand is the first that hath unsealed the love-fount
                  in my heart. Henceforth, its tide of passion shall flow for thee alone."
               "Bless you, my darling," he said, drawing me nearer to his manly breast. "How
                  sweet will be the devotion which shall pay for the rich treasure of thy love! My
                  whole life shall repay thee, and this arm shall be ever strong to shield thee from
                  the rude blasts of life's chilling storms. While this heart lives to love thee,
                  thy pathway shall be strewn with roses, and time—swift, withering time—shall pass
                  so lightly that ne'er a shadow can leave its blighting trace upon thy brow."
               We sat for some time in silence, each spirit drinking from the same fountain of
                  bliss—each heart thrilling with the same impassioned spell. Suddenly a merry laugh
                  awoke us from our spirit-dream, and Aunt Minnie said, as she entered the
                  arbor.
               "Well, I have found you at last! I wonder what doctor Stanley will say, when we
                  tell him his little patient went way down to the arbor, when he only gave her
                  permission to walk into the parlor, and that very carefully, too! But I see who
                  will have to bear the blame. So, Mr. Haverland, what must be the penalty for
                  causing Edith to break the kind doctor's commands?"
               "Why," answered Victor, "I suppose I shall have to see that she returns safely to
                  the house, and then stay and play the part of nurse!"
               Aunt Minnie laughed heartily, and said she feared he would make a very poor nurse
                  if he continued as careless as he had commenced. But Victor staid with us all that
                  day, and when he departed at night, Aunt Minnie told him that as he had made such
                  a capital nurse, he might come the next day, if he would promise not to allow
                  Edith to run away to the arbor again.
               He replied in a tone of mock gravity, "that if he should, she might doom him to
                  the same painful penalty which paid for the last offence."
               Days flew swiftly by. Bright, blissful days of sunshine—the sunshine of the heart!
                  Victor was with me, and in his presence, time passed so lightly, that even the
                  rustling, of his shadowy wings broke not the gentle atmosphere of happiness in
                  which we dwelt. A new world seemed opened
                  before me! A new path in the wide field of life. Together our hearts perused the
                  glowing leaves of love's golden-hued book, and our spirits thrilled alike with
                  each glowing sentiment.
               The one same link which bound soul to soul in kindred sympathy, was so closely
                  woven, that our spirit thought with one thought; we saw with one glance; breathed
                  with one breath; and dreamed one same glorious dream of wild, passionate love.
                  Surely, the spell was too sweet to last—the heaven of our existence too glorious
                  to remain forever cloudless.
               My health improved rapidly, and the rose was soon returned to my pale cheek. Every
                  afternoon we would repair to the pretty arbor, and Victor would read aloud from
                  some favorite author, while the warm, glowing sun-light stole through the thick
                  foliage, and the song of birds mingled with the fountain's low-murmuring
                  melody.
               How richly fell his deep-toned voice upon the calm, hushed air of summer! How well
                  adapted was his peculiar style of elocution to the eloquent heart-strains of the
                  poet, as he read the sublime thoughts of great and mighty minds! Ah! Victor
                  Haverland, thine was a soul high and lofty as the glorious thoughts of those same
                  noble minds, whose gems of eloquence thou readest so thrillingly.
               When evening came with its cool, quiet air, we would wander alone through the
                  walks of the large, beautiful garden, and often would we sit upon the grassy back
                  of the miniature lake, in the deep, solemn hour of midnight, while the bright
                  beams of the silver-hued moon, bathed us in a tide of softened light, and the
                  countless host of golden stars gleamed like jewels from the canopy above.
               To sit thus within such a paradise of beauty, was happiness too sacred almost for
                  words, and the silence would remain sometimes for hours unbroken. But our spirits
                  would drink deep of the same pure fount of bliss, so closely were our hearts
                  allied.
               Ah! those were blessed hours—all fraught with the very incense of human
                  happiness.
               Time passed swiftly on. Oh, why should its rustling wings flutter with the same
                  ceaseless flight, when bliss so sweet was hanging on its wand of destiny? Autumn
                  came, and my mother was anxious to return once more to her own nothern home. And
                  so the day was fixed upon to leave Aunt Minnie's hospitable mansion.
               Ah! how I dreaded leaving that little southern heaven! How tearfully I visited for
                  the last time, the arbor where so many happy moments had been passed—the pretty
                  lake, with its green foliage shading it so deeply—the dear little fountain
                  murmuring such gentle melody; and the bright birds singing in the old hall.
               And how tearfully we all assembled in the cheerful parlor when the starry evening
                  came! We were to start the next morning for the North, and Aunt Minnie must hear
                  her darling Edith sing her favorite song, and play one more game of chess with
                  Victor, ere—as she said—the spell of
                  loneliness should again be flung over her little household.
               And Victor—he went with us, else I fear I should indeed have been almost
                  heart-broken. Aunt Minnie's kind voice trembled when she bade us good night; and
                  we retired to our rooms to dream for the last time beneath the dear roof which had
                  so long and kindly sheltered us.
               Morning came. A bright, beautiful morning; and the glorious sun was just rising
                  from the golden east, when the carriage drove up to the gate. Then came the
                  parting! Aunt Minnie was engaged with my mother, and I stole out upon the portico
                  to take one last sad look at the arbor and fountain.
               Most beautiful did they look with the rich sun-beams flinging a golden hue over
                  the whole. I burst into a flood of tears, and, leaning against a column, thought
                  of the happy hours I had passed amid those scenes.
               Here had the tiny bird of love first nestled its rosy wings within my heart; and
                  with those same fluttering wings, swept the chords of the slumbering lyre whose
                  music soon learned to mingle with the silver notes of the love-bird! Here for two
                  whole seasons had I dreamed away life beneath the unclouded canopy of happiness,
                  with the spell of bliss upon my soul, and never a shadow dimming the
                  life-star.
               Alas! how could I leave it? But the carriage was waiting, and my mother already
                  seated within it! I turned towards Aunt Minnie, and she clasped me silent- ly to
                  her heart. She could not speak, and my heart was too full for utterance. One
                  moment—and the silent farewell was over, and I whirling with all the rapidly which
                  two stout horses could command, from Aunt Minnie's residence. I leaned from the
                  window, and kissed my hand to the kind relative who loved me with all a mother's
                  fondness, as she waved her snowy handkerchief from the portico. One last,
                  lingering look at the dearly-loved spot, and the beautiful Southern home had faded
                  from my view.
               I wept for a few moments most bitterly, until Victor remarked in a quiet tone of
                  mock seriousness, that if I would stop weeping for a few moments until he had
                  taken sufficient breath, he would cry, too.
               I burst into a hearty laugh in which my mother joined, and thus restored to a
                  pleasant mood, we enjoyed the journey finely. By steamboat and railroad, by coach
                  and carriage we travelled, until our northern home was reached. My mother and
                  Victor were delighted when the parlor door was thrown open, and the bright
                  cheerful fire glowing in the grate, sent a gentle warmth throughout our chilled
                  frames.
               The faithful housekeeper came forward to greet us, but though I loved the dear
                  home of my childhood, yet a shudder passed over me, and a strange unaccountable
                  presentiment of something—I knew not what—thrilled my spirit.
               But the strange emotion soon passed away, and I was gay and joyous as ever. With
                  books and music, chess and visitors, the
                  day passed swiftly by, and the time fixed for my marriage was rapidly
                  approaching.
               I loved Victor with my whole soul, and his passion seemed every day to increase.
                  The hours we spent together were fraught with bliss, and he spoke often of the day
                  that should make me all his own.
               We received a letter from my only brother, who was then travelling in Europe,
                  stating that he was soon to return to his native land. Mother was delighted, and
                  Victor longed to clasp by the hand, one so very dear to the heart of his darling
                  Edith.
               One bright sunny afternoon, I was sitting in the parlor with Victor. He had just
                  finished reading a beautiful portion of Childe Harold, and our souls yet thrilled
                  with the exquisite poetry, when the servant opened the door and handed me a
                  note.
               A singular sensation stole over me, and a crimson blush dyed my cheek. Victor
                  perceived it, and said in a gay tone,
               "Some love epistle, I suppose?"
               I tried to smile, and replied with a forced laugh,
               "To pay for such an insinuation, you shall read it to me!"
               So handing him the note I seated myself in the attitude of a patient listener,
                  while he in obedience to my commands, broke the seal! His eye glanced hastily over
                  it, and he commenced reading it to himself. The expression of his face changed,
                  and the beaming smile was succeeded by an almost death-like paleness.
               As he read on, the white teeth were set firmly together, and his manly breast
                  heaved with inward emotion. I sat in painful suspense, until he turned to me and
                  said, in a tone which betrayed the most intense suffering, while an expression of
                  cold, withering scorn flitted over his fine face,
               "Madam, would you hear the contents?"
               "Read it, O, read it," I exclaimed, unable longer to bear such agonizing suspense,
                  though a presentiment of something terrible, even then blanched both cheek and
                  lip. In a tone of bitter sternness, he commenced,
               "To her whose heart I once fondly deemed my own! Edith—for still will I call you
                  so—I am dying. The shadow of Death is upon my brow, and its icy chill freezing the
                  life-blood in my heart! Ah, why should life, so young as mine, thus early seek the
                  quiet of the silent grave? Because a shadow, cold, dark and bitter, has clouded
                  life's bright sky, and the spirit star has faded beneath the midnight hue which
                  drapes the dim, veiled future! And whose hand lighted the passionless torch which
                  is slowly consuming the life-tide in my heart's deep-shadowed cells? Whose lips
                  bade that heart to bury its flowers of passion deep in the dark urn of memory, and
                  its noblest dreamings within the cold grave of hope? Edith Lacy, thy heart will
                  answer!
               "I do not reproach thee that thou couldst not love. Ah, no; far from it. I know
                  that the mighty wand of destiny swayeth the heart's passion. But I reproach thee,
                  that with a witchery e'en like the syren's, thou didst lead me on, step by step, with that false smile covering a heart
                  where the dark bird of deceit had made its nest, until my soul was taught to know
                  no sweet unshared by thee, and my spirit to cherish no dream save for thy
                  happiness. And when I dared to kneel and ask the love thy every motion had taught
                  me to deem mine own, how coldly was I spurned! Ah, Edith Lacy, did I not tell thee
                  that the chill thy hand flung over my heart, would ne'er depart 'till life should
                  cease its weary march? Aye! the chill was cold and withering, and surely hath it
                  done its work. Thy meteor-like smile was the insidious wile of the coquette, and
                  its power did well attain thy purpose. Thou didst win my heart, and thou has
                  broken it!
               "My tiny bark is fast nearing the still waters of an unfathomed eternity, and the
                  life-bird is faintly fluttering on the verge of a silver shore. Death with its
                  shadowy wings is rustling near me. I go to seek in eternity the happiness earth
                  has denied. My last prayer shall be for thee—my last wish that we may meet above.
                  I ask from thee one kindly thought; and oh! forget not when the spell of happiness
                  thrills thy spirit, that the soul of Henry Wilton passed from earth breathing thy
                  name!"
               Victor rose from his seat, and flinging the letter at my feet, said in a cold tone
                  of bitter anguish—
               "And is it possible that I, too, have been deceived? Can the same insidious smile
                  have taught me also to love one whose bosom cherishes the dark venom of deceit?
                  Can I have sacrificed my heart upon a worthless shrine, and lavished all the fond
                  worship of my nature upon a being utterly devoid of every noble attribute which
                  should dwell within the heart of woman? Oh, my God! I had not thought the cup of
                  misery could hold a draught so bitter!
               "Henry Wilton—he was my early friend. At college we were as brothers. Well do I
                  remember his proud sensitive nature, and the high and noble soul which scorned
                  aught wearing deception's ignoble mark! Ah, what a spirit was his. High,
                  passionate and proud! the very soul of honor; he was one of God's noblest
                  creations!
               "And yet thou didst not hesitate to pierce such a heart with a death-arrow from
                  the quiver of deception! Even as I have loved thee, so were the noblest dreamings
                  of his soul wrapt in the false heaven of thy love, and bitter was the sacrifice of
                  such a soul on such a heartless shrine. Oh, heaven forbid that I should ally
                  myself to one who could do a deed so terrible! Edith Lucy, know that thy hand has
                  flung a shadow over two hearts instead of one—that thy deception has pierced two
                  souls with the same arrow. My life is forever clouded; for oh! happiness departs
                  when I bid farewell to thee!"
               "Stay Victor, oh, stay," I shrieked; "I have not deceived thee! I love thee, as
                  woman never loved before."
               But my words were unheeded—Victor Haverland had gone forever.
               Ah! Henry Wilton; thou wert indeed revenged! The hour had indeed come when I had fearful cause to
                  repent the wound I gave thee.
               My head swam, and every object in the room seemed floating in a swelling sea.
                  There was a cold, chilling sensation in my heart, and it did indeed seem bursting.
                  I clasped my hand tightly over it, but the spirit-harp was swept too rudely, and I
                  sank insensible upon the floor!
               When I awoke to consciousness, I was in my own room. The windows were darkened,
                  and by my bedside sat my mother, pale, anxious, and but the shadow of her former
                  self. How came I there—and where was Victor? I pressed my hand upon my brow, and
                  shutting my eyes, the past floated before my mind.
               I turned towards my mother and feebly asked how long I had lain there. She told me
                  in a low voice, that for many long, weary weeks, I had raved in the wild frenzy of
                  delirium, and that life seemed hanging upon a single thread—how she had watched
                  over me during the long hours of the day, and through the weary midnight,' till
                  nature was nearly exhausted; and, as she finished, she sank upon her knees and
                  murmured, "I thank, thee O! merciful Heaven, that my child is again restored to
                  me."
               It was long ere I was restored to perfect health, and then I was an altered being.
                  Repentance had faithfully performed its duty, and I lived, not for myself, but for
                  others. I found no happiness like that of exerting myself to promote the happiness
                  of those around me.
               I learned from Aunt Minnie, that Victor Haverland upon his return to the south,
                  had instantly departed for Europe. His name never passed my lips, but his image
                  was engraven on my heart, and the memory of the happy hours I passed with him, was
                  fondly cherished, as the few golden sunbeams of perfect bliss which light for a
                  little while, the sky of life's uneven pathway.
               Aunt Edith's story was ended. I had heard the history of her heart! For a few
                  moments, neither broke the deep silence which followed the painful recital. Each
                  was absorbed in a reverie almost as deep as the silence itself. At length I
                  said,
               "Aunt Edith, as Victor Haverland left you so cruelly, why did you not accept the
                  hand of that rich widower? I am sure he loves you dearly, and then he is so
                  handsome, and has such a fine establishment!"
               "Ah, Louey," she replied, "one would easily know that the little love-bird had
                  never fluttered in your heart. When such a love as that I gave Victor Haverland is
                  once blighted, and the heart-chords so rudely severed as were mine, no power of
                  ours can ever transfer the soul's affections to another, and no voice, however
                  sweet, can again call forth the music which first swept the lyre of the warm and
                  passionate heart. Have you forgotten these truthful lines of Shakspeare?" 
                     
                        "Love is not love
                        Which alters when it alteration finds,
                        Or bends with the remover to remove;
                        Oh no! it is an ever-fired mark,
                        That looks on tempests, and is never shaken;
                        It is the star to every wandering bark,
                        
                        Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken,
                        Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
                        Within his bending sickle's compass come;
                        Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
                        But bears it out, e'en to the edge of down."
                     
                  
               
               "If those lines breathe as much truth as eloquence," I replied, "I should rather
                  the love-bird would never nestle those uneasy wings of his within my heart."
               Aunt Edith smiled and answered,
               "And when he does, my darling, may it be when he is in a happy mood, and may the
                  melody he awakes never cease its notes of love, but continue to cheer thee with
                  its harmonious music till life shall need its song no longer. But Louey, we have
                  not heeded how swiftly the hours were passing. See, it is almost midnight."
               I glanced up at the old clock, and sure enough it wanted but a few moments to
                  twelve. So I thanked Aunt Edith for kindly granting my request, and after
                  receiving her good-night kiss, retired to dream of conquetry and broken vows.
               Days and weeks passed pleasantly by, when one morning, just as we were rising from
                  the breakfast table, a letter was brought in for Aunt Edith.
               She glanced at the superscription, and I thought the chirography must be very
                  familiar, for she trembled violently and instantly retired to her room. She had
                  been absent nearly an hour, when I heard her voice calling me.
               I instantly obeyed the summons, and in a moment was seated with Aunt Edith, in her
                  cheerful apartment.
               "Loucy," she said, placing the letter she had received in my hand, "I have
                  confided to you the story of my eventful life; I will make you my confidant in all
                  that shall concern that story. Read this, and tell me what you think of it."
               Full of amazement I commenced reading the mysterious note. It ran thus:—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "MY OWN DEAR EDITH:—Many long, weary years have passed since we met.
                              Years—for me—replete with woe and loneliness. I have been a wanderer
                              upon a foreign shore—an exile from home and happiness. But whether
                              roaming amid the glowing scenes of starry Italy, or the vine-covered
                              homes of sunny France, the thought of thee has ever filled my breast;
                              the image of thy dear face been ever present in my heart. And a voice
                              seemed ever murmuring the words "I have not deceived thee. I love thee
                              as woman never loved before!" Oh, Edith; how bitterly have I
                              reproached myself for leaving thee so hastily! I should have staid to
                              soothe the bitterness which repentance had even then placed in thy
                              heart. But no, I left thee with nought save reproaches, and bitterly
                              have I repented an act so unkind. I found, when too late, that I also
                              loved 'as man ne'er loved before.' And oh! could you know
                              how unhappy—how wretched I have been, you would forgive me.
                           "But I have returned once again to my native land, and once again do I seek thy love.
                              Youth—wild, passionate youth—has departed. But time has left no trace
                              upon my brow—has mingled no silver with my hair; and my heart—thy
                              heart, dear Edith, for never has it ceased to beat for thee—is still
                              the same. Oh! Edith, do you love me yet, or has the withering hand of
                              neglect pressed upon thy heart till it is passionless? Shall the love
                              I seek be mine once more? May I come and woo again the tenderness that
                              in years gone by was given me so fondly? Ah, Edith, pardon the
                              wanderer, and once more bid happiness to thrill the true heart of
                           
                              VICTOR HAVERLAND."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               I glanced at Aunt Edith. The tear-drops rolled down her fair cheeks, and her hands
                  were pressed tightly over her heart. I flung my arms around her neck and pressing
                  my lips to her cheek, murmured,
               "Oh! do send for him, Aunt Edith, and tell him how fondly you have cherished his
                  memory, and how truly you still love him!"
               She pressed me fondly to her heart, and then seated herself to answer the
                  note.
               The answer was simple, yet it expressed the heart's own eloquence:—"Come, Victor,
                  and learn how proudly I accept the heart I have long endeavored to prove worthy
                  of."
               When afternoon came, I insisted upon playing dressing maid to Aunt Edith, and I
                  shall never forget how sweetly she looked in the neat robe of dark velvet, which
                  admirably set off her singularly clear complexion, nor how she said she had a mind
                  to punish my wilful-ness, by not wearing the tiny rose leaves, I would—much
                  against her will—place in the braids of her glossy hair.
               Evening came, and Aunt Edith was left alone in the parlor. Presently the bell
                  rung, and the servant opening the parlor door announced, "Mr. Victor
                  Haverland!"
               None witnessed the meeting. The re-union of two such hearts was too sacred for
                  intrusion.
               Ah! what a joyous wedding was Aunt Edith's. The bride looked charmingly, and the
                  bridegroom,—I whispered in Aunt Edith's ear as I pressed a kiss upon her cheek, "I
                  never shall love until I meet with one like Victor Haverland!"
               She smiled, and the incredulous expression of her face, said plainly, then I fear
                  you will remain an "old maid" longer than Aunt Edith did.
               Oh! how bitterly I wept when Aunt Edith departed with her noble husband for the
                  sunny South. Loneliness for a time usurped the place of happiness in our little
                  household, and the long, weary days seemed fraught with desolation. I was almost
                  wild with joy when a long, glad letter came from Mrs. Haverland, which said that
                  the next summer she would visit us once more. The letter contained a dear little
                  note for me, and if it pleases thee, kind reader, thou mayst read it with me, for
                  methinks the warning it contains should be impressed on other hearts than
                  mine:—
               
               "I am enjoying a little world of bliss in my own little southern paradise. The
                  same silvery fountain murmurs its low melody before the trellised portico, and the
                  same glowing sunlight sheds its gentle beams upon the same scenes it used, in
                  former years, to flood so gloriously. And each day Victor and myself visit the
                  pretty arbor, and spend many a blissful hour in the dear spot where so many hours
                  were dreamed away when the love-spell first bound our souls. Ah, Louey, I feel
                  that I am blest indeed. Dwelling within a home lovely as a fairy's haunt. Idolized
                  by the noblest of husbands, every hour seems replete with perfect happiness. I
                  miss no voices from my bird-like home, save my dear mother's and Aunt Minnie's;
                  but I know they are both angels in a happier world than this.
               "And now, darling, I would warn you against cherishing in your young heart even
                  for a moment, the despicable fault which caused me so much misery. If there be one
                  error which above all others, will lay the foundation for future woe, it is
                  coquetry. Repentance, stern, bitter repentance will surely follow when too late
                  for reparation; and then a shadow, cold, dark and withering, is flung forever over
                  the sorrow-stricken heart.
               "Oh! beware lest the fearful shadow rest upon your spirit, and if even tempted to
                  practice the syren wiles of deception, I beg of you, call not the curse of Heaven
                  upon your own head, but think of the future, and remember Aunt Edith's story."
            
            
               THE DESERTED HALL.
               
                  Light let each footstep fall,
                  Speak not too loud;
                  Thou art in no lighted hall,
                  Thou art in no busy crowd;
                  Thou art where each emblem fair
                  Speaks of the dead;
                  And the cold silence there
                  Tells all are fled.
               
               
                  Once in that quiet hall,
                  Merry feet bounded,—
                  While with sweet rise and fall,
                  Gay music sounded.
                  Now many a withered flower,
                  Faded and broken,
                  Of the swift fleeting hour,
                  Rests a cold token!
               
               
                  From that deserted hall,
                  No sound is heard;
                  O'er that deep-shadow'd wall
                  No leaf is stirred.
                  Lost in the Summer's bloom—
                  Sunlight is fled;
                  And in the vaulted tomb,
                  Slumber the dead.
               
            
            
               
               THE TWO BRIDES.
               
                  
                     
                        "I saw two maidens at the kirk,
                        And both were fair and sweet;
                        One in her wedding robe,
                        And one in her winding sheet.
                     
                     
                        The choristers sang the hymn,
                        The sacred rites were read.
                        And one for Life to Life,
                        And one to Death was wed.
                     
                     
                        They were borne to their bridal beds,
                        In loveliness and bloom;
                        One in a merry castle,
                        The other a solemn tomb.
                     
                     
                        One on the morrow woke
                        In a world of sin and pain;
                        But the other was happier far,
                        And never woke again!"
                     
                  
               
               The summer birds filled the morning air with melody, and the sweet flowers lifted
                  their bright heads in homage to the newly-risen sun. The bell of our village
                  church rang forth a marriage chime, and the green in front of the church was
                  covered with merry-hearted, wondering children. Many of them held bunches of
                  bright flowers in their dimpled hands, and when the bridal party reined their
                  spirited horses in front of the church, they scattered the pretty tokens over the
                  green sward and the church steps, that they might kiss the little feet of the
                  beautiful bride when she passed on to the altar.
               And bright and blooming as they were, those summer flowers, they could not be more
                  lovely than she whose light footsteps crushed their sweet petals. But now she
                  stood in the little church before the man of God, listening to the holy words that
                  bound her for a lifetime to him who had won her young heart. Very beautiful she
                  was in her bridal robe, with the wreath of white rosebuds and pure-looking
                  snow-drops twined in her dark tresses. And very happy was the look of trust her
                  sweet eyes turned upon the face of the handsome bridegroom. But his
                  eyes, though they answered that trusting look with one of fond affection, shone
                  with an expression of uneasiness, and at times as the marriage rite went on, his
                  face would grow suddenly pale, and he would throw a quick glance around, as if
                  other thoughts than his present joy were resting on his mind.
               But the rite was over. The vows were spoken, and the marriage ring was placed on
                  the small finger of the bride's fair hand. They turned to leave the church, and
                  though a tear glistened in the dark eye of the bride, yet her step was light and
                  her heart full of sunshine as the flowers beneath her feet. When she walked over
                  this flowers to the altar, she was a maiden pure and lovely as the rose-buds in
                  her hair. Now she was a wife, bound by the holiest ties of life to make the
                  sunshine of another's heart. She had given her happiness to another's keeping, she
                  had exchanged her girl- hood's freedom
                  for chains which only Death could sever—chains which might drag her young heart to
                  the grave, or bind it more closely to the affections of life, she knew not which.
                  Ah, well it was she did not know her destiny—her footsteps would not
                  always be over flowers! Her future looked bright to her now as she viewed it from
                  the altar, and her heart was very, very happy.
               Not so the bridegroom. His heart would thrill with happiness when he glanced down
                  upon the lovely face of her who leaned so trustingly on his arm, but a shadow
                  would quickly darken their happiness. A vision of a face lovely as his bride's,
                  through a pale and death-like, would came between him and the being by his side,
                  and the spiritual eyes would seem gazing into his with a look of deep, yet gentle
                  reproach.
               The company were again in their saddles, and the bridegroom was springing upon his
                  horse, when his restless eyes glanced into the church-yard; and as for a moment
                  they rested there, they fell upon a new-made grave! Once more the
                  sudden paleness came over his face, and his horse sprang forward with the rest. He
                  knew who would be laid there, and ever after the shadow of that open grave seemed
                  resting over his life.
               The bridal party were gone from the church, and nought told of their presence
                  there, save the flowers which lay withering in the summer sunlight.
               It was afternoon. The sun still shone warm and bright, and again the sound of the
                  church bell floated over the village; but now its chime was slow and solemn, for
                  it tolled a funeral knell. A sad procession stopped upon the green, but the
                  sunny-hearted children strewed no flowers in the pathway, though another bride was
                  to cross the threshhold of the church. They feared the smileless bridegroom, for
                  the maiden was garbed in the white robes of burial, and the bridegroom who had won
                  her to his arms was—Death.
               They bore her over the church steps, and laid her in the same spot where the
                  living bride had plighted her marriage vows. And the same holy man whose lips had
                  said, "What God hath joined together let no man put asunder," now repeated, a
                  Earth to earth, dust to dust, ashes to ashes."
               Gentle reader, go thou to the coffin and look on that lovely face with the dark
                  hair parted so smoothly on the peaceful brow, and the sweet, almost mournful
                  smile, lingering round the pale, cold lips, and tell me, shouldst thou think the
                  manly-looking bridegroom of the morning had aught to do with the shaft that laid
                  that young head low in death? Ah, surely not, you say; but, reader, it was his
                  hand that aimed the shaft of death towards that sweet maiden's heart. He had won
                  her love and then he had deserted her!
               He had been the playmate of her childhood, and when the bloom of womanhood made
                  her brow still fairer, he had plighted to her his vows of love and constancy. He
                  had walked with her in the summer moonlight, he had sat with her in the winter
                  hours, gazing in her sweet eyes and
                  breathing into her ear words of affection, till he had bound her young heart to
                  him with, a tie that death alone could sever, till she lived only in the light of
                  his love. But there came a change. The glow of affection faded from his eyes when
                  he gazed upon her face, and the once gentle tones grew cold and distant. He did
                  not tell her that he had ceased to love her; he did not tell her that he had
                  broken his oft plighted vows, but he treated her coldly, neglecting her when they
                  met, and avoiding the glance of her eye that pleaded silently to know the cause of
                  his coldness. And he met her no more, but rumor told her that his broken faith was
                  again plighted—plighted to a young and beautiful heiress.
               From that time she faded slowly and surely away. Friends said consumption was upon
                  her, but her widowed mother knew she was dying of a broken heart. She murmured no
                  reproach against him whose broken faith had given her into the cold arms of Death;
                  and when the stern archer came to claim her for his bride, she sank calmly and
                  peacefully into his dreamless slumber.
               The funeral rite was over, and they bore the maiden to the church-yard. The lonely
                  mother gazed for the last time upon the dear face that had so often been pillowed
                  upon her breast, and the coffin was lowered into the grave. Wreaths of bright
                  flowers were flung upon it by the young maidens who had been the companions of her
                  girlhood, and the grave was closed and the sad procession moved away. But the
                  widowed mother lingered there till the sunlight faded, and her tears fell fast and
                  thick upon the fresh, green turf. Her last tie to earth was severed, her work on
                  earth was done, and she went back to her lonely home, to await the summons which
                  should call her to the dear ones who had gone before. Alas! poor mother! The same
                  blow which had crushed her child's young heart had rebounded and chilled her own.
                  Surely the false heart of him whose broken faith laid the gentle maiden to rest a
                  lone sleeper in the church-yard, who, in blighting her child's happiness, buried
                  the mother's hopes in that new-mounded grave, shall not, in this world, go
                  unpunished. The shadow of that lonely grave, the sorrow of that stricken mother's
                  heart, shall yet darken his life and fill his own heart with the bitterness it
                  gave to others.
            
            
               
               I'M LONGING FOR THE SPRING.
               
                  I'm longing for the spring, mother,
                  I'm longing for the spring;
                  For the flowers that herald summer,
                  And for birds upon the wing.
                  My heart has grown so weary, mother,
                  Within this darkened room,
                  That I long to see the signs that speak
                  Of sunny life and bloom.
               
               
                  I'm longing for the spring, mother,
                  For the violet and the bird;
                  For azure skies and trees of green,
                  And leaves by soft winds stirred.
                  My poor head aches so oft, mother,
                  And I feel so much of pain,
                  That I fear if spring doth tarry long,
                  It will bloom for me in vain.
               
               
                  I'm longing for the spring, mother,
                  For with the winter's snow,
                  Pale sickness laid its blighting hand
                  Upon my aching brow.
                  And will not sunny spring, mother.
                  Bring blooming health to me?
                  Will not my eye be bright again,
                  And my step be light and free?
               
               
                  I'm longing for the spring, mother,
                  For if it bring me health,
                  'T will be for you and me, mother,
                  More than a world of wealth.
                  For I cannot part from thee, mother,
                  And I know that anguish wild
                  Would well-nigh break thy gentle heart,
                  If thou didst lose thy child.
               
               
                  Oh! I'm longing for the spring mother,
                  'T would be so hard to die,
                  Ere yet the passing spell of youth
                  Has fairly floated by.
                  Then pray the spring may come, mother,
                  With its breezes sweet and mild,
                  And bring the bloom of health again
                  To bless thy weary child.
               
            
            
               
               THE LITTLE DANCING GIRL.
               IT was Christmas morning. The sleigh-bells were jingling merrily through the
                  crowded thoroughfares of our own proud city, and the snow covered sidewalks were
                  thronged with pedestrians of all grades and nations.
               One moment passed the aristocratic daughter of opulence, with her rich robes
                  waving gracefully with each haughty step of the dainty feet, and the elegant
                  garments held scornfully back in the delicately-gloved hands, lest they should be
                  contaminated by touching the tattered vesture of some low-born "child of
                  poverty."
               The next, would pass a fair young girl with languid steps, and scanty clothing
                  drawn closely around the slender form, that the winter's icy chill might not
                  benumb her aching limbs.
               Poor creature! The sad expression of suffering and sorrow upon that pale face,
                  tells how surely the iron grasp of poverty is wearing her young life to the silent
                  tomb.
               Day after day, doth she tread that same busy street, passing the stately abodes of
                  wealth and luxury, and meeting many a proud maiden attired in the costly robes of
                  affluence, who may not boast a fairer form or purer heart than her own humble
                  self, and yet is petted and caressed by kind and loving friends who, look upon her
                  as the pride of their splendid home; while she must be content to pass the golden
                  hours of youth, in laboring unceasingly for the poor crust of coarse bread which
                  forms her daily meal.
               Work on, work on, thou child of poverty! Soon shall the day come when the rich and
                  poor shall sleep together in one common earth. When the same sod shall cover the
                  high-born and the lowly.
               But ah! when the last trump shall bid the dead arise, not alike shall the
                     high and low be judged! No, no; they who have humbly borne the cross
                  below, shall wear the crown above; and the proudest of earth may be the lowliest
                  in Heaven.
               It was nearly twelve o'clock, when a little girl descended the broad steps which
                  led from the side entrance of a fashionable theatre. She was coarsely and scantily
                  dressed, and the thin, light slippers which encased her small and exquisitely
                  shaped feet, were quickly saturated with the soft snow.
               The coarse hood which only half covered her head, exposed to view a face of the
                  most peerless beauty, Every feature was delicate and classically beautiful, and he
                  large, dark, brilliant eyes, had in them that deep thrilling expression which
                  seems to speak the sweetest language of an eloquent soul.
               Her hair was dark and glossy, and escaping from the hood, fell nearly to the waist in long clustering
                  ringlets. There was an expression of anxiety resting upon the lovely features,
                  which told that, young as she was, the life of the sweet child had not been always
                  crowned with sunshine.
               She stopped not to admire the glittering ornaments displayed so invitingly in the
                  shop windows, nor to gaze upon the splendid sleighs which dashed so merrily
                  through the white streets on that bright Christmas morning.
               Many a proud lady turned to gaze once more upon that glorious face, as the
                  beautiful child hurried through the crowded streets; and many an aristocratic
                  mother turned from the contemplation of those radiant features, to the pale,
                  expressionless face of her own petted child, and wondered why one of lowly birth
                  should be so lovely, when not even the vaunted tinsel of wealth and aristocracy
                  could make her high-born child as beautiful.
               But the little girl heeded not the admiring glances bent upon her face, and
                  hurriedly walked on, though the chill breeze lifted the curls from her shoulders,
                  and brought a rosier glow to her velvet cheeks.
               It was a large room upon the first floor of an old-fashioned, grim-looking house.
                  The white pine floor was unsullied by a single spot, and the scanty furniture was
                  arranged with the most scrupulous neatness. Seated before the poorly-blazing fire,
                  was a middle-aged woman, whose intellectual face, although very pale, still
                  retained traces of once brilliant beauty.
               She was dressed in a rusty black silk gown, which, from the short waist and large
                  old-fashioned sleeves, must have been made when her years were fewer, and her
                  small hands even fairer than now.
               There was a certain air of dignity and superiority about her, which displayed
                  itself from the anxious glance of her dark eyes to the slightest movement of the
                  pale hands, and revealed, even to a careless observer, that she had seen "better
                  days."
               But whatever might have been her station in years gone by, it was evident that
                  grim, blighting poverty, was now fast paling her cheek, and passing its cold hand
                  over her once smooth brow.
               She held in her lap a beautiful child of about three years of age, whose flushed
                  cheeks and deep, irregular breathing, told that the blood in those blue veins, was
                  burning with the wild heat of fever. His eyes were beaming brilliantly, and he lay
                  seemingly unconscious of all that passed around him, gazing vacantly into the
                  fire.
               The dark eyes of his pale mother—for such the striking semblance between them
                  proclaimed her—were bent upon his face, and every now and then the silent tear,
                  and the half-stifled moan, would reveal the unutterable grief which swelled her
                  fond heart, as she marked the vacant stare and the burning cheek of her darling
                  child.
               Suddenly the outer door creaked upon its rusty hinges, and the next moment the
                  little girl we have before in- troduced
                  to the reader, bounded into the apartment. She hastily flung aside her hood and
                  shawl, and exclaimed as she knelt beside the sick child and fondly kissed it,
                  "Don't you think Willie is a little better to-day, mother?"
               The mother laid her hand upon her head, but did not answer; and as the little boy
                  heard the sweet voice of his beautiful sister, he partially raised himself, and
                  flinging his little arms around her neck, murmured, "darling Allie," and sank
                  quickly back into his mother's arms.
               For a few moments the little maiden gazed upon him in silence, and then rising
                  from her kneeling posture, she drew a chair to her mother's side, and said in a
                  low tone as she seated herself upon it.
               "Oh! mother, we had such a long, dreary rehearsal; and I told Mr. Montford how
                  sick dear little Willie is, and how much I wanted to stay at home with him, and he
                  said that as to-night is Christmas, he should have a very large audience, and he
                  could not do without me; and when I cried and said I could not dance when little
                  brother was so sick, he was so angry, and said if I did not dance to-night, and
                  dance well, too, I should never enter his Theatre again, and he would never pay me
                  anything. But if I would come to-night, and dance well, he would pay me to-morrow,
                  and so I said I would go.
               "Oh! to-night, mother, I do want to stay with you and Willie; I know I cannot
                  dance to-night!" And the little girl nestled closer to her mother's side and burst
                  into tears.
               The pale mother threw her arms over the slight form of her beautiful child, and
                  said, while the hot tears flowed over her wan cheeks.
               "Oh, Allie, do not weep so bitterly, it will break my heart; and it seems bursting
                  when I think that my Allie—my own sweet Allie, must devote her glorious beauty to
                  the tinselled stage, and like a wandering gipsey become a public dancer, to keep
                  from actual starvation. But it shall not be; my Allie shall not be called a
                  dancing girl! No, no; since God has spared my life. I shall devote it to Him and
                  to my children, and when health is once more restored to Willie, you shall leave
                  the stage forever!"
               "No, mother," replied the noble child, "I will be a dancing girl sooner than have
                  you labor! If Willie was not sick, I should not feel so badly, and you know Mr.
                  Montford says he cannot afford to pay me much, because he furnishes my dancing
                  dresses, and I fear if we do not get money to purchase medicine for little brother
                  he will—Oh! mother, would it not be dreadful if willie should
                  die?
               The child struggled to repress the gushing tears, but they would come, and once
                  more was the sweet face buried in the mother's lap.
               They sat for a few moments in silence, and as Willie raised her head, the mother
                  murmured in a sad, low tone,
               
               "'Tis just three years to-day, since your father left his native land, and oh!
                  little did he think when he bade me farewell, and pressed a last kiss upon your
                  cheek, Allie, that he would so soon sleep in the blue ocean he loved so fondly.
                  While he lived, what a proud home was ours, and how happy he was to sit by my side
                  with you upon his knee, and related the many strange incidents of his ocean
                  life.
               "And he had promised not to cross the sea again when he returned from that fatal
                  voyage; but ere six months had flown, there came news of that dreadful shipwreck,
                  and I realized with a breathing heart, that my own noble Melbourne, was lost to me
                  forever, and my sweet children fatherless. And they drove us from our happy home;
                  and oh! what have we not suffered since that sad bereavement? The blight of
                  poverty has rested upon us, and were it not for the mere pittance you received for
                  dancing, we should have long since starved.
               "Three years ago, Allie, wealth and luxury was ours; but now, there is nought
                  around us save penury and want. Nought to look forward to, save toil, care and
                  poverty.
               "My heart sinks within me when I think of the future; for if God spares Willie's
                  life, you shall give up dancing, Allie, and I will toil for you till these hands
                  can labor no longer.
               "But how shall we procure medicine for him? and without it I fear he cannot
                  survive; and oh! Allie, if we should lay our sweet darling in the cold grave, how
                  could we ever be happy again?" and pressing the children nearer to her bosom, she
                  burst into a flood of tears.
               Suddenly Allie started from her seat, and wrapping her shawl around her slight
                  form, and typing the faded hood upon her head, she wiped the tears from her cheeks
                  and said, firmly,
               "I am going out now, mother, and I shall not return until I have procured medicine
                  for Willie."
               "God bless you, Allie," replied the mother. "You are a noble child, and something
                  tells me you will be successful!"
               As the little girl closed the street door, she stood a few moments upon the steps,
                  as if in deep thought, and then saying, half aloud,
               "I will go to Dr. Barton, in Summer street; he was our next neighbor when we lived
                  in our early home, and as he was dear papa's friend, he cannot refuse me."
               She sprang lightly from the steps, and feeling sure Dr. Barton would give her some
                  medicine for Willie, she hurried on with a light step and a hopeful heart,
                  forgetting that the friends of wealth are not the friends of poverty.
               Little Allie stopped not until she had reached a stately mansion in a fashionable
                  street, upon whose silver door-plate was engraved the name of "Barton." She rang
                  the bell, and the door was answered by a servant, who, as Allie's timid inquiring,
                  "if Dr. Barton was at home," replied in
                  a pompous tone, "that he was engaged and could not be disturbed for a beggar."
               The crimson blood rushed to the child's fair cheek, but with the proud contempt of
                  a high spirit, she deigned no answer, but said in a determined tone that she
                     must see Dr. Barton.
               The servant was awed by the superior dignity of her manners, and muttering
                  something about the impudence of beggars, opened the drawing-room door, and the
                  next moment a well dressed gentleman, with the highly polished air of an
                  aristocrat, stood before the trembling child, and inquired in a tone of haughty
                  condescension, "What was her business with him?"
               She briefly stated her request, and told him in what part of the city she resided,
                  to which he replied, "that he never visited poor families, and that if she wished
                  assistance she had better apply to those nearer her own station."
               Closing his richly carved door, the "man of wealth" left the child standing upon
                  his granite steps with an almost bursting heart.
               Reader, dost thou think this fiction? Didst thou never know a man,
                  who in his luxurious home could count his thousands upon thousands, to turn coldly
                  away from a starving child, denying it a few pence of timely assistance which
                  might, perhaps, have saved its life?
               If you have not, then look abroad, and learn that many, oh! too many of the
                  high-born ones who wear the gilded badge of aristocracy, wear also the sullied
                  brand, which, thank heaven, the heart of the poor man, humble though he be, would
                  scorn to wear.
               Poor Allie was bitterly disappointed, and the hope which had sprung up in her
                  little heart, was crushed as she slowly turned to retrace her steps. She was just
                  leaving a large street, when her eye fell upon a plated bearing the name of "Dr.
                  Elton." She stopped, and gazing upon it for a moment, murmured, "I cannot return
                  without the medicine;" and ascending the steps of what appeared the office of a
                  physician, she knocked timidly at the door.
               It was opened by an extremely young and handsome man, who gazed for a moment in
                  silence upon the wondrous beauty of the child, and then in a voice of kindness,
                  which sounded strangely soothing to her trembling heart, he bade her enter.
               He drew a chair before the cheerful fire, and as she sat warming her little cold
                  hands, he kindly inquired her name; in a sweet voice she answered "Allie Rivers,"
                  and then went on to relate her touching story.
               When she had concluded, he told her his name was Elton, and he would find a more
                  comfortable home for them, and while he lived, they should never suffer more. He
                  told her he once had a little sister whose name was Alice, but she died, and now
                  little Allie should be his sister, and he would love her as fondly, and watch over
                  her as tenderly as he did his own Alice.
               In an hour Dr. Elton was to leave town on important business, but he gave Allie some medicine for
                  Willie, and told her he would come the next morning and see how he was; and taking
                  a bank bill from his purse, he told the little girl to purchase some food for her
                  mother and herself, and the next day they should be removed to a cheerful
                  home.
               The bright tears stole down the rosy cheeks of the sweet child, as she thanked Dr.
                  Elton for his kindness, and with the medicine and money clasped tightly in her
                  small hand, hurried through the crowded streets, stopping only to purchase food
                  for the "dear ones" at home.
               Dear reader, which think you was the happiest on that merry Christmas Eve? The man
                  who could boast of wealth untold, but who had that very day turned from his door a
                  suffering being; or he who with not half the wealth of the former, could yet lay
                  his head upon his pillow, with the sweet thought soothing his dreams, that he had
                  added his "mite" to assuage the weariness of human suffering.
               Many were the fervent blessings which Mrs. Rivers showered upon the head of the
                  young physician, when Allie laid the food and medicine before her; but when the
                  child told her of the promised assistance, she said, while a blush of pride
                  mantled her pale cheek,
               "Ah, Allie, I cannot live upon the bounty of others, while my own hands can earn
                  an honest livelihood!"
               The medicine was administered to the sick child; and he was laid carefully within
                  the little cradle; and while Allie sat by his side, Mrs. Rivers prepared the food
                  which the kind stranger had provided. It was almost dark when the simple repast
                  was over, and both mother and child seated themselves by Willie's low couch.
               He had fallen into a slumber, light, at first, but as the anxious watches bent
                  over him, his breathing became deeper and deeper, and his sleep more
                  death-like.
               "When he awakes," said Mrs. Rivers, "he will be either better or worse; and oh! my
                  Father grant that his dear life may be spared!"
               Long did they bend in silence over that little cradle, watching the crimson flush
                  pale and deepen on the wan cheeks, and the heaving breast rise and fall, with the
                  feverish breath that came one moment quick and deep, and the next, so light and
                  slowly, that one would almost think the little sufferer had ceased to exist.
               Oh! ye who have watched over the sick, perhaps dying couch of the loved and
                  cherished, making the cold sweat creep over the dear brow, and the flying pulse
                  beat fainter and fainter, can feel what those sad hearts felt when they bent over
                  that suffering child.
               Darker and deeper fell the wintry shades of twilight. The sick boy still slumbered
                  on, unconscious of the anxious hearts beating over him, and the silent watchers
                  stirred not, till a neighboring clock struck the hour of six.
               "Allie, did you promise Mr. Montford that you would dance to-night?" asked Mrs.
                  Rivers, softly.
               "Yes, mother, I did," replied the little girl, while a tear started to her
                  eye.
               
               "Then, my child, you must fulfil your promise; but, Allie, it shall be the last
                  time; he will pay you to-morrow, and that will buy us food till "Willie is better;
                  and then I trust I shall find means to labor for you."
               The warm tears rained over Allie's fair cheeks as she murmured,
               "Oh, mother, how can I leave you to watch over Willie alone?"
               Mrs. Rivers drew the sweet child to her bosom, and kissed her fondly as she said
                  in a broken voice,
               "God will be with us, darling, and I cannot think he will desert us in this trying
                  hour. Trust in Him, my child, and hope for better days; and the time may come
                  again when we may be as honored and respected as those cold hearted ones, who
                  drove you this day from their doors."
               Yes, yes, hope on, poor suffering mother! cheer with soothing words thy child's
                  young heart; soon shall it be filled with sunshine, and thine own meek submission
                  meet with its sweet reward.
               Aye, and soon shall thy station, too, be even as proud as those same world-honored
                  ones, and far, far happier; for thou hast the wealth of a meek and gentle spirit,
                  while they can boast nothing higher than worldly wealth!
               Once more was the faded hood tied over Allie's glossy curls, and after receiving a
                  parting kiss from her sorrowing mother, and taking a last look at Willie, she
                  crept softly, but firmly, from the apartment, and chok- ing back the starting
                  tears, she was soon on her way through the lighted streets to the Theatre.
               Brightly flashed the lights, and gaily echoed the music within the massive walls
                  of the old Tremont. The Theatre was in the very height of its prosperity, and as
                  this was Christmas Night, it was crowded from "pit to dome" with the beauty and
                  aristocracy of our noble city.
               Let us look around among the audience, and try, if amid the strange sea of faces,
                  we can find one that is familiar.
               There is a face of exquisite beauty, lighted up by smiles of almost heavenly
                  sweetness; and in the same box is one so pale and fair that in marking its
                  contrast to the glowing radiance of the other, one is reminded of a fair snowdrop
                  beside a blushing rose.
               But we have never before met those faces, lovely though they be, so let us look
                  again.
               No! there are more none present whom we have met; but there, near the orchestra,
                  sits a gentleman whose face we cannot pass by, without a second look.
               What a glorious brow, and what dark, flashing eyes! what glossy hair and snowy
                  teeth, for a man of middle age. He seems utterly unconscious that there are others
                  around him, and even the fine performance is allowed to go on all unheeded by
                  him.
               His play-bill is doubled, so that as we glance over it to see what announcement
                  can so fix his whole attention, we can only see the words,
                  
                     ALLIE RIVERS, THE YOUNG AMERICAN DANSEUSE,
                        will also appear in a favorite dance!
                     
                  
               
               What can there be in this simple announcement to interest that proud stern man?
                  But see how his dark eye flashes, and his manly breast heaves, as he continues to
                  gaze upon it, apparently almost doubting the clearness of his own eye-sight,
                  brilliant as are those dark orbs.
               We have never met that handsome face before, and yet it seems familiar. But his
                  gaze is rivetted upon that bit of paper; so as we are invisible, you and I—dear
                  reader—will enjoy "a peep behind the curtain."
               See! There in that large room, stands our little friend, Allie! how gloriously
                  beautiful does she look. The round, white shoulders seeming like chiselled marble
                  as they appear above the rich lace over-dress; and the long glossy curls falling
                  like a shower around the fairy-like waist, and shading the heavenly face.
               The tiny satin slippers well become those small, delicate feet, and the jewels
                  which adorn those plump, white arms, lose half their wonted brilliancy, when the
                  lustrous eyes flash over them.
               But ah! in those large, spiritual eyes, there glistens a tear! wherefore did it
                  come? Ah! the sweet child thinks not of the beautiful dress which makes her look
                  so like an angel; she thinks not of that showy stage.
               No, her mind is far away in the cheerless room, where her gentle mother is bending
                  over the cradle of Willie, watching him alone and unaided. She sees them both in
                  imagination, and as she thinks of the wild tears raining from her mother's eyes,
                  and the flushed, hot cheeks of Willie, she starts, and grasping the arm of the
                  stern looking manager, who stands near her, says in a pleading tone of almost
                  frantic wildness,
               "Ah! sir, do please let me go home; I know little brother is worse, and I cannot
                  dance. Oh! do let me go home!"
               "What," almost shouted the manager, "let you go home when your name is on the
                  bill, and the audience are even now impatient for your appearance; no, no, I shall
                  do not such thing—you shall stay and dance, and mark me, you will fare hard if you
                  miss a single step; but see," he continued, grasping Allie's arm, "the play is
                  over, and the curtain is rising, now dance well and I will pay you to-night."
               This was said in a coaxing tone; but as they neared the stage he released his
                  grasp upon her arm, and pointing towards it muttered in a deep, firm voice,
               "Now on, and have care that you do not disappoint me!"
               The next moment Allie was on the stage.
               Like a being from fairy-land, floated that light form; deliciously swelled the
                  rich music, and more graceful became each sylph-like movement. Darker grew the
                  Italian eyes, and flushed the round cheeks with a still deeper crimson.
               
               Like a thing of light she glided over the stage, while a shower of bouquets fell
                  around her, and one beautiful wreath of flowers, as she was gliding from the
                  stage, fell upon her head, and rested like a coronet on the glossy tresses.
               When she had disappeared, the enraptured feelings of the audience burst forth, and
                  the very walls seemed to echo the applause so richly won.
               As Allie stood wearied and almost breathless from exertion, those swelling sounds
                  brought no thrill to her young heart.
               But louder and deeper they came, and the wildly manager told the poor child that
                  she must dance again, for well he knew that the wondrous beauty and exquisite
                  dancing of the youthful being, would excite even more admiration than the
                  magnificent acting of the brilliant "star."
               So once more did that peerless form move like an air-spirit before the vast and
                  delighted assemblage. Once more did the rich melody swell forth, and once more
                  fell bouquets and flower-wreaths at the feet of the fairy-like dancer.
               The dance was nearly ended, and for a moment the starry eyes of the child were
                  turned towards the audience. The stranger who first attracted our attention, had
                  risen from his seat, and upon his now almost death-pale face, fell those brilliant
                  eyes. The tiny feet ceased their graceful motion, and a second time those bright
                  eyes gazed as if spell-bound upon the stranger's pale face. Then with a low,
                  half-stifled cry, little Allie sank insensible upon the flower-covered stage.
               The curtain fell, and the unconscious child was lifted in the arms of the "star"
                  actress of the evening, and laid upon a settee; where the kind-hearted lady bathed
                  the pale temples, and unclasped the strain dress, whose roseate tint contrasted
                  strangely enough with the marble whiteness of the chiselled features.
               Slowly opened those dark eyes, and wildly they beamed as life came back to the
                  cold limbs.
               "My father—oh! where is my father; has he gone without even speaking to his Allie?
                  Tell me! where is my father?"
               And as the pleading voice ceased, the little girl started to her feet and gazed
                  into the face of the fair actress with an expression of such earnest, beseeching
                  inquiry, that the tears started to her eyes as she attempted to soothe her.
               Suddenly a commanding voice was heard, as if in altercation, with the harsh tones
                  of the manager, and the next moment, a side door was flung violently open, and
                  with a wild cry of "Father, my own father!" little Allie sprang into the open arms
                  of the manly stranger.
               When the excitement of the joyous meeting had some what subsided, Mr. Rivers told
                  Allie, that when his proud ship was lost, he was left by the waves upon a small
                  island, inhabited by Indians, where he was obliged to stay for a many a weary
                  month, till one day, an English ship, homeward bound, passed the island, and, attracted by his signal, sent a boat to
                  bring him on board.
               He went with the ship to England, and thereby improving a fortunate opportunity,
                  had amassed an almost princely fortune, and had returned to his native land to
                  enjoy it with his wife and children.
               He had been in the city nearly a week, but his constant search for his family had,
                  to this hour, been all in vain, and it was by the merest chance that he had now
                  found his child.
               He was passing the theatre, when he was attracted by the name of "Allie Rivers,"
                  and, with the wild hope of, at least, learning something of his
                  family, he had that night attended the theatre, and, as the reader already knows,
                  found the lovely object of his search.
               Mr. Rivers then called a carriage, and while they were on the way home, Allie
                  related to her father, all that had occurred since his departure. How they had
                  often suffered for food and warmth; how her mother had mourned over his supposed
                  death, and how sick little Willie was.
               Nor did she forget to mention the kindness of Dr. Elton, and the refusal of his
                  former friend to assist them.
               As Mr. Rivers clasped his darling child still closer to his heart, he replied that
                  they should both be rewarded for the kindness and unkindness with which they had
                  treated his family.
               But while Allie is so earnestly relating her little story, let us, gentle reader,
                  return once more to the old room where we left the pale mother watching over her
                  sick boy.
               After Allied departure, Mrs. Rivers seated herself by the little candle, and
                  holding Willie's fevered hand within her own, watched every change of his flushed
                  countenance, for she knew that the crisis was near, and she feared for the life of
                  her darling.
               Wearily passed the long hours, until the clock in the next room struck eleven, and
                  then little Willie withdrew his hand from his mother's and opened his large
                  eyes.
               Their expression was no longer vacant, and as he looked up into his mother's face,
                  and with his wonted smile wreathing the dimpled mouth, murmured "dear mamma," she
                  felt a thrill of joy and gratitude swelling her heart, for in that calm beaming
                  eye and gentle tone, she read that he would live to love and bless her.
               Again he fell into a light slumber, but the fearful crisis was past, and now the
                  sleep was sweet and refreshing.
               Mrs. Rivers breathed a prayer of thankfulness to that "High Throne from whence all
                  mercies flow," and then after replenishing the cheerless fire with the few chips
                  lying upon the hearth, again seated himself to think of the past, and study plans
                  for the darkly-shaded future.
               She was wondering why Allie stayed so late, when the door opened and with a light
                  step the sweet child bounded into the
                  room. She quickly asked her how Willie was, and being told that he was much
                  better, remarked, as she united her hood,
               "Oh! mother, would not this be a happy Christmas for us if dear father was
                  alive?"
               "Ah? my child," answered Mrs. Rivers, while the tears started to her eyes, "it was
                  God's will to take him from us, and I have tried to bow submissively, beneath his
                  rod, but I fear—I know I can never enjoy another Christmas!" and she wept wildly
                  and passionately.
               "Oh! mother, do not weep," said Allie, twining her arms around her neck; "perhaps
                  father will come back—we are not sure that he is lost; and mother, I heard
                  to-night that one man on board his ship was saved by being washed upon an island,
                  and who knows but it was papa?"
               "Did you indeed hear this, Alice? Oh! God grant that it may be my husband!" and
                  rising from her seat, Mrs. Rivers continued in a voice choked with emotion, "Oh
                  Allie, if he should come back, would we not be happy? but no, it cannot be—the
                  hope is too dear, too wild, for me to cherish!"
               "But, mother," persisted the little girl, "would it not be strange if he should
                  come to-night; this bright Christmas night? you know it is just three years this
                  morning since he left us."
               A sob was the only reply, and again the child spoke.
               "Mother, if some one should tell you that papa was yet living, and would be here
                  to-night, do you think you could bear the tidings calmly?"
               "Calmly! my child, calmly? Aye, and gratefully too; but why do you distract me
                  with these questions?"
               "Because, mother, I know that my father is living, and will be here to-night!"
               "What mean you, Allie? why, oh! why do you speak thus? surely you cannot mean what
                  you are saying!"
               Allie spoke not, but opening the door which led into a long entry, she spoke a
                  single word, and the next moment Mrs. Rivers was clasped to the heart of her
                  long-lost husband.
               Ah, reader, how shall we describe that meeting—of the husband and the wife! If you
                  are a wife, and have mourned a loved husband's loss, you may imagine it. If you
                  are a husband, and have ever grieved for a cherished wife, you can feel what we
                  would described; but, as we are neither, we must leave it, gentle reader, to your
                  own imagination.
               There was much to be told on both sides, and the gray light of morning crept
                  through the frost-covered windows-panes, ere the recitals were finished.
               As soon as it was sufficiently light, Mr. Rivers called a carriage, and his family
                  were conveyed to one of the large hotels, where they were to remain until their
                  own home should be prepared to receive them.
               Little Willie recovered rapidly, and ere many days had passed, they were
                  re-instated in their proud man- sion
                  which had been their former home, and the birthplace of their beautiful children;
                  and we can attest, there was not in our fair city, a happier household than the
                  one which gathered each more and eve, beneath the roof of the wealthy and truly
                  aristocratic Melbourne Rivers.
               The friendship which had formerly existed between Mr. Rivers and Dr. Barton, was
                  never renewed; why, the latter well knew. But the noble and kind-hearted Elton,
                  was ever welcomed most cordially to the elegant home of those whom he had
                  befriended when the blight of poverty was near.
               Many years, dear reader, have passed since the father's return. Other fair
                  children have caused the noble mansion of the Rivers' to ring with merriment, but
                  "Willie" is now a tall and handsome man, with the same glossy hair and brilliant
                  eyes which formed the charm of his father's beauty.
               And Allie, our right beautiful Allie! what of her? She, too, has grown to
                  womanhood, good and beautiful as an angel; but no longer doth she form the
                  sunshine of her early home, and the darling of her loved parents.
               Our handsome friend, the noble Elton, long since won a high reputation in a
                  Southern city, and there he built as beautiful a cage as ever echoed with the
                  sweet warblings of a sweeter bird. And to that glorious home did he carry his
                  peerless bride—his own sweet Allie; and who shall say that the happiness of the
                  gentle being is not perfect?
               Surrounded by all that can make life happy—idolized by a noble husband, and
                  cherished by a large circle of admiring friends, is she not truly blessed?
               Each successive Christmas, there is a family gathering within the stately mansion
                  of Melbourne Rivers; and thought in the midst of affluence and plenty, yet they
                  never forget that there is poverty around them. Many a suffering family has
                  learned to bless their kindness, in cheering them, not only by soothing words, but
                  by that assistance, which, with their own exertions, has placed them beyond the
                  pale of blighting poverty.
               Ah, reader, could you look in upon one of those pleasant Christmas gatherings, and
                  mark the sunny joyousness of each bright face, and hear the merry laugh and song
                  as it bursts forth from rosy lips, like silvery melody, methinks you would murmur,
                  as you turned from the glowing picture,
               "Oh! how sweet it must be to do good with what our heavenly Father has given
                  us!"
            
            
               
               BEWARE OF LOVE.
               
                  Lady, with thine eye of blue,
                  With thy heart so kind and true,
                  With thy tresses dark as even,
                  And thy soul as pure as heaven,—
                  Listen not to love's sweet tongue,
                  Leave him with love's song unsung.
               
               
                  Lady, when he comes to thee,
                  Murmuring harp-like melody,
                  Praising the beauty of thy brow,
                  Bidding thee breathe love's holy vow,
                  Thrilling thy soul with siren lay,—
                  With scornful lip, O! turn away!
               
               
                  Lady, when with eloquent tone,
                  He asketh thee to be his own,—
                  Breathes in thine ear the wild love-tale,
                  Saying that love shall never fail,—
                  O! turn away and heed him not,
                  Else thou wilt be soon forgot.
               
               
                  Lady, when he hath won thy heart,
                  He will scorn it and depart,
                  To gaze no more in thine eye of blue,
                  To care no more if thy heart be true;
                  He is cold as the stars above,—
                  Then lady! O, lady! beware of love.
               
            
            
               WOMAN'S MISSION.
               What does it all mean—this excitement about "woman's mission?" Methinks half our
                  sex must have gone crazy, stepping so boldly from the hearthstone to the rostrum!
                  Do they think it woman's mission to turn from the home-fold, seeking notoriety? Do
                  they think it woman's mission to go abroad in the wide world, trying to crowd
                  herself into the outside seat man occupies, and push him from the platform, that
                     she may be heard? No, no! the woman who would stand boldly and
                  unblushingly before the multitude, so far forgetting the delicacy which should
                  shrink from such an action, as to raise her voice against the stronger sex, should
                  drop forever the very name of woman.
               If such were woman's mission, why was she not created with man's
                  strength? why was she formed delicate and shrinking as the timid bird?
               Because such is not her mission. We find not the true woman standing
                  forth before the world; but go to the home-fireside and see her there! see the
                  smile of soul-affection lighting up her face as she welcomes him, who all through
                  the day has toiled unceasingly for her and for her children; see how quickly her
                  kindly words drive away all looks of weariness from his face, and the vexation of business from his mind;
                  watch her as she bends over the sick bed, wiping the moisture from the burning
                  brow, holding the cooling drink to the parched lips, and soothing the sick one's
                  nervous mind with sweet words of hope and cheer. How noiselessly, how tenderly she
                  arranges everything; dropping the curtain that the sunshine may not be too
                  brilliant; stepping lightly and softly that the sound may not waken the
                  sufferer.
               See her when she stands beside the erring one, stealing her soft hand in his,
                  while she gazes into his face so entreatingly, and pleads with all the eloquence
                  of her earnest heart, that he walk once more in the path of duty. Mark how the
                  tears chase each other down his cheeks, as the clasp of the gentle hand grows
                  tighter, the pleading voice more earnest! Ah! those low tones have sunk deep into
                  his wayward heart, and he inwardly resolves to go back into the world and sin no
                  more.
               The gentle pleader leaves him, but he is saved! saved through the quiet, unseen
                  influence of a meek, shrinking woman!
               See her yet once more, as she sits with her child when the hush of night makes
                  earth more beautiful. How tenderly her hand rests on the golden head of the little
                  cherub kneeling at her feet! how pure the smile that comes over her face when the
                  childish voice repeats after her, "Our Father who art in Heaven!" And then how
                  meekly she kneels by the prattler's bedside and pours forth her whole heart in
                  prayer for his future welfare. Not even when the days of childhood have gone by
                  are those hours forgotten by the golden-haired listener; many, many a time when
                  the siren voice of temptation whispers in his ear, there floats to his heart on
                  the still tide of memory, the low, sweet words of his mother's prayer, as she
                  knelt long years ago by his bedside. Ah! that mother may be an angel now, but she
                  yet holds an unseen influence over the heart of her child—an influence gained by
                  those gentle prayers she taught him when he knew no thought save innocence.
               Yes! yes! this, woman, is thy mission. To form the sunshine of the home-hearth; to
                  lighten the cares of the weary with happy smiles, to soothe the couch of suffering
                  with words of tenderness, to lead the erring back to virtue, and teach the lisping
                  tongue of childhood the sweet words of truth and holiness. Ah! truly, the Father
                  hath given thee work fitting for His angels; see to it that thou doest it well.
                  Strive not against thyself, for thou art a woman, and woman's place is home!—her
                  mission, love.
            
            
               
               THE DESERTED WIFE TO HER HUSBAND.
               
                  We meet no more; though on the hearthstone gleaming,
                  The firelight nightly sheds its quiet glow—
                  Though the long days and hours of silent dreaming,
                  Like the past hours shall swiftly come and go—
                  Though in the hall the old clock's constant chiming
                  Rings out the hour that used to bring thee home—
                  And though I list to hear thy steps approaching,
                  'T is all in vain—thou wilt not come.
               
               
                  We meet no more; we, who have passed together
                  So many hours upon life's changing tide—
                  We, who in summer days and wintry weather,
                  Have walked earth's weary pathway side by side—
                  We, who have wept in woe and smiled in gladness,
                  Have cherished each the other's hopes and fears,
                  Whose hearts have often beat with one same sadness—
                  
                     We meet no more in all the coming years!
               
               
                  We meet no more; the time hath gone forever
                  When I had power to charm thy wayward heart—
                  When I alone could soothe grief's heavy fever,
                  And bid the shadow from thy brow depart.
                  Mayhap mine eye hath lost the youthful brightness,
                  You used to say was like the starlight's gleam;
                  Mayhap my feet hath lost the bounding lightness
                  That bore me on through life's first, joyous dream.
               
               
                  We meet no more; I know not if some other
                  Hath won my former place upon thy breast,
                  If thou dost lavish now upon another,
                  The tender love that once made me so blest;
                  I only know that through the lonely evening,
                  There stands beside my own a vacant chair—
                  That when I start up from my silent dreaming
                  To meet thy gaze, thou art not there!
               
               
                  We meet no more; our home is thine no longer;
                  Thy steps have wandered from its quiet spell,
                  Though in my heart the love-beat ne'er was stronger
                  Than when I gave to thee that calm farewell.
                  Yet when Death stills life's dark and wearying pain,
                  There is another and a happier shore,
                  There shall the wife and husband meet again—
                  On earth we meet no more!
               
            
            
               
               THE MASKED STRANGER.
               
                  CHAPTER I.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              She leans beside the vault where sleeps her mother,
                              The tablet has her name upon the wall;
                              Her only parent, for she knew no other;
                              In losing whom, the orphan lost her all.
                           
                        
                        L. E. L.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              This is the deepest of our woes,
                              For this these tears our cheeks bedew;
                              This is of love the final close,
                              Oh, God, the fondest, last adieu!
                           
                        
                        BYRON.
                     
                  
                  It was a clear, beautiful night in Autumn. The pale moon flung a silver
                     radiance over the world, but her fairest beams seemed flooding the white
                     tombstones of a small churchyard in a pretty English village. There were tall
                     trees waving above those lowly graves; and as the Autumn breeze swept through
                     them, bearing the withered leaves upon its course, they seemed ever murmuring
                     in a solemn chant for the silent forms resting in dreamless slumber
                     beneath.
                  The tombstones, with the pale moonlight streaming over them, seemed like white
                     spectres guarding the sacred enclosure from intrusion. In one corner, beneath
                     the drooping branches of a willow tree, was a new-made grave. Although the
                     raised turf was fresh and green, while those around looked sere and dead, yet
                     there was a marble monument rising above the grave, telling that the duty of
                     the living to the dead had not been forgotten.
                  The monument was simple, yet beautiful, and bore the brief but impressive
                     inscription, "MY MOTHER," carved in the centre of a wreath of myrtle.
                  It was near the hour of midnight that a slight, fair form passed slowly through
                     the little churchyard gate, and made its way towards the new-made grave in the
                     corner. The form was that of a young girl, whose white dress, pale face, and
                     long, jet black tresses, almost gave the idea that she was some beautiful
                     spirit, who had chosen that quiet burial place for a midnight haunt.
                  She soon reached the little corner, and kneeling before the monument, clasped
                     her small white hands and murmured, in a sweet, but broken voice—"Oh, my
                     mother, why did you not take me with you? Why did you leave me alone in this
                     cold, bleak world? How can I breast the chilling waves of life, with no loving
                     heart beating beside me; no tender hand to lead me from temptation; no kindly
                     breast whereon to lay my poor head when my heart is weary with the weight of
                     joyless life? Oh, my mother, would that this green mound covered both our
                     forms; would that I were with thee in thy far-off home!"
                  She sank down upon the cold ground and buried her face in her hands, while the
                     fragile figure quivered with inward
                     agony. Suddenly another form stood be side the monument, a form handsome and
                     manly, and a deep, rich voice, in faltering tones, said, "Effie,—Effie
                     Norton!"
                  The weeping girl quickly raised her head, and her dark eyes fell upon a face
                     pale and haggard as her own.
                  "Ah, Tracy, why do you come to reproach me at this hour, when my heart is
                     almost broken?" she murmured, while her tears fell upon the grass beneath her
                     like shining dew. The question was unheeded by the pale intruder, and folding
                     his arms upon his proud breast, he continued,
                  "Effie Norton, where is the heart you once gave me? where is the hand you
                     placed in mine one year ago this very night, and promised that at the altar it
                     should be given me for life? Where is the love which once cheered my wayward
                     destiny as the heaven-star cheers the lone wanderer? Ay, Effie Norton, where is
                     the heart and hand which once were mine?"
                  "Oh, Tracy, Tracy, it seems unkind to distract me thus; but I cannot blame you.
                     I deserve it. The heart I gave you is yours still, and will continue to be
                     while life remains in this poor breast. But the hand, Oh! Tracy, that is
                     already another's!"
                  "Another's, Effie! another's! The hand which I have toiled for, prayed for,
                     perilled even life to win, given to another! Well, well, this is my reward, a
                     fitting one for the suffering I have passed through to gain it."
                  The low, thrilling voice ceased, and the young man leaned against the monument
                     with a face pale and cold as the marble itself, while his form trembled from
                     very agony. The fair girl raised her eyes to his face, but it was so white and
                     wore such a terrible expression of intense anguish, that she shuddered as she
                     muttered, in a half-whisper, "and I have caused this,' and starting from her
                     lowly posture, she flung her white arms around his neck, and said, in a tone of
                     frantic earnestness,
                  "Oh! Tracy, God knows how I love you; and what a dreary waste life will be
                     without the heart you once said was mine; but I had not power to stay my
                     destiny when it came bringing woe and despair. Come, sit once more beside me,
                     Tracy; here upon my sainted mother's grave, and let me tell you that my own
                     will did not break the holy vow I made to you."
                  The stern expression disappeared from the proud face of Tracy Aubrey, and his
                     large black eyes beamed softly as he seated himself beside Effie, and with her
                     little hand still clasped in his, prepared himself to listen to the explanation
                     he had sought.
                  "My mother," commenced Effie, in a low, quivering voice, "as you already know,
                     wedded, when very young, a man to whom she was devotedly attached, but whose
                     superior talents was their only resource, neither possessing any fortune. For
                     three years they struggled with poverty and suffering, and at the end of that
                     time Lord William Southingham, who had known and loved my father from his
                     boyhood, obtained for him the office of first secretary to Sir Robert Walpole—then in
                     the zenith of his power as prime minister—whose favorite he remained until his
                     death, which occurred when I was but three years of age. Through the influence
                     of Lord William, Sir Robert settled upon my mother the large annuity to which
                     my father, had he lived, would have been entitled.
                  "My mother removed to this quiet village, where she has remained, with no
                     companion save myself; and for many years I have been the idol upon whom she
                     has lavished all the fond affection of her gentle soul. I have never expressed
                     a wish which were it in her power, she has not gratified; I have never been
                     unhappy but her watchful eye has detected the cause and with sweet words and
                     kindly smile removed it. She has dearly loved me, Tracy, and fondly, devotedly,
                     was the affection returned.
                  "She cherished a strange attachment to Lord Southingham; probably the memory of
                     my father seemed linked with his kindness. He came to spend a week with us last
                     summer, and would often drive out alone with my mother, or remain for hours
                     with her in the library. One morning she came to me after her usual drive with
                     Lord William, and never shall I forget the half-pleased, half-anxious
                     expression of her countenance, when she informed me that his lordship had asked
                     my hand in marriage, and on her bended knee she begged me to accept him. Yes,
                     Tracy, my mother knelt at my feet, and implored me, if I loved her, if I
                     cherished the memory of my lost father, to accept Lord Southingham."
                  "And you did!" said Aubrey, bitterly.
                  "Nay, Tracy, I did not, and my mother left me with a pale, haggard cheek, and
                     faltering step, while I threw myself upon a couch, weeping with agony that I
                     had refused the first request my mother had ever made.
                  "The painful subject was not mentioned again; but as the Summer days passed by,
                     my mother's face grew pale and thin, and her sweet gentle smile, changed to a
                     look of mournful sadness, which went to my heart like a living reproach. I
                     watched her form grow more shadow-like, and her cheerful step slow and
                     unsteady. Even her dark, glossy hair, became threaded with silver, and her
                     eyes, with their sad, reproachful expression, often glistened with unshed
                     tears. Oh! how bitterly did I repent sacrificing her happiness for my own, when
                     I saw my angel mother laid upon a sick couch, with Death written upon her sweet
                     face, and pale, cold hands. Then came the thought that I had repaid all her
                     tenderness, all her love and care, with disobedience. And when she called me to
                     her bedside, and with tears dimming her eyes and the flush of death upon her
                     cheek, begged me once again to grant her only request; to soothe her dying
                     pillow by gratifying the wish she had for years cherished, and the fulfilment
                     of which she had looked forward to as the solace of future years, even of
                     death; then I acceded to her request. I wedded Lord Southingham, and when the
                     painful rites were ended, and I knelt beside her couch once more, the heavenly smile she gave me, as she
                     laid her death-cold hand upon my head in blessing, repaid me for the lifetime
                     of misery I knew would follow. Do you still reproach me, Tracy?"
                  "No, no, Effie, I only love you more for the sacrifice. But, oh! Effie, I have
                     lived so long in the light of your dear smile; I have labored so earnestly, and
                     deemed one sweet word from you a blessed recompense for every sorrow; I have
                     loved you so wildly, so deeply, that to lose you forever—to know that another
                     has won the jewel I have toiled and prayed for, seems more bitter even than
                     death!"
                  "Do you forget that I too must suffer; that a cold, chilling blight has fallen
                     upon my heart, crushing all its youthful dreams, and filling its future with
                     weariness and woe? Do you forget that I cannot be happy without your love? That
                     my heart must wear the black seal of misery though life; do you forget all
                     this, Tracy?"
                  "Ah, no Effie, I do not forget. Ours is a wayward destiny, and we were both
                     born to suffer. In your proud home you will yet be happy, and I will hover near
                     you—for I could not live in air that was not breathed by you. I will be ever
                     near you, Effie, though you know it not; and tenderly, though silently, will I
                     watch that beloved brow, that no dark shadow may rest upon it. But have you no
                     token for me, no gift that I may gaze upon in the still hour of midnight, and
                     dreams of the love that was once mine?"
                  Effie withdrew her hand from the once which clasped it, and turning her head
                     towards the little corner, her eyes fell upon a rose-bush upon which still
                     bloomed, like an emblem of the constancy, a single white rose. With a small
                     pearl knife, she severed a glossy curl from the luxuriant tresses clustering
                     around her white brow, and plucking the rose, she pressed it to her rosy lips,
                     and then placed it, with the ringlet, in the hand of her lover.
                  "And now, Tracy," she said, in a voice choked with anguish, "we must meet no
                     more. The duty I owe him who is now my husband, and the promise I made to her
                     who slumbers beneath us, must be kept sacred, even though the sacrifice be
                     life. But, Tracy," and the heavenly light which shone in the dark lustrous
                     eyes, made her seem like some sweet angel—"we shall meet in a brighter world,
                     and there our union shall not be broken. Leave me now; let me be alone by this
                     dear grave once more, that I may prepare my weary heart to struggle calmly in
                     the cold, proud world."
                  Aubrey spoke not, but his manly arm for an instant encircled the slender form
                     beside him, and bending low, he pressed his lips upon the fair brow upraised to
                     his face, and murmured, in a low, broken voice—"Farewell, Effie; may the angels
                     of Heaven hover near you that no shadow may darken the sunlight of your
                     life!"
                  Another instant, and Effie Norton was alone in the churchyard.
                  Alone in the churchyard at the hour of midnight! Alone with the silent dead.
                     The white tombstones rising from the lowly graves like the shrouded forms be neath them—the trees sighing, with
                     their slow moving boughs, a low, constant requiem—the withered leaves rustling
                     with a sound like that which startles the very soul when the cold earth falls
                     upon the coffin—the sad Autumn breeze echoing back each moan of sorrow—the
                     silver stars gazing in pity upon the pale, suffering mourner!
                  Ah! what an hour was that to the young, tender heart of Effie Norton, as she
                     knelt there, by her mother's grave, with her white hands clasped tightly
                     together, and her tearful eyes fixed vacantly upon the green turf. Memory, with
                     her white robes, came gliding near her with her magic wand, recalling scenes
                     which had slumbered in her heart's quiet calls, and awakening sweet dreams she
                     had deemed crushed forever.
                  She knelt there, till the waning stars warned her that day was near, and then,
                     leaning her head upon the turf, she breathed a farewell prayer, pressed her
                     lips once more upon the white, cold marble, and dashing the tears from her
                     eyes, hurried from the churchyard.
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Yet, ere that moon was old, we saw the Donna Julia ride
                              Gay on her snowy palfrey, as Dona Alonzo's bride;
                              The bride was young and beautiful, the bridegroom stern and
                                 old,—
                              But the silken rein was hung with pearls, the housings bright with
                                 gold.
                           
                        
                        L. E. LANDON.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           It is the mind ill at ease that seeks for excitement.
                        
                        ETHEL CHURCHILL.
                     
                  
                  It was a gay evening in Southingham Hall. Rich music floated through the
                     spacious rooms, and the flood of light from alabaster lamps was rivalled only
                     by the light from starry eyes.
                  It was the first fete given by Lady Southingham, and all the nobility were
                     presented to honor it. There were many beautiful ladies there, whose high rank
                     and glowing charms had won the admiration of the million; but yet, amid all
                     that bright array of beauty, the brilliant hostess had no rival. The
                     magnificent diamonds she wore might have purchased a crown, or filled a hundred
                     homes with luxury and comfort; but they grew dim in the light of her dark,
                     flashing eyes. Her white brow looked strangely pure, contrasted with the
                     shining mass of jet black tresses, which, contrary to the fashion of the day,
                     were allowed to fall loosely over the neck and shoulders, with no ornament,
                     save a wreath of delicate flowers, fastened by a single superb diamond.
                  As she moved from group to group, with queen-like grace, the light word and
                     silver laugh flowing from her lip with such seeming joyousness, one would
                     scarcely have recognized the pale, fragile mourner of the little village
                     churchyard.
                  But one who looked deeper than mere outward appearance, could easily perceive
                     that the inward spirit was restless and unhappy, though striving to appear
                     cheerful and gay. Those beautiful eyes, though they sparkled, were sometimes
                     fixed on vacancy, with that peculiar stare which tells that the mind is
                     wandering far away—living again amid former scenes. The tones of that sweet voice were sometimes low and
                     sad, and the light, careless laugh checked suddenly, as if the eye beheld a
                     shadowing vision. And what was that silvery laugh as it came from those coral
                     lips when she moved amid the glittering throng of gaiety and fashion? A vain,
                     taunting mockery to the radiant smile which lighted the peerless features!
                  But Lady Southingham was idolized by her lordly husband, who, though many years
                     her senior, mistook her subdued gentleness for love. He never thought that
                     another could have won those young affections; he never heard, in the music
                     tones of that sweet voice, the mournful strain; he never marked the wandering,
                     restless glance of those thrilling eyes; no, no, Lord William Southingham had
                     never studied the strange character of woman, and he could not see that though
                     his young wife was obedient and gentle, yet her heart, even when by his side,
                     was far away.
                  As the mistress of the noble house of Southingham, Lady Effie was courted and
                     admired; but as the reigning beauty, she was petted, caressed and flattered.
                     Her wondrous beauty was the subject of many a glowing sonnet, and many a
                     sparkling toast rang with praise of her loveliness.
                  Flattery was poured into her ear, and the compliment was given alike in toast
                     and song. Not alone by the brainless fop was her society courted and her beauty
                     praised, but the high and wise acknowledged the witching fascination of the
                     gentle belle, and bent low at her peerless shrine. And was the young countess
                     unaffected by all this homage? Oh! no; her heart, gentle and sad as it was, was
                     human; and where is the human heart entirely insensible to the voice of
                     adulation?
                  And so Lady Southingham sought, in pleasure and excitement, the forgetfulness
                     which solitude could not bring. Her form was the proudest at the courtly fete,
                     her step the lightest at the midnight ball, and her wit the most sparkling at
                     the banquet. Her vanity—the vanity which characterizes every human breast,
                     whether great or low—was pleased and flattered with the praise bestowed upon
                     her. Her heart, strewn with the withered flowers of blighted hope, dared not
                     rely upon its own sweet meditations for the quiet peace and happiness it sought
                     so vainly; so she turned to the glittering world for the enjoyment—happiness it
                     could not be.
                  She strove to bury her misery in the giddy pleasures of society, concealing its
                     bitterness beneath the brilliant flow of sparkling wit. But the restless eye;
                     the strange coldness in the music-like laughter; the startling gaiety of the
                     fascinating manner; the deep shade of the forgetfulness which now and then
                     flittered over the radiant smile, and the sarcastic keenness of her ready wit,
                     revealed to a close observer that the heart of the proud and envied countess
                     knew not the sunny spell of free and native happiness.
                  As we have before mentioned, this was the first entertainment Lady Southingham
                     had given, and she enjoyed the satisfaction—as Lady Stanley remarked, when
                        she bade her beautiful friend
                     good-night—of seeming nearly all the world in her own stately
                     drawing-rooms.
                  But the glowing hours flew swiftly by, and the fete was over.
                  Alone in her fairy-like dressing-room was Lady Effie. The velvet robe she had
                     worn was laid aside, and a silken wrapper flung carelessly around her stately
                     form. The wreath still nested among the jetty tresses, but its flowers were
                     faded and dead, and seemed mocking, with their blighted leaves, the brilliancy
                     of the diamond that flashed amid them. The smile she had worn, like a mask,
                     when in the midst of that gay crowd, had faded from the lovely face, and its
                     radiance was succeeded by an expression as sad and gentle as was the former
                     proud and brilliant. The cheek, flushed with excitement but a few hours ago,
                     was strangely pale, and she sunk from very weariness into a fauteuil beside her
                     mirror.
                  It was a sweet place—that luxurious dressing-room; a fitting nest for a bearing
                     so fair and delicate as the youthful Lady Effie. There were rare exotics making
                     the air heavy with perfume; there was superb statuary, reflected in then
                     polished mirrors with that faint, indistinct outline which reminds one of the
                     shadows of a summer twilight; there were jewels of princely value scattered in
                     careless profusion over the ebony toilet-table, and shining like golden stars
                     in the soft light of the little antique lamp; and there was an easy air of
                     highbred luxury from the very pictures on the wall to the delicious chocolate
                     streaming so invitingly in its rich China cup upon the stand.
                  But the dark eyes of the young countess rested not upon the luxury around her.
                     The apartment was very warm and the casement flung open. The light silken
                     curtains were drawn aside and the beautiful stars seemed gazing in upon the
                     pale, sad face, upraised to their pitying light.
                  And where was the heart of Effie Southingham as she sat gazing upon those
                     kindly stars? The heavy curtains of the past were swept aside by the magic wand
                     of memory, and the young heart of the beautiful woman was far away in the
                     little village where her girlhood was passed, nestling by that quiet grave in
                     the lone churchyard! She was living over again the house she knelt upon that
                     hallowed sod, with her white cheek pressed against the cold marble, and her
                     warm tears mingling with the shining night-dew. All the splendor she had seen
                     since she became the mistress of that proud home, all the homage she had
                     received from the gay, glittering world, was forgotten in the sweet, painful
                     dream of the past.
                  Instead of the low whisper of adulation, she heard the gentle tones of her
                     angel mother. In place of jewelled splendor she saw a plain, white monument,
                     with a tall tree drooping over it. Even the low rustling of the withered
                     leaves, and the sighing of the autumn wind, seemed lingering on her ear and
                     echoing in her heart.
                  She saw again the pale, proud face of Tracy Aubrey, as she pressed his cold
                     temple against the white headstone. She sat once more upon that mounded
                        grave, with her trembling hand
                     clasped in his, and his dark, soul-speaking eyes fixed upon her face. She
                     remembered how that manly form shook with emotion as she bent low to press upon
                     her brow the last fond kiss of blighted love, and in imagination, she felt
                     those cold, quivering lips, as, for an instant, they touched her forehead. She
                     heard that whispered blessing, and felt again the frantic woe which thrilled
                     her, when the last faint echo of that low farewell died away upon the midnight,
                     wafted onward by the autumn breeze.
                  She covered her face with her hands and shudderingly strove to shut out the
                     painful picture, but it became more and more vivid, and she swept as bitterly
                     as on that starry night when she bade farewell to the lonely grave where slept
                     her sainted mother. But suddenly she raised her face from her hands and gazed
                     earnestly towards the window. Surely she heard the leaves rustle beneath the
                     light balcony. Again she heard the same slight rustling, and a moment after, a
                     low, sweet melody upon the night air. Lady Effie had heard the light strings of
                     the guitar swept in the festal hall and in the calm moonlight, but she knew no
                     hand, save one, to move them thus.
                  The silvery prelude was ended, and a rich, thrilling voice mingled with the
                     music notes. The cheek of the lady grew yet paler, and her dark eyes more
                     brilliant, as she listened, with clasped hands and throbbing temples, to the
                     low words of that deep voice, as it sang in strangely sweet, yet mournful tones,
                        
                           "I have roamed afar in stranger lands,
                           I have roamed across the sea,
                           But my blighted heart, like a weary bird,
                           Returneth still to thee.
                           I have stood beside the beautiful.
                           Who moved in courtly pride,
                           But still, as in a midnight dream,
                           I lingered at thy side.
                        
                        
                           "I have mingled in the lighted hall,
                           With the gifted and the gay,
                           And though beauty's spell was round me,
                           Yet my heart was far away.
                           I thought upon the hour I sat
                           Within the church-yard lone,
                           And I heard again the sad farewell
                           Of a low and gentle tone.
                        
                        
                           "There's a shining tress of raven hair,
                           Resting in sweet repose,
                           Above the heart that weareth still
                           A white and faded rose.
                           I wear them as the emblems
                           Of a love that once was mine,
                           For the heart that beasts beneath them
                           Still worships at thy shrine.
                        
                        
                           "When kindly stars are beaming
                           From out the silvery sky,
                           And the soft wind murmurs sadly,
                           As it passes gently by;
                           May memory glide beside thee
                           With dreams of other days,
                           And charm thee like the melody
                           Of low and witching lays.
                        
                        
                        
                           "May the dream she wakes be sweet, as when
                           It first was dreamed by thee;
                           May it wake a thought of pity,
                           And a tender sigh for me.
                           Oh! fare-thee-well, my Effie,
                           May the wind that murmurs free,
                           Bear to you Heaven the blessing
                           That I'm murmuring for thee."
                        
                     
                  
                  And did Lady Southingham remember the thrilling voice of that manly singer? Ah,
                     yes, too well, and was moving towards the balcony when the light footstep was
                     suddenly stayed. The cheek, which a moment before was pale as the snowy hand,
                     was crimsoned with a flush of shame, and muttering, half aloud, "My God, what
                     am I doing?" she sank upon a couch and buried her face in its silken
                     cushions.
                  Though she did not love her husband, yet she respected him, and her high and
                     noble sense of honor was shocked that she should allow even her thoughts to
                     rest upon another.
                  Long and bitterly did she weep, till, wearied and, faint, she sank into a deep
                     slumber, forgeting alike her throbbing temples and aching heart.
                  Slowly and coldly paled the white stars, and soon, in place of silver
                     moonlight, the rosy beams of the morning sun came dancing in through that
                     draperied window, gilding picture and jewel with a golden tinge. But the
                     sunlight fell upon no fairer object of beauty than the pale, classic face of
                     the gentle sleeper, who lay, with her small hands still clasped together, and
                     her raven hair pushed back from her white brow. She was wearied and worn out,
                     and it was many hours ere she awoke; and when at length the silken lashes were
                     raised from the marble cheek, the large eyes fell upon the face of her husband,
                     who sat beside her, holding one small hand and gazing tenderly upon the
                     beautiful face before him.
                  Lord William had been a very handsome man in the chivalrous days of his early
                     manhood, and even now, though the dark curling hair was turned to silver-gray,
                     and the high brow marked with many a deep line, his form was still unbent and
                     manly. The expression of his face was usually stern and somewhat haughty; but
                     it was wreathed with a smile of love and pride, as he smoothed back the rich
                     tresses from the brow of his young wife, and said, in a tone of singular
                     sweetness:
                  "I feared you were ill, my sweet wife, you looked so pale and weary; but that
                     bright glance and gentle smile tell me I need not fear the fading of so fair a
                     flower. Here is a note from Lady Stanley; you were sleeping so sweetly, that I
                     gave orders not to have you wakened, so I opened the note myself, as it
                     required an answer, and being an invitation to a moonlight sail on the Thames,
                     I sent word that as I have a little romantic passion for moonlight and water, I
                     should try and accompany you."
                  Lady Effie thanked him with so sweet a smile and tone that he felt more than
                     repaid for his care and tenderness.
                  
                  Thus passed the time at Southingham Hall. Its lordly master grew each day more
                     fond of his young and lovely wife, and, as she moved beside him, smoothing with
                     her soft, fair hand, the silver locks which clustered thinly around his
                     temples, or read to him form some favorite author, he felt that he was indeed
                     blessed, and everything which human love could suggest was ordered for the
                     happiness of her who was the solace of his life.
                  Fetes were given and banquets attended. Lord William was proud of the homage
                     and flattery his noble lady received from the high and gifted, and his heart
                     would thrill, when he thought that the beautiful queen of the festive train,
                     the brilliant star whose radiant beams eclipsed all others, was his own.
                  He saw her, day after day, the same gay, gentle being; he marked the brilliancy
                     of the sparkling eye, and the lightness of the echoing laugh, when the admiring
                     crowd thronged around her with smiles and praises; he felt the light touch of
                     her graceful hand upon his forehead; he heard the sweet tones of her voice
                     ringing in the witching song; he looked not beyond the sunny smile which
                     wreathed both lip and brow, and so he thought her happy. Ah! well is it for us
                     that we known not the bitterness which oft-times rankles in the heart of the
                     loved one, when the beaming eye sparkles most brilliantly, and the light laugh
                     echoes its gayest strain of joyousness! Did we know that keen misery caused
                     that unwonted sparkle; that the gay laugh was but a hollow mockery to an aching
                     heart; that the sunny smile was the mask that covered the unshed tears of human
                     woe, how quickly would the merry jest change to the word of sympathy, the light
                     beating heart throb with the pain of pitying sorrow.
                  One bright sunshiny morning, Lady Southingham sat alone in her boudoir, when
                     the door opened, and her friend, Lady Stanley, was announced.
                  "Why, how well you are looking, my dear," she exclaimed, in her usual lively
                     tone; "I believe that pretty dressing-gown becomes you even more than the
                     festal robe! But do you not anticipated a fine time at Lady Montague's fete?
                     you know it is so seldom, now-a-days, that we are enlivened by a masked
                     ball."
                  "Ah, yes," replied Lady Effie, "I have already chosen my costume, and am
                     waiting most patiently for the expected evening; but do you know we leave town
                     immediately after the ball? Lord Southingham is in delicate health, and we hope
                     the fresh air of the country will restore him."
                  "Leave town after the ball!" said Lady Stanley; "why, how very provoking; only
                     think how we shall miss you; I wish his lordship would contrive to postpone his
                     illness until a more convenient season. But I must be at home; I have not yet
                     ordered my costume. So adieu, sweet one, till we greet each other from our
                     masks, for you need not flatter yourself one can mistake that queenly step and
                     dainty form, even though the domino folds shroud the fair outline!"
                  
                  Again Lady Effie was alone, and fearing that she might be interrupted before
                     her usual hour of reading to Lord William, she went directly to the library,
                     where his lordship was already awaiting her. He looked unusually pale, and his
                     eyes were dark and heavy; but there was no quiver in the rich voice as he bade
                     his young wife a merry "good-morning," and led her to a seat beside the open
                     window, where the sweet warbling of birds and the perfume of roses were borne
                     into the apartment on the same gentle breeze.
                  It was the night of Lady Montague's fete. In her pretty dressing-room Lady
                     Southingham still lingered, as if unwilling to leave so sweet a spot. Her
                     costume was very rich, though somewhat fantastic. She wore no jewels save those
                     which glistened amid the heavy black tresses, and the single diamond shining on
                     the tiny clasp of each small slipper. Lord William was too ill to accompany
                     her, and yet he insisted upon her attending.
                  Standing before her mirror, with one fair hand pressed upon the white brow, and
                     the other clasping a bouquet of withered flowers, she seemed lost in a dream of
                     the past, and although gazing upon the beautiful face reflected upon the glass,
                     she did not seem to notice the restless glance of the black eyes, nor the deep
                     crimson which burned upon the hot cheek. But she stood there, gazing vacantly
                     upon her own sweet face, seemingly unconscious that the hour was swiftly
                     passing.
                  Suddenly she moved towards a stand, and, opening a small billet, read, in a
                     half whisper, half mutter:—"If Lady Southingham cherishes the memory of by-gone
                     years; if her heart still treasures a thought of him to whom her early vows
                     were plighted, she will wear to-night, as a token of that memory, a faded
                        rose!"
                  Crushing the note in her hand, she paced the room nervously, while the flush
                     which paled and deepened on her cheek told how bitter was the struggle between
                     love and duty.
                  "Oh! my God," she murmured, "why do I hesitate, when my own heart tells me 't
                     will be wrong? I will not waver longer; I will remember the duty I owe him
                     whose kindness I am so unworthy of. But yet, it can do no harm—perhaps he did
                     not write the note, and—and—no, no, it cannot be wrong. I will wear it!"
                  A step approached the door of her dressing room, and half frantic from
                     excitement, she sprang to the mirror, selected a withered rose from the bouquet
                     she held, and placed it in her raven hair, with its white leaves nestling
                     beside a brilliant diamond. How strange the contrast—a radiant gem and a
                        faded rose! but they nestled together like the emblem of Life and
                     Death, each a strange mockery to the other.
                  For the third time, Lady Effie's maid entered the apartment to remind her
                     mistress of the lateness of the hour; and as she fastened her mask, she noticed
                     the excited gleam of her eyes and the trembling of the small hands, but Lady
                     Effie assured her that it was
                     nothing, and flinging her domino over her shoulders, she was soon on her way to
                     the scene of festivity, with a brow which throbbed with pain, and a heart
                     beating with the consciousness of deviating from the duty she owed to him to
                     whom her bridal vows were plighted.
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  
                     
                        
                           Gaily the makers thronged the hall
                           Where glittered the light of the festival;
                           Many a lordly knight was there;
                           Many a lady proud and fair;
                           But one, there was who stood aside
                           From the train that moved in festal pride;
                           And eyes which beamed, like jewels bright,
                           In wonder gazed on that stranger knight.
                        
                     
                  
                  It was a brilliant scene—that gay masquerade. There was the stately princess in
                     her robes of royalty; the delicate nun with the long dark veil falling round
                     her like a shadow; the Spanish lady coquetting with her richly-carved fan; the
                     graceful Hindoo, the pretty peasant, the gorgeously attried Sultana, and the
                     charming little maid of honor. Every nation, almost every grade, was there
                     represented. There were Persians, and Spaniards, and Italians; gloomy-looking
                     friars, gaily-dressed knights, ferocious bandits and lordly nobles; princesses
                     and flower-girls; the imperial robe beside the gipsy mantle; the gay plumes of
                     the dashing cavalier waving by the dark veil of a pensive sister of
                     charity.
                  There was that strange mixture of the grotesque and the serious, the grave and
                     the gay, the artificial and the real, which is seen only at the masked ball.
                     But one there was among that motley crowd who, though he avoided all
                     intercourse with the gay assembly, was yet the unconscious "lion" of the
                     fete.
                  He wore the dress of a Roman; and though his cloak was drawn closely around
                     him, yet it could not conceal the stately proportions of a most noble form. He
                     conversed with no one, and if any ventured to address a passing remark, it was
                     answered in the same brief, yet courteous manner. His rich and singular costume
                     would alone have excited the admiration of the throng; but the strangeness of
                     his manners, the cold, hauteur which repelled
                     every attempt towards drawing him into conversation, at once wove around him
                     the spell of mystery, and at the same time set curiosity astir.
                  There were many conjectures as to who he might be. Some thought he was the
                     famous bandit chieftain; some, the great poet of the age; and others even went
                     so far as to assert for a fact, that he was the king. But curiosity was, for
                     once—as it should be ever—unsatisfied. They saw a noble figure, whose graceful
                     stateliness admirably personated kingly dignity—large, black, flashing eyes,
                     whose thrilling brilliancy seemed to speak the poet's soul—and the mysterious
                     air which might infer the polished outlaw. But the face was hidden from the
                     inquisitive gaze, and none there were who recognized the proud carriage of the fine head
                     and the regal firmness of the courtly step.
                  He paid not the slightest attention to the gay costumes around him, but his
                     handsome eyes wandered restlessly over the gathered assembly of grace and
                     beauty, as if searching for some object of intense interest to him alone. If a
                     group of maskers wandered near the spot where he stood, he would draw his
                     graceful cloak around him, as if it were an imperial garment, and himself the
                     monarch whose sceptre swayed the world, and moving away, seek some shadowed
                     recess, whose silken curtains partially concealed him from the crowd. Thus was
                     the curiosity of the gay masqueraders continually baffled. They could not
                     obtain the slightest glimpse of his face, and though many sought, none learned
                     the haughty stranger's name.
                  "Ah, dearest Lady Southingham," cried the sprightly Lady Stanley, approaching
                     the spot where the young countess was standing, a few moments after her
                     arrival, "did I not say we should meet to-night? But do you known we are all
                     dying with curiosity to learn whether yonder stranger be an eccentric prince or
                     a wandering minstrel? There is so much majesty in his courtly air, and such an
                     expression of soul in his bright eyes, that all the ladies are in love with
                     him—out of pure romance, you know! But let us walk past him and see if we
                     cannot get a glimpse of his features, for I know they must be gloriously
                     handsome."
                  And placing her arm in that of Lady Southingham, they sauntered carelessly
                     towards the column against which the proud stranger leaned. His arms were
                     folded upon his breast, and his ample cloak, being unclasped, had fallen back
                     upon his shoulders. As the two ladies passed the column, his dark eyes rested
                     for a moment upon the glossy tresses of the fair countess, and he started so
                     suddenly that the cloak fell, discovering to many curious eyes, his rich and
                     imposing costume. He gazed for a moment after the fair form of the queenly
                     beauty, and then, as if recollecting himself, hastily replaced the cloak and
                     moved away to a distant part of the room.
                  "You don't suppose we frightened him, do you?" said Lady Stanley, with a merry
                     laugh. "But really, I think he must be some noble prince, who, like every
                     gallant knight, pays court alone to our fair queen of beauty, and for the sake
                     of romance, chooses to woo in disguise. Well, well, I must say he possesses an
                     admirable knowledge of human nature, to have learned thus early that mystery is
                     the very witchery of love; for indeed, were that charm lost, love would soon
                     lose every other sweet."
                  The weary heart of Lady Southingham could not sympathize with the light gaiety
                     of the festive train; so when Lady Stanley joined a merry group, she quietly
                     left the lighted hall, and seeking the balcony, gave herself up to the reverie
                     which had stolen over her.
                  The damask curtains swept over the open window which led out upon the balcony,
                     concealing the form of the gentle
                     countess from the crowd within. The pale moonlight, the golden stars, and the
                     sweet, fresh air, heavy with the perfume of roses, seemed weaving around the
                     young heart of Lady Southingham, a dream like those of earlier and happier
                     days.
                  She leaned her head upon the balustrade, and the rich waves of shining-black
                     tresses swept over the soft cheeks and small white hands. Before her reposed,
                     Heaven-like, nature in its holy loveliness. Behind her was the world—the cold,
                     weary world! deceitful as its own siren festivity—full of mockery as the gay
                     laugh which stifles the moan of a breaking heart.
                  Beside her stood memory's unseen form, waving her white wand over that bowed
                     head. The almost living picture of the past, which, at the summons of that
                     mystic wand, shut out the lifeless picture of the present, glided like a weird
                     phantom before the inward vision of the dreaming lady.
                  She thought how few short years ago she was a merry-hearted girl, passing away
                     the fleet hour with the birds and roses in an unassuming village. Now she was a
                     titled beauty, flattered, caressed, and envied; wearing the outward semblance
                     of joyousness—bearing the inward blight of crushed affections. A shining tear
                     started to her eye and fell upon the folded hands, when she was startled by a
                     light footstep. As she raised her head to ascertain who was the intruder, the
                     crimson curtain parted, and in another instant the noble form of the masked
                     stranger stood beside her.
                  As the lovely countess had removed her mask, she was somewhat startled and was
                     about to leave the balcony, when a sweet voice murmured, "Effie, dearest Effie,
                     can it be you have forgotten me?"
                  A cloud for an instant obscured the moon, and when it had passed away, the
                     proud stranger was kneeling at the feet of Lady Southingham. The mask was
                     removed, and the clear, cold moonlight shone full upon the handsome face of
                     TRACY AUBREY!
                  "May God bless you, my own Effie," he said, in the same low, thrilling tone,
                     "for wearing that faded rose, to-night. I should have known that form in any
                     garb, but the signal flower assured me that the memory of other days is still
                     kept within thy heart, though the gay world would fain have dimmed it with its
                     siren splendor."
                  He drew the passive hand within his own, and the glossy head of the young
                     countess was the next moment nestling upon his manly breast. The world, her
                     husband, and her high station were alike forgotten in the wild happiness of
                     that meeting. She was young, passionate, and impulsive. She loved Tracy Aubrey
                     as few women are capable of loving, and it were strange, indeed, if she did not
                     meet him with a thrill of rapture which even the white-robed angels might have
                     forgiven.
                  "Do you remember the farewell in the still churchyard, darling?" he whispered.
                     "I have been ever near the since that dark hour. I have marked the restless glance which sought an
                     unseen form, and the unconscious sigh which told that even when the whisper of
                     adulation was floating by, the heart was listening to a silent voice. I have
                     sought this interview, not as the dependent Tracy Aubrey, but as one whose
                     wealth and title equals thine own. And we have met again, sweet Effie; may we
                     not be happy? may we not love fondly as before?"
                  Lady Effie did not answer, and as Aubrey pressed the hand he held, be bent his
                     proud head and touched his lips to the marble brow. Quick as thought the
                     countess sprang from his arms, and stood trembling with indignation before him.
                     That burning kiss had awakened her to a sense of her position, and her voice
                     quivered with emotion as she said, in a tone of despair:—
                  "And is it possible that I can thus betray the trust of him whose honor should
                     be held sacred? Is it possible that I have listened to words of love from
                     another? that I have forgotten the dying blessing of my angel mother—even my
                     own unsullied honor? Oh! Tracy, Tracy, may God forgive thee for this
                     interview."
                  As she flung aside the sweeping drapery from the window, and with the step of
                     an injured empress sought the festive hall, she heard the wild tones of Aubrey,
                     as he said:—
                  "Oh! Effie, I pray you do not leave me thus. Speak but one word and tell me I
                     am forgiven—but a single word, Effie, and we will meet no more!"
                  But the passionate voice and the wild prayer were alike unheeded. She swept on
                     with a still prouder step, and Aubrey murmured, as he sprang from the balcony
                     to the dew-stained earth beneath,—"'Tis well; I can but love her more for her
                     noble spirit!"
                  Lady Southingham was alone in her boudoir, whither she had immediately gone on
                     her return from the masquerade.
                  Her face was wan and haggard, and every limb trembled like the aspen leaf. She
                     was miserable; nay, wretched. She had humbled her own lofty pride, and the very
                     thought of listening to words of affection, even from her early love, when her
                     vows of constancy and faithfulness were so solemnly plighted to another,
                     appalled her sensitive heart and filled it with the frenzied anguish of
                     reproach.
                  Had her husband been unkind, or denied the love and sympathy which was her due,
                     she would not have been thus affected. But he had ever treated her most kindly,
                     and the tender gentleness of his manner told how deep and fond was the love he
                     lavished upon her.
                  Her hands were dry and hot as if burning with fever; and as she pressed them
                     upon her pale temples, she could feel the flying pulse throb wild and rapidly.
                     But quick as was the hot pulse, it did not beat so wildly as the woe-filled
                     heart.
                  She flung herself upon a couch, and sought the slumber which brings
                     forgetfulness and peace to the excited mind, but the feverish agony which
                     caused that excite- ment kept sleep
                     at a distance, and burying her face in the yielding cushions, her over-burdened
                     heart gave vent to the passionate tears which would else have burst it; tears
                     which were the sweetest luxury of the weary mind.
                  "Oh! my lady," cried the countess' maid, throwing open the door of the boudoir,
                     "do go directly to his lordship's room—we fear he is dying. He was in the
                     library most all night, and as one of the servants was passing the door, he was
                     startled by a heavy fall; and, on going in, he discovered that his lordship had
                     fainted. They carried him to his dressing-room, but oh! my lady, he is so pale
                     and faint—and he asks only for you; do go to him, for I know he must be going
                     to die!"
                  Dizzy from weeping and thoroughly alarmed, Lady Southingham hurried to her
                     husband's apartment. As she flung open the door, he was reclining in his large
                     arm-chair, and his face, so wan, so ashy white, looked even paler in contrast
                     to the rich crimson of his damask dressing-gown.
                  As his young and beautiful wife sprang towards him, he met the anxious glance
                     of her dark eyes with a look so full of love and pleasure, that she started
                     with an indefinable fear: for plainer even than the look of love, in that
                     pallid face, she saw the ghastly shade of Death.
                  The wild tears burst forth afresh when she stood beside him, and marked the
                     unearthly glare in his sunken eyes, and the strange hollow tone in which he
                     faintly whispered, as he drew her nearer to his heart:—
                  "God bless you, my own one. You have been the light of my life, and now you
                     have come to soothe, with your angel presence, my dying hour. I have ever
                     prayed that I might die upon your breast, and that your sweet voice might drive
                     away the fear which ever fills the human soul when pale Death comes. My
                     life-prayer is answered, and I die happy. May God bless you, my angel
                     wife!"
                  He strained her for an instant to his almost pulseless breast, and pressed a
                     cold kiss upon her pale brow, and, with a fond blessing yet lingering on his
                     lip, sank back motionless in his chair. Lady Effie knelt down by him and took
                     one marble hand in hers, but its icy coldness startled her, and she gazed upon
                     his face. The heavy eyelids were closed, and there was a dark, pallid line
                     settled beneath them. The chin had fallen and the whole face looked ghastly in
                     its unearthly paleness. The frightened countess murmured his name, but the
                     sealed lips gave back no answer; Lord Southingham was dead!
                  A week had passed by. The world had seen the noble form of Lord William
                     Southingham laid in the stately vault where reposed the ashes of his titled
                     ancestors. They had seen his beautiful widow dressed in the grab of mourning;
                     they had marked the sincere grief with which she mourned her loudly husband's
                     death. They missed the silver tone and the queenly form of the brilliant beauty
                     from the festal hall, for Lady Southingham had withdrawn from the gay world to
                     the sweet solitude of retirement.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Life may change, but it may fly not;
                              Hope may vanish, yet can die not;
                              Truth be veiled, but still it burneth;
                              Love repulsed, but it returneth.
                           
                        
                        SHELLEY.
                     
                  
                  Two years had passed since the lovely Lady Southingham withdrew from the gay
                     life of the London world. It was again autumn—just such a night as that on
                     which she bade farewell to her mother's grave. The bright moon was shining down
                     upon that little churchyard, and its pale beams silvered the white headstones.
                     The same willow tree waved its sighing boughs above the simple monument in the
                     corner, moaning ever the same low dirge.
                  It was near midnight, when the little wicket was hastily pushed open, and a
                     lady, richly attired and unattended, hurried across the churchyard towards the
                     corner.
                  Few would have recognized in that stately lady, with her proud step and
                     glorious beauty, the wan, sorrow-stricken Effie Norton, who crossed the same
                     churchyard five years ago that very night. But when she reached the monument,
                     and flung herself on her knees before it, her travelling hat became unclasped
                     and fell from her head; and if the reader had looked on the beautiful face
                     which the silver moonbeams shone upon, he would immediately have recognized the
                     lovely features of Lady Southingham.
                  The two lonely years of her widowhood had been passed far from her London home
                     and that loved village of her childish years; far, far away, amid solitude and
                     retirement. She had just returned to the village for the purpose of visiting
                     her mother's grave, and too impatient to wait for day, she had stolen from the
                     pretty cottage of her hostess, and wended her way alone towards the spot she
                     held almost too sacred to visit, when the cold eyes of strangers could witness
                     her emotion.
                  She was almost overcome when she knelt once more beside that lowly grave, and a
                     tide of sweet and painful memories came rushing like waves upon her mind.
                  Oh! how strange a thing is this still memory, coming so noiselessly at the
                     midnight hour, when the lone spell of silence rests over the slumbering world,
                     awakening, with a mystic power, such wild, weird fancies—calling grim phantoms
                     from the heart's secret places—awakening low, soft voices, which seem chanting
                     the gentle songs we used to love in by-gone days, when childhood's witching
                     presence crowned even shadows with wreaths of fancied flowers! How sweetly
                     spiritual are the dreams we revel in, when the visionary world folds its light
                     mantle around us, while its bright air-castles, its sweet visions, and its
                     soothing fancies float before our mental eyes, like gay-colored feathers
                     dancing with the west winds! Oh! memory—sweet, blessed angel as thou art—thine
                     is the power to soothe the weary heart when the world's coldness presses it too
                     heavily!
                  "While the beautiful countess was yet lost in the spell the hour and place had
                     woven around her, she heard the
                     small wicket swing open, and turning her head she saw a noble form and manly
                     face whose counterpart had long been graven upon her heart.
                  Another instant, and that proud form was beside her. A look of trusting love
                     made his handsome face radiant, as the moonbeams fell over it, and the dark
                     eyes beamed with hope when the low voice murmured—"May I love you now,
                     dearest?"
                  She did not turn from him, but her sweet face showed the emotions of her heart
                     as she placed her hand in his and answered—"Yes, Tracy, you may
                     love me now; for methinks could my sainted mother look down upon us, she would
                     bless the reunion of our hearts with a willing smile of sweet approval."
                  There, by that white monument, where a sad farewell had once been spoken, were
                     the vows again plighted, which had once in deed, but not in heart, been broken.
                     As they left the churchyard for the cottage her ladyship was visiting, Tracy
                     Aubrey told his sweet Effie, how, by the death of his uncle, he had succeeded
                     to the earldom of the Kingston, and how lonely he had been in his stately home,
                     without her love to bless him.
                  Ere many weeks had passed, the lovely Lady Southingham became Countess of
                     Kingston. A few months were spent in retirement, and then Kingston Hall was
                     opened to the gay world, and its sweet mistress was again the shining light of
                     the festival train. Many a proud nobleman, who strictly followed the strange
                     fashion of being entirely indifferent to beauty, save in other men's wives, was
                     struck with the most natural astonishment when he witnessed the devotion of
                     Lord Kingston to his gentle wife; for they almost considered a man insane who
                     could complacently talk to his own lady when any other person would listen to
                     him.
                  But Lord and Lady Kingston continued ever the same devoted couple, each happy
                     in the consciousness, of the other's love, for thoroughly had that love been
                     tested.
                  Every autumn, they visited the grave of Effie's mother, nor was Lord
                     Southingham's forgotten. The lofty vault, where he rested in dreamless slumber,
                     was often visited, and the rich bouquet of fresh flowers which was left upon
                     the coffin, told how fondly the memory of his love and kindness was still
                     cherished.
                  Among the little treasures Lady Kingston always kept in the pretty ivory
                     escritoire in her dressing-room, was a tiny-jeweled casket, in which nestled,
                     like gems lost from a regal coronet, two faded roses. One was the same Lady
                     Effie placed in the hand of Tracy Aubrey when they parted in the village
                     churchyard—the other was the one she wore in her hair when she met the "Masked
                     Stranger" at Lady Montague's fete.
               
            
            
               
               THE FALLING LEAVES OF AUTUMN.
               
                  Sweep, sweep, thou wind of Autumn,
                  With thy low and fitful moan,—
                  There's whispered many a tale of woe
                  In thy deep and hollow tone!
                  Thou bear'st upon thy withering blast
                  Full many a cry of pain,
                  That mingles low and mournfully
                  With thine own fitful strain.
               
               
                  Then sweep, thou wind of Autumn,
                  And chant thy hollow song,
                  And echo back each cry of woe
                  When thy wild blast sweeps along.
                  Thy power can make the cheek grow pale,
                  And the light of life depart;
                  And thy low wail can send a chill
                  Of terror to the heart.
               
               
                  But there is yet another voice
                  More solemn than thine own,
                  That speaketh to the human heart
                  With a low and dirge-like tone.
                  Ay, there comes a spell more solemn
                  Than that the wild wind weaves,
                  When we mark the countless numbers
                  Of Autumn's falling leaves.
               
               
                  There's a whisper in their melody,
                  Like voices from the tomb,
                  Which seem to chant the funeral dirge
                  Of beauty and of bloom;
                  They breathe a mournful requiem,
                  When they full with rustling sound,—
                  For hearts, that ere they fall again,
                  Shall moulder in the ground.
               
               
                  They tell how many a star of life,
                  Will shine all bright and brief;
                  And how the beautiful will fade,
                  Like Autumn's falling leaf.
                  Ah, let them strew our weary earth
                  In one dry, quivering wave,
                  As if they fell upon the ground
                  To deck Hope's shadow'd grave.
               
               
                  Ye withering winds of Autumn!
                  Ye fill the heart with dread,
                  Your hoarse wail chants the requiem
                  Of bloom and beauty fled;
                  But the silent voice that thrills the soul
                  And the spell of sadness weaves,
                  Seems speaking in the restless sound.
                  Of Autumn's falling leaves.
               
            
            
               
               THE IDEAL AND THE REAL.
               From fifteen to twenty-five, we dwell in the visionary world. While the
                  fascinating ideal lies before us, with its bright colorings, and sweet, poetic
                  dreamings, we scorn and detest the cold and sickening reality. With the ideal
                  spell upon us, we read in every flowers a romance—see in every star a phantom
                  brighter than the star itself—hear in every melody a strain which thrills our
                  souls, and awakens every slumbering feeling of sympathy. But time glides away,
                  alike, unheeding happiness or sorrow. The sweet life of youth is past, and, with
                  maturer years, come care and anxiety. We pass from the visionary world, to the
                  cold, business-like reality. We love the same sunny flowers; admire the same
                  silver stars; and listen enraptured, to the thrilling notes of melody. But, oh! we
                  no longer read a romance in the rose petals, fancy bright phantoms in the stars,
                  nor do our souls thrill with every note of music. We see the flowers without the
                  romance; the star without the vision, and them the sympathetic strain lost in the
                  melody we used to love.
               Thus it is, passing from the ideal to the real. In youth, we view life through a
                  gauze-like veil, which while it shows luxury and pleasure in the most gor geous
                  light, conceals by that same siren brilliancy, the rough, paths of toil and sorrow
                  which we wander through in after years.
               The poet, seated in his cheerless room, alone and without luxury, will forget the
                  world, as the spell of poetry steals over his soul. He does not see that every
                  article about him bespeaks blighting poverty; he thinks not of the wealth and
                  gaiety which even then glitters in the world around him. He is buried, heart and
                  soul, in the glorious world of poetry, and as he traces with a trembling hand the
                  eloquent thoughts which rush upon his fevered mind like living waters,—the flying
                  pulse, the flushed cheek, and the strangely brilliant eye, reveal the startling
                  intensity of the wordless eloquence which bewilders his brain and scorches his
                  very heart. The midnight hours fly on unheeded. The cold, gray light of day steals
                  through the dusty windows, and the visionary heaven fades like a waning star from
                  the poet's mind. Before him lie the sentiments of his soul, traced in lines which
                  mayhap will thrill millions long after the green sod covers the form of him who
                  wrote them.
               But the poor poet scarcely bestows a look upon the well-filled sheets. The sweet
                  spell of imagination has left him dispirited and heart-sick, and he enters the
                  proud world once more, sickened and disgusted with its hideo realities.
               The glowing pictures we weave so brightly "in youth's sweet time" are never
                  realized in after life. But even when
                  the dark hair has turned to gray and the young form become bowed with years, we
                  look back upon those youthful dreams with emotions almost as sweet and painful as
                  the prisoner in his lonely cell who sees for the last time the lingering
                  sunbeams.
               Ah! well it is for us that the ideal becomes lost in reality, else should we cling
                  too closely to the pleasures of earth. The ideal once banished, and we pass
                  through real scenes of life-sorrows, till the heart is led to place its hopes and
                  dreams upon a better shrine, and to look beyond this weary, world for the
                  happiness which fades with the ideal of youth.
            
            
               A TEAR.
               
                  Think not thou e'er hast won a heart,
                  And that heart holds thee dear,
                  Till it sheds for thee, and thee alone,
                  A pure and heartfelt tear.
                  For a smile of love and a spoken word
                  Ne'er yet affection proved;
                  But when we mark the starting tear—
                  Oh! then we are beloved.
               
               
                  Wake not for me the witching lyre.
                  The wild, impassioned lay;
                  There is no need of "words that burn"
                  To steal my heart away.
                  A passionate tale that's sweetly breathed,
                  May a token of lover appear,—
                  But the test which thrills the soul the most
                  Is a mute and simple tear:
               
               
                  A tear that is sent by tenderness
                  From its home within the heart,
                  And sweetly flows, unconscious all
                  Of the power that bade it start.
                  There's many a heart that a tender word,
                  And a smile and caress may win,—
                  But give me the tear that silently flows,
                  And speaks for the soul within.
               
            
            
               
               THE ACTRESS: OR THREE LEAVES FROM LIFE.
               
                  LEAF, THE FIRST.
                  "Oh! Fame! Fame! dazzling with thy splendor, bewildering with thy beauty, thou
                     dost lure me on, on to the dizzy height from which millions have fallen—but
                     still I follow thee. I know not but thy bright spell be the siren's. I know not
                     but thy charm be the destroyer's, and yet my spirit yearns for thy caress, my
                     heart longs to bind thy laurels to my brow."
                  With cheeks flushed from excitement the fair young speaker closed the volume of
                     Shakespeare she had been perusing, and flinging the rich curls from her brow,
                     moved towards the small mirror that hung near the white-curtained window. And
                     again she spoke in the same wild tone,
                  "Aye, Nature has been bountiful. She has fitted me with every requisite for the
                     life I covet, and that life must be mine! I cannot bear the hundred quiet of
                     this simple village. I was not born for such a life. My restless spirit is ever
                     longing for something it has not, and when I ask its name, a voice seems
                     whispering from out of my heart, and the word "fame" comes
                     trembling up its still cells. And the wild wind while it cools my brow, bends
                     to my ear, murmuring "fame, fame." Even the little gurgling brook, as I watch
                     its dancing ripples, echoes back my spirit's cry, and its low melody seems a
                     sweet told story of fame's bewitching brilliancy. Yes, yes, I must
                     have frame. I am a clergyman's daughter, it is true, but I was born to lead as
                     actress life, and ere another year comes round, my feet shall have pressed the
                     boards which must lead me to the fame I hope to win."
                  It was a strange feeling which thrilled the heart of that fair girl, when she
                     turned from the small glass, and flung herself carelessly upon the neat white
                     couch that stood in a corner of the chamber.
                  Very singular were the thoughts which rushed, like waves, upon her excited
                     mind. But she made no endeavor to repress those thoughts, and so the golden
                     twilight faded, and the full, white moon came sailing up the clear heaven, and
                     its fair, soft rays stole through the open window and draped that snowy couch
                     with a veil of silver. Still did the young girl lie there alone, buried in
                     those wild strange feelings. The sweet quiet of the evening hour possessed no
                     charm to soothe her troubled mind; even the consciousness that it was the
                     sabbath failed to check the unholy flow of thought.
                  She had sat that day in the high-backed pew of the old church, while the rich,
                     earnest tones of her white-haired
                     father gladdened the heart of many an humble villager; but the impressive words
                     of the good old clergyman had fallen upon the heart of his only child
                     unheeded.
                  Even while she stood gazing up into his face, while his lips breathed forth the
                     simple and beautiful language of his soul, her eyes saw not the radiant
                     expression of the venerable countenance; her ear heard not the clear inspiring
                     words of the rich voice. Her mind was far from the still sanctuary where the
                     air of holy peace gave such happiness to humble hearts. Her spirit felt not
                     that quiet peace—her soul caught not the sacred inspiration of their simple
                     worship. No! the heart of Annabel Lorimer was filled with a wild unrest that
                     forbade the angel of peace to enter there. She knew not how many restless
                     beings would gladly give up wealth and fame to lead the quiet life she led; and
                     so she yearned to leave her sunny home to mingle with the cold-hearted world in
                     the great cheerless city. She longed to exchange the peaceful happiness of
                     home, for the gilded pomps and heartless glitter of the unfeeling world. Yes,
                     that proud, beautiful girl; the only daughter of the old clergyman; the light
                     of her pleasant home; the pride of her native village; resolved, even while she
                     sat in the ivy-grown church she had loved in her innocent childhood, to leave
                     her sweet home and loving friends, to seek for fame in the cold world.
                  Alas, for the heart that trusts its frail bark of happiness on the fair seeming
                     lake of fame! Freighted with genius, guided by energy, with the flag of hope
                     floating on the changing breeze of fortune, it often strikes upon a hidden
                     rock, and its rich freight is ruined; its pilot crushed; its drooping pennon
                     torn from the mast-head, and the fragile bark wrecked forever.
                  While the young girl yet lay buried in her dream of future greatness, a low,
                     sweet voice was heard to speak her name. She started quickly, saying, "in a
                     moment, mother," and arranged her dress to go below.
                  A burning crimson flushed the fair cheek when that gentle voice dispelled her
                     wild dream, and she murmured, "Ah! mother, it will indeed break thy heart to
                     lose the child of thy love. I cannot leave thee; I cannot bring sorrow to thy
                     gentle spirit—but yet, I shall return again! I shall bring thee wealth and
                     luxury. I shall strew the path of thy old age with golden flowers. Yes, yes, I
                     will go. I will gain wealth for thy sake, my mother, I will win fame that its
                     rays may lighten thy heart in future years.
                  She smoothed back the dark curls that floated around her face, and assuming a
                     smile of quiet which covered the wild restless within, went below in answer to
                     the summons of her mother.
                  Ah, what a sweet scene that was, which the bright moon saw, as its pale rays
                     shone through the windows of the little cottage parlor. By the table in the
                     centre of the room sat the old clergyman, reading by the light of a brightly
                     burning candle. His good wife sat near him with her mild eyes fixed upon his
                     face, and a gentle smile of trust and holiness lighting up the still fair
                        fea- tures. Near the open window,
                     through which the sweet fragrance of climbing roses was borne on the evening
                     breeze, sat the nephew of the good clergyman, a young man with dark eloquent
                     eyes and handsome face. He was the only child of Mr. Lorimer's half sister, and
                     since her death, which occurred when he was but ten years of age, he had
                     resided in the clergyman's family. He had been educated by his kind uncle for
                     the ministry, and it was the intention of Mr. Lorimer that he should succeed
                     him when age required him to give up the care of his dearly beloved flock to
                     another.
                  Mr. Lorimer paused in his reading when Annabel entered the room, and looking up
                     into her face with a fond smile of affection, said, "Why so late, my
                     daughter?"
                  She did not answer him, but a crimson blush overspread her face as she seated
                     herself in the vacant chair by the same window her cousin occupied. The old man
                     went on reading in his clear voice the words of holiness, and his daughter
                     gazed upon his face with an unusual interest as she drank in the melody of the
                     rich, silvery tones. Ah, it was not the holy words he spoke which so fixed her
                     attention and caused her to forget for a little time the strange yearnings of
                     her restless heart. It was that she was listening for the last time for many
                     years to the loved voice of her doting father—that this was the last time she
                     would sit in that little parlor with those she loved seated around her.
                  And was no thought given to her cousin? did she not regret leaving him who had
                     so long been to her as a dear brother? No, she did not think of that now. She
                     did not even know how dear he was to her. She thought the love she
                     felt for him was the love of a sister, she did not dream of loving him in
                     another way.
                  But not so Charles Clayton! he knew how dearly he loved his
                     beautiful cousin. He knew how his boyish affection for her had grown into the
                     deep strong love of manhood, and the secret he kept locked so firmly in his own
                     breast, haunted his midnight dreams and wakeful hours till the fair girl's
                     beautiful image was graven indelibly on his heart. But he knew his cousin
                     looked upon him only in the light of a brother, and so he sat there in the
                     moon-light gazing upon her radiant face, his dark eyes glowed with a deeper
                     light, and his young heart trembled for his future if he was to spend his life
                     without the sunshine of his cousin's love.
                  But the last verse was read, and the sacred book was closed. All knelt in the
                     attitude of prayer, and the clear solemn tones of the white-haired minister
                     floated on the stillness of the little room like the closing of an angel's
                     hymn. Beautiful was the picture! The dancing moon-beams playing over the floor,
                     the forms of youth and age kneeling with bowed heads, the calm, deep hush of
                     quiet night broken only by that praying voice.
                  The prayer was ended. Annabel stole quickly to her father's side and pressed
                     her lips upon his brow. Silently he drew her to his heart and his hand lingered
                        on her young head in blessing.
                     Her mother's smile of happiness grew deeper as her beautiful child twined her
                     fair arms around her neck and pressed the usual kiss upon her cheek, and her
                     eyes still rested on her face as she touched her dewy lips to the brow of
                     Charles—her brother, as she called him. Then the good-night was spoken and the
                     family separated for nightly rest—one to go forth in the silence, to launch
                     alone upon the siren waves of life.
                  Once more in her chamber, Annabel flung herself upon her couch to woo slumber
                     for a few hours. Her sleep was restless and full of strange dreams, and she
                     woke again ere the stars had paled. While she lay with her hands clasped over
                     her bewildered brow, the sound of the clock, striking three, fell upon her
                     ear.
                  In an instant she was up, and flinging back the curtain she gazed forth. All
                     was still, but it was nearly as light as day, and she hastened to put on her
                     bonnet and shawl and place in a small bag such articles of clothing as she
                     would most need. This done, she took from her drawer the little purse that
                     contained nearly all the money which her father had given her the past
                     year—this leaving home was not the scheme of a day; but one she had been
                     forming for months, nay, years; and then opening her door she passed
                     noiselessly and cautiously out. She paused not till she reached the
                     woodbine-covered porch, for the front door had not been fastened. In those
                     days, reader, one was not obliged to bolt and bar one's doors through fear of
                     the house-breaker and assassin, and now she stood lingeringly on the steps,
                     trying to stifle back the tears which would come.
                  She succeeded at last and with a gesture of impatience and determination dashed
                     the grief drops from her cheeks and passed out through the gate. But here she
                     paused and looked back. The little cottage with its open porch, its garden full
                     of blooming flowers, and the look of quiet comfort about everything, from the
                     white-curtained windows to the neat walk leading to the gate, was a pretty
                     sight, truly. But it was not that which fixed the fair girl's gaze—it was the
                     home of her childhood! the home where she passed the time of glee and laughter;
                     the home where she had blossomed into womanhood and where first had sprung up
                     within her that strange desire for wealth and fame. She could gaze no longer!
                     Kissing her hand towards the cottage she turned into the road leading to the
                     next town, where the morning stage was to pass—and the first leaf in the life
                     of Annabel Lorimer was ended.
               
               
                  LEAF, THE SECOND.
                  The steady wings of Time had sailed slowly and evenly through the space of
                     eight long years. In the richly furnished chamber of a hotel, sat a young and
                     beautiful woman attired in a robe of crimson velvet. Her form was queenly and
                     elegant; her face, with its large, dark, brilliant eyes, and clear complexion,
                     and small, proud mouth, was lovely and fascinating. Her hair, dark, rich and heavy, hung in glossy
                     ringlets over her shoulders, and her small, jewelled hands were white as the
                     leaf of a lily.
                  In her blooming womanhood, Annabel Lorimer was even more beautiful than had
                     been the lovely maiden. The restless glance which shone in those dark eyes
                     eight years ago, was exchanged for one of almost cold calmness, and the nervous
                     manner for a dignified quiet which seemed more proud and haughty.
                  In her hand she held a paper which announced her last appearance before the
                     world, and as she finished reading the long and flattering paragraph she threw
                     it aside and murmured with a smile of bitter satisfaction,
                  "Yes, my purpose is gained! I have wealth and fame, but where is the happiness
                     I trusted this would bring me? Ah! my parents, my only happiness will be when I
                     lay at thy feet the wealth I have won. I thought the laurel wreath would cool
                     the restlessness of my heart, and bring me peace; but no, its leaves freeze my
                     brow and its incense sickens me. I am weary of the world! I despise the glare
                     and frivolity my youthful fancy so longed for.
                  "Let me lay my head once more upon my mother's breast, let me receive once more
                     my father's blessing, and I shall be happy! Oh! my home, my home! why did I
                     leave thee? why did I give up thy sweet peace for the heartlessness and glitter
                     of the world? But stay, I will not weep. I shall see ye soon, dear ones! I
                     shall breathe in a few short days the air of home! But oh! this fear, this
                     chill of apprehension that comes over me when I think of my kindred! Oh! God
                     grant no harm may have befallen them! God grant I may find them well and
                     happy."
                  She rose from her chair and flinging a rich shawl over her shoulders, passed
                     down the stairs and entered the carriage that was to convey her for the last
                     time to the theatre.
                  Yes, reader, Annabel Lorimer's purpose was gained. Early and late
                     she had toiled to gain wealth and fame, and her reward had come. The laurel
                     wreath rested proudly on her brow, the wealth she coveted was at her command.
                     The first year of her appearance before the world her talents had not been
                     appreciated, but by a sudden turn in the wheel of fortune she was brought into
                     notice and raised to the high position she now occupied.
                  Friends crowded around her with flattery and homage, but she knew well it was
                     her position, her wealth that drew them. In the long weary year of suffering
                     and privation, when she had studied in the garret of an old, tumble-down house
                     she boarded in, she had found no friends. Now that her scanty wardrobe was
                     exchanged for one rich and luxurious, her garret for costly furnished rooms,
                     her unknown name for the brilliant title of a gifted favorite of fortune, her
                     poverty for wealth, they crowded around her with professions of friendship and
                     regard.
                  
                  But the beautiful favorite disdained their proffered friendship, and her manner
                     was cold even to haughtiness. Many admirers had knelt at her feet. Some there
                     were, too, who bowed not at her shrine for the sake of the riches she
                     possessed, but from real, disinterested affection had offered noble hearts to
                     the gifted woman. But she had refused them, one and all. And wherefore! could
                     she not among so many hearts find one to lean upon in her
                     loneliness? could she not find one worthy of the love she
                     withheld?
                  No! for that heart which the world thought so cold was already occupied. Almost
                     unconsciously to herself, the image of her cousin had stolen into it when
                     others sued for her love, and the sisterly affection she had cherished for him
                     grew into one of a deeper, stronger nature. She thought of him taking the place
                     of her father in the hearts of the humble villagers she had passed the days of
                     her childhood with. She thought of him dwelling in the sweet solitude of her
                     simple home, where the bustle and noise of the world never came, and she
                     longed—with a yearning as strong as that which tempted her to leaves it—to
                     return once more to her native village.
                  She longed to fling off the wreath which rested too heavily on her brow, to
                     draw a long, free breath, where the fresh air of nature was not tainted by
                     artificial breezes. In fact, she was weary—weary of the world, weary of her
                     brilliant fame, weary of her own heart while it beat amid so much worldly
                     heartlessness.
                  And this was the last night she would appear before that world, whose smiles
                     she had left her home and the home-ones to gain. Go with her, dear reader, to
                     the theatre.
                  In the green-room she sat, with her shawl yet lying carelessly over her
                     shoulders, reading and looking over the papers which lay in confusion on the
                     table near which she was sitting. How glorious she looked as she sat there in
                     that graceful attitude, with her luxuriant curls fastened back from her brow by
                     a diamond circlet, and falling carelessly over her marble-white shoulders. Ah,
                     truly, Annabel Lorimer was beautiful. Those lustrous eyes were far
                     more brilliant than her diamonds, and her clear, white skin rivalled the snowy
                     satin which fitted so charmingly her graceful form.
                  And yet she sat there, seemingly all unconscious of her peerless beauty,
                     quietly looking over those scattered papers. She had taken up one which she was
                     reading with more interest than the rest, because it was a country paper; when
                     suddenly she grasped it tighter in her hand, and holding it close to her eyes,
                     read over and over again the simple paragraph which had chained her attention.
                     She had risen from her chair and stood leaning, with the paper yet in her hand,
                     towards the light. One hand was pressed tightly on her brow, as if she could
                     not convince herself that she was awake. But there were those dreadful words
                     yet staring her in the face.
                  Yes, it was reality!
                  
                  The paper dropped from her grasp, the paleness of death came over her face, and
                     she sank heavily into a seat. But she shed no tears, though the veins in her
                     snowy forehead swelled till they seemed to bursting, and she sat so still that
                     her very breath seemed shut forever within the firm-closed, ashy lips. Her eyes
                     seemed suddenly glazed and distended, as they stared fixedly and wildly on the
                     paper she had flung upon the table. Woe, woe, was written on every feature of
                     that distorted face—and yet no tears! Reader, she was stricken with grief too
                     deep for tears, for there, in the green-room of the theatre, she had read
                        the announcement of her mother's death!
                  
                  She did not move from her chair, till some one, speaking her name, told her the
                     audience were awaiting her appearance. Then she started as if with sudden
                     fright, and pressed both hands over her brow, while she closed her eyes to shut
                     out the glaring lamp light. Slowly the color came back to her cheek, and her
                     breathing became more free and distinct; she took her hands from her brow, and
                     rising from her seat, gathered up the trailing folds of her satin robe and
                     passed on with her usual proud and elegant step to the stage. As she swept by
                     the gentleman who had spoken to her while she sat so silent and unconscious, he
                     started as if a lightning flash had dazzled his eyes. For in the few moments
                     the beautiful actress had sat with her white hands clasped on her brow, there
                     had a change passed over her face which one would have deemed years could not
                     have wrought. The brilliant eyes gleamed with an expression unnaturally cold
                     and strange, and the small, proud mouth was firmly closed as if the silent lips
                     shut in a world of tearless anguish.
                  But yet she passed on to the stage, her heart bleeding at every pore, her very
                     soul writhing in agony, and with the eyes of the world feasting on her glorious
                     beauty, went through her part with a coolness which the audience, had they
                     known the sorrow in her heart, would have called the calmness of insanity.
                  Never had her acting been more brilliant. The excited audience sat with parted
                     lips and heads bent forward to catch every word; to see every superb movement,
                     till the curtain hid the magnificent form from sight. For a few moments, the
                     silence of the house was oppressive; and when the spell was broken, the
                     thunders of applause which shook the very walls, seemed to roll forth from the
                     hearts of the multitude like the waves of the stormy ocean. But he beautiful
                     enchantress came no more before them; she had fled from the splendor of the gay
                     world; she had fled from the temple where the wreath of laurel was laid upon
                     her brow. And thus closed the second and most brilliant leaf in that young and
                     singular life.
               
               
                  LEAF, THE THIRD.
                  The bright, clear moonbeams shone placidly down on the cheerful cottage of good
                     old Parson Lorimer.
                  
                  The season was spring, and the flowers were blooming in the neat yard, and the
                     trees were fast losing their bright blossoms. The vine, climbing over the
                     little porch, looked green and luxuriant, and in the porch, seated in his
                     favorite arm-chair, was the old clergyman. His hair was bleached even whiter
                     than when we saw him last, for as the moonlight lay over it, it looked liked so
                     many scattered threads of silver.
                  The eight long and weary years which had passed, had told upon his countenance.
                     The eyes had lost their bright, beaming expression, and the broad, high brow
                     was deeper furrowed. His withered cheek rested on the palm of his hand, and his
                     gaze was fixed on the clear heaven, as if his all of happiness were dwelling
                     there.
                  Ah, poor old man! he had seen more trouble in those eight years than he had
                     known in all his life before. The loss of his only child had nearly driven him
                     frantic with grief; and now his wife, his gentle Mary, had gone, and he was
                     left alone in the world. He had not murmured against the will of his Father; he
                     had borne his sorrows with the fortitude of a true Christian. And yet this last
                     cup seemed a bitter one to drink, for his days were far spent; and though
                     broken down with sorrow and feeble with age, he had neither wife nor child to
                     soothe the stream of his life as it ebbed slowly away.
                  Truly, it was a hard lot for an old man, who had passed his life in the
                     sunshine of domestic love, and who, till within the last few years, had known
                     neither grief nor trouble. Aye, a hard lot for one to bear, who, for nearly
                     half a century, had labored constantly and untiringly for the good of his
                     fellow creatures. But the old clergyman bore it bravely, with the spirit of a
                     true Christian; and as he sat there gazing on the golden stars, he was thinking
                     of his wife—how peacefully she passed away—of the time when he, too, should be
                     called to that far-off home, to spend an eternity with the "loved and lost."
                     Then a thought of his child crossed his mind. Was she yet alive? could she be
                     in the world, and her old father be allowed to lie down and die alone? Ah! this
                     was the most bitter of his griefs. His wife he knew was in heaven; his
                     daughter—he knew not whether the wide world held her.
                  He felt that he could die in peace if he could but once again rest his hand on
                     the still loved head in blessing, if he could once again press his child to his
                     breast, and hear her say once more—"My father!"
                  He buried his face in his hands, and breathed a silent prayer for the wandered;
                     but ere he had raised his head, he was startled by the sound of rumbling
                     wheels. An open carriage was coming up the road so fast that the horse seemed
                     almost to fly. It stopped before his gate, and ere it started on, the elegant
                     form of a woman, young and beautiful, was half way up the neat walk. The bright
                     moon made the evening nearly as light as day, and the dim eyes of the aged man
                     recognized that radiant face ere his glance had thrice scanned the beau- tiful features. A heavenly smile
                     came over his face, and raising his eyes upward, he murmured,
                  "Thank God! my daughter!"
                  Another moment, and she was kneeling before him, with her head bowed in his
                     lap, and his trembling hands resting on her glossy curls, while his lips were
                     murmuring the olden blessing. Suddenly she raised her eyes to his face, and the
                     first words she had spoken came choking from her lips.
                  "My mother died!" was all she said; but her father knew her meaning, and
                     answered,
                  "Yes, my daughter, of grief."
                  Quickly she sprang from her knees, and passing round a corner of the house,
                     flew wildly over the field that led her into the churchyard path. She knew well
                     the spot where they had buried her mother—under the willow, where the twin
                     sister of her childhood slumbered, and five minutes from the time she left her
                     father, she was kneeling by her grave—aye, kneeling by the grave of her mother,
                     whose dying blessing she had not received.
                  She bowed her head upon the turf, and tears, the first, she had shed since she
                     read that terrible announcement, in the theatre, gushed from her eyes. Oh, it
                     was terrible to witness such heart-rending grief. Deep, heavy sobs came welling
                     up from her heart, and the stifled, half-frantic voice kept murmuring in
                     agony,
                  "Come back, come back, my mother! bless me once, only once more!"
                  Alas, the mother's ear heard not the frantic wailings of her child; they could
                     not break the stillness of the dark grave's silent depths. But one earthly gaze
                     witnessed that young creature's sorrow; but one earthly heart bled in sympathy
                     with hers.
                  Charles Clayton had witnessed the meeting between the father and his child. He
                     had seen her fly past the window where he sat, and he knew she had gone to her
                     mother's grave. After soothing the somewhat excited mind of his uncle, and
                     telling him he would watch her lest she might stay too long in the night air,
                     he had followed the footsteps of his beautiful and still loved cousin.
                  For over an hour he had stood silently in the shade of the drooping willow. He
                     did not wish to intrude upon the sufferer's deep sorrow. But when she grew
                     calmer, he moved to the grave and seating himself beside the sorrowing girl,
                     raised her bowed head to his shoulder. She had heard his voice when it murmured
                     "Annabel," so gently, and now she looked up for a moment in his face, but the
                     tears gushed forth again, and burying her face in his bosom, she sobbed.
                  "Oh, Charles, it was you, it was you, she blessed when she was dying!"
                  "Nay, nay, Annabel, with her last breath she breathed a blessing on your head."
                     The manly voice trembled as he said this, for the scene had affected him
                     deeply. For a few moments he sat in silence, and then in a low, gentle toned he
                     breathed forth words of soothing—words of holy faith and submission that fall like balm upon the aching heart. And
                     like balm they fell upon the almost broken heart of that young girl, calming
                     the wild emotion, and soothing the deep grief; for when her cousin led her back
                     to her father, there was an expression of meek submission on her countenance
                     which told that though the heart bore the same sorrow, it bore also more of a
                     Christian spirit.
                  A year has passed since Annabel Lorimer returned to her home. The bright
                     moonlight plays once more over the pretty cottage, and the sweet breath of
                     spring flowers floats through the open windows.
                  In the little parlor a small company are assembled, for a good old parson
                     Lorimer has given his beautiful daughter in marriage to his worthy successor.
                     Dear reader, should you know that radiant bride, with the meek look of a
                     Christian spirit beaming from her eyes, and the smile of such gentle sweetness
                     wreathing her calm happy face, for the proud, brilliant actress, in her velvet
                     robes and flashing diamonds? Does she not look far sweeter in that muslin
                     dress, than she did in her rich attire? And now she is a minister's wife; but
                     the gentle look in her dark eyes tells that the trust reposed in her will not
                     be misplaced; she will be equal to her duties. Well, we echo the blessing of
                     the happy father, as he laid his hands on the young heads of the noble couple,
                     and wished them a long life of happiness and peace.
               
            
            
               THEY SAY THOU WILT DIE.
               
                  They say thou wilt die
                  When autumn sweeps by,
                  Like a star from the brow of even!
                  That angels will come from their shadowy home,
                  And bear thee away to heaven.
                  Oh! say, shall thy tone
                  Breathe forth the death moan—
                  Oh! say, wilt thou leave me alone?
               
               
                  Each glance of thine eye,
                  And each quivering sigh
                  Thrills my soul with widest delight;
                  Where thy look doth beam, life seemeth a dream,
                  And when thou'rt away it is night.
                  Will thy dear spirit fly
                  To the heaven on high—
                  Oh! say, my own, wilt thou die?
               
               
                  In this world's wild strife,
                  Thou alone art my life,—
                  I will love thee forever and ever;
                  E'en the angels above shall not sunder our love—
                  No power our spirits shall sever.
                  If thou lie in the tomb,
                  In thy beauty and bloom,
                  The lovelight will set amid gloom.
               
               
               
                  Oh! tell me, my love,
                  When the angels above
                  Bid thee worship at heaven's shrine;
                  If they bear thee there, will they hear my prayer,
                  And carry my spirit with thine?
                  For, oh! if thou die
                  When autumn sweeps by,
                  My soul will go with thee on high.
               
            
            
               THE CASTLE AND THE COTTAGE.
               
                  CHAPTER I.
                  
                     
                        
                           Affection is a fire which kindleth as well in the bramble as in the
                              oak, and catcheth hold where it first lighteth, not where it may best
                              burn. Larks that mount in the air, build their nests below in the
                              earth; and women that cast their eyes upon kings, may place their
                              hearts upon vassals.
                        
                        MARLOWE.
                     
                  
                  "Never, Adelaide, never! If you wed a low-born peasant boy, when a proud noble
                     kneels to the beauty I have cultured, for the same object, you are no child of
                     mine!"
                  "But, mother, think how fondly I have loved Lorenze St. Leon!"
                  "Loved! Adelaide, loved! What is the love of one plebeian heart to the
                     admiration of a world? Have you no thought that, as the beautiful
                     wife of Lord Harcourt, you will be the proudest star of the titled train? the
                     brilliant shrine towards which shall float the wandering homage of a thousand
                     hearts? the peerless center of a world in which none move save the high-born
                     and the great? Could you be content to pass a simple life of mere love within a
                     low-roofed cottage when all the pomp and pride of a lordly castle would woo you
                        as a mistress? Ha! ha! Adelaide;
                     a maiden with the beauty of an empress talking of loving a peasant boy—a
                     wandering plebeian, when an earl kneels at her feet."
                  "Ah, mother, I confess the picture you have drawn would realize the wildest
                     dreams of my ardent fancy, for oh! I should so love to dwell in a stately
                     castle; to be garbed in the rich robes of pride and affluence; to be proclaimed
                     the loveliest of the courtly throng; to lead a proud life of gaiety and
                     splendor amid the dazzling luxuries of titled wealth. Oh! yes, I should love to
                     be a rich and beautiful countess—but—but—Lorenze St. Leon is handsome—oh! so
                     proudly handsome; and, mother, the Earl of Harcourt—the high, the nobly
                     born—the stern, proud nobleman, is horribly, terribly
                     deformed!"
                  A cloud flitted for an instant over the pale face of the ambitious mother, for
                     the tone of wild enthusiasm in which her daughter had first spoken had sunk
                     into a low, weird-like whisper, as she slowly, yet with startling distinctness,
                     uttered that dreadful truth. But the mother's heart was not crushed by that
                     dead sentence. She knew that she might dazzle that youthful imagination by
                     siren pictures of glittering splendor, and that the heart of her child, too
                     young and thoughtless to be scarce conscious of its own will, must, with such
                     pictures spread fascinatingly before it, sooner or later, yield to her wishes.
                     She drew the fair form of the lovely girl yet nearer, and taking both her small
                     hands within her own, said, in a low, earnest tone:—
                  "Listen to me, Adelaide. You are not, as you have ever thought, of lowly birth.
                     There is as noble blood coursing through those blue veins, as Harcourt's
                     haughty earl may boast. Ours was an ancient family, and our house one of
                     England's proudest; but I wedded for love, poor, foolish love, and the same
                     hour that brought upon my head a father's curse, brought upon my life one still
                     darker—the gaunt, chill curse of poverty!
                  "Your father, Adelaide, was also of a noble family, but alas! he was the
                     younger son, and being strangely handsome, was no favorite at home. There had
                     been, for many years a deadly feud existing between the two houses, and from
                     the hour I left the proud home of my childhood, I have never seen a single
                     member of our family. My father, stern and unyielding, forbade me to enter his
                     doors again, and my beautiful sisters were too angry to care whether I lived in
                     luxury or penury. Your poor father struggled against his hard lot for three
                     long years, and then he was laid to rest beneath the kindly sod which shuts out
                     the spectre forms of misery and woe.
                  "Adelaide, I have passed my life within a vine-clad cottage, with want and
                     sorrow for my portion, when, with my ancient name and youthful beauty, I might
                     have won a nobleman, and thus led a life of luxury and splendor. But no, I
                     married for love, and love is all I have ever received. I have
                     dwelt in dear obscurity for many long years, with but one hope to cheer me—one
                     object to look forward to. And that object, Adelaide, that single hope I have so long and fondly
                     cherished, you are already acquainted with; 'tis to see you enjoying the proud
                     station from which my own foolishness drove me—to see you triumph over the
                     glittering circle who cast me from them. Many a time, when you have stood
                     beside me in all the sunny innocence of childhood, I have inwardly thanked
                     Heaven that you were so peerlessly beautiful. You have been nurtured, Adelaide,
                     not in luxury, but in ease. Those small hands have never known labor to soil
                     their whiteness—that young heart has felt no blight to dim the sparkle of those
                     dark eyes.
                  "But, Adelaide, you can never know the sacrifices I have made to obtain for you
                     this ease. You can never know what I have suffered, to keep, unimpaired, the
                     glorious beauty which I knew would bring us, at no distant day, the wealth and
                     station which are rightfully ours.
                  "And that day has come at last. The haughty Earl of Harcourt, this very morning
                     asked your hand in marriage, and yet, Adelaide, you say you cannot wed him, for
                     you love an ignoble plebeian.
                  "Now listen, Adelaide. If you wed Lorenze St. Leon, a thousand curses shall
                     rest upon your head. If you wed Lord Harcourt, you have my blessing and my
                     prayers. You will feel, too that the mother who has watched over your childish
                     years, who has shielded you from want, and borne the grim burden of suffering
                     for her child's sake—is made happy by your decision.
                  "Wed the former, and you will pass a plain life of quiet, meaningless love, in
                     a low-roofed cottage. Wed the latter, and you will enjoy an existence of luxury
                     and splendor amid the pride and brilliancy of a princely castle. Now, my child,
                     I leave the decision to yourself. Choose as your own heart dictates. But
                     remember, you are choosing between a lofty castle and a lowly cottage—the proud
                     title of nobility and the simple lot of the peasant—the curse of a mother and
                     her heartfelt blessing. Choose wisely, my child; decide not for the past, but
                     the future!"
                  With a rigid expression of anxiety resting upon her still handsome features,
                     the mother rose from her seat, and retreating to the window, remained
                     half-hidden by the flowing muslin drapery which swept over the low seat. But
                     the earnest gaze of her large eyes was fixed, with intense eagerness, upon the
                     bowed form of her beautiful daughter.
                  Long did the young girl remain with her sweet face buried in her graceful
                     hands, while the rich mass of raven tresses concealed any show of emotion which
                     might agitate the snowy breast. But yet the anxious mother could perceive a
                     slight quivering of the fair form, and once she heard a faint sigh as it came
                     trembling through the rosy lips. But when the regal head was raised from the
                     white hands, there was no tremor in the queenly form, no quiver in the proud
                     voice as she said, in tones of thrilling sweetness, "Mother, I will wed the
                     Earl of Harcourt!"
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER II.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              ——The hour of sacrifice
                              Is near. Anon the immolating priest
                              Will summon me.
                           
                        
                        THE HUNCHBACK.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           She wrapped herself up in a brilliant future. Still there were moments
                              when she felt that its hopes were icicles.
                        
                        ETHEL CHURCHILL.
                     
                  
                  The fair hand of the beautiful Adelaide slightly trembled as she pushed open
                     the little wicket which led into the garden attached to her mother's cottage.
                     Her costly garments enhanced by their surpassing richness the regal style of
                     her wondrous beauty, for she was attired in bridal robes, and in one short hour
                     she would be a countess. But though her dark eyes had rested proudly on the
                     dazzling gems flashing in the midnight blackness of the glossy tresses, yet she
                     had restlessly turned from their brilliancy, and stolen into the small garden
                     to bid farewell to the shrubs and flowers that had been her silent companion,
                     when childhood's spell hollowed the sweet hours she had dreamed away in their
                     midst.
                  She passed slowly through the rustic arbor at the lower part of the garden,
                     pausing every now and then to pluck a rose from some favorite bush, or to
                     linger, for the last time, beneath the branches of a tree that she had often
                     sat under, when the summer moonlight silvered the light shrubbery. Ah! where is
                     the heart that can gaze for the last time upon the hallowed scenes of childhood
                     with a calm eye and motionless lip? Where is the heart that can bid farewell
                     forever to scenes which have sweetly and silently twined themselves around the
                     inmost affections of the soul—without the simple tribute of a starting tear?
                     And where, too, is the heart that can easily forget these early scenes; these
                     dear sweet dreams of innocence and childhood that come to us in the silence of
                     after years, and give to memory a charm which soothes the very depths of life's
                     own weariness? Oh! I cannot think that even in this cold, selfish world, there
                     beats a heart so hard and stern and passionless! I cannot think there beats a
                     heart so void of nature's heaven-like tenderness, that it could refuse the
                     tributary tear of sweet regret when it bade a last farewell to the loved scenes
                     of earlier years.
                  The heart of Adelaide possessed a goodly share of pride, but it was that pride
                     which deceives the possessor with its false show. Her nature was generous and
                     noble, and as she flung herself upon the seat in the pretty arbor, and thought
                     that she was sitting there amid those dear scenes of youth for the last time,
                     the warm tears sprang to her eyes, and she murmured, as the memories of the
                     happy past stole over her:—
                  "Alas! can all the pride and pomp of future splendor atone for the sacrifice of
                     happiness? I may be proud, and high, and wealthy—but shall I be happy? Will the
                     glaring light in the saloons of fashion fall upon me with the gentleness of
                     this moonlight? Will the hom- age
                     and admiration of a heartless world yield me the same happiness which the sweet
                     words of St. Leon have ever caused? Oh! Lorenze, would that I were free again
                     to listen once more to those low words of thine! would that my life could be
                     passed with thee; me thinks the humblest cottage would be a paradise, if graced
                     by the noble form——"
                  "And you chose a life of pride within the stately castle, to the quiet home and
                     unchanging love I offered thee!"
                  Adelaide had not heard approaching footsteps, and the voice which addressed
                     her, though it was low and sweet, somewhat startled her. She quickly raised her
                     head, and her eyes met those of a young man, who stood before her with his arms
                     folded coldly and proudly upon his manly breast. He was singularly handsome,
                     both in form and feature, and the eyes which rested calmly upon the beautiful
                     face of Adelaide, were large, black, and strangely expressive. But the
                     expression of half scorn, half-pride melted into one of sadness, as the
                     trembling girl sprang towards him and, laying her small hand on his arm,
                     exclaimed:—
                  "Oh! Lorenze, tell me that you do not hate me; that you do not think me selfish
                     and cold! Tell me that the memory of the vows we have breathed for each
                     other—the sweet hours we have spent together in this dear spot, shall be
                     cherished in your heart as in my own! Oh! Lorenze, tell me that you forgive
                     me—that you will never, never forget me?"
                  "Forget you! Adelaide; forget you! Think you that I, too, am
                     false-hearted?"
                  "Do not reproach me, Lorenze, and at this hour. I cannot bear it. Do not look
                     upon me with that cold, scornful smile. Tell me that you will ever think kindly
                     of me when I am far away."
                  "Adelaide, I shall ever think of you with pity."
                  "Pity! Lorenze St. Leon; pity! I ask no pity from you. I can bear reproaches; I
                     can bear scorn; but I will not bear pity! I have chosen my station
                     in life and I will maintain it. I ask the pity and the love of none. So
                     farewell, Lorenze, and when you do think of me, think that I am happy."
                  The haughty farewell was unheeded by St. Leon. He stood for a moment gazing
                     upon the fair form before him with a sad yet stern expression on his proud
                     face; then, in a tone of thrilling distinctness, he said:—
                  "Yes, Adelaide, you have chosen your station in life! You have
                     chosen pride in the castle, when you would have known
                        happiness in the cottage! You have chosen a heart, cold, stern,
                     and passionless as the white stars above us, when you might have chosen a soul
                     whose love for you must be unchanging as these same stars! Heaven grant that
                     you may have no cause to repent the choice, Adelaide—this choice that has given
                     the peace and happiness of your heart to a heartless and unfeeling world. I
                     shall not forget you, Ada; my prayers will ever be that God's blessing may rest
                     on thee. Love not the world too
                     fondly, lest it betray thy trust. Now, fare-thee well!"
                  Again his proud eyes met the glance of the agitated girl, and again that same
                     cold expression came over his face, and in another instant he was gone.
                  Adelaide gazed long and abstractedly towards the leafy entrance of the arbor,
                     and then, sinking upon the seat, buried her face in her hands and
                     murmured:—
                  "Would that I had chosen the peasant's lowly cot! And yet, why should I? I have
                     chosen wealth, and rank, and luxury. As a peasant's wife I must dwell in
                     obscurity, and be content to hide the beauty heaven has bestowed upon me
                     beneath the simple hat and mantle of a class scarce higher than a band of
                     gipsies. As the wife of a noble I shall be arrayed in the courtly robes of
                     rank, and the glittering world will acknowledge the witchery of the beauty my
                     mother says will far surpass the proud dames of the imperial court. Oh! I shall
                     not repent my choice. I must be happy amid so much wealth and splendor. But my
                     husband—I cannot love him. He may be hideous to me. I must not think of love—I
                     must look to pride for happiness. Yes, yes, pride! pride—and
                     pomp—and glitter. Oh! I shall be happy—I know I shall."
                  "What are you saying, Adelaide, in that half-crazy tone? Of course you will be
                     happy; so come into the house and do not keep us waiting and longer. The earl
                     has arrived and everything is ready—and of course you will be happy."
                  Adelaide followed her excited parent up the neat pathway that led to the
                     cottage and, in a few moments, she was standing by the earl's side, listening
                     to the sacred words which bound her to him forever. And truly, what a strange
                     scene that bridal was. The bride was beautiful as a dream, with her full, proud
                     form, and sweet, heavenly face, around which waved a raven mass of glossy
                     tresses. The bridegroom was ugly and ill-shapen as Shakspeare's Richard. His
                     hair was coarse and straight, and his face was nearly hidden by whiskers which
                     might have served and outlaw chief. His eyes continually sought the earth, but
                     when, for an instant, their marble lids were raised, one could perceive that
                     the half-closed orbs were dark, and, in strange contrast to his almost hidden
                     person, singularly beautiful.
                  It was a striking—a painful contrast. She so young, so bright, and peerless—he
                     so frightfully deformed. It seemed like placing a dark storm cloud beside a
                     bright, pure star. But the bridal rite was read as calmly as though it bound
                     two willing hearts; and Adelaide, though she shuddered and turned pale when the
                     solemn "amen" of the minister fell with strange distinctness upon the deep
                     silence of the little parlor—yet felt relieved when the painful ceremony was
                     ended.
                  It was a dark, cheerless afternoon when the bridal party arrived at Lord
                     Harcourt's stately castle. The journey had seemed longer to Adelaide than it
                     really was. Her mother and Lord Harcourt had slept nearly all the way, and though she tried to think of a
                     bright future, yet memory would steal by her side, and place constantly before
                     her eyes a vision of the scenes she had left behind.
                  She ran, like a child, through the richly furnished apartments of the castle,
                     expressing her delight at everything which pleased her fancy. Her husband
                     followed her, and at every expression of pleasure that escaped the cherry lips
                     of his bride, he would shrug his shoulders and raise his really fine eyes to
                     her face with an expression which seemed to say, "Worth marrying me for, isn't
                     it?"
                  Passing through the large drawing-room, he called her attention to the splendid
                     mirror in which both their forms were reflected in vivid contrast. Adelaide had
                     never before behold her own magnificent form, and now as she stood gazing upon
                     its exquisitely beautiful proportions, a flush of natural pride crimsoned her
                     roseate cheek, and made the superb features look still lovelier. And if the
                     costly glass enhanced her loveliness, it made the deformity of her husband only
                     more frightful. He stood, with folded arms, gazing intently upon the queenly
                     form that looked so peerless in contrast to his own, and, as Adelaide's dark
                     eyes glanced towards him, he muttered, in a bitter tone,
                  "Yes, yes, fair Adelaide, I am deformed! terribly frightfully deformed. But you
                     are beautiful as the vision of an angel. You are gloriously perfect, both in
                     form and feature. Now listen. I married you that I might show the world that,
                     hunchback though I be, I could win a more beauteous bride than the proudest
                     Adonis in the realm. I married you that, when the proud world paid homage to
                     your heavenly beauty, I, the frightful hunchback, the pitiably deformed, could
                     gaze upon the bright star of beauty's train, and say that the envied prize was
                     all my own. Ha! ha! ha! It will be a sweet triumph for me when the fair
                     Countess of Harcourt makes her debut before the gay world of rank and
                     fashion!"
                  With a low, and to Adelaide, strangely mocking laugh, he felt the gorgeous
                     apartment.
                  The young bride stood for an instant, with her hands pressed tightly over her
                     brow, and her eyes fixed vacantly upon the spot where her husband had stood.
                     Then with an effort, she moved from the spot, and going to her own beautiful
                     dressing-room, closed the richly carved door, and flinging herself upon a
                     silken couch and burying her face in its cushions, burst into a passion of hot,
                     raining tears.
                  "Oh, my God!" she murmured, "what is to repay me for the sacrifice I have made?
                     I have cast from me a true, noble, faithful heart, and received in exchange the
                     mere name of a heartless demon; and my very beauty must be made the means of
                     his triumph over the world. Oh! St. Leon, hadst thou heard those bitter words,
                     thou wouldst know I had cause, deep, mocking cause, for the vain
                     regret you feared would come. Oh! would that I were free again. Would that I
                     were once more a simple peasant."
                  
                  Long and bitterly she wept, till her temples throbbed with pain and her heart
                     grew sick and over-burdened with grief. But who could she blame for her bitter
                     anguish? No one. She had chosen the proud station of wealth, and that station
                     was now her own. She remembered the words of her mother—the threatened curse if
                     she did not wed Lord Harcourt. Should she blame the only parent for this
                     unhappy marriage—that mother who had watched so tenderly over her childish
                     years, and had done this, as she thought, for her child's happiness? Oh! no.
                     Adelaide Harcourt was too noble for so selfish an accusation. She knew the
                     choice had been left to her own heart, and she had chosen wealth. But she had
                     not studied her own character, and she did not know how deeply she loved the
                     noble present she had spurned.
                  But now she was another's—forever and irrevocably another's. And now, when it
                     was too late, she realized the depth of the affection she still cherished for
                     him who could in future be nought to her. She remembered how she had often sat
                     in the rose-covered arbor of the cottage garden, and woven bright pictures of
                     the future; but in each picture the noble form and handsome face of Lorenze St.
                     Leon had even appeared the dearest and the proudest charm.
                  She could now look forward to a brilliant future. To a future filled with pomp
                     and splendor, and wreathed with the radiant flowers of pride and luxury. But
                     the form that should be the charm of that future was, to her sensitive nature,
                     hideous in its frightful deformity. The heart that should be her
                     richest treasure amid all this future pride, was cold and as incapable of love
                     or even the noble sentiments of honor, as the China images in her boudoir. She
                     knew that the heart of her husband, if indeed he possessed one, was as inferior
                     to the high soul and lofty sentiments of her former lover, as the earth-worm is
                     to the star that shines so proudly above it.
                  But the proud heart of her noble lover had been cast from her, and she was
                     bounded by the most sacred vows, to him she had chosen for his rank and wealth.
                     She determined to crush the vain passion her vows forbid her to cherish longer,
                     and place all her hopes of future happiness upon the pomp and glitter of the
                     proud world.
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              The fateful day passed by; and then there came
                              Another and another.
                           
                        
                        MARCIAN COLONNA.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           Better, oh, better that I had not listened to the vanity of a heated
                              brain—better that I had made my home with the lark and the wild bee,
                              among the fields, and the quiet hills, where life, if obscurer, is
                              less debased,—and hope, if less eagerly sought is less bitterly
                              disappointed.
                        
                        THE DISOWNED.
                     
                  
                  The young and beautiful Countess of Harcourt reclined upon a rich fauteuil in
                     her luxurious dressing- room, on the
                     morning after her first appearance at a brilliant fete. Her unrivalled beauty
                     had excited the utmost admiration, and many a proud belle already looked with
                     jealousy and envy upon the bright star whose matchless loveliness bid fair to
                     eclipse them all, and its fair possessor to become at once the reigning
                     beauty.
                  Lady Adelaide was well pleased with the admiration she received from the
                     glittering throng of fashion. The pomp, the dazzling splendor, and the gaiety
                     and fashion she had beheld, was all novel and therefore pleasing to her young
                     heart. The flattery and praise of the gay world fell not upon an unwilling
                     ear—the crown of admiration was not placed upon an unwilling brow. She had
                     entered into the festive excitement with a keen zest, and she had schooled her
                     heart to enjoy its brilliancy. And as she sat there, alone, in the very midst
                     of the rarest luxury, and thought of the triumph of the last evening, and of
                     the wondering homage that had been rendered to her beauty, she could not
                     repress the inward with that Lorenze St. Leon had beheld her in her flashing
                     jewels and rich attire. She wondered if he would have thought her lovelier than
                     in the simple dress of a peasant, with only a few dewy roses wreathed amid the
                     waves of her dark hair and worn upon her snowy bosom.
                  She rose from her seat and opening the casket that contained her jewels,
                     clasped the rich bracelets on her white arms, and placed the shining tira on
                     her glossy head, where it rested like a regal diadem. Then she moved towards
                     the large mirror and gazed long and earnestly upon the superb beauty of her own
                     fair form and features. The jewelled coronet that flashed over the marble
                     forehead was very brilliant, but the dark, lustrous eyes were more radiantly
                     dazzling. The velvet softness of the matchless complexion, the roseate ting
                     upon the fair cheek, and more than all, the sweet expression of the glorious
                     face—would be enhanced as much by a simple flower as by a sparkling gem. And,
                     as the young countess unclasped the rare gems, and slowly replaced them in the
                     emblazoned casket, she murmured in a low, half-unconscious tone,
                  "And it was for these glittering baubles that I gave up love and happiness! For
                     these poor trinkets that I sold myself to a heartless monster. And he would
                     love me no better in my costly robes than he did in my peasant dress. He would
                     admire me as much with a plain rose wreathed in my hair as if a regal coronet
                     flashed upon my brow. And he is right. Jewels cannot give peace to the soul;
                     nor admiration, happiness to the heart. The restless spirit will yearn for a
                     something above this worldly glitter—a something higher than shining gems and
                     rich attire."
                  There was a knock at the boudoir door, and the next moment Lord Harcourt
                     entered the apartment. He flung himself at full length on a sofa, and turning
                     his face towards his wife exclaimed,
                  "Well, my little beauty, how did you enjoy yourself last night, at Lady
                     Walford's fete?"
                  
                  "Oh! very well, my lord, much better than I had anticipated."
                  "So you wasn't disappointed, hey? Well, I'm glad you enjoyed yourself. I never
                     felt prouder in my life. The young Duke of Hereford and the Earl of Neville,
                     arm-in-arm, sauntered near where I stood concealed by the curtains of a recess,
                     and as you passed by, the duke exclaimed,
                  "For heaven's sake, Neville, tell me who is that splendid creature?"
                  "That is the Countess of Harcourt," replied the earl. "You recollect her
                     husband; he is deformed!"
                  "Yes, yes," said Hereford, "I heard of Harcourt's marriage; but where in the
                     name of wonder, did he find a bride so gloriously beautiful? Why, she will
                     eclipse the proudest beauties of the day. What could have tempted her to marry
                     him, when, with her superb beauty, she might have become a queen. But I suppose
                     she married for wealth, for it certainly does not seem possible that such a
                     being could love a hunchback."
                  "And I suppose you married me for wealth, Adelaide; but who will say you are
                     not well repaid? Look at those magnificent diamonds; there were none more
                     costly at the fete last night. Look around on the luxury that is yours, and see
                     if it be not stately enough to satisfy even a heart like thine that beats for
                     nought save pride and splendor. Yes, Adelaide, you married me for wealth, and I
                     married you for beauty. And you have found the wealth you sought, and my
                     purpose, too, is gained. I have shown the world what the human heart will
                     sacrifice for rank and pomp. But come, my dear, don't look so sober. I have
                     ordered the carriage, and when you are dressed for a ride, you will find me
                     waiting in the drawing-room."
                  As he passed from the room he caught her jewelled hand and pressed it to his
                     lips. She withdrew it, indignantly, and told him in a haughty tone, that she
                     would be ready to accompany him in a few moments. As she moved to the mirror
                     and gathered up her night-black tresses into her coquettish little hat, a flush
                     of deep crimson burned on either cheek, and her voice trembled as she murmured,
                     in a tone of disgust,
                  "The young duke was right when he said I could not love my husband, but my
                     husband was wrong when he said his wealth and title would repay me for marrying
                     him."
                  Days, and weeks past by. Lady Harcourt had become, as Lord Hereford had
                     predicted, the reigning beauty. Her society was sought and courted by the
                     fashionable world, and the most extravagant praises were lavished upon her
                     brilliant beauty. She had attended fetes and operas, had seen pomp and splendor
                     till she was heartily tired. She had mingled with the world till she had
                     learned that its gaiety and pomp is empty as the air bubble; that its homage
                     only gives the human heart a restless longing for something higher, purer and
                     better.
                  The wealth, the splendor she had anticipated and sought, had, for a little while, dazzled her
                     fancy, but its witchery soon faded, and she yearned to enjoy again the quiet
                     life of her earlier years. The gaiety, the brilliancy of the world may, for a
                     while, please the ear and eye, but it cannot satisfy the longings of the soul.
                     Life must have some object to strive for; something whereon to place its hopes,
                     its confidence, and its affections. And if it have no such object, the heart
                     must naturally sicken of a continual round of pleasure, until life itself seems
                     devoid of every attraction, and the spirit grows restless and weary. Then we
                     turn from the gay amusements of the world, disgusted with its sameness and its
                     insufficiency to yield the happiness we have vainly sought, and in our
                     eagerness to place our neglected affections upon a worthier shrine, fix them,
                     it may be upon an object which reason and circumstances must at once
                     condemn.
                  Thus it was with Lady Harcourt. She had sickened of the world's pride and
                     gaiety, and she would readily have given up all the rank and luxury that
                     surrounded her, to have become once more an inmate of the little cottage where
                     life's vanities, perplexities and disappointments, had been unthought of and
                     unfelt; where the bloom on her cheek had been brighter than the roses clinging
                     round the arbor—her heart merrier than the warbled lay of the wild bird, and
                     her fairy step more light and bounding than the golden-winged butterfly she had
                     chased so joyously.
                  She scorned and despised her husband, and yet she felt that if he were noble
                     and high-souled, she could, notwithstanding his deformity, love him fondly and
                     deeply. But he was cold and heartless. He could not sympathize with the nobler
                     and more sensitive feelings of his lovely wife, and she turned from him with a
                     natural contempt she was too frank and independent to conceal, or even vainly
                     attempt to overcome.
                  She had narrowly watched her mother, from day to day, and she thought she
                     smiled less frequently and seemed far less happy than when at the cottage. And
                     when she one day questioned her if the gay life they now led fulfilled all her
                     glowing anticipations, she answered that if it were not for the mere name she
                     would be far happier in their peaceful cottage than amid the bustle and
                     excitement of fashionable life.
                  Ah! there it is. It is name—fashion, that the human heart most fears. It will
                     sacrifice its peace, its happiness, for the mere name of wearing the costly
                     robe of aristocracy. It will wear away life in a proud castle when it yearns
                     for the happiness that dwells beneath the humble roof of the flower-wreathed
                     cottage. Oh! when will the spirit of human independence free itself from the
                     despicable shackles of name and station? When will the heart dare follow its
                     own inclinations and acknowledge allegiance only to its own free will? When
                     will life cease to crouch and bend to pale-faced aristocracy out of the
                     miserable regard it bears its gilded name?
                  Lord Harcourt had left town on business he thought of vast importance, and Lady Adelaide had gone
                     alone to Lady Neville's fete. Lady Neville was the dearest friend of Lady
                     Harcourt, and Adelaide would on no account, offend her by declining to be
                     present, as her ladyship had said, let what would happen.
                  Lady Harcourt felt restless and weary, and so, leaving the gay throng, she
                     wandered languidly through the walks of the splendid garden. She stood leaning
                     against one of the columns near the entrance of the green-house, gazing
                     silently and thoughtfully upon the full bright moon that flung its clear beams
                     over her face and form. The tiny leaves of the luxuriant vine that wound its
                     green tendrils around the snowy column, twined themselves in her soft hair as
                     she pressed her glossy head against them. The diamonds shining amid the jetty
                     mass of raven tresses, seemed to sparkle less brilliantly as the silver
                     moonlight played gently over them. The jewelled arm, looking like chiselled
                     marble in its rounded beauty, carelessly clasped the vine-wreathed column with
                     the radiant gems shining from the vine-leaves.
                  The sweet, cool air, and the gentle fragrance of summer roses, refreshed Lady
                     Harcourt's weariness, and her pale temples seemed to throb less painfully;
                     while the beautiful moonlight, streaming placidly over the rare flowers,
                     carried her back to other days, and she stood there, gazing with vacant eyes,
                     upon the divine beauty of the starry night.
                  "Dear, dear flowers," she murmured, in a tone of passionate regret, "how
                     vividly ye recall the blessed memories of my childhood! Oh! that I were back
                     once more in my humble home. One hour spent beneath its lowly roof were worth a
                     thousand in you painted world!"
                  "Art so soon weary of the world, sweet lady?" said a low, thrilling voice at
                     her side. The young countess started from her position and turned her graceful
                     head towards the intruder, just as her jewelled hand was clasped in another;
                     and the same sweet voice continued, "Spurn me not from you, Adelaide. I could
                     not longer stay from your side. I knew you were not happy, and I have come to
                     love you. Will you cast me from you again, Ada? Me that have been still true,
                     despite your own inconstancy?"
                  "Lorenze, dear Lorenze!" and Lady Harcourt pressed her hand upon her brow, and
                     murmured, in a strangely bewildered tone, "I thought you far away. Tell me, how
                     came you here, and at this hour?"
                  "Nay, dearest, ask me not; the time we may spend together is too precious to be
                     passed in useless explanations. Enough that I am here, and that I love you
                     dearer than ever. Say that you will not cast me away, Ada!"
                  "Cast you away, Lorenze, never! Think you I could bid you leave me, when my
                     heart is yearning for an object to love? No, no, Lorenze, I have been shut out
                     from the sun of affection, with the cold rays of fashion glaring upon me, till
                     I am sickened of the world, and will
                     bless you for the love you lavish upon me. I can not love my husband—his cold,
                     heartless nature forbids it. You are generous and noble, and I will love you.
                     It will not, cannot be wrong."
                  St. Leon pressed the small hand he held, and drawing her arm within his own,
                     whispered, "Do not return to the crowd within, while the moon shines down so
                     sweetly. The night is too fair to be passed even in castle walls—too much,
                     dearest like those we used to love in other days."
                  For some time they walked on in silence, each too happy in the consciousness of
                     the other's presence, to express that happiness in words. St. Leon was the
                     first to break the silence, but his tones were low and gentle as he said,
                  "Did you not say, Adelaide, when I stood by your side, that you were weary of
                     the world? that you longed to become once more the inmate of a quiet home like
                     the one where your childhood was passed?"
                  "Yes, Lorenze, I did say all this; and I may repeat it; I am weary
                     of this worldly pomp and gaiety, and I yearn for the peace and quiet I once
                     enjoyed. I have sought happiness in pride and splendor, but I have sought in
                     vain. Instead of finding happiness in the proud station I so unwisely chose, I
                     only learned, when too late, that I drove it from me when I turned from my
                     cottage home."
                  "You were young, Adelaide, and too inexperienced to understand your own heart
                     or you would not have made so unhappy a choice. But do you think that now you
                     have become accustomed to this gaiety and fashion—now that you have dwelt in
                     the luxurious castle, you could be happy in a lowly cot?"
                  "Happy, Lorenze, happy? I could be happier in the gipsies' tent, than in the
                     stately home I call my own! I could be happy anywhere did I know there was a
                     heart to love me; a being to whom I could cling through sunshine and storm—one
                     whom I could love, not for rank, but for a noble heart and lofty soul."
                  "And could you leave your castle home to dwell in one far, far humbler? Could
                     you give up the admiration of the world and be content with the changeless
                     devotion of a single heart? Could you forego your stately pride to dwell in
                     plain obscurity, with only one to care for you?"
                  "Gladly, gladly, Lorenze, I am sickened of this artificial life—this vain,
                     insipid pomp and show. The very luxury around me is hateful to my sight, for
                     the existence I am breathing away is passed in useless seeking after enjoyment
                     that cannot be. My life has on object to make it interesting, save the pursuit
                     of pleasure; and what is pleasure to a heart that contains one particle of
                     life's true energy—one thought of lofty impulse and noble feeling; like the
                     empty casket to the eye that seeks the diamonds it once contained; like the
                     mocking echo to the voice that cries for mercy. No, Lorenze, I can endure this
                     flimsy life no longer. I must have some object to love, some purpose to live
                     for."
                  
                  "Adelaide," and St. Leon clasped her white hand in his, and fixed his dark,
                     fascinating eyes upon her face, "Adelaide, you say you do not love your
                     husband—that he is cold and stern. Is it not wrong to dwell with one whom you
                     so bitterly despise? Is it not wrong to glide with graceful steps and a face
                     all radiant with smiles amid the luxury of your proud castle, when, in your
                     heart, the serpent of hatred points its venomed head toward the master of the
                     wealth you revel in? Tell me, Ada, does not all this seem like a mockery to the
                     solemn vows of wedlock?"
                  He paused for an answer, but no answer came from the lips that were already
                     pale and quivering. Lady Harcourt's face was turned from him, but the hand he
                     held fluttered in his clasp, and he saw the influence he had gained. He drew
                     the fair arm closer in his, and continued, in the same low tone of thrilling
                     eloquence:
                  "While the heart wears its sacred chains lightly and happily—while it bends not
                     beneath the weight, those vows should be kept holy as the promise of an angel.
                     But when the heart looks upon its plighted vows with scorn, contempt, and
                     hatred; when the chains become heavy and galling, and the face cannot smilingly
                     greet the object of its hatred without inwardly breaking every vow it can no
                     longer hold sacred, then the laws of man may yield to those of nature, and the
                     heart may no longer wear, with repulsive feelings, the chain that binds it to
                     the keenest misery a human heart can know.
                  "No, Adelaide, the vow which binds you to the Earl of Harcourt is not
                     inviolable. Had you ever loved him—had you ever cherished for him one feeling
                     of respect—to break that vow would be a crime. But you have not. You married
                     him when every affection was placed upon another. You married him when you were
                     too young to understand the nature of the vows you were plighting; and even
                     when the words of God's minister were falling upon your ear, you were thrilled
                     with the misery you felt when the last words of the only one you ever loved
                     sank into your heart. You have sat for hours by your husband's side when, in
                     imagination, you were sitting with another. You have listened to your husband's
                     voice when your heart was echoing the unspoken words of an ideal tone. Yes,
                     Adelaide, you have smiled upon an earl when you were yearning for a single word
                     from a lowly peasant.
                  "That peasant, Ada, is beside you. He can offer you naught but an humble
                     cottage, and the wild, passionate, devoted affection of a true and faithful
                     heart. Will you be his, Adelaide; will you trust the happiness of your future
                     to his keeping? You love me, Ada, madly, passionately. You can never be happy
                     without the heart I offer you. I am a peasant, it is true; but, in the firm
                     consciouness of my own right, I dare kneel thus at the feet of Harcourt's proud
                     countess, and ask, once again, Will you be mine?"
                  He knelt at Lady Harcourt's feet, his radiant face eloquent with devotion, his
                     fascinating eyes raised to the
                     countess' pale face, and her trembling hand still clasped in his. For a single
                     instant her eyes answered the gaze that rested upon her own, but only for an
                     instant, and then her hand was withdrawn and the young countess sank upon a
                     rustic seat and buried her face in her hands.
                  Love, duty, honor, happiness—all in that young heart wrestled for the mastery.
                     Which should be conqueror?
                  Thoughts came rushing over the mind like mountain waves. She remembered that of
                     late her husband had been unusually cold and stern. That he had many times
                     spoken unkindly, nay, harshly to her. She despised her husband—she was sickened
                     of her luxurious home—she scorned the proud, heartless world. She thought how
                     she had, in by-gone days, plighted her vows of constancy to her peasant lover.
                     She remembered the happy hours she had passed with him, wandering in the fields
                     and groves, gathering the fragrant flowers, and singing sweet songs at the rosy
                     hour of twilight, or when the silver moon looked kindly down from her vaulted
                     home. She saw the mishapen form of her husband standing in mocking contrast by
                     St. Leon's handsome person. She knew that to pass her life in the castle of her
                     wedded lord, would be to pass it in misery. To pass it with St. Leon, it
                        must be one of happiness.
                  The struggle raging in her heart became yet wilder. Which should be the
                     conqueror? With one wave of his mysterious wand, Love swept the trembling
                     citadel and placed his rosy seal of triumph upon the fluttering heart, with all
                     the dainty haughtiness of a proud victor. Lorenze St. Leon stood, with folded
                     arms and firm lip, gazing upon the queenly form of the elegant countess, when
                     the bowed head was proudly raised, and the sweet face beamed with a trusting
                     smile, as she placed her jewelled hand in his, and in a low tone said:—
                  "From this hour I am yours."
               
               
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              The mask is off—the charm is wrought—
                              And Selim to his heart has caught,
                              In blushes, more than ever bright,
                              His Nourmahal.
                           
                        
                        LIGHT OF THE HAREM.
                     
                  
                  It was night—still, dark, and starless. Like a regal palace rose the stately
                     Castle of Harcourt through the gathering darkness of the night shadows. But one
                     solitary light shone from the lofty edifice, and that seemed shining but dimly,
                     as its fitful rays glimmered through the richly-draperied window of Lady
                     Harcourt's luxurious boudoir.
                  Standing by a window, with one hand holding back the curtains that swept the
                     rich carpet, and gazing abstractedly forth upon the night, was the Lady Ade- laide. Her superb form was enveloped
                     in a costly cloak of embroidered velvet, and an exquisite, little hat of the
                     same material sat pettishly upon her glossy head, with its profusion of raven
                     plumes drooping over the white forehead and partly concealing the glorious
                     face. There were no tears upon her cheek—none sparkling in her dark, brilliant
                     eyes. Her face was marble-pale, and the proud lip was pressed together with a
                     firmness which told the strong, unbending will of the beautiful and haughty
                     woman.
                  She was that night to leave her stately home forever, but she left it by her
                     own choice; and the strong-minded Lady Harcourt was not one to regret a choice
                     that promised so much for future happiness, nor to shed a torrent of weak,
                     foolish tears over a decision which the world might condemn, but which her own
                     heart knew was made for future peace.
                  And what is the world, that we should so fear its censure—so love its praise?
                     "Tis a place where the young heart, beating with hope and genius, struggles
                     bravely to attain its noble object, and receive, as its reward, scorn, neglect
                     and coldness, till every warm feeling is turned into bitterness; every high
                     hope broken, and the heart itself crushed like the flower whose gentle head is
                     bent to the lowly earth by the harsh, chilling blast. 'Tis a place where the
                     arrow of sorrow is aimed at the breast that seeks its smile; where the innocent
                     heart that believes it all truth and happiness, is blighted by its unkindness
                     and deceit; where, in place of encouragement, the young and struggling spirit
                     of genius receives contempt, and the stricken soul, instead of sympathy, the
                     cold smile and mocking sneer.
                  Oh! ye who yearn for happiness, seek it in a spot where the smooth tongue of
                     flattery cannot sully its brightness; where the wily smile covers not a
                     deceitful heart; where the icy taunt of scorn may not crush every noble
                     thought, every gentle feeling, and every spark of genius. No, no; if ye desire
                     happiness, seek it on the solitary desert, rather than in the heartless,
                     artificial world! Place every high hope and noble dream upon the holy altar of
                     Heaven, and thy reward shall come from Him who can give to the heart that seeks
                     it at His hands, peace and happiness for this life and for the life
                     hereafter.
                  While Lady Harcourt yet stood gazing from the window, the clock struck twelve.
                     She dropped the curtain, and, as she turned from the window, muttered, while a
                     cold smile of triumph curled the proud lip:—
                  "Ha! ha! methinks Lord Harcourt will wonder much, when he returns, to find his
                     prisoned bird thus early flown!"
                  She did not pause to give the room where she had passed so many hours, even a
                     farewell looks; but, as she swept from the apartment, said:—
                  "If I am acting rightly, I am leaving misery behind; but if wrongly, may God
                     forgive me."
                  She passed through the drawing-room and hall to the outer entrance, where a close carriage was in
                     waiting. The coachman sprang from his box, opened the carriage-door, and the
                     next moment the lady sank upon the rich cushions, the sole occupant of the
                     vehicle. In an instant the coachman was in his place, and gathering up the
                     reins, the impatient and spirited horses were soon moving at a pace which
                     would, in the day-time, have excited the suspicions of every honest pedestrain.
                     But the noble animals sped on with almost lightning rapidity, and the
                     fashionable world reposed on their soft couches, or reveled at some princely
                     banquet, little dreaming that the proudest of their number—the flattered, the
                     caressed, the envied Countess of Harcourt—was even then, alone and unattended,
                     flying from her luxurious home to the lowly cot of the peasant.
                  The sun had already risen when Lady Harcourt's carriage came in sight of the
                     spot which had been the countess former residence. There she was to meet
                     Lorenzo St. Leon; and there, at her request, was she to pass her future life.
                     As she let down the sash, she immediately recognized the familiar hedge where
                     she had, in childhood, gathered the spring roses; and, leaning from the window,
                     she clasped her hands in wonder, as her eyes fell upon the spot she once called
                     her home.
                  She no longer saw the plain, simple cottage, with its low, woodbine-covered
                     porch; but in its place rose one much larger, and so beautiful and fairy-like,
                     that Lady Harcourt thought, for an instant, it must have been placed there by
                     the magic of the wizard.
                  It was almost hidden by the luxuriant vines which covered the long windows, and
                     large, exquisitely built portico. On the broad marble steps of the portico
                     stood rich vases, containing the rarest exotics; and on each side of the walk
                     was a marble figure of the most beautiful sculpture.
                  Lady Harcourt could scarcely believe her own eyes, when the coachman opened the
                     carriage-door, and she walked slowly up the smooth avenue. And if she had not
                     noticed the aged yews which had shaded her mother's cottage, she would hardly
                     have believed this exquisite spot to be the home of her childhood. As she was
                     entering the open door, she paused to gaze with admiration upon the kneeling
                     figure of a little marble flower-girl. The hat of the beautiful creature was
                     thrown carelessly back,—and the sweet, childlike face, wearing a timid, gentle
                     expression, that deeply enhanced its virgin beauty, was slightly upraised. On
                     one arm the sculptor had placed a small basket, in which were bouquets and
                     wreaths of waxen flowers, looking as if still fresh with diamond-like dew. The
                     other arm, round and plump as that of infancy, was gracefully extended, and in
                     the small hand was held a bunch of moss roses, which she seemed entreating Lady
                     Harcourt to accept.
                  Long and earnestly did the young countess gaze upon this rare gem of art, and
                     an involuntary tear started to her eye as she marked the earnest, supplicating
                        expres- sion of the sweet face,
                     and the seemingly forced smile, which seemed, to cover a sea of unshed
                     tears.
                  But the lady's admiration did not overcome her curiosity, and she passed into
                     the hall. The parlor door was opened and Lady Harcourt entered it to await the
                     appearance of St. Leon, who, much to her ladyship's surprise and apprehension,
                     had not yet appeared, to welcome her. She paused a few moments to admire the
                     elegant taste displayed in the neat, yet rich furniture, and then, moving to
                     the open window, which looked out upon the beautiful garden, she stood, wrapt
                     in thought, gazing upon the beauty without, while the silken curtain half
                     concealed her form. A light step pressed the carpet, and a low voice said:—
                  "Adelaide!"
                  The fair countess turned from the window and raised her dark eyes to him who
                     had spoken her name. She started suddenly, and the paleness of death succeeded
                     the rosy tinge of her cheek and lip, for before her, with his arms calmly
                     folded, stood her husband! For an instant the beautiful woman returned the gaze
                     that seemed to challenge her own, but the full, proud lip was quivering, and
                     her strength seemed leaving her, and sinking upon a sofa, she muttered,
                     coldly:—
                  "I am punished!"
                  "Yes, Adelaide, you are punished, and sufficiently too, I hope.
                     But don't look so serious, dearest, and I will do all in my power to comfort
                     you."
                  This was said in a merry tone, and while the countess sat gazing upon him,
                     speechless with wonder, Lord Harcourt removed, a wig from his head, a
                     tight-fitting coat which contained the hideous hump, the ferocious whiskers
                     which had concealed his features, resumed his natural gait,—and there were the
                     dark clustering curls, the noble brow, the open smile, and the proud, handsome
                     form of Lorenze St. Leon! He ran to the portico, and snatching the bunch of
                     moss roses from the head of the flower-girl, knelt before the still speechless
                     countess, and presented the bouquet for her acceptance, with a grace that would
                     have done honor to the most gallant of courtiers.
                  But no answering smile wreathed the still pale features of Lady Harcourt. She
                     took the roses, it is true, but the gaze with which they were presented was all
                     lost upon her, for as soon as she could command her voice, she said, laying her
                     hand upon his shoulder and gazing steadily in his face:—
                  "Tell me, are you Lord Harcourt or Lorenze?"
                  "Oh, as for that matter, just whichever you please," was the merry answer. "In
                     London they called me Lord Harcourt, but here, in our pretty little home, I
                     have no objection against being called Lorenzo. But who will you be—shall I
                     address you as Lady Harcourt or Adelaide?"
                  The young countess could bear such mystery no longer, and raising her eyes
                     supplicatingly to her husband's face, she said,
                  "Now if you love me, Lorenze, do explain, if you can, this strange
                     mystery."
                  
                  "Well, Ada, if you really cannot be happy without my telling you a long story,
                     I will commence now and get through as quickly as possible, provided I succeed
                     in satisfying your ladyship."
                  "I was left an orphan in my earliest years, and my childhood was passed far,
                     very far from Harcourt Castle, or this pretty spot. I resided with my father's
                     brother, in a beautiful cottage, the exact counterpart of this, our own sweet
                     home. My uncle was both wise and good, and I loved him as they only love who
                     have but one to look to as parent and friend. He had early learned, from some
                     cause or other, to distrust the world and despise its follies; and he lived a
                     life of quiet seclusion, which seemed to soothe and heal the wound the world
                     had given one of the noblest of hearts.
                  "It may have been my sympathy with his thoughts and feelings that taught me to
                     love the life he led, and to look upon the wealth and fashion of the world as
                     gross and empty. But certain it is, I grew up with a wild enthusiastic love of
                     nature, and a dread, almost hatred, of the world and its pomp. Often, while
                     strolling in the portico of my uncle's beautiful cottage, would I fall into one
                     of those waking dreams which taught me to look into the future—to the time when
                     I should wander through the grove and watch the silver starlight, with the
                     ideal of my fancy to sympathize with the inspiration the wild beauties of
                     nature awakened in my heart.
                  "These wild, idle dreamings awoke still wilder ones. I wished to be loved, but
                     loved for myself and not for my gold. From such
                     dreams and fancies, I was thrown into the deepest grief by the death of my
                     dear, kind uncle. I mourned for him with sincere sorrow, and the beautiful
                     cottage seemed like a silent charnel-house, without his beloved presence. I
                     determined to travel until the poignacy of my grief should be somewhat
                     alleviated, and having some affairs to look after, I resolved to visit Harcourt
                     Castle for the first time since my childhood.
                  "On my way thither, I passed through this pretty village, and for the first
                     time, met my fair Adelaide. I saw you, Ada, when passing the cottage, and
                     determined to win you in the guise of a lowly peasant. You were the embodiment
                     of all the wild dreams I had so long cherished, and from the first moment I
                     beheld you I loved you with a deep and lasting passion. As a peasant I sought
                     your society, and as a peasant I won your love.
                  "I discovered in your mother the ambition which aspired to a more noble match
                     than my humble self, for her gifted and beautiful child. I discovered in
                     yourself, or thought I did, a yearning for pomp and glitter, and I determined
                     to drop my assumed name, that of St. Leon, and to sue for your hand as Lord
                     Harcourt. I procured the disguise I have just now thrown aside, and as a
                     hideous hunchback, sought your hand, and, to my astonishment and regret, was
                     accepted.
                  "I met you in the garden an hour before you were wedded to the hunchback, and I almost relented
                     the part I had assumed. But I had resolved to punish the pride I so much
                     disliked, and before the nuptials took place, I had again assumed my disguise.
                     You are well acquainted with what has since followed. You have, like myself,
                     become disgusted with show and gaiety, and have learned that the pride of the
                     lordly castle cannot keep the heart warm, nor awake its noble aspirations.
                  "I have once again won you to my heart and home, as the lowly peasant, and now,
                     if you are satisfied with castle life, we will spend the remainder of our days
                     in our rustic cottage."
                  Adelaide expressed herself perfectly satisfied with the glittering fashion of
                     the past, and her husband was delighted with the praise she bestowed upon the
                     beautiful cottage, and the pleasure she anticipated for the future. When the
                     once ambitious mother arrived at the new home of her children, she could
                     scarcely find words to express the joy she felt; but she did not acknowledge
                     that she had never been happy in their stately castle.
                  Long and happy was the life our graceful couple passed in their country home.
                     They were beloved and respected by the surrounding peasantry, to whom they were
                     known as Lord and Lady Harcourt. Many were the blessings showered upon the
                     benevolent inmates of Harcourt Cottage—for thus it was designated by the
                     peasantry.
                  If the reader doubts my estimate of the happiness of our noble cottagers, he
                     should have the privilege of glancing at the group seated in the rose-covered
                     portico, on a bright summer evening.
                  The pretty children, seated on the marble steps, playing with the bright
                     flowers or listening to some charming story told by the delighted grandmother;
                     and more than all, the sunny smile beaming from the handsome features of Lord
                     Harcourt, and the radiant face of his beautiful wife, would convince the
                     reader—if still he doubted—that, though in Harcourt Castle the romantic pair
                     found only pride and pomp, in Harcourt Cottage they found happiness and
                     peace.
               
            
            
               
               DEATH OF THE HOUSE HOLD PET.
               
                  The sunbeams play upon the floor
                  As in the days agone;
                  The rays dance through the open door
                  As they have done so oft before
                  On many a sunny morn.
               
               
                  The kitten lies upon the hearth
                  And sleeps the hours away;
                  She never frolics now in mirth,
                  But seems to feel the household dearth
                  That e'en would mock her play.
               
               
                  The ringing laugh no more is heard,
                  That cheered the home ones on;
                  They hear no sweetly prattled word,—
                  The nest hath lost its singing bird,
                  The little pet hath gone.
               
               
                  The father's voice is mute with grief,
                  The mother weeps in woe,
                  But sorrow brings them no relief,
                  They miss the sunlight bright and brief,
                  That blessed them here below.
               
               
                  The music of the dancing feet
                  That pattered o'er the floor,
                  The prattling tone so gently sweet,
                  The bounding form they used to meet—
                  They will come back no more.
               
               
                  They miss the little sunny face,
                  The floating curls of gold,
                  They see the form of childish grace
                  As it lies within its narrow place,
                  All motionless and cold.
               
               
                  They miss the lost one's sweet caress—
                  The tone of silver strain;
                  They know the heart that throbbed to bless
                  With its little world of tenderness
                  Will never throb again.
               
               
                  They gather round the fireside yet—
                  They mark the vacant chair,
                  And quickly every eye is wet,
                  For the darling one, the cherub pet,
                  She is not, is not there.
               
               
                  Then let the sunlight come and go,
                  Around that silent hearth,—
                  Those sad hearts feel that here below
                  There is no balm to heal their woe,
                  No star to brighten earth.
               
               
                  A shade is o'er the household cast,
                  The sweet home-light hath set;
                  And every joy in life seems past—
                  Each life-flower withered by the blast
                  That chilled the household pet.
               
            
            
               
               CHURCH-BELL CHIMES.
               How sweetly and solemnly they float on the clear air of a bright Sabbath morning.
                  How like the low whisper of an angel voice they steal upon the listening ear and
                  waken in the heart-cells the slumbering memories of other days. It is one of my
                  life's sweetest pleasures to listen, on a dewy summer's morning, to the low, soft
                  music of these chiming bells,—when the still quiet of everything around, and the
                  clear blue sky—bluer, clearer, purer than on other days—seems proclaiming to the
                  unheeding one that this is the Sabbath, the calm, holy Sabbath; when the birds
                  seem warbling sacred notes as they glide by with noiseless wings, and the
                  azure-hued flowers seem bending their meek heads as the silvery praises of the
                  golden-feathered songsters float by them, borne up to heaven on the sweet breeze
                  of summer.
               How quickly do the chiming bells carry me back to other days;—to the little
                  village where my childish feet first trampled the spring violets, and my young
                  heart first learned to love the music of the wild birds. There was but one church
                  in the village, but the bell that hung in the belfry was sweet-toned and clear,
                  and as its kindly voice called the happy villagers to their Sabbath worship, I
                  thought its sounding chime far sweeter than the richest strains I have ever heard
                  since. And when I wandered among the gravestones of white and gray in the little
                  churchyard, at the sweet roseate hour of twilight, the same soft chiming of the
                  church-bells came floating upon the dim air, seeming only more silvery, more
                  subdued than at morn.
               How I wondered when my mother would clasp my hand tightly in hers, and drawing me
                  to a grave that was beneath a spreading willow, kneel upon its green mound and
                  weep till I thought her tears must wet the coffin that lay beneath the cold green
                  sod. Yes, I used to wonder then how she could weep, when the evening was so
                  beautiful and fair. I thought, in my childish simplicity, that tears should never
                  flow at such an hour and amid a scene of such pure beauty. Ah! I knew not what a
                  luxury it is to weep when the sweet calm evening gathers its darkling drapery of
                  twilight silence around us. I knew not that tears are like the balm-words of
                  angels to the stricken heart.
               A blessing rest on the memory of those sweet days! those witching hours of sunny
                  childhood, when the goal of my ambition was a mother's smile—my greatest sorrow a
                  mother's tear. Other days have come, and other ties are woven round the
                  harp-strings of my heart. I hear no more the warbling of the wild bird in my
                  native village; my feet no longer press the azure flowered in childish glee.
                  Life's rosy time has passed me by, and its sky-hued flowers are withered and dead;
                     but they yet lie in the deep casket
                  of my heart, blighted and broken, like the ideal dreams of childhood.
               But, though these olden scenes are past—these olden dreams laid low by Time's
                  blasting wing—yet they seem to throng around me in all the sweet freshness of
                  by-gone beauty, when I hear the church-bells chiming for Sabbath worship, and
                  listen to the rich praises of the summer birds. And I think, while they seem
                  sweeping over the strings of my heart, awakening memories that have long been
                  hidden by the shadow of time, how welcome would be a grave in that far-off village
                  churchyard, where my young feet strayed long years ago and my childish heart
                  thrilled with the silver song of each warbling bird. And my last prayer shall be
                  that I may rest there when my spirit shall seek its home in yonder happy world,
                  and my ear be greeted with the soothing sound of the chime-bells of Heaven.
            
            
               BEAUTY AND INTELLECT.
               "My dear, do you not fear cousin Alice will supplant you in the Charles'
                  affections?" quietly asked Mrs. Leslie.
               "Supplant me! mother, what do you mean?"
               "As I say, Emma; do you not fear the power of Alice's superior intellect upon the
                  intelligent mind of Charles Mordaunt?"
               "Fear Alice Arnot! with her plain face? Me, the admired and courted Emma Leslie,
                  fear a being who cannot claim one gem from beauty's casket."
               "But, my dear, you know the brilliant conversational powers of Alice, soon make
                  one forget that her features are not beautiful. As for me, I somewhat fear the
                  effect of such intellect as Alice's upon Charles' truly lofty mind."
               "Ha! ha! mother; do you really think I need fear Alice Arnot? Why she might
                  converse as eloquently as the pleased for a whole hour, and one smile from my face
                  would drive every word from his memory. What if she has intellect; if beauty be
                  wanting she may as well talk to the winds; for, believe me, mother, nought but
                  beauty can captivate the heart of Charles Mordaunt." And the lovely Emma Leslie
                  drew up her stately form and curled her
                  superb lip as she glanced in the costly mirror.
               'T was night. The proud mansion of the aristocratic Mr. Leslie, glittered with
                  lights brighter than the starry gems of heaven. The drawing-rooms were crowded
                  with the fairest flowers of the aristocracy, and the splendor displayed in the
                  magnificent parlors of the millionaire dazzled the eye, till one would almost deem
                  himself dreaming in a fairy palace.
               The soft rays from many lamps fell daintily on the rich damask curtains, lending a
                  glowing, rosy-hued light to the spacious rooms that rivalled the fairest beams of
                  an Italian sunset. Sweet music was poured forth in rich, melodious notes. Now, in
                  wild, ravishing strains that thrilled the very soul with its intense melody, and
                  then melting into low, soft notes, that stole upon the perfumed air like tinkling
                  bells from some far-off fairy haunt.
               And beauty was there, in all its pride and loveliness. Fair blondes, with their
                  sunny tresses floating gacefully over snow-white shoulders, and dark-eyed
                  brunettes, with braids of raven hair shading their madonna-like brows, promenaded
                  the magnificent saloons.
               But the brightest star in the gay throne was Emma Leslie. And gloriously beautiful
                  did she look; moving like an orient queen among her guests. All bowed at the
                  shrine of her peerless beauty; and the noble heart of Charles Mordaunt, the hero
                  of the night, thrilled with admiration, as he gazed upon her transcendent
                  loveliness. Yes, his heart thrilled with admiration, but not love, for he wished
                  for something more than mere beauty to tempt him to lay his heart a willing
                  sacrifice on love's sweet altar. He knew that Emma Leslie, though very lovely, was
                  wanting in the pure sincerity and loftiness of soul which gives the real charm to
                  woman.
               Emma led Charles to where her mother and cousin were seated, and with a peculiar
                  smile, as her mother's eyes rested upon her, introduced him to Alice Arnot. A soft
                  blush overspread her features, as her eyes met those of Charles Mordaunt. He
                  noticed it, and offered his arm for a promenade.
               "Emma," said Mrs. Leslie, "I fancied Alice looked almost pretty, with that crimson
                  blush on her cheek, as Charles led her away. Do you not feel sorry you introduced
                  her?"
               "No indeed; why should I fear Alice Arnot? Do I look as though she could be a
                  dangerous rival?"
               Mordaunt led Alice out upon the flower-wreathed balcony; and, as her timidity wore
                  away, he listened to her interesting conversation with unwonted interest.
                  Unconsciously did she talk on, thrilling the gifted mind of Charles with the
                  eloquent thoughts that flowed like music from her lips, till he forgot that she
                  was plain—forgot all, save the low, silvery voice he was listening to. He gazed
                  into her dark eyes, and marked how expressively they beamed, while she talked of
                     subjects too sublime to think of
                  lightly. He fancied he saw mirrored in their clear depths, the high and noble
                  soul, which lent inspiration to each word she uttered. He knew that beneath that
                  plain face dwelt a mind of lofty, glorious intellect; he cared not for more; his
                  heart was already won,—he had found a true woman, and he was happy. He deemed
                  Alice Arnot, with her plain face and brilliant intellect, far above her fairer
                  cousin, with all her outward charms of glowing beauty.
               Emma Leslie curled her pretty lip with vexation, as she noticed the marked
                  attention Charles bestowed upon Alice. He scarcely seemed aware of her presence.
                  For him, Emma's beauty had indeed lost its charm.
               From that night, until Alice's departure, Mordaunt was a constant visitor at the
                  mansion of Mr. Leslie: and when Alice departed for her beautiful home on the banks
                  of the majestic Hudson, Charles accompanied her.
               When Alice Arnot again visited Emma Leslie, it was as the bride of Charles
                  Mordaunt.
               Poor Emma had learned a bitter lesson. She had loved Mordaunt as devotedly as her
                  heartless nature was capable of loving; and had felt no little pride when she
                  deemed his manly heart her own. But now that pride was humbled. Intellect had won
                  the victory over beauty, and Emma Leslie learned, too late, that beauty, without
                  intellect, is as the casket without the gem.
            
            
               FLOWERS IN THE SICK ROOM.
               "Throw them away," said the stern-faced physician; "throw them away—this is no
                  place for such things!"
               Throw them away! throw away the only things in that darkened room, which call up a
                  dream of the beauty she will never see again, when the eye of the pale invalid
                  rests upon them! throw away the only things in that room which give it such a look
                  of gleaming sunshine, the only things which bring a bright, glad smile, over the
                  wan cheek of the sick girl; for as she gazes on the beautiful emblems, she thinks
                  of the fairer, brighter flowers, blooming in the better land to which she is so
                  quietly and surely hastening. Flowers which the cold winds of chill autumn may not
                  blight! flowers which will not fade away when the spring bloom is on them, like
                  her own life.
               Methinks had the thoughtless physician seen the sunny spot in the dark eye of his
                  patient, and the bright flush which came over the white cheek, when those bright
                  flowers were first brought into her silent room, he would not have said so coldly,
                  'throw them away." For the unnatural brilliancy in those dark eyes, the beautiful
                  flush of such delicate brightness on either cheek, tells that when the summer
                  flowers shall bloom again in sweetness and beauty, she will not behold them! tells that when another season puts
                  forth its bright buds and blossoms, the sun-hued flowers will bloom upon her early
                  grave!
               Then throw them not away! they will do more good than all the medicine the
                  physician ever will give her. Rather throw away his useless medicines; for they
                  will not save her life, neither will they bring one thrill of joy to her heart.
                  But those bright flowers with their sweet fragrance and sun-like beauty, they will
                  bring a warmth like then olden gladness into that sinking heart; they will give a
                  gleam of sunshine to the dark stream, whose cold waters she must pass alone.
               Many months have I been an invalid. Many hours, lonely and weary, have I passed in
                  my sick room, and many times have the flowers which kind friends have often sent
                  me, brought a thrill to my heart, and a tear to my eye. For they wake dreams of
                  other days, ere my step had grown slow, or my cheek had lost the red hue of
                  health. Then place flowers in the sick room! place them where the eye of the weary
                  invalid may rest often upon their beauty; for they soothe the couch of sickness
                  like angel smiles, and bring dreams of a sunnier land over the faint and dying
                  one.
            
            
               SHALL I BE MISSED?
               
                  Shall I be missed if I pass from earth
                  When the sweet wild flowers are springing to birth?
                  Will Time's bright stream flow on as fair,
                  And home be the same if I am not there?
                  Will the faces I love wear the same gay smile,
                  And hearts I have cherished beat lightly the while?
                  Will my bird sing on with warbling breath,
                  If the voice of its mistress be hushed in death?
               
               
                  If my form be laid in the damp, cold earth,
                  Will a gloom rest over the household hearth?
                  Will the home ones think how I stood by their side,
                  At the morning hour and the even-tide?
                  Will they weep when they think how I loved them all,
                  How I cherished each word that would lightly fall?
                  Can kindred and friends I have loved of your,
                  Forget this heart when it beats no more?
               
               
                  Ah! friends will sigh when they hear it said
                  That a loved one sleeps with the lovely dead,
                  But the tones of others will cheer their lot—
                  Other faces will come, and mine be forgot.
                  Wild tears from kindred hearts will flow,
                  But time will pass and assuage their woe;
                  My face will glide from each sorrowing heart,
                  But my name and my memory ne'er will depart.
               
               
               
                  But there's one heart that within the grave
                  Will bury each hope in life's dark wave;
                  There will be one wound, time ne'er may heal,—
                  One soul forever its woe will feel;
                  There will ever be sorrow in one dear tone,
                  There will be despair in each fitful moan;—
                  Ah! none can soothe her anguish wild,
                  None know how the mother will miss her child.
               
               
                  She will miss my care when old age comes on,
                  She will miss my love when its light is gone;
                  She will miss my tears when her own are shed,
                  She will miss the form that is cold and dead.
                  Oh! I have no fear of the last faint sigh,
                  Yet I ask that Death may pass me by;
                  And my prayer for life, may Heaven forgive—
                  My mother, my mother, for thee would I live!
               
            
            
               THE BALL-ROOM BEAUTY.
               
                  CHAPTER I.
                  Let me usher you, dear reader, into the elegantly furnished drawing-room of a
                     large and stately mansion.
                  The long windows are curtained with crimson drapery; and the rich furniture,
                     the costly works of art, and the unmistakable air of elegance and refinement
                     blended with the spell of luxury, bespeak the princely wealth of its noble
                     occupant.
                  The polished grate with its bright, cheerful fire, sheds a glowing, warmth
                     throughout the apartment, for the day has been cold and chilly. In a small
                     niche, half concealed by a silken curtain, stands a rich French writing table.
                     It is strewn with papers—and before it sits a gentleman with his arms
                     carelessly folded, and his dark eyes fixed vacantly upon the table. He is
                     evidently wrapt in a profound revery.
                  While he sits there so quietly, apparently unconscious of aught around him, let
                     us examine his features.
                  His brow is broad and high, and the short, glossy curls of raven hair which
                     shade it, contrast finely with its marble whiteness. The handsome features are
                     classically moulded, but the large dark eyes, whose every glance reveals the noble soul within, lend
                     expression to every lineament. Ah, his was that proud beauty, whereon Nature
                     had placed her stamp of nobility.
                  And Norman Stuart possessed no ordinary soul. No, his was a mighty intellect;
                     his every thought the jewel of a lofty spirit. He had, the previous evening,
                     delivered and an elegant extemporaneous address before a large and delighted
                     audience. And as she sat there in the drawing-room of his own elegant mansion,
                     he was thinking over the events of the last evening, and, in imagination, the
                     deafening applause of the assembling still sounded in his ears.
                  He had been sitting thus nearly an hour, when the door suddenly opened, and a
                     young man entered. He stood for a moment with his hand upon the silver door
                     knob, and then bursting into a merry laugh, said, as he approached the
                     dreamer,
                  "Why, my dear fellow, what are you thinking about? Are you not going to the
                     ball this evening? for, if what rumor says, prove true, it will be a splendid
                     affair," and the young man carelessly threw himself upon a velvet sofa to await
                     the answer of his friend.
                  Stuart sat for a moment buried in deep thought and then replied,
                  "No, Charles, I believe I cannot attend to-night. I have important business
                     which needs my attention at home, and besides I have no fancy for such
                     frivolous amusements."
                  "Oh! Stuart," said Charles, rising from the sofa; "this is too bad, when, you
                     almost promised me last week that you would go. But you must; I will not let
                     you off so easily; why, it is to be the grandest ball of the season, and I
                     understand Florence Sidney, then celebrated belle, will be present, so say you
                     will go—I will call for you at ten." After receiving an affirmative answer,
                     Charles departed.
                  Stuart drew his chair before the glowing fire and sat for a few moments, musing
                     upon the conversation of his friend; suddenly he said half aloud,
                  "A ball-room belle! why should I wish to see her? and yet I will go to please
                     Mapleton!" and he rose to prepare himself for the ball. Ah, Norman Stuart, me
                     thinks thy willingness to please thy friend was not thine only motive for
                     complying with his request!
                  He had heard of Florence Sidney, and though he would not acknowledge even to
                     himself, that he had accepted Mapleton's invitation merely to behold her, yet
                     so it was. He was an ardent worshipper at the shrine of beauty, and the reports
                     he had heard of Miss Sidney's loveliness had excited a desire to behold
                     her.
                  He was much longer than usual performing the duties of the toilet, and a little
                     sparkle of pride—a very little, shone in his dark eyes, as he surveyed his
                     elegant form and handsome face in the large mirror of his dressing-room.
                  Charles Mapleton, punctual to the moment, rung at the door just as the clock
                     struck ten. The two friends soon reached the brilliantly-lighted hall, and a
                        moment after were mingling with
                     the gay, joyous throng. Stuart was leaning over the chair of a fair friend,
                     when Mapleton, touching his arm, whispered,
                  "Come with me, and I will give you an introduction to Miss Sidney."
                  Stuart took his friend's arm and accompanied him into the next room.
                  They paused a moment at the door, for Miss Sidney was so completely surrounded
                     by a crowd of admirers, that it was impossible to get within "speaking
                     distance," and Stuart wished to examine her features more minutely than
                     personal acquaintance would allow.
                  She was indeed a superb creature. Her form was faultless in its queenly
                     proportions, and every movement easy and graceful. Her face was classically
                     moulded, and her complexion dazzlingly brilliant. Her eyes were of a deep blue;
                     large, lustrous, and shaded by long, silken lashes, which were allowed every
                     now and then to sweep the velvet cheek with a gracefulness perfectly
                     bewitching.
                  Her brow was broad and white as alabaster, and her hair of rich golden-hued
                     brown, like a shower of sunbeams, fell in thick clustering curls over a neck
                     rivaling the whitest marble.
                  She was attired in a snowy satin, over which was worn a rich robe of wrought
                     lace, caught up carelessly, with pearls. The short lace sleeve was looped up
                     with tiny pearl clasps, and rich bracelets sparkled upon arms of the most
                     faultlessly beautiful proportions. Indeed, her dress was most elegant and
                     recherche, and well calculated to enhance the high order of her beauty.
                  Stuart stood gazing upon the fair creature with all the passionate admiration
                     which beauty ever excites, thrilling his heart. He thought her very, very
                     lovely, but he could have wished the snowy brow a little more strictly
                     intellectual; the deep, flashing eyes more soul-like in expression; the
                     coquettish manner a little more dignified; but yet all this would pass
                     unnoticed by an admiring crowd, when her fair face was radiant with the sweet,
                     witching smile, which played so prettily around her coral lips. Stuart and his
                     friend pressed through the crowd, and Mapleton, after exchanging the usual
                     compliments, said,
                  "Miss Sidney, allow me to present my friend, Mr. Norman Stuart."
                  She arose from her seat, and bowing gracefully, while the blue eyes were cast
                     down, and the long lashes swept the beautiful cheek, murmured a few words in a
                     sweet voice, and the next moment was leaning upon his arm.
                  The heart of Stuart beat yet more rapidly when he felt the pressure of that
                     little hand upon his arm, and met the glance of those blue, brilliant eyes.
                  Every eye followed the handsome couple as they promenaded the magnificent hall,
                     and every now and then murmurs of "beautiful—so well matched—made for each
                     other," fell upon the ear of Stuart.
                  Although the young lawyer seldom danced, yet he did go through a quadrille with Miss Sidney, and
                     enjoyed it finely, too. He could scarcely tell which most enchanted him, the
                     piquant wit of her conversation, or the witching smile which made her radiant
                     face even more brilliant. He was by her side throughout the evening, and when
                     he bade her good night, and her silvery voice invited him to call at her
                     father's residence, his heart as well as voice replied, that he should accept
                     the invitation with extreme pleasure.
                  When he was once more seated before the cheerful fire in his beautiful
                     drawing-room, the dreamy spell of forgetfulness was once more flung over him.
                     But now the dream was not of fame, but love; first, passionate love! and the
                     fair form of Florence Sidney seemed in imagination yet beside him, and her
                     sweet tones yet thrilling his very soul.
                  Ah, in the bliss of that wild dream he forgot that he had seen that beautiful
                     being only in the ball-room! He forgot that he heard nought from those coral
                     lips, save the silly nothings of a vain frivolous mind! He forgot that the
                     heavenly smile of those radiant features was one of the studied acquirements of
                     the fashionable belle!
                  Ah, yes, he forgot all this, and his dreams that night were crowned with the
                     glowing flowers which love wreathes so sweetly around the youthful heart.
                  The delicious music still echoed in his ears—the gay dancers still whirled
                     before him, and a bright, beautiful fairy, who waltzed divinely, smiled
                     bewitchingly, and whose bird-like voice caused every chord in his heart to
                     thrill with a new and dream-like passion, seemed floating before him on a
                     silver-hued cloud of love, light and beauty.
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  In the richly-furnished parlor of a stately mansion, a bright, glowing fire was
                     flickering in the grate, and lending a rosy hue to the costly furniture.
                  The last faint beams of the setting sun stole through the damask drapery of the
                     windows and lingered lovingly upon the tiny marble images on the mantel. A
                     lounge was drawn up before the fire, and the reader will recognize in the
                     blue-eyed, golden-tressed lady reclining upon it, the fair Florence Sidney.
                  She had dropped the book she had been perusing—a new novel—and was gazing
                     abstractedly into the fire, watching the changing shadows of the glowing
                     flame.
                  Seated near the centre table was a young girl of some eighteen summers, whose
                     dark, expressive eyes, raven hair, and pale, intellectual face, contrasted
                     strangely with the starry eyes, sunny ringlets, and blooming complexion of
                     Florence.
                  The contrast was indeed very striking—both were beautiful, but while one
                     resembled the dark-eyed daughters of Italy, the other reminded one of the
                     sunny-hued flowers which bloom so brightly in the glorious "land of song."
                  
                  The silence had been unbroken for nearly an hour, when Florence, turning toward
                     her companion, said, in an earnest tone, "Oh! Alice, I do wish you had been
                     present at the ball last evening, you would have been delighted; why, almost
                     everybody was there, and the arrangements were magnificent; but whom do you
                     think I was introduced to?"
                  "I cannot think, I am sure,' replied Alice, after musing a few moments.
                  "You have heard of Norman Stuart?"
                  "The distinguished young barrister?"
                  "The same."
                  "Yes; I once heard him deliver an address, and a most eloquent one it was,
                     too."
                  "Well, I flirted with him the entire evening!"
                  "What, Florence; flirted with a barrister! and such a one as Norman
                     Stuart!"
                  "And why not, Alice?"
                  "Why, in the first place, I did not know that barristers ever flirted; and in
                     the second, I know that such a man as Norman Stuart would not evince the
                     slightest partiality for any woman to whom he was entirely indifferent. And
                     thus, if he would flirt—as you call it—with you, it is very evident that you
                     have made some impression upon his mind; and, really, Florence, I did not think
                     you would try to win the affections of such a soul as his but to blight them as
                     heartlessly as you have many others!"
                  The blush which glowed upon the cheek of Florence, told that the gentle reproof
                     was keenly felt, and, for a moment, she was silent; but, suddenly rising from
                     her reclining posture, she said,
                  "Alice, I wish you would come and sit here with me, on the lounge; I wish to
                     talk with you."
                  "Alice immediately laid aside her work, and seated herself beside her
                     cousin.
                  Florence seemed at first to hesitate, but after a slight pause, she
                     commenced,
                  "So you think, Alice, that Norman Stuart would not flirt unless his intentions
                     were of a serious nature?"
                  "I do most certainly think so," replied Alice, while the puzzled expression of
                     her countenance showed how perfectly amazed she felt, to hear such a sober
                     question from the lips of her frivolous cousin.
                  "Well, Alice," continued Florence, "I will tell you in confidence, that I am
                     not flirting with Stuart! You have heard, probably, that he is very wealthy,
                     keeps a splendid establishment, and, as a barrister, is very popular. Now, papa
                     was saying the other day, that the highest destiny of a woman's life was
                     accomplished, when she attained a desirable match."
                  Alice opened her dark eyes yet wider, and the expression of her face showed how
                     much of contempt as well as astonishment she felt, that such a sentiment could
                     pass the lips of a man. Florence went on.
                  "Now, I shall exert all my powers to win the heart of Stuart. Only think,
                     Alice, how grand it will seem to be the mistress of so much splendor, and how
                        much attention I shall receive as
                     the wife of the Hon. Norman Stuart!"
                  "Florence," said Alice, earnestly, "do you love Stuart?"
                  "Why, what a singular question, Alice; of course, I should love him if he were
                     my husband; and even now, I think him one of the handsomest men I have ever met
                     with. He has such an eloquent voice, and then his manners are so perfectly
                     high-bred!"
                  "Oh! Florence," exclaimed Alice, "that is not love; and could you be so
                     heartless as to win the finest affections of a noble soul, when you did not as
                     ardently reciprocate the sacred passion? could you accept the heart of a man,
                     merely because he is popular, keeps a fine establishment, and possesses a
                     handsome face? Could you promise at the altar, to be the companion, the
                     help-mate of a high and gifted nature, when in your heart you knew you were
                     plighting those sacred vows merely to gain an entree into a high circle, and
                     enjoy the attentions of that circle, bestowed for no higher acquisition that
                     being the wife of a distinguished man?"
                  "Fie, Alice; how strangely you do talk! what other motive should I have for
                     wishing to be the wife of such a man? you don't suppose I should want to wash
                     his dickeys, mend his stockings, and cook his dinners, do you?"
                  "Ah, Florence, I see you do not understand me. I mean that your heart should
                     beat in unison with his; your spirits be bound together by the sweet link of
                     kindred sympathy; and your every thought, dream, and aspiration, mingle in one
                     same stream; for, without sympathy, there can be no happiness between two
                     wedded hearts!"
                  "Happiness, indeed!" said Florence, with a scornful curl of her red lips,
                     "there would be a vast deal of happiness in studying out a husband's thoughts
                     and dreams, and allowing one's heart to be troubled with their lofty
                     aspirations, I'm thinking! No, Alice; when I marry, it will not be to study a
                     husband's happiness. It will be to admire more, and to be more admired; to see
                     more of the world and less of home; to receive calls in my own stately
                     establishment; to leave my chard in other drawing-rooms as the Hon. Mrs.
                     So-and-so. In fact, Alice, I marry to lead a brilliant life of fashion, gaiety,
                     and what I consider happiness! But it is almost dark, and I must go and arrange
                     my dress, for Mr. Stuart calls this evening, and as he is what papa calls a
                     "most desirable match," I must try and look my best!"
                  Alice sighed as her gay cousin danced out of the room and went to her own
                     apartment humming a merry song, in a light happy tone.
                  "Ah," she murmured, "can it be possible that such a mind as Norman Stuart's,
                     can be captivated with a beauteous casket when there is no jewel within?"
                  Alice forget that the fresh, piquant sayings of a frivolous beauty, commonly
                     excite more admiration than the
                     sensible conversation of a really intellectual woman. A woman of refined and
                     lofty intellect cannot fail to excite admiration, and respect, while the
                     trifling absurdities of a gay, frivolous mind, when sweetly and prettily
                     displayed by a coquettish beauty, possess a charm which the mind of a talented
                     man can seldom resist; and thus it is, that while they cannot esteem such
                     trifling inconsistencies, yet man of lofty intellect generally allow themselves
                     to be blindly captivated with the very qualities they condemn!
                  Alice Merton was an orphan and an heiress; and since her childhood had resided
                     with her uncle Sidney.
                  First the play-mate of her cousin Florence, then the companion of her girlhood,
                     she became the cherished friend—almost mother of the wilful beauty. Indeed the
                     attachment existing between them was most singular, considering the striking
                     contrast in their dispositions; for while Alice was gentle, high-minded and
                     intellectual, Florence was vain, heartless and wilful.
                  But, notwithstanding all this, the two cousins loved each other with all the
                     ardent affection which characterizes an attachment between two natures so
                     widely different.
                  Alice had often wept over the faults of her cousin; but alas! they were faults
                     of nature, and therefore not easily wiped away. She had at first remonstrated
                     earnestly and gently, but she soon found that remonstrance was useless, for
                     through Florence dearly loved her, and would listen patiently to a reproof,
                     which from others would not be borne, yet Alice perceived that it made no
                     impression upon her mind, and she soon ceased her exertions to instill into the
                     mind of Florence the lofty principles which so exalt the mind of woman.
                  When evening came, and Alice received an introduction to Norman Stuart, she was
                     more astonished than before that a man with such a mind should fancy a being so
                     like a bright-winged butterfly.
                  But, with a woman's quick discernment, she read in the glance which rested so
                     often upon the beautiful face of Florence, that the passion she had awakened in
                     his heart, was destined to color the stream of his future existence.
                  The evening passed pleasantly away, and Stuart departed to dream once more of
                     the fair creature at whose peerless shrine he so ardently worshipped, while
                     Florence was more delighted than with any previous conquest.
                  Stuart became a frequent visitor, and rumor soon announced an engagement
                     existing between the distinguished barrister and the celebrated belle.
                  Time spent on. Stuart had proposed, and was, of course, accepted. The wedding
                     day was appointed, and the unusual bustle at the Sidney mansion told that it
                     was near at hand.
                  Never beamed the sun more gloriously; never sang the birds more sweetly, than
                     on the bright spring morning which greeted the blue eyes of Florence Sidney, on
                     the day appointed for the bridal.
                  
                  "My wedded life will be very happy," she murmured, as she flung aside the light
                     muslin drapery from her window.
                  Ah! Florence, thou shouldst not judge from the rising of the sun; wait till you
                     have marked its setting!
                  The morning wore quickly away, and the golden stars of evening soon succeeded
                     the glowing sun. The mansion of the Sidneys was illuminated at an early hour,
                     and the elegant parlors presented a most brilliant appearance.
                  The guests were soon assembled, and many a young heart thrilled with happiness
                     and pride; many a fair cheek flushed with a more brilliant hue; and many a
                     starry eye sparkled brighter than the rich flood of mellow light, which fell so
                     softly upon radiant features and snowy necks.
                  The murmur of silvery voices, and the melody of bird-like music was hushed when
                     the bridal party entered.
                  Never did bridegroom look more noble than Norman Stuart; and never did a bride
                     look more like a beautiful being from some fairy festival, than did Florence
                     Sidney.
                  They stood in the center of the richly-lighted apartment; the "man of God"
                     before them; the brilliant assembly around them, and the gorgeous light from
                     rose-stained lamps falling softly upon their forms.
                  And what visions floated before the minds of each, in that fleeting moment of
                     silence? what dreams, perhaps never to be realized—were they fondly
                     cherishing?
                  The noble bridegroom saw in the brightly painted future of imagination, a
                     beautiful home, to which he should return after the business of the day was
                     over, and enjoy the companionship of the little earthly angel who was
                     henceforth to be the idol of his heart, the star of his home, the sharer of his
                     joys and sorrows, and the friend to whom—above all others—he was to look for
                     encouragement and kindred sympathy.
                  The bride was looking forward to a life of gaiety, fashion, luxury and
                     splendor; her dream was not of home and wedded happiness; her visions not of
                     blended sympathies, and kindred companionship; no, her dream was one of life's
                     brilliant pleasures, and her fancy pictured naughty save bliss.
                  A golden canopy above her, starry flowers beneath her feet, and the spell of
                     luxury thrown over all! this was the dream of the bride—the other, of the
                     bridegroom!
                  Alas! alas, for human dreams; cherished for a life-time—blasted in a
                     moment!
                  But the solemn voice of the aged minister broke the silence, and the beautiful
                     marriage rite was commenced. The holy vows were breathed, the sacred words
                     spoken, and the future happiness of the proud, the passionate, and the
                     high-souled Norman Stuart, was in the keeping of—A Ball-Room
                        Beauty.
                  
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER III.
                  Florence Stuart was in her new home.
                  A month had gone by; to her, a month of pleasure—to Norman, a month of happy
                     uneasiness! He was happy, because the being he loved so fondly was his wife; he
                     was uneasy, because every evening was spent at the opera, and at parties, and
                     he had as yet enjoyed none of that domestic happiness, of which he had so
                     fondly dreamed.
                  Alice Merton, at the earnest invitation of Florence and her husband, resided
                     with them. She knew there was no similarity in the tastes of Norman and
                     Florence; and that, consequently, they could not be happy; yet she resolved to
                     stay with them and exert all her influence for the happiness of both. Her
                     nature was entirely different from her cousin's; and while Florence was happy
                     in the crowded ball-room, Alice resorted to the well-filled library, as the
                     most useful and entertaining source of amusement.
                  Stuart had become weary of such a continual round of balls and operas, and one
                     evening remarked to his wife, as she entered the drawing-room,
                  "Florence, we will not go out to-night; only think, we have been married nearly
                     two months, and have not yet spent a single evening at home; so to-night we
                     will stay and keep Alice company; I will read to you both."
                  The pale face of Alice brightened, and her dark eyes beamed with pleasure, for
                     she had long wished to hear Stuart read; but her cheeks flushed with
                     disappointment when Florence exclaimed,
                  "What, Norman, stay away from the opera to hear you read from a dull,
                     uninteresting book? Why you must think I wish very much to hear you read!"
                  Stuart bit his lip, and strove to speak gently as he replied,
                  "The book shall not be dull nor uninteresting; it shall be the finest
                     production of one of the oldest authors!"
                  "Oldest authors!" repeated Florence, scornfully, "a very great inducement,
                     truly. I hate the very name of 'old author,' and as for their fine productions,
                     I would go into hysterics to hear them read; I detest them, and besides I would
                     not stay at home to night, even to hear you read that charming novel Carrie
                     Wilson sent me!"
                  "Charming novel!" replied Stuart, in a tone of bitter irony, "I am well aware
                     you would not stay at home to hear me read it, for I would not disgrace myself
                     with reading such a book; but I really wish you would stay at home this
                     evening, for I have an engagement to-morrow night and the next, and I am fairly
                     tired of so much bustle and excitement. You know we attended the opera last
                     night, so do stay at home with me this evening!"
                  "I shall do no such thing, Norman; do you think I am going to stay at home
                     every evening? I never have, nor
                     will I ever, to please any one; so get ready, I am going to order the
                     carriage!"
                  "Very well, Florence," replied her husband, "I will go with you to-night—but
                     remember, from this time, I cannot accompany you!"
                  Florence said nothing, but went to order the carriage, and was soon in the
                     midst of a crowd of admiring friends, with that sweet, witching smile lighting
                     up her radiant features.
                  Poor Norman; his blissful dream of wedded happiness had vanished; his
                     passionate love for his beautiful wife was chilled by a dark shadow.
                  Alice Merton sat in the drawing-room alone, after Florence and her husband had
                     gone, and the tears rolled down her fair cheeks, as she thought of the
                     unhappiness in store for them, for if it had commenced thus early, she might
                     well trembled for the future.
                  Days and weeks flew swiftly on; out every evening, Florence passed no time with
                     her husband, who preferred spending his leisure hours in his own cheerful
                     parlor. He was bitterly disappointed; and his affections, crushed and blighted,
                     sought not to win the heart of his young wife back to the delights of her
                     beautiful home, and the unappreciated society of the home ones.
                  The Spring had passed by, and the bright hued Summer succeeded it.
                  One evening, Florence remarked to her husband that she wished very much to
                     visit a celebrated watering place, as most of her acquaintances were going, and
                     it would be exceedingly dull at home. Stuart had always deserted watering
                     places, but he replied that if she wished to go very much, he would accompany
                     her; for he thought that perhaps he might enjoy more of her society even there,
                     than he did at home.
                  So it was decided that they were to start the next week, and, as Alice was to
                     accompany them, Florence was perfectly delighted; and, as she thanked her
                     husband with that beautiful smile upon her features, he felt well repaid for
                     his ready acquiescence in her request.
                  The next week they were at the springs. Alice found much pleasure in admiring
                     the beautiful scenery, and reading in her quiet room. Florence resorted to the
                     elegant parlors, as the only source of happiness.
                  There were beautiful women there, but the fascinating Mrs. Stuart surpassed
                     them all. She was the reigning belle, the attractive star of the passing hour;
                     the lovely rose, around which the gilded butterflies of fashion clustered; and
                     her vanity was greatly flattered with the homage and adulation she received.
                     Had she spared time even to spend a few hours of each day with her husband, he
                     would have been far happier; but no, she would rather listen to the syren tones
                     of the wily flatterer, than to the eloquent voice of the noble and gifted being
                     who called her wife!
                  One dark rainy morning Florence was reclining upon a lounge in her own room,
                     reading a freshly published novel. Her husband was seated near her, gazing in
                     silence out upon the clouded sky. It seemed to him so like his own existence—first fair and beautiful,
                     then shut in by dark, heavy shadows—that every pattering raindrop which fell
                     upon the window pane seemed falling upon his heart.
                  His life had commenced with the bright sun of hope and happiness shining from a
                     shadowless sky, but alas! too soon was that sky overcast with rayless
                     clouds.
                  In the pride and vigor of life, his high, noble spirit longed for a heart to
                     beat responsive to his own, for a congenial spirit, whose chords of human music
                     were awakened by the same power which awoke the slumbering melody of his
                     soul.
                  But this was denied him. His destiny was linked with one who could not
                     appreciate the noble qualities of his lofty nature; one who detested the very
                     aspiration he so fondly cherished!
                  Ah! how blest would be his life, if the companion of his bosom were like
                     himself; if their dreams could mingle in the same glowing stream; their
                     sympathies blend in the blessed harmony of kindred love!
                  He turned from the window and the glances of his dark eyes fell upon the form
                     of her, whose pleasure it should have been to smooth the marks of care and
                     weariness away from that lofty brow, and to awaken with her own hand the music
                     of his heart.
                  She reclined upon the velvet lounge, a morning wrapper flung loosely around her
                     form, her golden hair scattered in dishevelled masses over her shoulders, and a
                     book he detested held in the jewelled hand; and this was the wife of such a
                     man! He, a noble and gifted being, the dreams and aspirations of his lofty
                     spirit, soaring far above the gossamer vanities of life; she, a ball-room
                        beauty, whose very existence hung upon the adulation of the
                     world!
                  Ah! 'twas a bitter picture, and bitter were the thoughts of Norman Stuart, as
                     he sat in the silence of that room, contrasting the picture he had drawn on the
                     eve of his marriage, with the one before him.
                  Florence had dropped the book which she held, and sauntered languidly to the
                     window where sat her husband, and as she seated herself on a chair near him, he
                     said,
                  "Florence, I received important letters last evening from the city and from
                     them I learn that affairs demand my immediate attention. I have already given
                     orders to the servants to have everything ready for a speedy return."
                  "What!" said Florence opening wide her dreamy eyes, "return to the city when
                     life at the springs is in its gayest season! Indeed, Norman, I shall do no such
                     thing."
                  "Florence," replied Stuart rising from his seat, "I have bent to your will till
                     I shall do so no longer! I will not suffer myself to be made the tool of a
                     vain, heartless woman, who has neither love for me nor respect for herself. My
                     business needs my attention at home, and to-morrow I shall return; you can go
                     or stay—as you think best; and he left the apartment.
                  
                  Florence commenced weeping, and immediately went to seek Alice, to pour into
                     her ear an exaggerated story of what she called Norman's unkindness.
                  She found Alice in her room, and the story was soon told, and Florence sank
                     sobbing upon a couch expecting her cousin would sympathise with her when she
                     was so wretched. But instead of that, Alice took no notice of her tears, and
                     merely inquired what objections she could possibly have against returning
                     home?"
                  "Why," sobbed Florence, "the great ball is to come off next week, and I am
                     enjoying myself so finely here!"
                  "And what of that," replied Alice, "would you wish your husband to return
                     alone—and besides, what pleasure could you take at the ball in the situation
                     you are in?"
                  Florence commenced sobbing anew, and saying that Alice and Norman were both
                     trying to make her unhappy, left the room for her own apartment.
                  She concluded, however, to return home with her husband, and the following day
                     they left the springs. Florence was too sullen to speak; her husband was cold
                     and stern, and the proud expression of his handsome face told that he had
                     determined to stifle every feeling of affection, wasted as it was upon a being
                     so unworthy of it.
                  The journey was very unpleasant, and they were all glad when once more seated
                     in their own drawing-room.
                  The situation of Florence prevented her going abroad, and the long, weary days
                     passed lonely enough.
                  Florence still felt angry with her husband, and would scarcely speak in his
                     presence, and he, naturally yearning for the sympathy of a spirit like his own,
                     sought the society of the gifted and kind-hearted Alice. In the presence of
                     such a being, he would forget for the time his own unhappiness, for the sweet
                     bond of sympathy between two congenial natures like theirs, seemed like a ray
                     of sunshine to his crushed heart.
                  And Alice pitying him as she did, exerted all her powers of pleasing, to soothe
                     the bitterness of his disappointment. She tried in vain to effect a
                     reconciliation. Florence was too angry, too wilful to wish it; and Norman was
                     too proud to attempt it.
                  Thus was Alice Merton placed in no enviable situation. She loved her cousin and
                     pitied her husband; she was the sister, the confidant of the former, and the
                     sincere friend of the latter. She was well acquainted with the nature of
                     Florence, and knew that the wilful-ness arose more from habit than from
                     heart.
                  She knew that she had never felt the influence of a gentle mother, and that
                     entrusted as she had been to the care of an uninterested governess, she had
                     been brought up with no higher aim than to shine like a bright butterfly, in
                     the crowded ball-room, and she could not help pitying, even while she chided
                     her.
                  She knew that the soul of Stuart soared above such vanities, and she grieved
                     that the wife of his bosom of little appreciated the loftiness of his noble
                     character. Thus were the sympathies of the gentle-hearted girl awakened for
                     both.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  Norman Stuart sat in the drawing-room alone. There was a hurrying to and for
                     from the chamber to the kitchen, and the important glances of the old
                     housekeeper told that something unusual had occurred.
                  Suddenly Alice entered the room, and Stuart read in the expression of her face,
                     even before she spoke, that he was a father!
                  "How is Florence?" he exclaimed eagerly.
                  "Nicely," she replied," and you may come and see what a sweet little daughter
                     you have got!"
                  A ray of light broke like a sunbeam, over his pale, anxious face, as he
                     followed Alice to his wife's apartment. He bent over the silken couch and
                     pressed his lips to the pale cheek of Florence, and then turned to welcome the
                     little stranger whose low wail stole so soothingly over his soul.
                  It lay upon the lap of the nurse, a feeble, helpless infant; but as Norman
                     Stuart knelt before it, and kissed its tiny face, the shadowy veil of futurity
                     seemed for a moment lifted and the eye of the young husband saw in imagination
                     a lovely being who twined her white arms around his neck, and murmured in a
                     sweet tone, "Father!"
                  But once more the dark veil fell, and the vision faded from his view. He kissed
                     again and again that little unconscious face, and as he turned to leave the
                     cham- ber, Alice saw a pearly tear course down his manly cheek. He entered the
                     library and sinking upon his knees, murmured,
                  "I thank thee, Oh! my God, that thou hast given me something to love!"
                  As he sat there in the quiet of the apartment, with the dark shadows of evening
                     fast gathering around him, he was thinking of the future, the dim, unknown
                     future!
                  Ah, happy is it for us that the drapery of time hides it from our view.
                  Stuart little thought of the unhappiness in store for him as he murmured half
                     aloud,
                  "Yes, it must be so, if the husband's love proves no incentive to higher aim,
                     the love of the mother for her child, must prove a sacred tie to bind her more
                     closely to home, and her heart must naturally yearn towards the father of her
                     darling!"
                  Alas, he knew little of the iron power of habit, nor thought that it needed
                     something more potent than a mere kindred tie, to burst its mystic spell.
                  The sundering of that tie perhaps might prove effectual, but surely, not when
                     its links first bind the wayward heart!
                  Days, weeks, months passed by. The bloom of health returned once more to the
                     fair cheeks of Florence Stuart, and the mirror told her that that fair face was
                     lovlier than ever. Norman was happier than before, for though he could not
                     enjoy the society of his still world-loving wife, yet when the drawing-room afforded him no
                     pleasure, he could resort to the nursery, where he would sit for hours, holding
                     his beautiful child, and gazing upon its sweet, innocent face. His whole soul
                     seemed wrapt up in one dream; one hope, one thought, and that was—for his
                        child!
                  
                  Florence dearly loved it, but the fearful spell of habit was not yet broken,
                     she thought the world was even as dear. But ah! Florence Stuart knew not her
                     own heart! She loved her child with a sacred affection; but that affection was
                     slumbering in her bosom, to awake, when its fond yearnings would be for an
                     angel in Heaven!
                  Alice Merton loved the sweet babe with a most tender affection, and Stuart
                     loved her, for the care and tenderness she lavished upon it.
                  Florence was seldom at home, and Norman would have been unhappy indeed, had he
                     thought the little birdling was left to the sole care of an uninterested
                     nurse.
                  Summer, and autumn had gone by, and winter with gay pleasures had returned once
                     more. Mrs. Stuart divided her attention between the opera and the ball-room,
                     and the few hours she passed on the morning of each day, with the sweet little
                     Rosalie, were, she deemed, sufficient to prove a most tender affection.
                  The heart of Norman was deeply grieved when he found that not even this blessed
                     tie could transform the thoughtless beauty, into a gentle and loving wife. He
                     had fondly hoped that with the love of the mother, would return the love of the
                     wife; but alas, time had revealed how vain was that hope!
                  Florence still enjoyed the same round of girlish pleasures, and while the
                     husband and father passed the long winter evenings in watching over his
                     idolized child, the vain mother spent those precious hours in the glittering
                     ball-room!
                  The season of gaiety was nearly over.
                  The snows and frosts of winter were fast melting beneath the rays of warmer
                     suns, and every heart save Florence Stuart's greeted the returning breezes of
                     spring with a most cordial welcome. She had attended many a scene of pleasure
                     during the season, but yet the heart was not satiated, and she was eagerly
                     looking forward to the magnificent party to be given by her "dear friends," the
                     aristocratic Mrs. Roscoe.
                  It was to be the last of the season, and therefore no expense would be spared
                     to make it the most splendid. As it was near at hand, Mrs. Stuart had given up
                     her few hours visit to the nursery, and every moment was spent with milliners
                     and dressmakers, for she intended her dress should be most beautiful.
                  She had persuaded Alice to accompany her, and her waking as well as sleeping
                     hours were filled with brilliant dreams of the pleasure she expected to
                     enjoy.
                  The wished for morning dawned at last, with a bright sun beaming from an
                     unclouded sky. Florence was in the drawing room, busily occupied in preparing
                        her magnificent costume. Her
                     heart beat high with joy and expectation, and she had scarcely thought of
                     little Rosalie, so intently was every thought wrapped up in her dream of
                     pleasure.
                  Stuart went from the breakfast room to the nursery. His beautiful child was
                     lying on the lap of the nurse, and gently taking it from her, he told her he
                     would tend it while she went to breakfast.
                  As he held the sweet darling in his arms, he noticed that the little face was
                     unusually pale, and the expression of the large blue eyes was dull and
                     heavy.
                  He felt the pulse beat slow and feebly, and the little hands were icy cold. His
                     heart was filled with apprehension, and a tear started to his eye, as the
                     thought stole over his heart, that she might die! But the thought was quickly
                     banished, for ah! 'twas too terrible to think of even for a moment, that his
                     Rosalie, his hope, his idol, could leave him, when his whole soul was wrapped
                     up in her, and his spirit seemed linked to hers by every tie of human
                     tenderness. No, no! she would not die, he could not cherish a thought so
                     dreadful.
                  "Nurse," he said as she entered the apartment, "have you not observed the
                     strange alteration in little Rosalie's appearance?"
                  "Why no," she replied, I don't see that anything ails her; I suppose she's
                     teething, and children are often a little sick and restless when they are
                     cutting their teeth!"
                  "But look, nurse, how pale and cold she is; don't you think you had better
                     speak to her mother?" asked Norman anxiously.
                  "Why, no indeed, there's nothing serious ails the child, and besides what good
                     would it do to speak to her mother even if she were sick? I don't believe she'd
                     trouble herself to come and see her if she were dying!"
                  "Nurse," said Stuart, sternly, "let this be the last time I hear your mistress
                     mentioned with so much disrespect!"
                  He felt the truth of what she said, but yet, Florence was the mother of his
                     child, and as such, he would not hear a servant speak disrespectfully of
                     her.
                  He pressed the little cherished form once more to his heart, and gave her to
                     the care of the nurse, saying as he did so,
                  "Don't leave her for an instant—and send for me, if she is worse!"
                  As he passed through the hall, he opened the door of the drawing-room, and said
                     to his wife,
                  "Florence, I think you had better visit the nursery; little Rosalie seems quite
                     unwell!"
                  "Oh, fie!" she replied without turning her head, "you are always worrying about
                     Rosalie; I am sure, Doctor Warnford said no longer ago than yesterday, that she
                     was a remarkably healthy child; but if she draws a deep breath, or cries, you
                     think she must surely be going to die."
                  Stuart did not trust himself to reply, but shutting the door passed on.
                  
                  The day passed away; to Florence, swiftly; to Norman, every minute seemed a
                     weary hour. His heart was with his child, and a strange presentiment of
                     something dreadful seemed lying with fearful weight upon his mind.
                  When he retired to his home, the night shadows were fast gathering, and with a
                     quickly beating heart he hastened to the nursery.
                  Rosalie was lying on her tiny silken couch, and Alice was bending over her. She
                     moved from her position when Stuart entered, and he quickly took her place, by
                     the side of his child. An exclamation of anguish broke from his lips, as his
                     anxious glance fell upon the face of his darling. The lovely face was no longer
                     pale; the cheeks were flushed and burning; the blue eyes beamed with a strange
                     unnatural light, and the throbbing pulse was quick and irregular.
                  "Alice!" said Norman, in a low quivering tone, "tell me what you think of
                     her?"
                  Alice did not reply, but as she met his earnest glance, she shook her head, and
                     the tear that had trembled on the silken lashes rolled down her fair cheek.
                     That pearly tear was Stuart's answer.
                  An hours had passed, and he was standing over that little form, watching every
                     change of the flushed countenance, and listened to the deep heavy breathing;
                     when the door opened, and Florence entered to kiss little Rosalie before she
                     left the house.
                  Her husband looked up, and as his eye glanced over the superb costume of his
                     beautiful wife, he exclaimed,
                  "Good God! and is it possible that you can attire yourself in those rich robes;
                     that you can meet the admiring glance, and listen to the empty voice of
                     adulation, in the crowded ball-room, while your only child lies in such a
                     state? I have long known that you were cold and heartless as yonder image, but
                     surely I had not deemed you capable of this!"
                  Florence stood, for a moment, scarcely knowing what reply to make. She looked
                     at her child; its cheeks were flushed, and its eyes sparkled brightly. She
                     thought 'twas health. Alas! she knew not that it was the false light, which
                     like the dying flame, but shines more brilliantly when Death is nearest!
                  Yes, Florence Stuart mistook the light of Death for that of health. The voice
                     of grief in which her husband addressed her sounded to her ear like harshness,
                     and that she would not brook. She glanced once more toward her
                     child; then in the mirror! She saw the reflection of her own fair form; never
                     had she looked so peerlessly beautiful. Could she forego the admiration she
                     must that night receive? Ah! once again habit triumphed.
                  She stopped and kissed the hot cheek of little Rosalie, then turning toward her
                     husband, she said in a cold tone of defiance.
                  "I shall go to-night, in spite of all you can do to prevent me!"
                  
                  The expression of his proud face was fearful, when he replied, as she swept
                     from the room,
                  "Florence Stuart, if there be a God above, you will bitterly repent this last
                     proof of utter heartlessness!"
                  When she had closed the door, he sank into a seat and bowed his head upon the
                     couch.
                  Suddenly he started up, and grasping the hand of Alice, as she bent over little
                     Rosalie, said in a tone hoarse with emotion.
                  "Alice, will you grant me one favor? it may be the last I shall ever ask of
                     you."
                  "Anything, anything you wish," she replied.
                  A tear started to his eye as he answered,
                  "It is one which I well know will grieve your kind heart, but yet I must ask
                     it. Go with my wife to-night. Mark if the laugh flow as brightly from her lip;
                     if the voice of adulation brings the glow as softly to her cheek, and if that
                     smile, that cursed smile, can beam as brightly, as though her husband was not
                     alone in his home, watching over, with a bursting heart, the form, of her dying
                     child! will you grant me this, Alice?"
                  "I will," she replied, in a voice scarcely above a whisper.
                  "Then go, and may God bless you as I do!" was his fervent response.
                  The gentle girl pressed one more kiss upon the cheek of the sweet babe, and
                     left the apartment.
                  Ten minutes after, the carriage rolled from the door, bearing the kind-hearted
                     Alice, and the unnatural mother, to the scene of festal pleasure.
                  The sound of the carriage wheels had scarcely died away in the distance, when
                     the nurse entered the apartment, and going up to the couch as if to take the
                     infant from its, said, in a tone of much importance,
                  "Mistress told me, sir, to take care of baby myself.
                  "What," exclaimed the now infuriated man, as he pushed the woman from the
                     bedside, "did she dare send her menial to take my child from my arms? Did she
                     dare bid the hand of another wipe the death-sweat from that angel brow, when
                     the father was bending over it? Oh, my God! most bitterly shall she repent
                     this! Begone, and let me not see your face again!" he said, as the nurse stood
                     trembling before him, frightened at his vehemence of manner. "But stay; find
                     James, and bid him go for the physician, and when he arrives, tell him I am in
                     the library."
                  It was but the work of a moment for Stuart to take the light couch in his arms
                     and carry it gently to the library. There was a fire glowing in the grate, and
                     a lamp burned softly on the mantle.
                  Every moment seemed an age to the anxious father, until he heard a step
                     approach the door, and the next moment doctor Warnford entered the apartment.
                     He stepped quickly to the little bedside, and gazed intently upon the lovely
                     face of the beautiful infant; then he felt the pulse, and shook his head as he
                     turned toward Stuart, who stood with clasped hands, and heaving breast awaiting
                     his opinion.
                  
                  "Mr. Stuart," he said, "from my heart I pity you, for no earthly power can save
                     your child. She cannot live till morning!"
                  Ah, how those words fell upon the father's heart. But he did not weep. No, not
                     even a sigh escaped him. His anguish was too intense, too thrilling for tears.
                     He refused the offered kindness of the sympathising physician, and once more he
                     was left alone with his child.
                  Oh! how did his noble heart bleed, as he knelt by that tiny couch, to watch the
                     life-tide recede forever from the paling lips. No tongue can tell the intensity
                     of sorrow which swelled his heart, till the veins in that broad forehead seemed
                     bursting, and the strained eyeballs flashing sparks of living fire. How full of
                     agony was the gaze fixed upon the beautiful face of that dying child! He marked
                     the glow depart from those little cheeks; the brilliancy from those blue eyes.
                     He saw the cold dew of death gathering damply upon the snow-white brow, and the
                     glassy film over the eyes whose glance had ever caused his very soul to leap
                     with joy.
                  Once more did he wildly clasp that cherished form to his breaking heart, and
                     press his lips in agony to his child's, as if to keep in life.
                  But alas, life was already blighted, and the paling lips grew colder and
                     colder. He laid the little form back upon its couch—to die! And kneeling by its
                     side, and taking the tiny hand between his own, he waited the hour that should
                     sever the tie which bound the departing spirit to his own.
                  Nought broke the silence of that room, save the lifelike ticking of the little
                     mantle clock. Slowly, slowly the moments passed on, and so thrillingly was the
                     stillness that the agonized father could almost hear the rustling wings of
                     Death as they fluttered over his child.
                  Ah! gently was the pure spirit of that sweet child led through the dark valley.
                     No suffering, no gasping for the departing breath; but gently, sweetly, as
                     droops the rose at Summer twilight, was the angel spirit passing.
                  The little clock struck twelve—the dim, dread hours of midnight. The death-damp
                     on that marble brow grew damper yet. The breath came more faintly through the
                     pale lips; the eyes became more fixed and glassy.
                  Suddenly a heavenly smile overspread the marble features; the blue eyes for a
                     moment brightened, as though they already caught a sight of the "better land,"
                     then they closed—forever.
                  The tiny hand the father clasped, quivered like a leaf stirred by the breeze;
                     and then, 'twas icy cold. He heard nought save the beating of his own heart;
                     and Norman Stuart knew that he was childless! The cold sweat stood
                     in large drops upon his forehead, and the rigid face was almost as motionless
                     as the lifeless clay before him.
                  His very breath seemed suspended, and the bleeding heart almost ceased to beat.
                     But there he knelt while the long hours dragged slowly on. Not a tear did he shed; not a moan did he breathe. But
                     the death-like paleness of the marble cheeks, the strained and bloodshot eye,
                     the wild rigid glance fixed so vacantly upon the statue-like face of the dead,
                     told how acute, how terrible was the agony that struggled so fearfully in his
                     soul.
                  Oh! it is bitter to gaze on the tears of woman; but when we behold the strong
                     man stricken like the feeble infant, with anguish too intense for tears, too
                     deep and terrible for words, when the noble head is bowed—not like woman's,
                     with submission—but with the dark blighting spell of woe which flings a leaden
                     torpor over the soul and prostrates every nerve. Oh! then, then it is
                     appalling!
                  The silver stars were already fading, when Florence Stuart once more entered
                     her home. Alice came with her, and with trembling hearts they hastened to the
                     nursery. No husband, no child was there!
                  Alice sprung past Florence, and the next moment she had reached the library.
                     Florence had followed her and as she flung open the door, and advanced a step
                     into that room of death, both stood as if paralyzed by the scene before
                     them.
                  The expiring lamp still flickered with a dim, ghastly light; the flame had died
                     away in the grate. In that silken couch rested the beautiful form of little
                     Rosalie; a fair, cold corpse!
                  
                  Kneeling beside it, with one marble hand clasped within both his own, and his
                     vacant gaze fixed upon the beauteous clay; his pale, haggard face scarce warmer
                     than that on which he gazed, and his noble form bowed as with the change of
                     years, knelt the father.
                  Aye! there he knelt—alone—hearing nought, seeing nought, save the dead face of
                     his angel child.
                  Alice laid her hand upon his shoulder; the gaze was withdrawn from the
                     unconscious face, and he sprang to his feet. His soul was awakened from that
                     benumbing torpor, and he realized the extent of his misery. The expression of
                     his face was fearful to behold, as he sprang toward his wife and grasping her
                     arm with desperate strength, and pointing to the little waxen form which lay so
                     motionless in the embrace of Death, exclaimed,
                  "Look there! while you were receiving the world's homage in the crowded
                     ball-room, Death came and took your child; my idol! never more will its little
                     arms twine around your neck; never more will its soft cheek press your own.
                     She, your Rosalie is dead, and you were not here to soothe her dying
                     pillow.
                  "No, no, you deserted her—left her with the shadow of Death hovering over her,
                     and while you were mingling in the dance, her spirit passed from earth; and I,
                     alone in the grim hour of midnight, received the last fond glance of those dear
                     eyes, and marked the cold film steal over them! I inhaled the last chill,
                     struggling breath, and held that tiny hand when it quivered with the
                     death-spasm. Yes, I—with no pitying hand to wipe the sweet of woe from my brow;
                     no lip to whisper comfort to my
                     breaking heart, watched my angel child sink to the sleep 'which knows no
                     waking.'"
                  He paused—released his iron grasp; a strange, fierce expression shone from his
                     flashing eyes, and bursting into a wild, hollow unearthly laugh, which told
                     that reason had fled, he fell back pale and insensible as the clay before
                     him.
                  Then it was that the arrow of retribution sank deep into the heart of Florence
                     Stuart! The tie was sundered, and the fearful spell which had so long bound her
                     heart, was broken forever.
                  Her agony was terrible, and she wrung her hands, exclaiming.
                  "Oh, God! I have murdered them! My child; my husband!"
                  In her wild frenzy she would press the little form of her dead infant to her
                     bosom, and cover its cold face with kisses. Then she would kneel by her injured
                     and insensible husband, and chafing his marble temples, utter the most
                     thrilling cries of wild despair.
                  Now it was that all the fortitude and presence of mind in the character of
                     Alice Merton was called in requisition; and the despairing cries of the unhappy
                     Florence, seemed to give new energy to the strength the occasion required. She
                     hastened to arouse the servants, and ere long Doctor Warnford arrived at the
                     house of mourning.
                  The still insensible form of Stuart was carried to his room, and when restored
                     from that death-like swoon, he was raving in the delirium of a brain fever. Two
                     days from that on which she attended Mrs. Roscoe's ball, Florence Stuart
                     followed her only child to the grave.
                  Oh! who shall paint the anguish of that sorrow stricken women, as she took her
                     place by the bedside of her suffering husband. Her child, her darling Rosalie,
                     gone forever, and her husband stricken down in the pride and strength of
                     manhood—his spirit hovering between life and death.
                  There was repentance stern and bitter, mingling with the most poignant grief,
                     and her anguish was too terrible for earthly power to sustain. She saw the
                     past, the irretrievable past, with a naked eye, and bitter, yet sincere was her
                     repentance. She found a balm at the foot of the throne, where mercy is never
                     denied, the truly repentant heart; and she felt as she drew nearer to the
                     blessed Redeemer that, "thought her sins were as scarlet, they should be white
                     as snow."
                  Many long weary days did she watch over her husband. It was her hand that held
                     the cooling draught so gently to his fevered lips, and pressed the throbbing
                     brow when racked with burning pain. And often in the still watches of the quiet
                     midnight, would Florence Stuart kneel by that sick bed and pray with an humble
                     contrite heart, to the Great Being to whom she now looked for life and
                     comfort.
                  The kind physician would often admonish her to seek repose, but yet not once
                     did she leave that sick room, and she would only allow herself a few hours rest
                     each night on the sofa at the foot of the couch.
                  
                  At length came the crisis, and doctor Warnford must himself watch with his
                     patient. He deemed it advisable for Mrs. Stuart to remain in another room.
                     Conscious how much her husband's life depended upon his being kept perfectly
                     quiet, she consented.
                  How fervent were the prayers she breathed that he, her husband might be spared;
                     and when the crisis was passed and the physician told her that danger was over,
                     she poured forth her whole soul in gratitude to Him who in his infinite mercy
                     had listened to her prayers, and with His blessed comfortings had sustained her
                     through that terrible trial.
                  The doctor well knew what caused that long, weary sickness, and he told Mrs.
                     Stuart that during her husbands convalescence, it was better for both that she
                     absent herself entirely from his room, as his nerves were at present so weak
                     that the least excitement would cause a relapse.
                  It was a bitter trial for her to be deprived the dear privilege of watching
                     over the loved form, but she felt that it was better not to meet till he should
                     have fully realized the misery he had gone through.
                  A week had passed by since that fearful crisis. The invalid was rapidly
                     recovering, and was once more able to sit by the window of his room and listen
                     to the sweet music of the birds, for it was bright balmy summer. His spirit had
                     grown pure—better. His proud heart was chastened by sorrow, and he placed his
                     hope and affections upon that "better world," to which he had been brought so
                     near.
                  The shadow of Death had passed so near him as almost to touch him with its
                     chilling hand, and the cold waters of eternity had almost deluged the
                     slumbering soul. But yet through the providence of the Great Redeemer, he was
                     once more permitted to leave that couch of sicknesss—almost of death; and he
                     left it, if not a happier, at least a better man!
                  Doctor Warnford had told him of Florence's unceasing watchfulness and care. He
                     described in glowing colors the devotion with which she had watched by his
                     bedside, and the anxiety which had paled her cheek while bestowing the
                     unwearied attention which had done more than the physician's skill could do, to
                     restore him once more to life and health.
                  And as a Stuart listened silently to the kind doctor's praise of his wife, the
                     hope he had so long cherished once more awoke in his heart. But he had not yet
                     seen her for whom that wild hope was wakened; he knew not whether she had
                     changed.
                  'Twas a sweet summer twilight, the dim, gray shades, with their dreamy spell,
                     were fast gathering over the flower-wreathed earth, as Norman Stuart sat by the
                     open window of his room. He was thinking of the past, and a tear rolled down
                     his pale cheek when he thought of his child.
                  The cool breeze lifted the curls from his broad brow; and the sweet pensive
                     stillness soothed his weary spirit.
                  Suddenly a soft hand was laid upon his shoulder; a slight form knelt at his
                     feet, and a low quivering voice, murmured,
                  
                  "Oh! my dear husband, will you take your repentant wife once more back to your
                     heart? Will you give her the fond love, which once was her's? Oh! my Norman,
                     can you, will you forgive me—me, your once loved Florence?"
                  The tears rolled down his cheeks, as he lifted that light form, and Florence
                     Stuart was pressed to the heart of her husband! And the link of kindred
                     sympathy and love, which then, and there, bound their hearts together, was
                     never broken.
                  As days, months, and years passed on, and Florence continued the same humble,
                     affectionate being, devoting the beauty and love which had before been given to
                     the world, to her husband, and her home, he blessed her often as the star of
                     his existence; the gentle angel of his happy home. Alice Merton, the sweet,
                     kind-hearted Alice, always resided with them, beloved by both as a dear
                     cherished sister.
                  Norman and Florence very often visited the grave of their lost darling, and
                     though the fond father would bedew the little mound with tears, yet he knew his
                     Rosalie was a blessed angel, and he could not murmur at the dispensation which
                     had transformed "the ball-room beauty" into a true and loving
                        wife!
                  
               
            
            
               TO MY MOTHER.
               
                  Oh! fare thee well, sweet mother!
                  I am going from thy side;
                  You'll miss me in the sunny morn,
                  And at the even tide.
               
               
                  You'll feel no more my hand, mother,
                  Pressed gently on thy brow—
                  You'll see me sit no more by thee
                  As I am sitting now.
               
               
                  Oh, I have loved thee well, mother,
                  I've looked upon thy face,
                  And wondered if a dearer love
                  Could e'er thine own replace.
               
               
                  Yes, I have loved thee long, mother;
                  My deepest love was thine—
                  Its first affection strong and true,
                  My heart poured at thy shrine.
               
               
                  Thy hand has cooled my brow, mother,
                  When my heart with pain was tried;
                  And through the long hours you have watched
                  Like an angel by my side.
               
               
               
                  Yet I must leave thee now, mother,
                  And bitter tears I weep—
                  For who, oh, who, will take my place
                  When I am laid to sleep?
               
               
                  TO BROTHER GEORGE.
                  
                     Oh, forget not, sweet brother,
                     When I stand no more by thee—
                     When we meet no more in joyous love
                     Around our household tree.
                  
                  
                     Forget not, when my voice no more
                     Shall mingle with thine own,
                     How I have loved each tender word
                     That fell from thy dear tone.
                  
                  
                     We have walked together side by side
                     Through long and happy years,
                     Our hearts bound by a sympathy
                     That grew with smiles and tears.
                  
                  
                     But it is over! we no more
                     Shall walk together here—
                     No more shall seek each other's side,
                     To mingle smile or tear.
                  
                  
                     My voice no more will speak thy name
                     In sorrow or in glee;
                     And yet I know thou'lt ne'er forget
                     The love I've felt for thee.
                  
                  
                     I know, though long years glide away,
                     And many a change shall come,
                     Thou'Il think of her who grew with thee,
                     Within thy childhood's home.
                  
                  
                     And when the twilight shadows fall
                     Across the churchyard graves,
                     Thou'lt seek the sport where o'er my form
                     The tall grass bends and waves.
                  
                  
                     Oh, longer there, sweet brother,—
                     Come oft at fading even—
                     And while thou thinkest of the lost
                     I'll smile on thee from heaven.
                  
                  
                     I'll bend low at our Father's shrine,
                     And pray His blessings sweet,
                     May guard thee like an angel's host,
                     Till by his throne we meet.
                  
                  
                     And we shall meet, my brother,
                     Upon that better shore!
                     We shall roam its valleys hand in hand,
                     Dwell side by side once more.
                  
                  
                     Then I'll not say to thee, "farewell,'
                     Although we now must part—
                     I'll only say "His love be thine,
                     His peace be in thy heart!"
                  
               
            
            
               
               MIDNIGHT O'ER THE WORLD.
               Hush—'tis midnight! Midnight o'er the proud, cold world. In yonder noble mansion,
                  sits a fair young mother—beautiful, high-born and gentle. Why sits she there, in
                  the lone midnight hour, with tears streaming from her starlike eyes, and sorrow
                  swelling her young, warm heart? Costly furniture, ornaments which might grace the
                  boudoir, of a queen, jewels which might glitter in a regal crown, beauty, luxury,
                  pomp, splendor, are scattered around her. Yet there she sits, in the still
                  midnight, unmindful of the silent, fleeting hour.
               On a silken couch, carved with many an dainty figure, and inlaid with many a
                  costly gem, lies a little waxen form, cold, silent, and dead! The golden curls are
                  brushed back from the white brow; the blue, laughing eyes are hidden 'neath the
                  marble lids; the full chiseled lip, now pale as the wan check, is wreathed even in
                  death with the same sweet, childish smile. The dimpled hands, folded so innocently
                  over the snowy bosom still clasp a half-blown flower—faded, broken, withered ere
                  it bloomed! blighted like the child's young life.
               Sweet angel; when the red sun set in the golden west, the life-blood was coursing
                  through those blue veins, and the sunny ringlets, kissed those rounded cheeks and
                  azure eyes. But midnight came, and the little limbs were motionless and cold; the
                  star eyes closed, and the fair young form resting in the icy arms of Death. And
                  there sits the pale, beautiful mother, with the spell of pride and splendor flung
                  around her sorrowing over her lost idol!
               Ah! reader, is not this a strange, sad picture? Does it not seem very strange that
                  Death, grim, shadowy Death should enter such a home, and bear from the arms of
                  love and luxury, that sweet, fair child; that little earthly idol,—when many a
                  sad, stricken heart is longing for the rest which the shadowy angel brings? Yes,
                  it does seem very strange; but the sad picture, teaches us that even amid wealth
                  and pomp, we may bear the blighting chill which sorrow brings, and that neither
                  splendor nor love can stay the fleeting arrow from the quiver of the mighty
                  Conqueror.
               Let us look upon one more picture ere the midnight hour passes. What a cold
                  cheerless room! No costly furniture—no silken drapery—no glittering ornaments—no
                  pomp—no pride—no splendor. But the fire on the small hearth burns dim and feebly,
                  and the candle flickers with every breath of air. Here, too, sits a mother, pale,
                  wan, and emaciated. She, too, is watching over her child; but Death has not
                  blighted its sweet, young life, nor chilled the warm, beating heart. No, its
                  little cheeks are flushed with a rosy hue, and the red lip quivers with the warm,
                  soft breath.
               
               Slumber, sweet, soothing slumber, has hushed its silver voice, and, unconsciously,
                  it lies in its small, broken cradle, knowing not that a pale, loving mother sits
                  beside it, watching each gentle breath, and night after night, working on without
                  a murmur, wearing life away for its dear sake! Sweet, angel mother, labor on for
                  thy worshipped child! Mayhap when years have rolled away, and that young form is
                  breathing with the stately pride of manhood, he may bless thee with a proud home,
                  and the love and tenderness which is now lavished upon him, may be repaid with
                  love as kindly as thine own. If not, there is a Heaven above, and there shalt thou
                  meet a blessed reward, when thy sweet, hallowed mission in this cold, proud world
                  is ended!
               But the midnight hour is waning, and the life pictures fading from our view. We
                  have learned that Death may pass by the home of poverty, and snatch a worshipped
                  idol from the midst of love and affluence. Ah, this is indeed a strange, wayward
                  world, filled with many a strange life-picture!
            
            
               OUR HOUSEHOLD BAND.
               
                  Six He in the village churchyard
                  Where the willows are ever weeping,
                  And the mounded turf and marble gray
                  Tell us where they are sleeping;
                  The summer dews have, many years,
                  Wept on their little graves;
                  And the autumn breezes murmur there,
                  Like a sound of ocean waves.
               
               
                  Six are left in the wide, cold world,—
                  Six of our kindred number;
                  But happier far are the six who rest
                  In the silence of breathless slumber;
                  They dwell in a land where ne'er is felt
                  The sorrows we feel below;
                  
                     They live in a heaven of love and bliss,
                  
                     We live in a world of woe.
               
               
                  Our eldest, in his own loved home,
                  Sees children around him playing;
                  Our second in his youth's sweet prime,
                  Is still in the cold world straying;
                  And four are left to cheer the hearts
                  Which have joined in our woe and mirth;
                  The father who watched over our infant years,
                  And the mother who gave us birth!
               
               
               
                  Oh! when will the chain that binds us now,
                  By Death's pale hand be broken?
                  Who first will hear the solemn word
                  By the stern destroyer spoken?
                  Alas, alas, we may not know
                  Who first will pass away,—
                  Whose dust shall first in the churchyard
                  Mix with its kindred clay!
               
               
                  The village church-bells pealing forth
                  When the summer sunlight wanes,
                  Seem, as they fall on my listening ear,
                  Chiming two solemn strains;
                  One for the six who gather yet
                  Around the household hearth,—
                  One for the six who calmly sleep
                  In the cold and silent earth.
               
            
            
               THE WIFE'S STRATANGEM.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Ye fair married dames, who so often deplore
                           That a lover once blest, is a lover no more,—
                           Attend to my council, nor blush to be taught
                           That prudence must govern what beauty has caught.
                        
                     
                     OLD SONG.
                  
               
               "Well, Fanny, this is what I call comfort!" and the
                  speaker, young Charles Selwyn, threw himself back in his spacious arm-chair,
                  placed his slippered feet upon the crimson ottoman—by the way, they were the same
                  slippers Fanny embroidered in the halcyon days of their courtship—and rested a
                  pair of handsome eyes most complaisantly upon the face of his pretty wife.
               For the especial benefit of my "single blessed" readers, I will endeavor, if my
                  own "single" pen have power, to portray a pretty scene of domestic bliss and
                  comfort as was ever enjoyed by a young and happy couple, whose unclouded honeymoon
                  had not yet reached its meridian.
               It was a very bird's-nest of a room. The bright coal-fire made the polished grated
                  shine like ebony, while it shed a cheerful light around the cozy apartment. The
                  soft astral burned clear and bright on the round centre table, with its gentle
                  radiance playing over the figures of
                  the carpet and the damask roses of the fringed hearth-rug. Everything, from the
                  spreading of the table-cloth, to the placing of the chairs, was arranged in the
                  nicest manner, with an eye to taste and regularity. Even the little Canary in his
                  wire cage, seemed nestling his pretty head under his downy wing, merely out of
                  respect to the quiet order below him.
               And to completed the picture, there sat the young husband, in all the imaginable
                  bliss of velvet slippers, flowing dressing-gown, and cozy arm-chair; while his
                  gentle wife, with her smoothly brushed ringlets and neat attire, read aloud in her
                  peculiar sweet tone, a charming story from a new magazine. Indeed, had the reader
                  taken a peep into that quiet parlor, I think he could have thought, with Charley
                  Selwyn, that it was a most graphic picture of real solid comfort.
               "Charles," said Fanny, as she closed the book, "who was that gentleman you were
                  conversing with at Mrs. Vane's last night, while Lillian was playing the
                  harp?"
               Oh! that was Harry Gray; we used to be great friends when I spent my evenings with
                  the club. Last night was the first time I have met him since our marriage. A
                  splendid fellow, and glorious company—but a rigid bachelor."
               "What was the promise he reminded you of when we were passing through the
                  hall?"
               "Why, he wished me to meet with the club again, tomorrow night, as I havn't met
                  them for some time, I promised him I would. I shall be away only an hour or two,
                  and you can amuse yourself with a book if you are lonely."
               Fanny said nothing, but a cloud flitted over her pretty face, as she unfortunately
                  happened to think that Bertha Lee told her once, in confidence, that herself and
                  husband never would have parted had it not been for that very club which Charles
                  had promised to meet, and for which Bertha's husband so sadly neglected her.
               Fanny and Charles had been married but two months. They resided in a beautiful
                  cottage in the suburbs of the city, which, though somewhat out of the way, yet
                  seemed a perfect little paradise to its inmates. To be sure, Fanny was sometimes a
                  little lonely while Charles was away in the city, where he was obliged to spend
                  the long hours of the day; but then she had the pleasant evenings to look forward
                  to, and though she kept a domestic, yet, like every prudent wife, she
                  superintended the household affairs herself, which served as an agreeable pastime,
                  to wile away many an hour which, otherwise must have seemed tediously wearisome.
                  Her own fair hands prepared the exquisite niceties which Charles enjoyed so much
                  after his labors in the counting-room were over. Her hands arranged the polished
                  furniture, and placed his easy-chair before the comfortable fire, and laid his
                  slippers on the rug near the grate, so they should be nice and warm, on his
                  return.
               A loud cheer of welcome made the well-filled hall ring as Charles Selwyn entered
                  with Harry Grey His club friends
                  crowded around him; some with inquiries as to the cause of his long absence, some
                  with words of welcome, and some congratulated him with a jest and laugh, upon his
                  good luck in marrying the beautiful city belle.
               Selwyn was delighted with the reception he received. He had been absent so long
                  from the entertaining circle, that the excitement and gaiety seemed enhanced by
                  the charm of novelty. The merry laugh flowed forth spontaneously—the brilliant
                  jest flew from lip to lip—the sparkling wine lent a deeper swell to the ringing
                  song—and Charles Selwyn wondered how he could have forgotten, for two long months,
                  that lighted club-room and the brilliant society of his gay associates.
               But the young husband seems already to have forgotten the little cottage where he
                  left his pretty wife, telling her he should be at home in less than two hours; so
                  we will ourselves take a peep into the quiet parlor.
               Before the glowing fire stood the large easy-chair and the neatly embroidered
                  slippers. Fanny sat by the centre-table, with a book, in which she had in vain
                  tried to become interested, laying beside her, with one white hand still resting
                  over the unread pages, and the other pressed nervously against her throbbing
                  temples.
               Charles had promised to be at home in two hours, but the "two hours" were long
                  since past, and the tiny hand of the mantel clock told five minutes to ten. Poor
                  Fanny! She remembered just how her friend Bertha looked when she told her that the
                  ring of a hus- band's step on the floor of the club-room was the death-knell of
                  home-love and home happiness; and his every laugh within those siren walls a
                  ghastly mockery to the untold misery which the laugh itself foretold.
               Before her marriage Fanny Selwyn had resided in the city, where her beauty and
                  vivacity had drawn around her a large circle of friends, who loved and admired her
                  as much for her goodness as for her grace and intelligence. As an only daughters
                  she was petted and caressed at home, where everything within the power of her fond
                  parents was done to secure the happiness of their idol. It was a sad trial to her
                  young heart when she left that sweet home of her childhood; and when she turned
                  from the embrace of her gentle mother, as they parted on the night of her bridal,
                  the tears she had before succeeded in crushing back within their inward fount,
                  burst forth in a torrent, and the young bride had flung herself into her husband's
                  arms, with wild, unchecked sobs welling up from her warm heart. But a tender smile
                  and a word of affection soon dispelled the clouds from her fair brow, and since
                  that hour Charles had seen no more of those wild tears, for Fanny cherished too
                  deep a regard for his peace of mind to pain him with the constant sight of grief.
                  To say that at times she did not feel very, very lonely, would be untrue. She
                  missed the kind words and sweet smiles of her mother, and the lively companionship
                  of her young acquaintances; but she loved her husband with intense devotion, and
                  strove in every way to make his home cheerful and happy.
               
               But to-night the very demon of unhappiness seemed weaving a spell of misery around
                  Fanny Selwyn's heart. Her mind was full of dark forebodings, and she had become so
                  nervous that nought save weeping could soothe the feverish excitement of her
                  troubled feelings. And she did weep long and violently. But there was
                  no mother near her to pillow that graceful head upon her bosom and whisper in her
                  ear kind words of sympathy—no husband to take the little hand in his and banish
                  every sad thought by one of those beaming smiles—no dear companion of her girlish
                  years to mingle tears with her own. And so the young wife wept on, alone, while
                  her truant husband echoed back the gay laugh, breathed forth the brilliant
                  repartee, and joined in the ringing song which swelled within the walls of that
                  same dreaded club-room whose very name awakened such sad forebodings in the fond
                  wife's heart.
               Fanny had been sitting for some time, with her face buried in her hands, when the
                  little clock struck twelve.
               Twelve! twelve o'clock, and Charles not yet home! Fanny grasped a lamp and held it
                  close to the clock. Yes, it had told aright—it was midnight. She seated herself
                  once more and gave way to another passionate burst of tears. Again the musical
                  monitor chimed. This time it struck but one. The young wife sprang from her chair
                  and dashed the tears from her eyes, flung open the window and listened for his
                  step; but no step was heard. The pale moon and the white stars were kindly beaming
                  from the far heavens, but poor Fanny heeded not the beauty of the silent night.
                  She gazed long and earnestly into the dim haze, but her eyes fell upon no dear
                  form; her ear caught no sound of an echoing footstep. Indignantly closing the
                  window she lighted her little nightlamp, and without even glancing again towards
                  the clock, retired to the sung chamber where her aching temples were soon buried
                  in the snowy pillows of the pretty French couch.
               A few moments after the clock struck two, the night-lock was heard to spring back,
                  and with a noiseless step, Charles Selwyn entered the little parlor. The astral
                  was still softly burning, the arm-chair yet stood, before the grate. But all was
                  silent as the night itself. He opened the door of the sleeping apartment and
                  whispered," Fanny!" but no answer was returned. Two dark eyes peeped, for a single
                  instant, from beneath their silken lashes, and two little ears heard the low tone
                  of Charles as he murmured, "She is sleeping—I am glad she did not sit up for
                  me."
               The delicious coffee and the warm white cakes were already steaming on the table,
                  when Charles Selwyn entered the dining-room on the following morning. Fanny was
                  already in her place, looking prettier than ever in her neat morning robe and
                  plain white collar. She poured out the steaming coffee with her own fair hands,
                  but her own was scarcely tasted, and the clouded brow and slightly quivering lip,
                  when she essayed to speak, told she had not forgotten the last evening's
                  neglect.
               
               The breakfast hour passed most unpleasantly to the inmates of the pretty cottage.
                  The husband felt that he had done wrong; first, in breaking his promise to be at
                  home early, and secondly in passing so many hours in useless revelling, which
                  should have been spent at home. But, with man's usual preversity, he was not
                  willing to acknowledge that he had done wrong, and so, long before he had finished
                  his second cup of coffee, he had arrived at the manly conclusion that he had a
                  perfect right to go where he pleased and return when he
                  pleased, and that Fanny had no right to feel either angry or grieved. So when he
                  arose from the table he did not give her as, usual, a good-bye kiss, or bid her a
                  kindly good-morning, but arranged his coat and hat in silence, and, without a
                  word, or even a glance towards his wife, closed the door and started for the city,
                  with the determination to spend another evening at the club-room. And he
                     did spend another evening at the fascinating resort. And yet
                  another and another; till he learned to look upon the brilliant club-room and the
                  sparkling gaiety of his bachelor associates as necessary to his happiness. But it
                  was not the peaceful happiness he had enjoyed when his evenings were spent at
                  home. Oh! no, far from it. He was restless; oftentimes low-spirited and unhappy.
                  Even his wife's fond kiss and gentle smile seemed to add more fuel to the restless
                  flame of disquietude; and his own conscience told him that though she tried to
                  laugh and smile, yet her heart was miserable. She had pleaded with tears and
                  affectionate words for him to leave that dangerous place, forever; but ah! its
                  siren spell was already woven round him, and each night a phantom hand beckoned
                  him onward toward its charmed entrance, where the subtle tempter stood to lead him
                  still further on—to ruin.
               One starry night Fanny Selwyn was sitting in her little parlor, alone. Charles had
                  gone to the city, and as usual, the tears were sparkling like diamond dewdrops on
                  the young wife's silken lashes. She had not spoken unkindly to her husband for his
                  late cruel neglect, either had she allowed a cloud of displeasure to darken her
                  brow when in his presence. She continued, as before, to devise everything love
                  could suggest for his comfort. The same extra dainties were prepared by her
                  skilful hands; even were little luxuries often left over the grate, that they
                  might be warm on his return from his midnight resort. She strove by kindly words
                  and deeds, to win him back once more to his home; but it was all in vain.
               And so, to-night, she sat in the easy-chair, gazing into the glowing fire, with
                  the large tears rolling over her cheeks and falling down upon her hands. For two
                  long, weary hours had she sat thus, with despair and misery in her young heart,
                  and its pearly token upon her cheek. But suddenly her eyes beamed with a
                  mischievous light, and a dimple played prettily around the little proud mouth, as
                  if sent there by a merry thought. For a few moments she sat as if in deep
                  meditation, then, spring- ing up from
                  her seat, she exclaimed, clapping her white hands triumphantly,
               "Yes, yes, it shall be done! If love won't win him back, stratagem shall, and I'll
                  do it." And lighting her lamp, she glanced at the clock, but though at that very
                  moment it struck twelve she did not seem to heed it; for, as she went lightly to
                  her chamber, she hummed some snatches of a song, ceasing only to say, in a gay
                  tone, every now and then—"Oh! I know such a stratagem must succeed! I
                  know it will; it is so very strange."
               The next morning, when Charles came down to breakfast, he was astonished at the
                  unusual gaiety of his wife. She laughed and talked as in the earliest days of
                  their marriage, and the sunny light in her dark eyes and the merry strain in her
                  silvery tone, he thought could come only from a happy heart.
               "Charley," she said, and when he had risen from the table and sat down for a
                  moment on the sofa, "Charley"—and she placed her little hand on his shoulder and
                  gazed into his handsome face—"I have something I wish to tell you. You know mother
                  and my old friend, Ellen Graham, rode out to see me yesterday. Well, a large
                  number of city ladies, among whom are nearly all my former acquaintances, have
                  formed an entertaining society, called the 'Ladies' Circle,' which Ellen wishes me
                  to join. They meet every evening in the week, and as they have a fine, airy hall,
                  and plenty of books and chess, Ellen says they enjoy themselves highly, so I
                  promised her I would become a member, and I am to meet with them to-night for the
                  first time. I shall go to the city in the afternoon, and spend the night with
                  Ellen, as it would be inconvenient for me to return home at so late an hour. I
                  shall stay with her every evening I attend the circle, and, let me see—how often
                  shall I be able to meet them? Five—no, four; I don't think I can go more than four
                  evenings in the week—but I shall certainly go four evenings. Will it not be fine,
                  Charley? Only think, a 'Ladies' Circle'—pretty name, isn't it?"
               Charles did not answer the question, but gazed into his wife's sweet face, with a
                  somewhat puzzled expression, which she did not seem to notice, for she continued
                  in the same careless tone;—"You know Bridget can attend to everything just the
                  same as if I were here"—a fact Selwyn greatly doubted—"and I suppose you yourself
                  will be at home by one or two."
               The astonished husband hardly understood what his wife was saving, but the sarcasm
                  which that last sentence contained, though uttered in a careless tone, was not
                  lost upon him. It stung him to the quick and the crimson tide which told its
                  effects, mounted to his very temples.
               "There, Charley, you may go now," said Fanny; "I've told you all I am going to.
                  But stop, let me kiss you first—you know you won't see me again till tomorrow
                  night."
               And with his young wife's kiss yet playing on his cheek, Charles Selwyn started for the city. He did
                  not understand the "circle" affair. He had never before heard of such a circle,
                  and he little relished the idea of his wife being from home four evenings of the
                  week. To be sure, his own evenings were spent at the club-room; but then he had
                  been accustomed to seeing Fanny at the breakfast-table, and how could he spare her
                  sweet face and beaming smile from the morning and evening board. Poor Selwyn! For
                  once in his life he was fairly puzzled.
               The day wore away, and the young husband had nearly forgotten, in the usual cares
                  of business, both the "Ladies Circle" and the club-room. But twilight came, and
                  his steps were turned homeward. He entered the little parlor, but there was no
                  laughing voice to bid him welcome, no dear face to greet him with a sunny smile.
                  He could not bear the gloomy silence, and walking into the dining-room seated
                  himself at the supper-table. Old Bridget poured out his tea, which he drank in
                  silence, and, as he did not feel much appetite—there was no dainty dish beside his
                  plate, prepared by daintier hands—he soon rose from the table and started for the
                  city.
               But the brilliant club-room had lost its charm; the festive mirth of his gay
                  associates its fascinating witchery.
               He could not help contrasting that noisy revery with the sweet quiet of his own
                  little parlor, and the pure happiness which had hovered round his fireside. He was
                  abstracted and weary during the evening, and even the gay jest and light laugh of
                  the brilliant Harry Grey seemed to have lost its usual influence, for Selwyn could
                  not respond, in word or heart, either to jest or laugh. and so, at a much earlier
                  hour than was his wont, he turned his restless footsteps homeward.
               It was with a strange feeling of loneliness that the discontented husband sat down
                  to the morning meal. There was no neatly arrayed form beside him; there was no
                  smiling face, with the silken curls dancing over the graceful shoulders, to look
                  the heart's love for him in every sunny glance. His coffee, which had always been
                  so very delicious, was dark-colored and tasteless. The steak was burned almost to
                  a crisp, and even the bread was so heavy, and bore such unmistakable evidence of
                  an undue portion of saleratus, that it was wholly unpalatable. All Bridget could
                  offer, as an excuse, was, that her mistress had always superintended the breakfast
                  herself, and that she had forgotten how she settled the coffee.
               Thus passed a fortnight at the cottage. The young wife was absent nearly the whole
                  of the time, and when at home the household affairs were left entirely to old
                  Bridget's care. Poor Selwyn had not tasted a decent cup of coffee since Fanny
                  joined that hateful 'circle,' and more than that, he could not, half the time, see
                  Fanny herself.
               Oh! how sadly did he miss the nice little dainties he had been so accustomed to.
                  His arm-chair was never drawn out
                  before the grate, ready to receive his weary form; his slippers were never ready
                  for his tired feet; and Fanny, when she was at home, seemed too weary or too busy
                  to read to him or even listen to his own conversation. Even the cheerful home-look
                  of the neat parlor seemed exchanged for a cold, gloomy, comfortless aspect.
               The young husband had become sickened with the rude festivity of the lighted
                  club-room; and now that they seemed lost to him, he fully appreciated the sweet
                  enjoyments and pure, social comforts he had once slighted for society which could
                  neither bring peace nor happiness. He yearned to enjoy again those same quiet
                  home-comforts, to have the same sweet spell of domestic bliss woven once more
                  round his neglected fireside; and he determined to spare no efforts to regain
                  it.
               It was on a bright, cold morning that our young couple were seated at the
                  breakfast-table. Neither had spoken for some moments, when, suddenly, Charles
                  pushed aside his plate and cup with a very decided flourish, and folding his arms
                  and turning towards Fanny, said, in a tone at once resolute and serious.
               "Fanny, will you leave your 'Ladies' Circle,' if I will leave the club?"
               For a single instant there sparkled a roguish twinkle in Fanny's bright eyes, and
                  an extra dimple hovered round her rosy lips; but only for an instant—for the
                  pretty face wore a deeply serious expression when she put down the cup of coffee
                  she had held to her mouth without drinking a swallow, and answered, in a tone of
                  well-feigned astonishment,
               "Why, Charley, how very strange it is of you! How could you possibly get along
                  without the brilliant society of those splendid fellows? They haven't turned you
                  away, have they?"
               "No, Fanny, they have not turned me away; but I have become heartily tired of
                  their light festivity, and if you will leave the Society you have joined, I will
                  never again meet with them. Will you leave it, Fanny?"
               "Yes, Charles, I will, if you wish it."
               "Thank you, Fanny, a thousand times. We will henceforth spend our evenings in our
                  own little parlor, and I solemnly promise never to step my foot within the
                  club-room door again."
               And he kept his promise.
               After a few moment's conversation, in which all differences were happily adjusted,
                  Charles imprinted a kiss upon his wife's fair cheek and departed for the city,
                  with a lighter heart and more cheerful countenance than he had known since the
                  first night he visited the club-room.
               The door had scarcely closed upon her husband, when Fanny Selwyn flung herself
                  upon the sofa and burst into a fit of laughter. "Ha, ha, ha, didn't I know
                  stratagem would win him back, even though love did fail? Well, well, I have
                  learned how to manage my husband; just
                  let him miss a few of his domestic comforts, myself included, for a short time,
                  and I shall at last come off victorious."
               When Charles Selwyn returned from the city that night, and opened the parlor door,
                  he was greeted with a smile and kiss from his pretty little wife; and as he
                  glanced around the room and his eyes fell upon the easy-chair standing before the
                  cheerful fire, with his dressing-gown and slippers all nicely warmed, he could not
                  refrain from exclaiming,
               "Oh! Fanny, you cannot think how happy I am to see our pretty room look like old
                  times again."
               From that day, the sun shone upon no happier household than the one which gathered
                  round that little cottage fireside. Fanny never seemed too weary to read during
                  the pleasant evening, nor was Charles ever tired of listening to her sweet voice.
                  The fair wife could not again complain of her husband's neglect, for never was
                  there a more devoted husband than Charles Selwyn. And as years passed lightly by,
                  and the home of Selwyn became each day dearer to his heart, he often laughed with
                  Fanny over the happy success of her simple stratagem, and he never regretted that
                  it had won him from the pleasures of the dangerous club-room to the peaceful
                  happiness of his own loved and cherished home.
            
            
               TO THE ABSENT BROTHER.
               
                  Thou art gone, thou art gone, from the home of thy youth,
                  Thou art gone from its love, thou art gone from its truth,
                  From the clasping of arms that around thee would twine,
                  From the murmur of voices that mingle with thine.
                  The Farewell of loved ones hath saddened thine ear,
                  Thou art parted from those who have cherished thee here.
               
               
                  From the kisses thy mother pressed on thy young brow,
                  From the tears of affection she sheds for thee now;
                  From the father, whose blessing and tear-blinded eye
                  Spoke volumes of love when he bade thee good-bye;
                  From the sister who spent with thee childhood's sweet morn,
                  From the loved of thy home, thou art gone, thou art gone.
               
               
                  Thou went bravely forth in thy manhood and pride,
                  A young heart within thee, a world at thy side;
                  Thine eye saw no shadows, thy heart gave no fears,
                  To the future that slept in the fast coming years.
                  But there mingled a sigh in thy farewell tone,
                  For thou went forth a wanderer, young and alone!
               
               
               
                  The sweet years of childhood forever gone by,
                  Its glee lost in care, its smile in the sigh;
                  Thy home-hearth exchanged for the world's crowded mart,
                  Where cold words may chill all the warmth of thy heart;
                  Oh! say, is it strange we tremble for thee.
                  Launched alone on the waves of life's siren-like sea!
               
               
                  Yet go! for youth's spring-time is over thee now,
                  May the laurel thou seekest be twined on thy brow.
                  Thy name shall be breathed in each loved one's prayer,
                  That the stream of thy life may be tranquil and fair;
                  That the sunshine of peace o'er thy pathway be shed,
                  And a blessing, a blessing rest on thy young head.
               
            
            
               HAPPY NEW YEAR.
               
                  
                     
                        Hush the light laugh; 'tis the midnight bell.
                        Which tolleth the old year's parting knell.
                        Times quivering wings are rustling by,
                        Bearing the old year's dying sigh;
                        And we hear a voice like a "sound of dirth,"
                        Sighing, what will the next year bring forth?
                        
                     
                  
               
               Yes, yes, happy new year. New year in the castle, new year in the
                  cottage. New year on the dancing ocean; new year on the sunny land. But ah! does
                  the ringing echo meet a response from every heart? does every voice murmur in
                  joyous tones, "a happy new year?" Oh! no, no; there are pale, wan
                  cheeks whereon bright tears are shining like sparkling diamonds—there are white
                  lips whereon no heart sunshine hath lingered for many a long dreary day—there are
                  cold spectre-like hands, pressed tightly over slowly breaking hearts—there are
                  sad, low voices murmuring in the bitterness of woe, "one year ago today!"
               Mark yon proud mansion. In the spacious hall little dancing feet are gliding to
                  and fro; small and white hands are
                  filled with rare and costly gifts; young hearts are beating wild with happiness,
                  which knows no shadow; sweet, rich voices are ringing forth like bridal chimes,
                     "A happy new year!" Ah! yes, this is the happy new year to the
                  inmates of yonder home. Wealth, luxury and pleasure surround them. Every cherished
                  one of that circle who gathered round the luxurious board last new year's morn,
                  sits this joyous morning in the accustomed place. The chilling void of a broken
                  band has ne'er been felt within that kindred circle, therefore they echo with
                  light hearts and fervent voices, "a happy new year!"
               How neat and pretty looks that little cottage. It boasts no spacious hall, where
                  for years have gathered the high-born ancestry; it boasts no massive doors with
                  carved devices and silver knobs. 'Tis not the home of gilded aristocracy, but the
                  far nobler one of peace and happiness, though its inmates be ranked among the
                  lowly ones of earth. Let us take a peep into that pretty room. In the centre
                  stands the table with its snowy cloth spread smoothly over it, and the warm white
                  biscuits steaming through the perforated cover.
               Everything to promote human comfort is there, everything, save princely luxury.
                  The kettle is singing merrily over the bright blazing fire, and the gray cat purrs
                  contentedly on the hearth rug; and unmindful of all, sits the fair, young wife.
                  Yes, she sits there unheeding all around her; the dark hair parted smoothly on the
                  white forehead, and the tears shining on the soft cheeks. One hand holds a little
                  silken hat, with a curling feather drooping jauntily over the side, and the blue
                  ribbons crinkled by the neat little bow that nestles under a plump, dimpled chin.
                  In the other hand is a broken toy, with the small marks of little teeth upon it.
                  Look at that sweet young wife; see how mournfully she gazes upon those cherished
                  tokens, and how the tears gush forth as she murmurs, "one year ago to-day, my
                  Willie wore this little hat, and clasped in his dimpled hand this broken toy; now
                  he lies in the cold, dark grave, with the death shroud folded round him, and his
                  pale hands crossed over his silent heart!"
               Ah! yes, yes, one year ago to-day! Many, many a sad change has passed
                  over us since then. Last New Year's Day the idol of our country was with us in all
                  the pride of vigorous life; this new year he lies cold and silent in the embrace
                  of arms whose clasp is never loosened; with the death-seal on his marble lips, and
                  the shadow of eternity resting over his noble brow. Well, well, he "still lives"
                  in a better world, and we can only bless his loved memory, and with fervent hearts
                  thank Heaven for even that precious boon.
               Ere next new year shall come with its merry greetings, we too, may be at
                     rest! This year we may revel in affluence; next year, we may wear the
                  blight of bitter poverty. None may tell what change the fleeting years shall
                  bring; none may lift the mystic veil which drapes the future.
               But this is New Year's morning—so we must not al- low these sombre shadows to fit so darkly before
                  us, while the merry sleigh-bells are jingling around us, and light hearts are
                  beating so joyously; but we'll hope that none may suffer from poverty, while the
                  wealth and aristocracy of our proud city stand with pitying hearts and open purses
                  to relieve them, and soothe with kindly words of sympathy the bitterness of human
                  suffering. And with a light heart and happy tone we'll murmur to one and all,
                     "A Happy New Year!"
            
            
               THE DREAM.
               DEDICATED TO WILLIAM F. CUTTER, BY HIS SISTER LOUISE.
               
                  I dreamed that thou did'st die, will,
                  And slept within the tomb,
                  And o'er the sunlight of my life
                  There hung a veil of gloom;
                  For those dear eyes of thine
                  Were forever closed in death,
                  And from thy cold and pallid lips
                  There came no warming breath.
               
               
                  And when upon thy heart, Will,
                  I pressed my hands in woe,
                  I dreamed that through its silent cells
                  The life-blood ceased to flow;
                  And when I kissed thy marble brew,
                  And bade thee speak to me,
                  Thou answered not, and then I knew
                  Thy soul had broken free.
               
               
                  I dreamed that thou didst lie, Will,
                  All motionless and still—
                  That thy young life was stricken down.
                  With death's cold, silent chill;
                  Thy voice was hushed forever,
                  And thy weary spirit fled
                  And when I wildly called thy name,
                  They told me thou wert dead.
               
               
               
                  Yes, they told me thou wert dead, Will,
                  That I called for thee in vain,
                  That thy young heart had ceased to beat,—
                  Thou ne'er would'st speak again.
                  Oh! my heart was filled with darksome woe
                  For its sunny light had fled.
                  And there seemed no joy upon the earth
                  When I dreamed that thou wert dead.
               
            
            
               THE WARRIOR'S WIFE TO HER HUSBAND.
               
                  I loved thee in thy beauty,
                  And I loved thee in thy pride,
                  When the helmet rested on thy brow,
                  And thy falchion by thy side.
                  I loved thee when thy manly tones
                  Rang forth in warlike strife,
                  And when mid sword and plume you led
                  A soldier's martial life.
               
               
                  And on the blood-red battle-plain,
                  When fire and ball flashed by,
                  And the heavy smoke of the red campaign
                  Shadowed the cloudless sky:
                  When shout and groan alike were heard
                  Of victory and of fame,—
                  And the foeman with his falchion bold,
                  Laid thee amid the slain.
               
               
                  'Twas a death wound—and you came to die
                  Upon my throbbing breast—
                  To bless me are you calmly slept
                  The soldier's dreamless rest.
                  I marked that brow grow pale and cold—
                  I marked those eyes grow dim—
                  The lustre of their proud light hid
                  By Death's cold glassy film.
               
               
               
                  I marked the blood flow from thy side,
                  And knew 'twas wasting life,—
                  But yet you bid me not to weep—
                  
                     I am a warrior's life!
                  
                  You say that tears do not become
                  The wife of one who fell
                  Where stately plume and banner proud
                  Bent with the battle spell.
               
               
                  You bid them shroud thee in thy cloak,
                  And lay above thy breast
                  The helmet and the fashion
                  That thy hand in battle pressed;
                  You bid them with the muffled drum
                  And the cannon sound thy knell,—
                  But you say that tears should never flow
                  When a soldier breathes farewell.
               
               
                  Alas! I cannot keep them back—
                  Unconsciously they flow,
                  And like mute angels, seem to soothe
                  My heart's unspoken woe.
                  Thy martial cloak shall be thy shroud,
                  And the cannon's roar thy knell;
                  But Oh! let tears, like angels, soothe
                  The warrior's last farewell!
               
            
            
               THE DEAD PET.
               My pretty bird! my bright, beautiful canary, with its twinkling eyes of jet, and
                  its velvety feathers of pale, whitish gold! he lay quietly in my open hand, and
                  closed his tiny eyes never to opened them more.
               My darling bird! how fast the tears rolled down my cheeks as I watched him die. To
                  be sure he was nothing but a bird, but then for years the little creature has been
                  my pet, cherished and loved, because his life depended on my watchful care. His
                  golden warblings have many months made sunshine in my sick room, cheering its
                  loneliness, and making the dreary hours pass less wearily. He was given me by a
                  darling brother, and I loved him the more fondly for that dear one's sake. His
                  pretty songs carrolled so sweetly in the sunshine, seemed almost like the voice of
                  the absent one, and as they fell on my ear, they awoke pleasant memories of hours
                  which have faded in the shadows that fall from the broad wings of time. All
                  through the long days, when the sunlight played over the floor and when the dark
                  storm filled the room with gloomy dimness, his merry voice rang through the house
                  making music for our hearts, and driving away every shadow of gloom.
               Is it a wonder that I wept when I saw his sparkling eyes grow dim! Is it a wonder
                  that my heart grew sad with grief when
                  I saw him lying in my hand, silent and dead?
               Dear little pet! his cage hangs in its accustomed place, but it is empty. The
                  golden form that sprang so gracefully from wire to wire will flutter there no
                  more. The music voice that floated on the air in melody, that mingled with the
                  children's gleeful songs, and rang forth with new sweetness when they caressed him
                  with loving words, will never more make sunshine in the house. My sick room hath
                  lost the charm that soothed its silent weariness; it hath lost the golden tones
                  that made it bright and sunny. Sweet little pet, thy songs are ended; thy
                  cherished form will grace its little cage no more.
               
                  Take, take the empty cage away,
                  The bird will sing no more;
                  He hath charmed my ear for many a day,
                  He hath blessed my heart with each dear lay,
                  But all his songs are o'er.
               
               
                  The sunshine will not gleam again
                  Upon his pretty head;
                  I'll hear no more the golden strain
                  That bound me in its sunny chain;
                  My little pet is dead.
               
            
            
               THE LAST WISH.
               
                  Let me hear the song of the summer birds,
                  That is hushed in the wildwood now,
                  Let me feel the touch of the summer breeze
                  Once more on my heated brow.
                  Let me feel once more through my lattice come
                  The rose and the violet's breath,
                  Let me see the flowers and the springing grass,
                  Ere I sleep in the arms of Death.
               
               
                  The wail of the northern wind goes by
                  With a cold and dreary sound,
                  And the winter's sheet of glistening snow
                  Lies white on the frozen ground.
                  But the summer I know will soon come back
                  With its sunshine of birds and flowers,
                  And oh! I long for its gentle breath,
                  long for its quiet hours.
               
               
                  The crimson flush is on my cheek,
                  The brightness in my eye,
                  The dark seal set upon my brow
                  That bringeth death's cold sigh.
                  But I know the Saviour's open arms
                  Will take me to his breast.
                  And his gentle smile beam on me there
                  In the land of eternal rest.
               
               
               
                  I know that His mansions are bright and fair,
                  That His tones are peace and love,
                  And while I sigh for the home on earth,
                  I long for the home above.
                  My heart beats fainter each passing hour,
                  My dream of life is o'er,
                  And I shall soon be in that better land
                  With the loved ones gone before.
               
               
                  But I long to hear the pleasant sounds
                  Which the wildwood warblers pour,
                  And to gaze on the soft blue skies again
                  Ere I go to return no more.
                  I long to see the violets bloom,
                  The wild rose and the thyme
                  To hear soft winds go whispering by,
                  To die in summer time.
