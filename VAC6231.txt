                  CHAPTER I.
                  HOPING AND FEARING.
                  WHEREVER you went, north, south, east, or west, within a considerable circuit,
                     you might see on a clear day the sails of "Four Meadows Mill" standing like
                     silent watchers against the sky, or moving with the wind. It will be understood
                     from this, that "Four Meadows Mill" stood on high ground, which it did; the
                     four meadows in whose very center it was placed sloping gradually up to it.
                  
                  It was a chilly autumn evening. The mists had settled down so as to leave
                     nothing truthfully revealed that was not closed at hand. The trees but a field
                     off might be houses, and the houses trees, for all a stranger to the place
                     could discover. The lanes, bordered with hedgerow timber, were thickly strewn
                     with the fallen leaves; and the hedges had few beauties left beyond the golden
                     and crimson tints of decay, and the bird harvest of hips and haws already
                     bright in color.
                  Along one of these lanes walked a peddler, as his pack showed him to be—a man
                     who had passed the very prime of life without having lost its vigor. He was
                     white-headed; but his back was straight, his head erect, and his step firm:
                     and, though he wore an air of perplexity, it was evidently but of a trifling
                     and temporary kind. More than once he had paused before a gate or a hedge-gap,
                     over which he seemed straining his eyes to see something that, from the mist,
                     could not be seen. At length, solacing himself with the thought, "It's a long
                     lane that has no turning," although he felt sure he had never been in so
                     hopelessly long a lane before, he was agreeably surprised by the vision of a
                     man at a short distance, emerging from the haze, and advancing slowly towards
                     him.
                  "Good-evening," he cried, making a halt in the front of the stranger: "I never
                     was better pleased to meet with company. Can you direct me to Four Meadows
                     Mill?"
                  The man was dressed in a long white smock frock: and, coming as he did all
                     unexpectedly out of a breath of vapor, he might have made a nervous heart
                     tremble; but the peddler was not nervous. He stared curiously for some seconds
                     without replying to the question, and then said,—
                  "Be you a going to the mill?"
                  "That's just what I wan't to make out," cried the peddler. "I was directed to
                     take the turn that brought me into this
                     lane; but I cannot make out whether I am going to the place or from it, for I
                     can see nothing."
                  "The mill is to the right," said the man.
                  "Then," exclaimed the peddler, "I am going from it?"
                  "You be so," said the man, with a confirmatory nod.
                  "Then put me right, friend. Which turn must I take?" asked the peddler: "it
                     gets thicker and thicker; and, if I don't get into the road soon, I shall be
                     benighted before I find it."
                  "Second gated this side," said the man in a tone of indifference, that
                     contrasted strongly with the peddler's energetic appeal.
                  The latter, who had rested his pack on the ground, now shouldered it again, and
                     turned in search of "the second gate this side." He soon reached it: it was
                     locked; and, while preparing to climb it, he said, "A good-evening and quick
                     getting home to you," to the man, who came up at the moment, with a lumbering
                     movement, and answered calmly, "You needn't a clomb;" then, producing a key
                     from his pocket, he unlocked the gate.
                  "Thank you," said the peddler: "you have done me another good service. I doubt
                     if I could have got my box over that high gate without shaking it; and now one
                     thing more,—which way do I go, straight upwards; that is, to the right?"
                  "Ay, sure, straight up'ards," said the man, who was busy locking the gate on
                     the inside.
                  "I suppose I am bearing right," the peddler soliloquized when he had advanced
                     some distance on the hillside. He was almost startled by the man's voice
                     replying from behind, "Ay, right enough:" the soft sward and the heavy mist,
                     which thickened every moment, had prevented his hearing or seeing him.
                  "What! you there?" he exclaimed. "Which way are you going?"
                  
                  "The way as you're a going, as I suppose," said the man.
                  "What! to the mill?" inquired the peddler.
                  "Ay, sure; and you'd best let me come afore, and guide the way," said the man,
                     passing in front of him.
                  "Why in the world, my friend, didn't you tell me you were going to the mill? It
                     would have saved me some trouble; for I have been walking in doubt and fear
                     every step, lest I should come up against a tree, and hurt my limbs or damage
                     my goods."
                  "You never axed afore," replied the man quietly.
                  The peddler could not help being amused with the rejoinder. He wondered what
                     sort of companion he had met with. At first, he had seemed dull enough; but he
                     suspected now that there was plenty of shrewdness hidden beneath that
                     unpromising surface. "Perhaps, then, you live at the mill?" he asked, finding
                     that what information he got must be in the way of answer to a direct
                     question.
                  "I do," said the man; "leastways, I don't, I gets my vittles there; but I
                     sleeps at home."
                  "Ah! but you belong to the place, and know plenty about it, and the mistress of
                     it?" said the peddler.
                  "Ay, plenty," replied the man, with an emphasis and a sigh that contradicted,
                     in this case, the old aphorism, "Plenty is a little more than a man has." It
                     appeared evident that he would have found "plenty," with a little less of his
                     experience.
                  "It is Miss Hornbeck?" said the peddler.
                  "Ay, sure, Miss Jenny as used to be," replied the man.
                  "She has been a long time at the mill. Have you been with her long?" asked the
                     peddler.
                  "I've lived wi' her and her'n ever sin' she come into the world," answered the
                     man.
                  
                  "Then you are an old servant indeed," remarked the peddler; "for she has been
                     in the world a pretty considerable time, hasn't she?"
                  "She b'ain't young, not she b'ain't old," was the answer.
                  "I dare say you are much attached to her,—fond of her," remarked the peddler;
                     but the tone in which his companion uttered "fond," by way of reply, showed
                     him, that, in his mind, Miss Jenny and fond did not at all assimilate.
                     Nevertheless, he repeated his question in a modified form, saying, "I mean you
                     must be so thoroughly used to her."
                  "Never knowed anybody as got used to her," was the laconic answer; and an
                     ordinary tactician would have been assured, from the voice in which it was
                     given, that it was hopeless to try and drew more information from the same
                     unpromising source; but the peddler, nothing daunted, 'continued his
                     efforts.
                  "What! isn't she a pleasant person to live with?—a good mistress? What sort of
                     a person is she?"
                  "You be a going to the mill, b'ain't you?" demanded the man, after a pause
                     which had made the peddler doubt if he should obtain any answer at all to his
                     questions; and he replied,—
                  "Well, yes: I hope so. I'm in a fair way for it now."
                  "Then you can find out for yourself the sort she is, and will pretty quick
                     to-night, without there's been a change in her sin' dinner-time," said the
                     man.
                  "What! she has a quick tongue or temper, or both?" suggested the persevering
                     peddler.
                  "I never said nought of the kind," was the answer.
                  "No; I see you won't speak harm of those whose bread you eats you are quite
                     right." The peddler spoke approvingly; but his companion did not accept his
                     approbation, as was plain by the tone in which he muttered, "Eats my own bread." And when he continued,
                     "You mean you earn what you eat," he answered quickly, "Nobody never had her
                     bread as didn't earn it."
                  Perhaps he thought, after this speech, which was delivered with some warmth,
                     the best way to save himself from indiscreet answers to the peddler's questions
                     was to take the lead out of his hands, and turn catechist himself; and so he
                     began,—
                  "You be a trader?"
                  "Ah! replied the peddler.
                  "What be your pack,—grocery and such, or gowns and that, or stockings, or may
                     be watches and the like?"
                  "I have a little of most things," replied the peddler; "but most of my stock is
                     in knives, scissors, and razors, and other small cutlery."
                  "And how come you to think of getting a deal with the missus?" asked the
                     man.
                  "Oh! there is something, you know, in getting ting a new beat: it increases
                     business. There are good houses, I am told, about here; and they say Miss
                     Hornbeck has plenty of money."
                  "Plenty! she'll never have that much," said the man.
                  "Oh! she is one whose wants grow with their means?" asked the peddler; but his
                     companion, drawing in again, answered,—
                  "I b'ain't a going to say nothing about her. When you gets a deal with her,
                     you'll find out for yourself."
                  "Money never made any one happy yet; but it's the commonest mistake in the
                     world to believe that it will," the peddler remarked: and the man replied a
                     little sharply,—"
                  "Seems you've got no objections to it, by your carrying that pack about."
                  "Nay, but we must get bread to eat, and raiment to wear," the peddler
                     expostulated: "we may surely work in our calling, without desiring to heap up
                     riches!"
                  
                  "Very like," said the man in his usual tone of indifference. "Yonder's the
                     mill," pointing to a little light that twinkled through the most. "See, you'll
                     have to be sharp in picking your way back again in this fog: for there's a many
                     awk'ard humps and stumps of old trees as has been cut down; and, if you don't
                     take care, you'll have a fall of your goods."
                  "Oh, I hope I sha'n't come back to-night at all!" said the peddler.
                  "Not come back? where be you going to sleep?" asked his companion, adding, "not
                     at the mill, I can promise you; and there b'ain't never a house for lodgers in
                     the lane by. Mine's a or'nary place; but you're welcome to bide in it till
                     morning: you shall have a bit of fire."
                  "You have been a very great help to me, indeed," said the peddle. "I am very
                     thankful to have met with you. If I had not have missed my way, and travelled
                     far out of it, I should not have been so late. I hoped to get back, and remain
                     at Hancock to-night; that is near, I know."
                  "Ay, sure! it is a comical time to come trading in."
                  "I suppose Miss Hornbeck will see me tonight?"
                  "Can't say: there's no counting upon her: she might rate me for taking of you
                     in; and she might rated me for keeping of you out. But, if you've got a mind to
                     be ready for her tongue, in case as it's not agreeable, and'll try your luck,
                     why, here we be, close at the door."
                  He spoke in a low, cautious voice: but it was enough, with the slight noise of
                     their approach, to raise a loud bark; which was quickly joined by a shrill
                     yelping, that made it into a most uproarious chorus.
                  "Down, Wolf, down!" said the man. "He won't hurt, now he's heard me. I can
                     always make him peaceable: he's awk'ard wi' strangers; but he's the reasonable brute alive
                     wi' friends."
                  The peddler, who had felt uneasy at the hostile reception they had met with,
                     was re-assured, especially as Wolf's behavior bore out the character given to
                     him: for his bark subsided into an amicable grunt; and he came up and rubbed
                     himself against the man's legs.
                  "Is he loose? he whispered nervously; for he was not sure that he should be
                     looked on as a friend.
                  "Always loose o'nights, arter dusk hour. Good boy! good old feller!"
                  Wolf, though he appreciated duly these compliments, smelt out that a stranger
                     was in the company, and became more personally inquisitive about the peddler
                     than was at all pleasant: but the man allayed his fears, and drew off the dog;
                     and they gained the low porch that overhung the entrance.
                  Here he hesitated, and said softly, "If so be I was alone, I should go in
                     backwards. But may be missus mightn't like for me to take you in unbeknownst to
                     her; and, if so be as I was to leave you here, I'm not so sure about Wolf's
                     being friendly as would make it pleasant to you: so I'll venture," a knock in
                     front."
                  This "venture," which was a very humble one, made with an evidently nervous
                     hand, brought no other answer than a renewal of the yelp from the inside; and
                     another knock, after a sufficient interval, given with more energy, met with no
                     better success.
                  "What can ha' come of her? She's not out, sure," exclaimed the man in some
                     perplexity.
                  "You knock too gently: she didn't hear," replied the peddler; to which the man
                     answered, under his voice, as if he did not wish even Wolf to hear the
                     treason,—
                  "She not hear! Folks 'll tell you she can hear what the fishes thinks about in
                     the middle of the sea. I can't make it
                     out: there was a light in the window."
                  At this juncture, a sound of voices in the rear roused Wolf to a warlike
                     salute; but he was soon silenced by a harsh and strong reproof from one of
                     them. "Down, brute! Come on, Mr. Hope: he won't do you any hurt. Down, I say!
                     Don't you know me?"
                  "There is something frightful in the bark of an unchained dog, especially in
                     the dark," remarked Mr. Hope. "A good conscience that one does not come as a
                     thief or a vagabond isn't quite enough to make one keep one's ground."
                  "Haw! who's here?" cried his companion, going up against the two men in the
                     porch just as they were coming out to make way for her.
                  "It's me, miss, only me,—Jerry," said the man, in the meekest of tones.
                  "Only you? How long have you had two bodies?" "miss" demanded.
                  "It's a person wi' me, miss, as was wishful to see you; and I met him on the
                     road, and helped him to find the way," answered Jerry.
                  "What does he want? Who is he?"
                  Before Jenny could answer his mistress's question, Mr. Hope expostulated,
                     "Sha'n't we go in, Miss Hornbeck? We're all in the dark, and it's very damp;
                     and Wolf is hardly satisfied about me. He comes much closer to me than I like;
                     and he is beginning to growl."
                  Miss Hornbeck acquiesced with her usual expression, when words were
                     insufficient, or not readily forthcoming to convey her mind on a subject,
                     "Haw!" She put the key in the lock; and the door flew open, as if afraid of
                     facing her with opposition a single moment.
                  It was a low door, leading to a low passage. Miss Hornbeck, having made way for
                     Mr. Hope to take refuge from the possible incivilities ties of Wolf, turned round on the peddler and
                     Jerry, crying, "Who have you brought here at this time of night?"
                  "It's a trading person, miss, as was a losing on himself," said Jerry, all the
                     little manhood he had hitherto shown fast dissolving under the spell of that
                     voice.
                  "And couldn't you manage to let him find himself anywhere but here?" she
                     angrily demanded.
                  The peddler now stepped forward, and turned spokesman. "I come from a place
                     well known to you, Miss Hornbeck. I have made a long, stretch out of my way on
                     purpose to see you; but I won't trouble you to-night. I can get a lodging, if I
                     may see you again in the morning."
                  "You ain't seen me at all yet," said the lady miller. "I'm not the one to be
                     done with chance traders: you mind that. I dare say you've heard that I've got
                     plenty of money; but I'm not a fool, to be easy parted from it, if I have."
                  "It's not altogether a matter of trade I'm here upon," said the peddler. "I
                     told you I came from a place you know very well; and I've got a thing or two to
                     tell you about it that may be worth knowing."
                  "Haw!" exclaimed Miss Hornbeck, after a moment's pause of reflection on his
                     words.
                  Then she turned to Jerry,—at least to where she supposed he stood, and said,
                     "What made you so long gone?"
                  "Jones warn't to his time, miss: so I bided till he come," replied Jerry
                     humbly.
                  "Have you got the samples?"
                  Jerry fumbled up his long smock, to get at his pocket.
                  "Not now: I don't want 'em, now. Go and get your supper, and see all made
                     right."
                  "This 'ere travelling man, miss," said Jerry very timidly,—"might he have a
                     ruck o'straw over the stable? or might
                     I bide there tonight, and he shall have my place?"
                  "Bide where you like," she answered impatiently, not noticing the question
                     concerning the peddler; for she wanted to go to Mr. Hope.
                  Rashly interpreting this permission favorably, Jerry went on to ask if a bit of
                     bread and cheese, and a draught of whey, might be given to the stranger; but
                     his mistress did not stay to hear him out, much less to answer him: she slammed
                     the door in his face, and, turning the key inside, hastened to her guest.
                  She found him with a book open in his hand, standing under the lamp that hung
                     from the centre of the ceiling. It was an iron lamp, fed with oil, not
                     brilliant at the best, and too high up to afford much of its dim light to any
                     but the tall. Mr. Hope being short, and troubled with asthmatical difficulties,
                     after climbing the hill, found it very wearisome to stand on tiptoe as he did
                     now, trying, by holding his book high up, and squeezing his eyes into a focus,
                     to succeed in reading it.
                  "You'll please excuse me, sir," she cried. "That pudding-headed Miffler kept me
                     chattering about some peddling fellow he's brought up here: now I'm ready to
                     attend to business. Please be seated." She accompanied the invitation with the
                     push of a chair across the sanded floor towards the little round table that
                     stood beneath the lamp.
                  "Lamp too high up?" she inquired, as Mr. Hope, now seated, winked up anxiously
                     towards the smoky luminary; for the sudden slamming of the door had agitated it
                     into a state of flaring, that lessened the little light it gave.
                  "I'll reach you a candle," she said. "I can do my business very well by it;
                     but; there's a deal of difference in eyes: and I know that lamp won't suit
                     every one."
                  "I could see a little standing; but, in sitting, it's impossible: for down here it throws its own
                     shadow on the book," said Mr. Hope, putting the book on the table, and, as he
                     did so, eliciting a smothered "Haw!" from the lady miller, for she saw it was
                     the Bible; and the thought crossed her mind, "What does he want here this time
                     of night with the Bible?"
                  She stalked to a corner cupboard, whence she produced a bright brass
                     candlestick, and lit the candle at the lamp, which her long arms could readily
                     reach for the purpose.
                  "If it's the last account you wanted to settle sir, I've got it ready; and I
                     hope there's no complaint this time about the flour. It's your cook don't knead
                     well, or the yeast is bed" please tell Mrs. Hope that's it."
                  "No, Miss Hornbeck, no," interrupted Mr. Hope: "I can't undertake to interfere
                     in these matters. Mrs. Hope will settle them and the account together, when she
                     calls; which I dare say will be soon. But just now, if you please, we must
                     attend to the business I did come on, or my man and his lantern will be here
                     before I am ready for him."
                  Miss Hornbeck, with a doubtful expression on her face, hung up her black bonnet
                     on the corner of the cupboard door, which was still open, and took her stand
                     beside him, her arms extended, and her hands planted on her waist in the form
                     called akimbo.
                  "Wouldn't you—wouldn't you sit down?" said Mr. Hope, smiling half nervously, as
                     if he felt she had too great an advantage over him all that way up, to enable
                     him to make good terms with her.
                  "Haw!" she cried, flouncing somewhat impatiently into a chair.
                  "Well, here we are, then," Mr. Hope began, after a preliminary throat-clearing.
                     "You think of turning your tenants out of their cottages, in order to improve
                     your property?"
                  
                  Miss Hornbeck gave a jerking nod of assent.
                  "But you cannot forget that they had your father's promise that they should
                     never be disturbed?"
                  Miss Hornbeck had a particular screw of the mouth when any inward displeasure
                     was kept in check; and it made its appearance now: but she did not reply.
                  "Therefore I don't see how you can disturb them. To do so would be an act of
                     great injustice both to the poor people and to your father's memory."
                  "Haw!" with uncontrollable emphasis was the answer.
                  "Now," continued Mr. Hope earnestly, "let me beg you to consider that a promise
                     is so binding"—
                  "I never promised," interrupted the wrathful Miss Hornbeck. "If my father had a
                     mind to be foolish, that's no rule for me. I must look after things better than
                     he did when he got old, and too soft-hearted."
                  "My good friend, I am shocked: I am grieved to hear you talk so!" exclaimed Mr.
                     Hope. "I will say nothing of the gratitude you owe him for his entire bestowal
                     of his property on you, to the exclusion of his sons. The fifth commandment is
                     what I insist on, 'Honor thy father and thy mother.' Now, you know what your
                     excellent mother would have said to your proposed conduct; and you have your
                     father's positive commands upon you, conveyed in his promise to those old
                     people." He endeavored to enforce this appeal by a most expressive look; but
                     Miss Hornbeck had turned her face as far away from him as she could, and was
                     letting off the explosive hurricane in her heart, by violently shaking her
                     foot.
                  "Just think of the shame you will bring on yourself," Mr. Hope continued,
                     descending to lower motives, as his
                     highest strains of argument was so unsuccessful. "These poor people have lived
                     in tolerable comfort all these years, under the impression that their home was
                     secure to them; and there is not one who had not a good claim to be so
                     remembered by your father. If you don't think better of it, you will bitterly
                     repent of it, I am quiet sure."
                  Miss Hornbeck started up, and turned full on him. "Look you, Mr. Hope: I don't
                     get money without working for it; and I've got no mind to throw it away.
                     Besides, it's not altogether the money; I can't bear the people? they're a pack
                     of whining, canting"—
                  "Hush, my good friend, hush! no abuse. I can't let you abuse them. They are
                     among the most excellent, orderly, well-conducted people in the parish," cried
                     Mr. Hope.
                  "Easy job to take you in, sir," resorted Miss Hornbeck, with an unpleasant
                     laugh. "Anybody can do that, that can cant a bit."
                  "These people are no talkers. If you suppose they have been entreating me to
                     come and plead their cause for them, you are mistaken. It was your own man,
                     Miffler, that told me quiet accidentally this afternoon; and I resolved, much
                     as I dread the damp evening air, to come to you at once, and try to advise you
                     into changing your mind,—for your own sake really, as much as for the poor
                     people's."
                  "I'm obliged to you; but I've got my reasons. I'm not the person to do things
                     without a reason."
                  "No, I believe you; but the question is, Are you sure it is a good reason?"
                  "Why, yes, I am," she answered, with the same unpleasant laugh. "You preached
                     in your sermon a while ago, that we must look sharp after to-morrow; and what's
                     the good of hearing sermons, and talking no heed to them?"
                  "In what sense did I lay the charge on
                     you?" asked Mr. Hope, a little confused and bewildered at the sudden
                     attack.
                  "In the sense of looking about us, and laying out and laying by for what's to
                     come. That's the way I took it," she replied.
                  "I can't remember any thing you could have misinterpreted into a justification
                     of your conduct; unless, surely, you are thinking of a sermon about three weeks
                     ago, when my text was, 'Take no thought for the morrow.'"
                  "Very like. I don't know what the text was; but I know you said we must look
                     about, and not let 'to-morrow' make us repent of 'today:' and I thought to
                     myself, 'That's well: I'll see to them cottages.'"
                  "You didn't listen to the whole: you entirely mistook my meaning. I see no
                     reason, I grieve to say, to make it needful for me to urge my congregation to
                     be worldly-wise: that they sufficiently are. I was trying, I am sure, to
                     impress on your hearts the necessity of so living to-day as to be ready for
                     to-morrow,—the great to-morrow,—God's day of reckoning."
                  "I always take words to mean what they say; and I thought to myself, if I let
                     them stay on any longer, they'll think they're there for good: so it's best be
                     alive about it, then I sha'n't have to blame myself for dully-dallying,—that's
                     how it was," said Miss Hornbeck, who looked quiet relieved by having thrown the
                     onus of her conduct on her companion's shoulders.
                  It was in vain that he argued and quoted passage after passage from the Bible,
                     to show her the curses on an undutiful child, and the promises to those who
                     walked in the obedience of love: she looked more and more like the wall, on
                     which her eyes were fixed every moment.
                  "I won't again remind you, that the parish all around will cry shame on you.
                        You may well despise the opinion of
                     man, if you can set at naught the law and favor of God," he said at last,
                     rising to go, as a loud knocking told him that his servant had arrived. "I
                     hoped to have saved you from this sin and disgrace; but, if you won't be saved,
                     I am clear of it."
                  "I consider I'm looking sharp after to-morrow, sir," said Miss Hornbeck,
                     lighting him out.
                  "Friend," he replied, turning round on her, "there is also the day after
                     to-morrow. When that day comes, you will be sorry, oh, how miserably sorry! for
                     repentance will be too late."
                  The impenetrable face made no response. The lady miller was, however, more
                     struck by his words than she chose to appear to be, and, as she bolted the door
                     after him, gave utterance to a long "Haw!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL.
                  JERRY Jerry Miffler!" cried Miss Hornbeck, as she went down the low passage,
                     and made for the kitchen, after letting out Mr. Hope. Before he had time to
                     answer, she pushed open the door, and there beheld Jerry alone by the nearly
                     fireless grate, looking as if her call had scared his head up and his eyes
                     open; for he had, it was plain, been fast asleep.
                  "What have you done with that man?" she demanded.
                  "Man?" said Jerry, in a tone of bewilderment, the sudden apparition of his
                        mistress making him quite oblivious
                     of every thing but her presence.
                  "Ay, man, trader, peddler,—whatever you call him,—where is her"
                  "He's a-bed, miss, in my house," said Jerry, gradually recollecting
                     himself.
                  "Where did you pick him up?" she asked, having raked the embers together, and
                     seated herself opposite to him.
                  "It was him as picked me up, miss," said Jerry, who had a vague fear that he
                     was going to be called to account for making the acquaintance.
                  "What d'ye mean?" demanded Miss Hornbeck.
                  Jerry explained, by describing the meeting between himself and the peddler.
                  "Haw!" said the lady. "Where does he come from?"
                  "Didn't ax him, miss," said Jerry.
                  "Just like you. What does he want?"
                  "Wants to trade, as I understand," said Jerry.
                  "Nothing else?"
                  "Said summat about wanting to see you," said Jerry.
                  "What for?" asked Miss Hornbeck.
                  "Never axed him," said Jerry.
                  "What's his name?"
                  Jerry shook his head.
                  "Wiseacre!" exclaimed his mistress scornfully. "Couldn't you have asked
                     him?"
                  "Ay, sure, I could," said Jerry sheepishly.
                  "Could,—could,—but didn't. That was what Jem Stone said about the pigs."
                  "What, miss?" asked Jerry with a look of interest.
                  "What? Why, that he could have got any price for 'em, but didn't," she answered
                     sharply.
                  "Did he go for to tell you so, miss?" asked Jerry, much interested, and
                     evidently struck by the strange act of
                     Jem's having told of himself.
                  "He did, but not till I had found it out from somebody else," said Miss
                     Hornbeck.
                  "Oh!" said Jerry; meaning, "that explains it."
                  "So I told him to be off, and paid him to the day; and you'll have to be up
                     early, to do his work. And there's a job or two left for you to-night: there's
                     grain to be shifted, and another thing or two. Snuff your lantern, and come
                     with me. I'll show you."
                  Jerry obeyed, sorry to find that Jem Stone was gone, especially as he had such
                     personal reasons for regretting it; but he would as soon have thought of saying
                     "No" to the wind that blew him down the hill as demur to an invitation from his
                     mistress: so, though he was very tired from a long day's work, he submissively
                     took up his lantern, and followed her to the mill, to finish off that which did
                     not belong to him.
                  "Is the man old, or young?" asked Miss Hornbeck, as she strode on before.
                  Jerry answered her much as he had done the peddler, when she was the subject of
                     inquiry.
                  "What has he got?" she demanded.
                  Jerry told all he knew.
                  Miss Hornbeck stood by, lighting him, sometimes otherwise helping him, while he
                     performed the remnant of the officially defunct Jem's labors, and seemed quite
                     as fresh and ready for work as if she had not been busy ever since four o'clock
                     in the morning.
                  When all was done, and the mill was locked, and she was leading the way back,
                     lantern in hand, she suddenly turned on her companion with the evil-boding
                     words, "I've got a crow to pick with you."
                  "A what, miss?" said Jerry, who understood more from her eyes and voice than
                     from her words that a storm was brewing.
                  "A crow. Did you never hear of a
                     crow?" she demanded, setting down the lantern on the kitchen-table, and
                     standing before him with wide-open eyes,—eyes as black as any crow, showing the
                     whites all round.
                  "Yes, miss," said Jerry, shaking in his shoes, and wishing himself a crow, or
                     any thing else that had wings.
                  "Well, then, here's my crow. What business have you got to go gossiping about
                     my business to other people?"
                  "Business, miss?" said Jerry, with a doleful and disappointed air; for he had
                     thought an extra half-point would be offered as the reward of his extra work,
                     and little expected "crow-picking" instead.
                  "What have you been chattering about to Mr. Hope? Tell me that," said the lady
                     miller. "You that I have kept out of nothing but kind feeling, you to go
                     backbiting me!"
                  "Me, miss?" said Jerry, electrified, as the conversation he had certainly had
                     with Mr. Hope came into his mind.
                  "Yes, you. Now sit down there,—don't stare so,—and tell me what you told him,"
                     she said, giving him a little push towards the settle.
                  Heartily did he wish that she would not stare so; but, collecting his scattered
                     wits as he might, he related what had passed.
                  "Go on. You told him how you pitied the poor things, and how, if old master had
                     lived, they'd never have 'seen the road.' How much more?"
                  Jerry did not see any need to criminate himself, like Jem Stone departed: so he
                     made no answer; and, finding she could neither drag nor draw any more out of
                     him, she suffered him to leave, after he had cleared up another trifle or two
                     of Jem's dues, warning him that he must be up betimes in the morning.
                  "You'll see my light in the window. Bring the samples with you; I'll settle
                     them first thing: there'll be a heavy day for us tomorrow."
                  
                  "The day after to-morrow will be a deal heavier," said Jerry.
                  Miss Hornbeck, remembering Mr. Hope's words, gave an involuntary exclamation;
                     on which Jerry explained that Mr. Randall was going to send that great lot of
                     grain to be ground at once, either by wind or water.
                  "Haw!" said Miss Hornbeck, in her usual tone: and they parted for the night,
                     Jerry to go to his straw over the stable, and the lady of the mill to discuss
                     her solitary supper by the side of the now brightening little fire; which, as
                     if it knew like all other and every of the Four Meadows' Mill subjects, that it
                     was of no use to attempt to go to sleep while the ruling power was awake, had
                     turned to in good earnest, and briskly darted its newly-kindled little forks of
                     flame among its faded materials, to remind them that Miss Hornbeck "expected
                     every cinder to do its duty."
                  "Burnt up," said that lady, with a nod at the grate, as much as to say, "You
                     knew who poked you; that's plain," and then established herself, in what was
                     comfort to her, on the settle, having by her side the remains of a huge cold
                     pie and a small measure of ale.
                  She ate, as she did every thing else, with an eye to business. To-morrow she
                     knew would be a hard day, even for her, by reason, in part, of the loss of Jem
                     Stone's services; and, in part, of a move she meant to make in her improvement
                     scheme. As mechanically as the sails of her mill followed each other did
                     mouthful follow mouthful, till the portion she had considered necessary was
                     consumed; then, having given her whole thoughts to the meal while it lasted,
                     she tossed of the ale with one swallow, and turned the measure upside down by
                     the side of the pie, in the little inner buttery. This done, she crossed over
                     to the sanded parlor, and from the corner cupboard, whence she had brought the
                     brass candlestick for good Mr. Hope,
                     she took a dingy red-covered book and a small stone ink-bottle and steel pen,
                     and sat down under the lamp, with a look of occupation even more decided than
                     that she habitually wore; and these were her lucubrations, some
                     half-uttered.
                  "Let me see. Near twenty years,—just twenty years, all but a few days, I've had
                     this mill; and a pretty difference there is in the property since I came in to
                     it,—air the land round, which was no more than common then, under good
                     cultivation, and let at rents paying fifty per cent more than it did then. That
                     railway coming close through was a fine thing; and that bit they were forced to
                     buy was a fine thing, giving me the ready money to work the rest. Ah, ha! if
                     poor father could get out of his grave, and see what I've done, wouldn't he
                     say, Bravo, Jenny!"
                  This involuntary thought brought others with it; which came not only without
                     her will, but much against it. "What would father say?" How could she help
                     remembering Mr. Hope's warning on the certain punishment of a breach of filial
                     duty? Though she didn't believe what he said, she had disliked hearing it; and
                     a frown puckered her forehead, and gave an angry expression to her black eyes,
                     as his words now returned to her.
                  "Haw!" she exclaimed, suddenly shutting the book, in which she had been
                     entering rent received that day, and took from a secure pocket a leathern
                     purse. It was still in her hand, unopened, when she turned her head to the
                     little window, through which the feeble rays of the lamp had acted as a beacon
                     to Jerry and his companion.
                  "Not shut! That old gentleman put it out of my head. What brought him teazing
                     me at that time of night?" she soliloquized, closing the shutter, and drawing
                     the bolt, and then sat down, adding, "Bright notion, to count money with an
                     open window at one's back!"
                  
                  Very soon she was looking exultingly at the shining heap before her. She knew
                     it was right. "Would she have allowed her tenant to go without being satisfied
                     to the last farthing? By no means; but there was a pleasure (known only to
                     those who know it) in seeing the queen's face printed so fairly in gold and
                     silver so many times over: and she put all back into the purse with some
                     reluctance.
                  Thus she continued ruminating, while she made her final arrangements for the
                     night.
                  "Too much to keep in the house. I'll take it to the bank to-morrow, if I can
                     get time. What a plague that Jem Stone was, to provoke me to turn him off just
                     now, when I'm so busy! Don't like trusting strangers; must get a hand
                     somewhere. Ben Onions?—lazy; Phil Bligh?—tricky; Wood?—too old. I must look
                     about, and work Jerry double till I have found some one: his doubles aren't
                     worth much. Poor tool, poor tool! Don't see how I can find time to go to
                     Hancock to-morrow. Haw, must make time."
                  Three minutes after, Miss Hornbeck was fast asleep, her purse under her pillow;
                     and the little dog—whose duty it was to yelp inside the house at every noise
                     outside, when his mistress was not on guard, but to keep the peace with all
                     meekness when she was—lay by her door, ready to give the alarm, if any
                     misguided marauder should attempt to molest the dwelling-house of Four Meadows'
                     Mill.
                  It was no more than ten o'clock where her gradually-deepening breathing became
                     unmistakable snores; and the little dog, having once or twice picked up his
                     ears to be sure the sound was a legitimate one, stretched himself peacefully on
                     his mat, and joined chorus with his mistress, as he had done before with Wolf.
                     It was no more than ten o'clock; but, to people who rise at four in the
                     morning, that is an hour very reasonably to be called late. Jerry, who had had more than an hour's start of
                     his mistress, considered himself due to bed, and quite ready for it, as he went
                     towards his cottage, to give a look to his visitor before taking refuge in his
                     straw.
                  The light streamed through the window, which possessed neither curtain nor
                     shutter; for Jerry had nothing to hide not to guard but himself: and Miss
                     Hornbeck, who owned the house, had told him, when he asked her to put up a
                     shutter, he'd "never be run away with till there was never a man left in the
                     worlds to run away with him."
                  This Jerry supposed to be true, though not flattering; so was content to go
                     shutterless. His want now served him a good turn: it would save him from going
                     in and talking with his guest. He had no taste for talking: talking never
                     seemed to do him good; often it did him harm. If he never indulged in a little
                     innocent gossip with a neighbor, it was sure to get to Miss Jenny's ears, with
                     many changes and additions. If, in an unguarded moment, he gave her any
                     information respecting the same neighbors, she was sure to turn it to account
                     in a way prejudicial to his character or his comfort; and he was justified
                     (though chemists might have doubted the statement) in saying, "He found as
                     words always turned to hot water."
                  Perhaps he was naturally indiscreetly candid: if so, discipline had done
                     wonders for him.
                  "I'll just peep through the window," he thought, going softly up, and looking
                     in; but, to his surprise, the room was empty: the fire was bright, and showed
                     every thing clearly enough. The little three-legged table stood before it, and
                     one of the two chairs was at the side: the bed in the corner—for the house had
                     but one room—had not been disturbed. But sign of living creature there was
                     none: the peddler, his pack, his box, his stick, had departed.
                  
                  Jerry tried the door. It was locked. He could see through the keyhole. The key
                     had been taken out. The man must have taken it with him; for it was not stuck
                     in the thatch.
                  "Well, well, if Miss Jenny wouldn't make a good haw at this," he cried. "He's
                     gone, sure enough. He haven't taken my Sunday clothes, I hope. Nothing else to
                     lose; that's a blessing when thieves is about: but I don't think harm of him,
                     only"—
                  "Surprised to find me out?" said the peddler, coming behind him, without either
                     his pack or his box.
                  "Ay!" said Jerry, almost frightened.
                  "I've been a little way, to see a person on business," said the peddler.
                  "Where's your pack?" asked Jerry.
                  "Under the bed, friend: I put all my goods there; I was sure they'd be safe.
                     Here's the key. Come in, and have a minute's chat over the fire."
                  "No, no," said Jerry: "I must be up too early for that; I only came to see if
                     you was comfortable."
                  "Quite," said the peddler.
                  "And to say I'd have brought you some wittles, if I could, to put to what you'd
                     got in your pocket."
                  "Had plenty," said the peddler; who seemed in excellent spirits, as if he had
                     partaken of much more generous diet than his host.
                  "Good!" said Jerry; "then here's a pleasant night to you: I'll look in the
                     morning, if I can get a bit of time."
                  Jerry was perfectly indifferent to what the peddler's business might have been;
                     but the reader shall know all about it.
                  When good Mr. Hope left the mill, he said to his man Thomas, "Go by the
                     mill-lane home."
                  "Very slippy that way, sir, and farther round," said Thomas.
                  
                  "Yes: but you must drive carefully; and we must make the best of it. I have
                     business there: pull up at Molly Martin's."
                  "They'll all be gone to bed, sir, won't they?" argued Thomas, who objected to
                     fog on his own account as well as his master's.
                  "We shall see when we get there: It is but eight o'clock now; and Molly shall
                     have the chance of a call."
                  There was no more to be said; and Thomas obeyed. A little light twinkled on the
                     hedge opposite the three cottages.
                  "Somebody is up; and I dare say it's Molly," said Mr. Hope, as the carriage
                     bumped along the rutty lane.
                  He was right. In the centre house, the light stood: the others were dark.
                  "I won't stay long, Thomas," he said, almost in a tone of apology. "Put the rug
                     over your knees, and put up the umbrella if you're afraid of the drizzle: it
                     does drizzle. I'll soon be out."
                  Thomas felt dubious, but made himself as comfortable as he could; and his
                     master lifted the door-latch, and went into the cottage. There sat by the poor
                     fire an old woman, busy reading. There was no doubt about the book,—an old,
                     well-worn, large-printed Bible; and she, being very intent on her subject, did
                     not raise her eyes from it till he stood by her, and touched her shoulder.
                  "Heh! but you started me," she cried, lifting up the merriest of faces that
                     ever looked merry under such disadvantages; for it boasted but of one eye, the
                     other being closed up, and covered with a shade.
                  "I rattled the door; and I should have thought you would have heard the
                     carriage," said Mr. Hope, seating himself.
                  "Soft road, and maybe a little hard hearing," said Molly in explanation. "I
                     don't know what made you come so late, sir; but I'm hearty glad to see you any
                     time:" and she looked hearty glad.
                  
                  "Why, Molly, I shouldn't have come in now; but I was passing. And to-morrow I
                     have a vestry-meeting, and the club-committee meeting, and many things: so I
                     thought I'd try and see you to-night."
                  "Night or day, sir, you're a good sight to see," said the old woman, with a
                     merry little laugh.
                  "I've been to the mill," he said, watching for some change in her face; but
                     there was none. "Perhaps she does not know what is hanging over her," he
                     thought. "Miss Hornbeck is—is—Have you seen her lately?"
                  "Ay, sure, sir, she's been here once or twice in the week, looking over the
                     ground," said Molly, as blithely as if it had been a survey made for her
                     special benefit.
                  "And she came in and talked with you?" he inquired.
                  "Well, sir, there wasn't much talk: it wasn't pleasant to talk about, you know,
                     for none of us," said Molly.
                  "Then you know what she thinks of doing?"
                  "On course we do, sir: we've been on the hooks of that a long time; and she put
                     us easy about it Thursday is a week."
                  "Put you easy?" said Mr. Hope.
                  "Ay, sir, told us her mind, and what she would do; and that was a deal better
                     than letting us know it by black looks and cross words that was spoke at us. I
                     was always for knowing the worst of a thing."
                  "But it will be a sore trial to you all," he said in a tone of
                     commiseration.
                  "It comes hard, there's no denying that: but, dear heart, sir, the world must
                     find room for us while we are in it; and, when we are taken out of it, we won't
                     need to trouble any one for a lodging. Why, just as you started me up, I was
                     reading,—this place. Please to look here, sir. You see, spectacles and all, I
                     can't make more than two eyes: so I'am not quick at reading." With a joyous look, as if she
                     had been congratulating herself on great advantages, she pointed to her open
                     Bible; and Mr. Hope, looking at the place, read from the thirty-second of
                     Deuteronomy, "He led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of
                     his eye. As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth
                     abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings, so the Lord alone did
                     lead him; and there was no strange God with him."
                  "Read it," she asked, when he raised his face from the book.
                  "I have; and you believe in it, and take it to yourself?"
                  "On course, on course," said the old woman heartily. "Do I so turn my back on
                     his mercies of all my life past—seventy-five years and more—as to think he'll
                     leave me now? No, no: if he was a strange God, I might be afraid; but he is
                     'the Lord alone.' And just now look'ee here," she cried eagerly, turning to
                     another place which had been kept open by her spectacle-case; "Don't you see
                     this?"
                  Mr. Hope, again looking down, read, as her finger pointed to it, "Here we have
                     no continuing city; but we seek one to come" (Heb. xiii. 14). "And you are
                     doing that, I believe," he said.
                  "Believe I am: the Lord be praised," she said, with a cheery little laugh.
                  Mr. Hope, who had come, with some oppression of heart, to comfort her, laughed
                     too. "So, then, you are content with whatever may come?" he asked.
                  "I don't know what is coming: nobody knows, lying down at night, what's to come
                     tomorrow. It may be, before I am set out to seek for a home, the Lord may come
                     to call his people—even poor critters like me—to the many mansions he is gone
                     to prepare for them. How do I know?
                     Why, believe me, sir, I can't turn to a place in this book but it fills my
                     heart with more comfort than it'll hold; and I don't care, when I'm comforted
                     that way, what may happen to me in my few days that are left. He'll bear me on
                     his wings 'to old age,' it says in another place. Bless the Lord, O my soul!"
                     Old Molly seemed fairly overcome with emotion as she uttered the last
                     words.
                  "And how do your neighbors take it?" asked Mr. Hope, admonished by a cough from
                     Thomas that he must remember his promise to make haste.
                  "Kitty Wood, pretty well," said Molly. "But John is getting into years, and
                     ailing too; and he'll have to take her, being her son: so she makes a trouble
                     of troubling him, specially as his wife isn't agreeable to it."
                  "And Betty Harness?" he asked.
                  "Betty is one as doesn't seem to know much difference between being in trouble
                     and out of it: she says it's hard, and that; but she said things went hard
                     afore this came. She'll go to her daughter in Hancock; and I think it will be
                     hard upon her, poor thing! with her five children and a very indifferent
                     husband. I'm sorry for them, very!" And, for the first time, Molly looked
                     grave, almost sad.
                  "And where do you think of going?" he asked again, but getting up to go, as
                     another and louder cough from Thomas audibly reproached him.
                  "Me?" cried Molly, her laugh returning. "Well, sir, how can I tell? I've got
                     never a son nor a daughter, nor no relation in the world, except my poor boy as
                     broke the laws, and was sent beyond sea, poor lad!
                  "That was a trouble: but there, it's been turned into good to me; and I believe
                     it'll be turned into good for him."
                  "Then you've made no plan?" said Mr. Hope, clicking the lock to pacify
                     Thomas.
                  
                  "How can I, sir, when I've got nothing to make it of?" said Molly, her face
                     twinkling all over at her little joke.
                  "Well, well, you've got the best of all comforters," he said: "keep close to
                     that, and fear nothing. I'll call again in a day or two, and see Kitty and
                     Betty: tell them so, will you? The Lord bless you, and have you in his holy
                     keeping!"
                  "Here's a person wants to see you, sir," said Thomas, in a voice not at all
                     like Molly Martin's.
                  "Can't see him in the dark," said Mr. Hope, with a laugh; for he had caught the
                     infection from Molly more readily, because he was always predisposed to it.
                  "I wanted very particularly to speak to you, sir, and was on my way to your
                     house, when I found that you were in that cottage," said the person.
                  "To my house? Very good: get up then by Thomas; and you shall drive down. It's
                     no distance; but it'll save time." Thomas gladly made room for him, rejoiced to
                     avoid another parley on the road.
                  They were soon at the vicarage; and the peddler, who, as the reader will have
                     divined, was his visitor, thought he had never beheld so cheerful a room as
                     that he was ushered into.
                  "Take a chair, friend," said the good man. "It's a raw night: you will be glad
                     of the fire."
                  "Thank you, sir. I come, sir, from Hickleton, on business I want your advice
                     upon: it respects Miss Hornbeck, of the mill."
                  "Hickleton, Hickleton?" said Mr. Hope in a thoughtful tone. "Ah, yes! Miss
                     Hornbeck has friends there, I know. I remember, her father's first wife came
                     from Hickleton."
                  "Yes, sir; and her half-brother, Christopher Hornbeck, lives there now," said
                     the peddler.
                  "Oh! he is alive, is he? we have heard
                     nothing of him for a long time,—many years. You know, I dare say, that his
                     father's leaving all his property, or nearly so, to his daughter, made him very
                     angry. He came here, and was very full of wrath,—very: but it was just, quiet
                     just; for the mill and all the property came to old Hornbeck through his second
                     wife, Miss Jenny's mother."
                  "Yes, sir, it did; but, by a mistake, I doubt if he has really left it to
                     her,—that is, if she can keep it: I doubt he has got the law on his side, and
                     will clear it all off," said the peddler.
                  "Never! ne-v-e-r!" said Mr. Hope, astonished.
                  "It's this way, sir," said the peddler: "by law, he had no power to leave any
                     of his second wife's property; for it was in the hands and power of trustees:
                     and she, through she left it to him when she died, could only leave him the
                     possession of it, not the willing away of it.
                  "I've got the law of it written down, sir: perhaps that will make it plainer to
                     you than what I have said."
                  So saying, he took a paper from his pocket-book, and reader as follows:—
                  "'The legal estate in fee simple was vested in the trustees of
                     the marriage settlement,' (that was the second Mrs. Hornbeck's marriage
                     settlement, you understand, sir,) 'and remained in them and the survivor;'
                     consequently it never was in John Hornbeck. Now, sir, if he had no legal title
                     to the estate, he could not devise it, you see," the peddler concluded, folding
                     up his paper, and looking at Mr. Hope.
                  "But,—but," said Mr. Hope, "I understood that Mrs. Hornbeck left him ll."
                  "She left him all she had, sir,—a beneficial interest: the fee simple, or legal
                     possession, by ignorance, or oversight, never was taken out of the hands of her
                     trustees; therefore it was not her to leave to him, you understand."
                  
                  "Oh, dear! oh, dear!" said Mr. Hope, with a sigh: "what a thing the law is! And
                     he means to fight for it, knowing that both her father and her mother fully
                     intended her to have it?"
                  "He does, and is confident of success; and so is his lawyer," said the
                     peddler.
                  "Give me the gospel,—the plain, true gospel, that makes its covenant as clear
                     as the sun at noonday, and as sure as the mountains. Ah, sir! this is a very
                     bad business. And, pray, why didn't he put in his claim before? It is now
                     twenty years since old Hornbeck died; and he has made no stir since the very
                     first."
                  "Not quiet twenty, sir: it wants three days," said the peddler.
                  "Three days! but Miss Hornbeck knows nothing of it?" he exclaimed.
                  "She will know to-morrow, or the day after," said the peddler: "a notice will
                     be served on her then."
                  "The day after to-morrow!" cried Mr. Hope. "How very remarkable! but why has it
                     been left so long?"
                  "He has waited to the extreme time allowed by the law; twenty years he might
                     wait from the death of the testator: he will claim on the last day," said the
                     peddler.
                  "But why not before?" asked Mr. Hope.
                  "Because he knew she was improving the property more than he could do: she is
                     so energetic, so industrious. He knew it was in far better hands than his;
                     besides, he is vindictive: he will never forgive his having been overlooked by
                     his father, through he so richly deserved it. And, next to getting the
                     property, he enjoys the thoughts of turning her out, and getting rich by her
                     labors."
                  "O heart of man!" cried Mr. Hope. "Is this the heart which some say is
                     regenerate in baptism? capable of rising in its own strength from its inborn
                     corruption, and mounting to heaven
                     without a new nature, without the baptism of the Spirit? Sir, I am shocked! I
                     knew man was wicked; but this is such deliberated, cruel villany! but I trust
                     he will be foiled."
                  "I fear not," said the peddler.
                  "Poor Miss Jenny! she will say I am a prophet. Surely,—well,—may all be
                     overruled to her good, and God's glory!"
                  After further talk, in which Mr. Hope advised with the peddler how best to
                     shape his course in the matter, the latter, hospitably refreshed, returned to
                     Jerry's cottage.
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  A SHADOW FROM COMING EVENTS.
                  JERRY could not "find" time for visiting in the morning, and not being equal,
                     like his mistress, to "making time," did not call on the peddler. What time
                     came to hand in the natural way, he used after his fashion; that is, he made
                     half an hour's work lie over three quarters (when Miss Jenny was not at his
                     heels a whole one), being certainly, in point of energy, what she called
                     him,—"a poor tool!" Truth to say, he forget his guest in his accumulated
                     labors; till Miss Jenny asked him, as she poured out his porridge at about seven o'clock,
                     what he had done with his man.
                  Jerry stared.
                  "Your peddler!" said Miss Jenny.
                  "Oh, peddler! ay," said Jerry, recollecting himself: "he's at my house." As the
                     words escaped him, the thought came in, "Unless he's gone wandering again."
                  "Don't think you're sure of it?" said Miss Jenny, who saw the doubt as plainly
                     as if he had spoken it.
                  Jerry felt sure she could hear what the fish in the sea were thinking about. He
                     looked at his porridge to escape her eyes, and muttered, "I left him there last
                     night."
                  "When is he coming up here?" asked Miss Jenny.
                  "He didn't fix; but he'll be stirring soon, by his way," said Jerry.
                  "What way?" said Miss Jenny.
                  "His—his—ways in the general," said Jerry, looking at every word as he spoke,
                     as if asking, "Will you get me into trouble?"
                  "Then he's quick and lively, I suppose? What made you take him to your house?
                     he's a stranger to you."
                  "You said as there was nothing to run away with there; and I couldn't leave him
                     to bide out in the dark and cold," said Jerry, fortified by a spoonful of
                     porridge into being able to give a good answer.
                  "Haw!" said Miss Jenny "I shall be going out to-day. I shall want the black
                     mare: so you'd best fetch the bricks betimes, to give her a rest in
                     between."
                  Jerry wished she would be as considerate to him as to the black mare; but he
                     continued his porridge, after nodding an answer.
                  "Who's there?" cried Miss Jenny, starting from the fire, where she was
                     frizzling a rasher of bacon for her own breakfast, as a sharp knock made with a
                     stick fell on the door.
                  
                  "The peddler, very like," said Jerry, going on with his porridge; for he was
                     afraid of seeming in a hurry to let him in, through he did not know why.
                  Miss Jenny, however, performed that office herself: she shook the rasher into
                     the plate, hung up the fork, and confronted the peddler in a few seconds.
                  The day had hardly come into full life; but the fog had vanished, and the sun
                     was giving cheerful promise of the bright hours of a clear autumn day.
                  "Excuse my calling so early, miss," said the peddler: "but I knew you would be
                     up and about; and I have a long journey and plenty of business before me."
                  Miss Jenny, while he spoke, observed him sharply,—his person, his pack, his
                     box, and, having finished, fixed her eyes on his face with a very emphatic
                     exclamation.
                  "You don't want any thing in my way, perhaps haps? Tea, I have samples of: but
                     my goods are chiefly cutlery and stockings; and I have a little assortment of
                     fancy articles."
                  An expression of impatience crossed Miss Jenny's face, at the mention of fancy
                     articles; but, otherwise, she seemed more taken up with the speaker than his
                     goods.
                  "What may your name be?" she asked.
                  "Banks," said the peddler.
                  "Dick Banks?" she asked earnestly.
                  "The same, miss," said the peddler.
                  "And from Hickleton you come?"
                  "I do, miss," said the peddler.
                  "Thought I knew your face; but it's a good many years since I saw you. Come in.
                     Have you had your breakfast?"
                  "No, miss: there's a place at Hancock, I'm told, where I can get a good meal
                     cheap; and I'm going there after I've done business with you."
                  "Don't know about business," said Miss
                     Jenny: "I've got no money to throw away."
                  "Nobody has money to throw away, miss, if he does honestly by it," said the
                     peddler; "but I'd like to have, a bit of talk with you about your friends at
                     Hickleton."
                  "Haw! come in: you can get a bit of breakfast here, without going to Hancock;
                     bring your pack into the parlor. Jerry, look alive, and see to the bricks when
                     you've done."
                  Jerry, who had finished his porridge, and was transacting the remainder of his
                     business with bread and cold bacon, nodded as usual; and the peddler followed
                     the lady of the mill into her private sitting-room, with pack and box.
                  "I can't give you your breakfast till the man is cleared out," said Miss Jenny.
                     "But I was up hours before you; and I have not tasted bread yet: so we're in
                     the same boat. And how's all the folks at Hickleton? and what's going on
                     there?"
                  "It's a long day since you were among them," said the peddler: "there's a
                     goodish bit to tell,—some dead, some born, some gone up in the world, and some
                     come down."
                  "Always the way with places," said Miss Jenny. "I suppose you never happened to
                     come this way before? There's fine alterations since I came into the property:
                     if poor father could only see it, he'd be proud enough; and some folks I could
                     mention would be fiercer than ever. And how long have you taken to this trade?"
                     she continued.
                  "Ever since I gave up my smithy through bad health," said the peddler.
                  "Pay?" inquired Miss Jenny.
                  "Pretty well, as times go," said Banks.
                  "Your mother alive?"
                  "Yes."
                  "You're married, of course?"
                  "No."
                  After some further inquiries respecting Hickleton in general, and the peddler's affairs in particular, Miss Jenny
                     went to the kitchen-door, which she reached in very few steps. "Have you almost
                     done?" she cried.
                  The unfortunate Jerry put his last division of bread promptly into his mouth,
                     without stopping to inquire if there was room for it: so he was obliged to
                     answer by nod, and with haste, for him, made preparations to depart.
                  These Miss Jenny greatly accelerated by her own rapid movements towards getting
                     breakfast ready for herself and her visitor; and he was, as she expressed it,
                     "cleared out," and the table spread with her own special rasher and the cold
                     pie for the peddler in a very short space of time.
                  "We'll look at your goods presently," she said: "we'll get a bit to eat
                     first."
                  The peddler seemed nothing loath, and, standing up by the table, asked a
                     blessing on the food, and then sat down by the cheery fire.
                  Miss Jenny looked at him, as much as to say, "Oh! that's your way, is it?" but
                     made no comment; and soon they were both busy in eating.
                  Banks was either more hungry or more deliberate than Miss Jenny; for she had
                     finished, and was looking at him with some impatience, while he continued his
                     attacks on the pie.
                  "Suppose you haven't seen any of them in Coley Lane?" she said at last, unable
                     to wait any longer.
                  "It was about them, miss, I wanted to speak to you," said the peddler.
                  "I don't want to know much about them: they haven't got much love for me, I'll
                     be bound," said Miss Jenny, as if the subject was one she would rather
                     avoid.
                  "Mr. Christopher Hornbeck," the peddler began.
                  "Haw! come to that, is he? he used to be Kit Hornbeck," said Miss Jenny, with a
                     scornful little laugh.
                  
                  "He has risen a little in the world, and thinks to rise more, being your
                     brother."
                  "No brother of mine!" said Miss Jenny angrily: "he was father's son by his
                     first wife, no son of my mother's."
                  "Well, I know," said the peddler; "but he considers that he is so much your
                     father's son that he ought to be here. I don't say he has right nor a promise
                     of succeeding on his side; but that is what I wanted, as a friend, to tell you
                     If: he is determined, if he can, to turn you out."
                  "Oh!" said Miss Jenny, shaking with angry emotion and scorn.
                  "Yes: I found it out by a curious accident; and I thought I would let you know,
                     to prepare you that his mind is full of it. And he will shortly come down on
                     you: he will truly."
                  "He come down upon me! let him try it, that's all," said Miss Jenny. "Haven't I
                     been in the place, mistress and owner, these twenty years?"
                  "The law is a strange thing, miss," said the peddler.
                  "Stranger than I take it to be, if it serves him against me," said Miss Jenny.
                     "Why! didn't father leave every thing to me in his will but that house in Coley
                     Lane? and wasn't Kit content at last to take that, and never say a word more
                     about the business?"
                  "It seems he had his thoughts, miss, whether he spoke them or not. I'm sorry to
                     say, he has a most revengeful feeling against you, and will do what he can to
                     injure you. I didn't like that you should be taken by surprise; and poor old
                     mother didn't like it: and, when we found it out, she fixed that I should make
                     this round on purpose to tell you."
                  "But he can't man,—he can't! The mill came to my father through my mother, not
                     his," said Miss Jenny, standing up.
                  "The law is a strange thing; miss. He seems to have some notion that he shall
                     get his way; and the lawyer tells him
                     so: and he keeps it very quiet, till the time he has fixed on is come."
                  "He's a villain, and always was!" said Miss. Jenny. "I don't regard him that!"
                     snapping her fingers.
                  The peddler waited till a little of her heat had cooled down, and then by
                     degrees put her in possession of the facts which he had related the night
                     before to Mr. Hope.
                  The paper she would hardly hear him read, declaring it was all "make up;" and
                     she didn't believe there was a word of sense, any more than truth in it. And,
                     as to the explanation, that she treated with similar contempt; and, shaking her
                     head with a scornful laugh, she finished by declaring that all the lawyers in
                     England, with Kit at their head, could not, and should not, turn her out of her
                     own, not alive,—that they shouldn't!
                  "Well, Miss Hornbeck, I hope you are right; and I hope you will not be turned
                     out. Your mother was a very good woman; and Mr. Christopher, to whom she made
                     an excellent step-mother, ought to think well before he turns his hand against
                     her child: we all know that. But she could not give him that excellent spirit
                     which cometh down from above, though she did her best to train him to seek for
                     it."
                  Miss Jenny sat moodily folding and unfolding the cloth she had taken to wash up
                     the breakfast things, and did not answer.
                  "It was gratitude and love to your mother's memory that made my poor old mother
                     and myself so anxious that you should have a little time to look about you,"
                     said the peddler. "She was a kind friend to us before she was married, and
                     after: and, though years have gone by since then, mother doesn't forget; and I,
                     though but a child then, don't forget how she stood by us in our need."
                  
                  "Haw!" half sighed Miss Jenny.
                  "Yes, miss, the memory of the just is blessed. My mother loved to tell how Mrs.
                     Hornbeck was the first person that ever tried to bring her to repentance and
                     faith; and I may thank her for having taught her how to train me: so, for her
                     sake, let alone common charity, we would do any thing we could to serve
                     you."
                  It was plain that Miss Jenny had ceased to listen as soon as faith and
                     repentance were the peddler's subject. Starting up suddenly, and marshalling
                     the cups in order for washing, she went to work, as Jerry used to say, "like a
                     hail-storm," and did not speak till the table was cleared.
                  "Obliged to you for coming," she said then, having expended sufficient
                     superfluous breath to enable her to speak with some clamness. "I was put out,
                     as you may believe, at the thought of Kit's malice and impudence. Why, I
                     offered to take his eldest boy and bring him up, I did; and this is his thanks!
                     But he shall pay for it. I won't leave a copper in that direction. No,—I'd
                     sooner—I'd sooner"—But, not having hitherto had the making of her will and the
                     division of her property in contemplation, she broke off here, being unable to
                     think of any object whom she would choose to enrich: so she resumed her speech,
                     after a moments' pause, with, "I'd sooner grind it all to dust in the mill, and
                     throw it in the brook,—that I would!"
                  Jerry didn't like her eyes at the best of times; but it was good for his nerves
                     that he didn't see them then.
                  "Well, miss, I've done the little I can," said the peddler; "and now I won't be
                     in your way. You'll go to your lawyer or some good friend for advice, I
                     suppose; and, as you are certain to hear to-morrow (for the day after to-morrow makes up the twenty years),
                     there's no time to be lost."
                  The day after to-morrow! When would she hear the last of the day after
                     to-morrow!
                  But Miss Hornbeck affected so entirely to mock at Kit's pretensions, which it
                     seemed to her all the laws of all the kingdoms of the earth could never
                     justify, that she would not allow she was in any hurry to consult any one, not
                     even that she would give the subject a moment's consideration.
                  "If any of his impudence, or of his lawyer's impudence, comes to me, I'll put
                     it in the fire: you may tell him that when you get back," she said, with a
                     laugh not musical, and a look that expressed a hearty good-will, on the spur of
                     the moment, to put Kit and the lawyer in the fire too.
                  The peddler, however, felt sure she would consult somebody when he was gone: so
                     he begged leave to get his goods, that he might depart.
                  "Without showing what you've got?" said Miss Jenny.
                  "If you wish to look; but you told me you'd no money to spare," said the
                     peddler.
                  "Haw! that's true enough," she replied; and recollecting herself just in time
                     to thank him for the trouble he had taken, and to send a message to his mother,
                     she allowed him to depart.
                  "Turn me out, turn me out!" she said to herself, as if trying to take in the
                     full meaning of the words. "I should like to see him do it—him!" and a scowl of
                     scorn and dislike made her look so very unpromising, that Jerry, who had
                     brought the bricks, coming in for his next order, fixed his eyes on the wall as
                     he spoke to her.
                  "Saddle the mare," she said sharply.
                  "Yes, miss."
                  
                  "Get Wood to help you. Here's the key of the beans. I'm going out on particular
                     business: I shall be back in an hour, you may say, or half an hour. Very quick:
                     look alive, if you can, and be ready for Mr. Randall's wheat when it comes
                     to-morrow. Do you hear?"
                  Did he hear? How could he help it?
                  "Wood and he together won't make a man," she soliloquized as she prepared for
                     her ride. "I'll look out at Hancock if there isn't something to be had. I wish
                     I'd cooled a bit before starting off Jem Stone."
                  While Miss Jenny goes off on the black mare (having first seen Jerry and Wood
                     at work), we will let the reader a little into the light of her history. Her
                     mother had died during her early childhood,—so early, that, although she had
                     some indistinct idea of her being unlike people in general, and much to be
                     reverenced, she could not call to mind any particulars concerning her which
                     might prove her impression correct. She was in the habit of classing her with
                     the Bible and Mr. Hope, whom she liked, though she was often offended with him.
                     She had no objection to her mother's having been religious. Her toleration of
                     Mr. Hope's religion was not so entire; for, while she took some credit from her
                     mother's principles, which she considered reflected somewhat of their light on
                     her, without interfering with her practice, his were too apt to come across her
                     in the way of rebuke or hinderance. She had laid up her mother's Bible with
                     superstitious awe; and, though she seldom saw even the outside, and much less
                     frequently the inside, she would not have parted with it on any consideration.
                     She dusted the case in which it reposed regularly every time she cleaned the
                     parlor, which was twice as often as it needed cleaning; for, if Miss Hornbeck
                     had hated sin as much as she did dirt,
                     there would not have been a more diligent seeker after holiness under the
                     sun.
                  After her mother's death, her father kept her by his side continually; and, as
                     soon as she was able to use her head and hands in work, he gave her ample
                     opportunity and instructions for doing it. She resembled him, in persevering
                     energy, in indomitable courage and self-denial, in determination to prosper,
                     and in hardness of spirit and harshness of temper. Some of these qualities,
                     under her excellent mother's training, might have been made the elements of a
                     fine and useful character; but they had never received any modification or
                     check. In her father's eyes, she was a model of wisdom. She kept his books,
                     made his bills, managed his house, and took no small part in such business
                     matters as she could help in. The consequence was, that, when at twenty-one
                     years old she became mistress of the mill and the land around it, she wanted no
                     one to guide or advise her.
                  The quarrel that arose between her half-brother and herself, with respect to
                     the settlements of the property on her, had ended in an entire estrangement.
                     Once she had paid him a visit, when going to see her mother's friends; and then
                     she offered to take his son: but his refusal prevented her from further
                     overtures. Without any of his father's better qualities, Christopher inherited
                     from him a vindictive spirit; and the worldly wisdom, which showed itself in
                     what are called "the tricks of trade" and "the art of getting on" in the old
                     miller, developed itself in the son in the forms of low cunning, and deep,
                     patient craft.
                  Jane Hornbeck, at twenty-one, was a girl of no small attractions,—by no means
                     without personal advantages of a common sort. Her vigor of intellect, her
                     self-reliant bearing, and her exertions to supply the loss she had sustained in
                     her father, made her highly respected and admired by the people round, and
                        more than one eligible match was
                     proposed to her; but she had no mind to marry: she was too much occupied in
                     business to hamper herself with the duties of a wife, and too fond of
                     independence to sacrifice it for any husband. So Jane Hornbeck she remained
                     until our story opens, when she wore a different appearance from that which had
                     won her suitors in the days of her youth. Large-boned, hard-featured,
                     dark-skinned now, rough with work and exposure to all weathers, her grenadier
                     figure, and too often dragoon face, showed that sovereignty and prosperity had
                     been unfavorable to her outward form at any rate. Little did this concern Miss
                     Jenny: eyes were to see with, hands to work with, and so on. She valued each
                     member in herself and others according to the business they got through, and
                     would have scorned any other claim from them on her attention. Years had also
                     set their stamp, and that as unattractive, upon her character. Every quality
                     had hardened into a fault,—some, very grave ones. The world (that is her mill,
                     her land, and their gains) was deep in her heart; and she was hardly careful to
                     maintain a decent appearance of religion by attendance on public worship. Mr.
                     Hope, of whom, in spite of herself, she stood in awe, was becoming increasingly
                     distasteful to her, though she tried to restrain herself, and treat him with
                     respect. In fact, religion was to her a very tiresome, hindering, and expensive
                     thing,—tiresome, because it obliged her to go to church every Sunday, and fret
                     through the time taken up by Mr. Hope's sermons, of which she seldom remembered
                     so much as she had quoted to him in the interview described; hindering, because
                     all work was at a stand till Sunday was over; and expensive, because she had to
                     pay tithe, and put a shilling in the plate at charity collections: yes, Miss
                     Jenny, during twenty years of increasing prosperity, arrived at by concentrating her heart and mind on it,
                     had come to this. She had not really fallen from much, for she never had
                     possessed a spark of true spiritual religion; but her natural heart had not in
                     those earlier days thrust its sharp and pitiless angles through the tenderness
                     and comparative inexperience of youth; so that she had passed current for
                     better than she was: and, when the neighbors looked back, they shook their
                     heads, and said, "Miss Jenny had turned out a worse screw than her father:
                     nobody would have thought she would have come out such a 'hard piece' who had
                     known her twenty years back."
                  And Molly Martin sighed (an uncommon thing for her), when she remembered the
                     piety of her mother, and the earnest prayers she had offered up for her child
                     in her dying hour, for Molly had been her nurse, and, like many others, had
                     learnt heavenly lessons from her teaching. And Molly had often prayed for her;
                     and the knowledge of this act of love, having come to her ears, had given her
                     very great offence, and been one reason for hardening her heart against the
                     three widows, whom her father, not without just cause, had placed in the three
                     little cottages in Mill Lane, with a promise that they should never be turned
                     out.
                  It was true, Kitty and Betty had not offended her by offering more than general
                     prayers for her; but, as they were thought to be much influenced by Molly, they
                     fell under suspicion of partnership in this grievance.
                  Miss Jenny had to go down the mill-lane on her way to Hancock. She would have
                     chosen another road, but she could not without waste of time; for she had a
                     little business to transact between the end of the lane and Hancock, which, if
                     put off to another day, would occasion a second journey. She would not have
                     passed down the lane if she could have helped it, because she did not want to
                     face any one of the inmates of the
                     cottages. Perhaps Molly especially was the one she would have willingly
                     avoided; but, as it very often happens, things turned out exactly contrary to
                     her desires: and Molly, as if as anxious to see her as she was to shun the
                     interview, stood out at her door, to salute her as she rode by. It looked
                     cowardly to pass without saying a word: so she drew up, and nodded, being a
                     little relieved by Molly's very lively air and cheery face. The thought struck
                     her, "She has heard of some home: some friend has turned up."
                  "Fine morning. Going sticking? mind the hedges," she vouchsafed to say, and,
                     considering this enough, prepared to ride on.
                  "The hedges'll never cry out against me, miss," said Molly; who, with her head
                     on one side, to bring her eye to bear on Miss Jenny, and her little scarlet
                     handkerchief pinned tight over her dress, looked like a jaunty robin red
                     breast.
                  "Your skirt's tucked up, miss: let me give it a pull," she added, leaving her
                     gate, and going into the road for the purpose.
                  "Haw!" said Miss Jenny, submitting to the operation somewhat uneasily. "You
                     look all alive this morning."
                  "Yes, miss; and, what's better, I feel all alive, bless the Lord! I'm strong
                     and hearty, though I'm past seventy-five."
                  "Haw! you've had easy times," said Miss Jenny, wishing to remind her of the
                     benefit she had so long enjoyed from her, as a set-off against the hardship at
                     hand.
                  "Easy times! Well, yes, I have; and I hope I shall have the same to the day of
                     my death," said Molly, with a little laugh.
                  "You're going out, you understand," said Miss Jenny, nodding significantly at
                     the cottage; for she now feared that Molly's manner might indicate an idea of
                     her having changed her purpose.
                  
                  "I understand it quite plain," said Molly, with the same merry face.
                  "Then I suppose you have heard of something? Kitty and Betty are well provided
                     for with their son and daughter; but I've been sorry about your having no
                     friend to take you in."
                  This was true; for it had been reflected on, much to Miss Hornbeck's discredit,
                     that she was about to turn out her mother's favorite servant and faithful
                     tender nurse without her having the prospect of a refuge.
                  "I've got a friend: I've got a friend. I've had such a message from him this
                     morning," said Molly, fixing her bright eye, with a very meaning smile, and a
                     very hilarious one too, on the lady of the mill.
                  "I'm glad to hear it," she repeated. "Shall you be going far away?"
                  "Up to the hills," said Molly exultingly.
                  "What hills?" asked Miss Jenny, rather puzzled.
                  "Why, the everlasting hills, to be sure, miss!
                  "'I will never leave you, nor forsake you:' that's the message I've had; and
                     there's promise upon promise that I shall never want here, as sure as that I
                     cannot want there,—there, where your dear mother is, who first told me to care
                     for the heavenly inheritance. 
                        'Sweet is the memory of the past.'
                      I'd tune it if I could, for it's a real pretty hymn; and I often say it
                     over, thinking of her. And, Miss Jenny, my dear,—begging your pardon for being
                     so free,—I hope you'll lay to heart, that you'll never, never see her sweet
                     face no more, if you don't go where she is,—up to the everlasting hills; where,
                     praise the Lord! I'm bent on going, and don't trouble about the bit of road
                     left on this side of 'em."
                  Miss Jenny could not ride on; for the old woman had fast hold on her skirt:
                     otherwise, it is doubtful if she would have indulged her by waiting through her little oration. The moment
                     she could, she gave the mare a sharp rap with the hazel stick, and, with a
                     somewhat dissatisfied "Haw!" rode on towards Hancock.
                  "Old prater: I hate all praters!" she said to herself. "And Mr. Hope?"
                     Questioning whether the advice she wanted would not be dear at the cost of his
                     prating, she went unwillingly the way to his house.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  THE BLACK MARE CONVICTED.
                  DEAD! you don't say so?" cried Mr. Hope. "I am shocked, much shocked! so well a
                     week ago! Well, truly there is but a step between us and death!"
                  "Sudden death has always seemed to me to be the greatest possible mercy to a
                     soul prepared," said Mrs. Hope, who had just brought her husband the
                     intelligence that caused his exclamation. "I don't know what your opinion of
                     poor Mr. Flood was; but, if ready, to
                     be spared a lingering sickness, and the advantages that a weakened mind and
                     body afford to the enemy of souls to tempt and afflict, is no small
                     blessing."
                  "We pray against sudden death," said her husband;" and the shock nature, even
                     nature renewed, receives when it comes before us, shows that we are right to
                     pray against it; though its victims may in some cases rejoice: but the living,
                     my dear,—poor Mrs. Flood, now, and her eight little, children,—what do you
                     think is their condition now?"
                  "Poor things! poor things!" sighed Mrs. Hope.
                  After a further expression of sympathy, and mutual prayer that the Lord would
                     be a present help to the poor widow in her great affliction, Mrs. Hope left the
                     study, to ascertain if she could in any way show her feeling by rendering
                     assistance.
                  "If they were poor, one could do much plainly enough; but it is difficult to
                     see one's way in this case, as I have never been more than friendly with Mrs.
                     Flood, not intimate. I could take some of the children; but, with their large
                     house, and numerous servants, it would be no accommodation to her, poor thing!
                     and she might object to their leaving her: but I will go and see," she
                     said.
                  When she was gone, Mr. Hope, deeply impressed with the occurrence, went through
                     much searching of heart, as to how he stood in the matter of ministerial
                     faithfulness towards the deceased: from this, he wandered through his parish;
                     and soon the interview he had had the evening before with Miss Hornbeck came to
                     mind.
                  "I was not plain enough with her,—not sharp enough, not strong enough,—I am
                     sure I was not," he cried: "and I went, intending to be plain and sharp and
                     strong; but I left her wholly unimpressed. Alas! alas! what poor efforts we satisfy ourselves with: a little
                     moving, a little remonstrance, a little warning, then we think we have done
                     all, and done well; but where is 'the saving with fear, pulling them out of the
                     fire?'"
                  Much humbled under a sense of shortcoming, which was less chargeable on him
                     than on many who do not plead guilty to it, the good man reflected with comfort
                     on the intelligence conveyed to him by the peddler the night before.
                  "This will shake her rocky heart: it will surely shake her. I was grieved for
                     her last night; but what signifies the loss of the mill, if it helps to the
                     saving of her soul? In the sight of this awful dispensation, it seems to me
                     that I could welcome any rod, for myself or others, that was needful to scourge
                     us from the toils of the evil one."
                  In prayerful meditation he sat, surveying his ministerial work, and naturally,
                     among other parts of it, calling to mind his sermons.
                  "Poor, lukewarm things very often, or confused perhaps," he thought. "That poor
                     woman at the mill,—what did she say? that my sermon had hardened her in her
                     love of money, and shut her heart against those poor widows!"
                  After a pause, it occurred to him that he would get the sermon down, and read
                     it; for he could hardly think, willing as he was to condemn himself, that she
                     was at all justified in the inference she had chosen to draw concerning it.
                  "Take no thought for the morrow." He soon had it open before him, and read it
                     carefully through.
                  "Well, really, I don't see—I don't see—I can't see that I have done wrong
                     here," he thought: "I have merely shown, that, as God's stewards, we are to use
                     the things he commits to us; that, instead of selfishly spending our substance
                     in ministering to our undue appetites or our pride, we should consecrate it to
                        the purposes for which it was
                     given; that, while we are forbidden to live in anxious suspense about
                     to-morrow, we are to use the best means afforded us of providing things honest
                     for it. Thus a father should consider the future of his children, as far as God
                     permits him; a husband should provide for the possibility of his wife becoming
                     a widow. Well, that's all right; no more than sowing the corn, if we expect to
                     reap it: there is no self-dependence, no want of faith, in that. And than I
                     finished by reminding my hearers of what is the gist of the sermon,—that there
                     is a day after to-morrow,—a day of account,—when the books will be opened, and
                     we shall be judged."
                  Taking off his spectacles, he laid them on the sermon, devoutly saying, "That
                     day! O Lord! constrain us to live for that day!"
                  Here he was interrupted by a knock at the door.
                  "Come in!" he cried, in more than his usual kindly tones; and Miss Jenny
                     Hornbeck, in her black stuff riding-skirt, and small check shawl pinned tight
                     over her shoulders, her bonnet very independent of the fashion, and a stout
                     hazel stick for a horsewhip, presented herself.
                  "Miss Hornbeck! I was but now thinking of you!" he cried, rising to receive
                     her.
                  "Haw!" responded Miss Jenny, holding up her skirt,—which, however, did not much
                     need it on account of its length,—and advancing.
                  "Take a seat, pray, nearer the fire: it's a very chilly morning, though the sun
                     is bright."
                  "Slushy in the lanes," said Miss Jenny, guarding her splashed skirt from
                     touching any of the furniture.
                  "Give me your stick," said the good man, whose heart was brimming over with
                     desires that she might not leave his house without a blessing.
                  "I'll hold it, thank'ee," said Miss Jenny: "it's got a touch of mud in places. The mare
                     shied; and I dropped it: I'd best keep all the dirt together."
                  So she sat with it upright in her hand, and looked as if she had come to settle
                     a score with her host of no pleasant kind, both her face and attitude being so
                     defiant and warlike.
                  "As you please," said Mr. Hope; "but there's nothing to spoil here."
                  He did not raise himself in his visitor's opinion by this courteous speech; to
                     which she replied,—
                  "Dirt'll spoil anything, even what's worse than itself (if that's to be
                     found)."
                  "Dirt, pollution, is a type of sin, my good friend; and the antitype always
                     exceeds the type: so sin is incomparably worse than dirt," said Mr. Hope, aware
                     that the last assertion was probably all that his visitors could
                     comprehend.
                  "Haw!" said Miss Jenny.
                  "I have been looking over this morning," he said (he was not to make known his
                     acquaintance with what had fallen out in the matter of Christopher Hornbeck),
                     "the sermon you mentioned last night, in which you thought I intended to
                     recommend the cares of the world and deceitfulness of riches as really good
                     things: but indeed I can't see any encouragement to the view you took of it; on
                     the contrary, to the best of my power"—
                  Here Miss Jenny interrupted him by an impatient movement of her arm, in which
                     the stick was affected, and had the appearance of a more hostile position
                     towards the worthy man. Seeing he was going to resume his discourse, which her
                     agitation had interrupted, and that he looked at his sermon, having put on his
                     spectacles, as if he were going to read it to her, she could not contain
                     herself, but said quickly,—
                  "Don't trouble about the sermon, sir; I didn't come about that: I want a bit of
                     your advice about that: I want a bit of your advice something."
                  
                  "I shall be glad to give you the best I can. What is it on, Miss Hornbeck?" he
                     said, taking off his spectacles, and laying them again on the manuscript.
                  "Why, it's all nonsense, I know, and will come to nothing: I know that; but
                     perhaps, as the law is a slippery thing, I'd best see if any thing had better
                     be done, more in paying him back for his impudence and wickedness than any
                     thing else. I don't mean to keep him from doing harm, for he can't do it: and I
                     don't believe he'll have the daring to try it on; still, I thought I'd mention
                     it to you."
                  Mr. Hope did not ask "what," for he knew very well; but he waited patiently for
                     her to continue.
                  Miss Jenny, with sundry little flourishes of her hand, in which the stick
                     participated, to the discomfort of the peaceful-minded Mr. Hope, who did not
                     know what evil a climax of energy might bring upon him, told the tale of
                     Christopher's iniquity, finishing with,—
                  "A nice kind of a brother you call that!"
                  "But you have often said you did not regard him in the light of one, Miss
                     Hornbeck," said Mr. Hope, desiring to set that position straight before they
                     proceeded.
                  "No, never! never did, and never will!" she answered vehemently, with all the
                     inconsistency of passion.
                  "Then you can't expect him to behave like one: you must look at his conduct as
                     you would at that of a person no way related to you," he replied.
                  "See how good mother was to him," she continued, wholly disregarding that
                     logic; "and doesn't he know as well as I do, that it was her will and father's
                     will to settle the mill property on me? Doesn't he knows as well as I do, that
                     father promised me he'd keep his word to mother, and settle it all on me but
                     the house in Coley Lane? and that was given to him just for kindness'
                     sake."
                  
                  "He ought indeed to consider any promise of his father's as sacred, and not to
                     dare to meddle with it," said Mr. Hope, looking steadily at his companion;
                     whose color mounted from her high cheek-bones, where it usually rested, and
                     spread over her forehead and her whole face.
                  "Haw!" she exclaimed; and a short pause followed.
                  "I was hoping, my good friend, that what I said to you last night had given you
                     a different feeling with respect to those poor widows."
                  "No, it hasn't," said Miss Jenny. "I didn't want to speak about them now: I
                     wanted to ask you if I could do any thing to stop his nonsense, if he's so
                     audacious as to try it on. Suppose you wrote him a letter: how'd that be?"
                  "I advised you heartily last night, my friend, and you refused to listen to me.
                     Can I reasonably hope, that, when an old parishioner whom I have watched over
                     for so many years turns a deaf ear to me, a person almost a stranger to me will
                     pay any attention?" Mr. Hope asked.
                  "Don't know," said Miss Jenny, shifting her stick till its end came nearly on a
                     level with the glass shade that hung from the ceiling.
                  "What do you think?"
                  "I think strangers go further sometimes than folks we know," she replied. "And
                     you've got a way of saying things that comes very sharp."
                  "Have I? I failed with you last night," said Mr. Hope.
                  Miss Jenny would have uttered strong words if she had spoken her heart's
                     language; but she did not: only with a rather fierce look, and a nearer
                     approach of her stick to the lampshade, she said,—
                  "It's no good going about other things: I might change my mind; and I mightn't.
                        But what I want to know is, will
                     you write Kit a letter, a good sharp one, and tell him he'll be the worse for
                     his trouble?"
                  "It would do no good, Miss Hornbeck, or I would write it. My advice to you is,
                     that you consult a lawyer immediately: you may be directed very importantly,
                     though I can't see how."
                  "I can't go to Lawyer Kays without paying even for the sight of his face," she
                     said, as she looked away from Mr. Hope's with an expression on her own that
                     seemed to say, there wasn't a face in England she would pay to look at.
                  "Shall I—let me—put your stick in the corner?" said Mr. Hope, as the end rapped
                     the glass in her last movement.
                  "Oh, no! not worth while, thank'ee! If you can't do any thing, and don't think
                     good to write that letter, why, I suppose I must go to Lawyer Kays; but I'd as
                     lief"—
                  What fate she would have preferred to having to pay for a sight of the lawyer's
                     face did not transpire: she lowered her stick, and got up, holding her skirt as
                     tight as before.
                  Mr. Hope was vexed, grieved: he knew perfectly well that such a letter as she
                     wanted would be useless; and, more still, that, if Kit did not
                     intend to proceed, it would be putting the idea into his head: but he felt
                     convinced that she saw nothing in his arguments but a refusal to help her at
                     the cost of any trouble to himself.
                  "I'll tell you what I will do," he cried, as she was going towards the door.
                     She turned, and fixed her eyes on him with eager curiosity. "I'll go to
                     him,—yes, I'll do that; that may be useful. At any rate, there is some chance
                     in it; none at all about the letter. I'll go to him, Miss Hornbeck."
                  "When?" demanded Miss Jenny, much surprised.
                  "At once. There's no time to lose, if any good is to be done. Let me see,
                     Hickleton is on the London line: the
                     next train starts at 12.20. I have just half an hour and ten minutes to get to
                     it: well, that will do handsomely. I could not walk in the time; but" (here he
                     rang his bell smartly) "Thomas shall bring out the carriage. The station is
                     only a mile and a half from Hancock, you know; and we are at the near end of
                     Hancock to it: oh, yes! we shall have plenty of time."
                  The smart ring brought a quick answer in the shape of a maid-servant.
                  "Tell Thomas I want the carriage immediately on important business, to catch
                     the London train; and tell your mistress, Mary, when she comes in, that I don't
                     know how the trains suit: so I can't answer for being home to dinner. She must
                     not wait. There, run; be very quick."
                  The good man looked quite pleased and relieved, as he took his over coat and
                     comforter from the pegs where they hung, and began to dress himself, saying
                     with a smile, "Good folks are scarce, Miss Hornbeck: it behooves us to take
                     care of them."
                  She had not yet recovered her astonishment, and could only stand, her skirt in
                     one hand, and her stick in the other, and stare, much bewildered, till she
                     blundered out a few words of "greatly obliged," and so on.
                  Mary, who never wanted wings when her master was in want of a Mercury, came
                     back instantly, saying that Thomas had taken the horse to be shoed.
                  "I told him not to go to-day," said Mr. Hope, much disappointed
                     that he had. But Thomas, having a will of his own, and considering the shoeing
                     of the horse and the proper time for it in his department, and not in his
                     master's, had given the order the treatment he thought it deserved, not
                     believing the carriage could be wanted till late in the day, as he knew "ther'd
                     be clubs and that going on."
                  
                  Mary looked as if she would willingly turn horse, and man too, for the
                     occasion, and stood in the doorway with a longing face.
                  "Will ye mind using the black mare?" asked Miss Jenny, turning to Mr. Hope.
                  "Mind? Not a bit! she'll go in harness?"
                  "Go?" exclaimed Miss Jenny, "why, I bought her for draught!"
                  "And she has often been driven?" he asked.
                  "Over and over again; and, if she hadn't, she should begin to-day," said Miss
                     Jenny.
                  "But there's another difficulty,—nobody to harness her and put her in, and
                     about bringing the carriage back from the station?"
                  But the whole thing was perfectly clear to Miss Jenny now.
                  "I'll do it all, sir; and I'll drive you. Maybe the mare will go, better for me
                     than she would for your man. If this young woman will show me where the stable
                     is, and the harness, it shall be ready for you in a twink."
                  "Sure I will, and help you too," said Mary, running off to the stable, while
                     Miss Jenny stalked behind.
                  "Whoa, lass! Come, old wench! there's my darling," cried Miss Jenny, as she
                     dressed up the black mare in the spruce harness which Thomas would have been
                     much mortified to see on so homely and clumsy a brute.
                  "Go and say we're ready," she cried, giving the finishing pull at the last
                     strap: "stand still, my darling," patting the mare; who, being unused to so
                     tight a fit, was inclined to expostulate, unmoved by the tender expressions
                     which Miss Jenny never bestowed on any living being but the mare in question
                     upon strong emergencies.
                  "We shall be in time," said Mr. Hope, coming briskly out, and mounting; "that
                     is, if your mare will go."
                  
                  "Go? I'll see she shall go!" replied the lady miller,
                     mounting to the driving-seat, and taking the reins.
                  "I'm sorry to give you the trouble of driving; but"—Mr. Hope began, but stopped
                     perplexed.
                  "It's best she should know who's behind her," said the lady expressively; and
                     they started at a sharp trot.
                  "This is very good," said Mr. Hope: "she goes as if she were running away from
                     something, doesn't she?"
                  The last part of his speech was added in a rather nervous tones, as the pace of
                     the black mare became considerably accelerated.
                  "Harness is strange to her: don't fit; that's it, sir," said Miss Jenny
                     coolly.
                  Re-assured by her manner, Mr. Hope made a remark or two upon the business he
                     was going on, but broke off to inquire, "Does the harness hurt her, do you
                     think? she seems very fidgetty."
                  "Pinches her," said Miss Jenny, unmoved.
                  "I shall be glad when we get to the hill: it's a steep hill. She can't go fast
                     up hill, can she?" he said, looking anxiously at her.
                  "No," said Miss Jenny, with a little hesitation in her manner.
                  "No. I'm glad of that: we have plenty of time,—plenty. Don't urge
                     the poor thing," said Mr. Hope; who, though ready to die in the true sense of
                     the word, had a strong shrinking from sudden death, especially a violent one,
                     and a general dislike to being hurt in any part of his body.
                  But "the poor thing" did not want urging. Often had Jerry Miffler labored hard
                     to get her to go at a decent pace; but she shared her mistress's supreme
                     contempt for Jerry, and walked, or trotted, or stood still, as best pleased her
                     fancy when he had her professedly in hand. He would have told you she could not
                     run away; but, at the first start, she had discovered ered "who was behind her," and had performed
                     accordingly. Her exertions made the pressure of some parts of the harness very
                     painful; and she showed unmistakable symptoms occasionally that she did not
                     like it.
                  Right glad was Mr. Hope when they had reached the hill, and began to ascend
                     it.
                  "Whoa, my wench! softly, my darling!" said Miss Jenny in a blandishing
                     tone.
                  But the "wench" and "darling" would not be blandished, even though she knew who
                     was blandishing: she fretted on and on, throwing her head about in a manner
                     that much exercised Mr. Hope's nerves.
                  "I sha'n't care when we're at the top of the hill," he said: "I'll get out
                     then. The rest of the way is nothing: I shall be in plenty of time."
                  Miss Jenny's eyes were fixed on the mare; and she made no answer.
                  On and on, till the hill-top was nearly gained.
                  "I thought she would: as sure as a gun she will!" cried Miss
                     Jenny, all color going out of her face.
                  "Will what?" breathlessly asked Mr. Hope.
                  "Jib: haw, here we go!" cried Miss Jenny.
                  And they did go, rattling down the hill backwards as fast again and faster than
                     they had come up.
                  Miss Jenny was a good driver, and knew nothing of fear so as to let it destroy
                     presence of mind: she kept the mare in the middle of the road, and made her
                     hold upright by the use of the whip.
                  "God be merciful to us!" cried Mr. Hope.
                  Miss Jenny was too much occupied with her driving to notice him.
                  "We shall be thrown out at the bottom!" he exclaimed with difficulty.
                  "Haw!" cried Miss Jenny.
                  To the bottom, however, they went; and when they had arrived there, the black mare, either tired by her restive
                     behavior, or afraid of "who's behind her," stopped with a jerk.
                  "Haw!" cried Miss Jenny.
                  "What a merciful deliverance!" cried Mr. Hope, tumbling out as fast as he
                     could; while Miss Jenny got out as deliberately as if she had been returning
                     from the most charming excursion.
                  "Curious. Heard she'd jib; never saw her do it; didn't believe it; thought
                     Jerry was in his sleep when he let her run through the hedge with the
                     flour-sacks; suppose he wasn't."
                  Mr. Hope was glad Jerry was vindicated, but would rather not have been present
                     at the vindication. He had not recovered his breath, but sat puffing on a low
                     milestone till it would come back to him.
                  Meanwhile, Miss Jenny, having examined the harness very critically, ascertained
                     which was the offending part, and proceeded to remedy the evil.
                  "Haw! Now it's right. Ready, sir? She'll go well enough now, I promise
                     you."
                  "Oh, thank you! no, no, not again. I prefer walking. I shall be in time for the
                     three-o'clock train if I go home first, and get some luncheon; and, if not,
                     there's the six-o'clock, and I'll go then. I'll take a bed at the inn at
                     Heckleton. I'll go, Miss Hornbeck, I assure you, but not with that horse: I
                     can't do that."
                  This speech came forth from him, as he sat on the milestone, in sundry
                     detachments, according as his breath gave him liberty to proceed.
                  Miss Jenny stood looking, at him with a comical mixture of vexation, amusement,
                     and contempt.
                  "She's safe now!" she said, patting the mare.
                  
                  "No doubt, no doubt," said Mr. Hope, putting out his hand, as if to deprecate
                     any feeling the mare or her owner might have of his casting a reflection on her
                     good intentions or qualities.
                  "And you're afraid to get in?" said Miss Jenny, with a grin almost.
                  "Afraid? yes, truly quite afraid. I can't bear violence. I have a great dread
                     of accidents of this kind" (he might have said of any kind).
                  "Haw!" exclaimed Miss Jenny.
                  "If you will, if you are not afraid"—he began.
                  "Afraid? Haw!" Miss Jenny answered.
                  "Well, if you will hold her head, I'll go home, and send some one to bring her
                     back," said Mr. Hope, getting off the milestone.
                  "Send some one!" exclaimed Miss Jenny, mounting the driving-seat, with a real
                     grin on her face; though she was much put out with the stoppage in the way of
                     Mr. Hope's journey.
                  "I'll teach you to jib!" she cried to the black mare, giving her a smart touch
                     with the whip, as she turned her head towards Hancock.
                  "She seems to be well acquainted with that already," said Mr. Hope,
                     sufficiently recovered to make a little joke. But he was still strongly
                     impressed with the escape he had had; for he felt sure, if Miss Jenny had not
                     been a most expert driver, and as form as a rock in courage and coolness, they
                     would never have come to a standstill in safety.
                  She drove off, giving him a nod as she went; and he followed her leisurely,
                     uttering thanksgivings as he walked along.
                  A concourse of people behind him caused him to turn his head round.
                  "What is it? Anything happened?" he asked of one of the foremost.
                  "Accident of the up-train, sir," said the man.
                  
                  "Accident? When?"
                  "The up-train at twelve, sir."
                  "Dear me! no one hurt, I hope?"
                  "A good many: they're bringing them down to Hancock," said the man.
                  Mr. Hope turned, and saw, indeed, the carriages and stretchers on which the
                     sufferers were being conveyed to the Hancock Infirmary.
                  "Any killed? no deaths, I hope?" he said faintly.
                  "Stroker, sir, poor Phillips, and a woman," was the answer.
                  "And I saved!" he mentally exclaimed; but the thought passed as another rose in
                     his mind, "Ought I to go away at such a juncture?"
                  He walked onwards, to give directions, that if the injured persons were too
                     many for the vacant beds of the infirmary, which was a small one, preparations
                     might be given for receiving ceiving them at his house; and he calculated what
                     part of the premises could be turned to advantage the best.
                  As he arrived at his door, he met Miss Jenny on the black mare, on her way to
                     Lawyer Kays.
                  "O Miss Hornbeck!" he exclaimed, lifting up his hands.
                  "What, ain't you got out of your fright yet, sir?" she cried, laughing
                     unpleasantly. "I'm going to Lawyer Kays. I'll call on you again to-morrow."
                  "Oh, what mercy has been shown to us! and what terrible trials have befallen
                     others!" he added, with much emotion.
                  She checked the mare (who looked as unconcerned as if she had never seen the
                     worthy man before, and there was no grudge on his part against her), and waited
                     to know what he meant.
                  He told her, and went on to expatiate on the dreadful calamity of sudden death, and what they
                     owed for deliverance from it.
                  "Haw!" said Miss Jenny, "I can't abide railways; never could. I know what I'm
                     about when I drive myself; but who's to know what's coming in a railway?"
                  "Don't say that," said Mr. Hope. "Although you are a skilful driver, I maintain
                     we were in great peril to-day; and I hope you feel, or will feel, sensible of
                     the mercy shown in your escape."
                  He was moved by her indifference. "She's like a block of granite," he said, as
                     he went in; and she trotted briskly off, her parting "Haw!" broken up by the
                     mare's pace into two or three syllables.
                  "Oh, my dear!" cried Mrs. Hope, meeting him as he entered the house, "I am so
                     glad you have changed your mind. I was quite at a loss what to do about several
                     things; and I had something to tell you."
                  "My love, I have something to tell you," he replied, and then related all that
                     had happened, concluding with the remark, "you can't think how near you have
                     been to realizing what I said on the troubles occasioned by a sudden death. I
                     never expected to see you again."
                  "But you know, love, you are very timid: you are soon alarmed in things of this
                     sort," she said, after having expressed her thankfulness for his safety.
                  "Yes, I am timid: I admit it. I have a horror of any thing violent; and, in the
                     short time we took going down that hill, the reflection of what awaited us at
                     the bottom, your distress, and—and—all sorts of things (it seemed to me a whole
                     lifetime of things) crowded upon me. I said a few words to that poor woman; but
                     she heard nothing, I believe. From sudden death, good Lord, deliver us!"
                  
                  "Well, my husband, I am sure to you it would have been sudden glory," said his
                     wife; "but, after what has happened, thinking of myself, I would rather you did
                     not go out again to-day. We are getting too old to bear such shocks; and I
                     don't want to be left alone: no, you won't go by train to-day. After this
                     accident, I shall feel quite as nervous as you would do." Mrs. Hope looked very
                     pale as she spoke.
                  "My dear, if I did not go, that poor woman would say, 'So much for Christian
                     charity.' I must go, to prove the truth of what I preach. If I come to harm,
                     the Lord knows I don't seek it; and he will take care of me. No: I am nervous
                     in an accident; but not so nervous as to shrink from a plain duty from the fear
                     of one. So, my love, I will go by the three-o'clock train, if it please God;
                     and you needn't be anxious. I am better now; and a little lunch will quite set
                     me up: and, while it's coming, I'll tell you all you want to know in the way of
                     directions. How is poor Mrs. Flood?"
                  "Ah! poor Mrs. Flood!" said Mrs. Hope, with strong emphatic feeling.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER V.
                  THE SHADOW DEEPENS.
                  LAWYER KAYS at home?" asked Miss Jenny, as, her bridle over her arm, she stood
                     at the office-door.
                  "No, ma'am; but Mr. Brasher is here," said a boy, with a grown-up
                     business-frown on his face, and his pen behind his ear.
                  Miss Jenny hesitated: she suspected that she must pay as much for an interview
                     with Mr. Brasher, who held a nondescript position in the office, as for one
                     with long-headed old Mr. Kays; and she did not like it.
                  "When do you expect him in, young man?" she asked.
                  The "young man" made himself as tall as he could, frowned rather more, and gave
                     it as his opinion, founded on some close calculation, that that gentleman would
                     not be at home till the day after to-morrow.
                  "Haw!" said Miss Jenny, who thought the "day after to-morrow" haunted like a
                     spectre.
                  "Will you see Mr. Brasher, ma'am?" inquired the young man, with an air of
                     strong recommendation, as if he would add, "Take my word for it, Mr. Brasher is
                     well worth seeing."
                  But Miss Jenny doubted if he were worth paying to see; so she shock her head,
                     and stood dangling the bridle, when Mr. Brasher came to the door, and cut the
                     matter short.
                  "Miss Hornbeck? Ben, take the horse. Walk in ma'am. I was just going out: you
                     are fortunate," he remarked, leading the way in, while Ben took the bridle; and with a very
                     dissatisfied air, as if she had been caught in a trap, and could not help
                     herself, Miss Jenny followed.
                  Mr. Brasher had not been educated for the law, but had worked his way on from a
                     very low origin by natural sharpness, and a determination to succeed. He was of
                     great use to Mr. Kays in many respects; but he never trusted him with any case
                     requiring more than the commonest legal knowledge. Mr. Brasher considered
                     himself underrated; and being ignorant of the extent of his ignorance, and
                     dazzled by his superficial merits, often regretted that more confidence was not
                     reposed in him by his master. He was what is called "off hand" in his manner.
                     Many a client would have been impressed with an idea of his vast legal
                     knowledge and talent, which enabled him to knock off at a glance a business
                     that had puzzled their brains, and still puzzled them, after most plodding
                     consideration and study. But Miss Jenny did not like off-hand proceedings in
                     her concerns: she was apt to be very "off hand" to those she ruled; but that
                     was another affair altogether.
                  "Well, ma'am," he said, well pleased that he was the only authority present,
                     and perching himself on an office-stool, when he had handed her a chair, and
                     laid his hat on his desk, "what is your good pleasure to-day? We haven't seen
                     you at the office for a long time. It wouldn't do for us if all our clients
                     were as able to manage their own affairs as Miss Hornbeck is."
                  "Haw!" Miss Jenny began. "Don't know rightly. It's a foolish thing enough:
                     don't suppose you've heard of such a thing. I'm sorry the lawyer's out."
                  "Not all the lawyer, my good lady. I hope you will find enough of him left for
                     your business," said Mr. Brasher.
                  
                  But Miss Jenny's black eyes roved about, much dissatisfied; and, if she could
                     have felt sure she would not have to pay for her mere admission to the legal
                     presence, she would have decamped without further ceremony; but if she must
                     pay, which she strongly suspected was the case, it had better be for something:
                     so she prepared to begin, but only prepared.
                  "Perhaps I can anticipate you," said Mr. Brasher, with a confidentially shrewd
                     air. "Is it about a marriage-settlement?"
                  Miss Jenny was startled, and nodded her head in some emotion.
                  "I thought it very likely," said the quick-sighted Mr. Brasher. "And who is the
                     happy gentleman?"
                  Miss Jenny's eyes had most decided white rings round them.
                  Mr. Brasher thought he might be on the wrong track, and that, instead of being
                     a principal in a matrimonial alliance, his client was going to act for another
                     party; but he looked as unembarrassed as if he had sailed quite right, and
                     said,—
                  "This gentleman about whom you interest yourself ought to be very happy."
                  "I don't wish any happiness to the person that's in this business, only how to
                     be quit of him," said Miss Jenny; who, having naturally supposed that it was
                     her mother's marriage-settlement that had been alluded to, was much at a loss
                     to comprehend the meaning of what had followed.
                  Mr. Brasher was equally perplexed at her remark, and resolved to make no more
                     hazard thrusts, but sat with his arms folded, and looking very profound,
                     waiting for a disclosure.
                  This, with much reluctance, Miss Jenny made, and at the close asked, "Now, can
                     you give me any advice worth paying for?"
                  "You are not supposed to know that this notice is coming?" Mr. Brasher asked,
                        when he had listened to the whole
                     with an air of having summed up the case, and decided on it.
                  "No. You see, Dick Banks let me into the secret," said Miss Jenny, "out of
                     friendliness."
                  "Dick is a reliable person?" inquired Mr. Brasher,—"I mean, he hasn't been
                     hoaxing you in any way?"
                  "He's not the sort to do that," said Miss Jenny; who from old remembrance, and
                     the way in which the peddler had asked a blessing, and returned thanks at the
                     meal, put him on the shelf with her late mother, Mr. Hope, and the Bible.
                  "Ah, well, then! if he is reliable, this is a very unpleasant business," said
                     Mr. Brasher, looking intensely grave; "but I hope we'll see you through it,
                     Miss Hornbeck,—I hope so. Just repeat, word for word, the sentence that your
                     friend Dick read to you. Perhaps you have the paper?"
                  Miss Jenny produced it, saying, "There isn't a bit of sense in it; only he said
                     I'd better have it: so I let him leave it."
                  Mr. Brasher took it, read it, pinched his lips, and screwed them up as if he
                     had been going to whistle, and then said, with mysterious impressiveness,
                     "This—is—a very—awkward—business; it is indeed, Miss Hornbeck! but still I hope
                     we may get you through it. When do you expect the notice?"
                  She told him with a very blank face; for his solemn assurance, coming after Mr.
                     Hope's misgivings, gave her a strong qualm. "You don't mean to say my father
                     didn't leave me the property?" she said, with a slight quiver of the lips.
                  "He meant to do so; but, if this is true, he, in law, had no power to do it:
                     the fee-simple was never his. Awkward, very awkward!" and he sat reading and
                     re-reading the scrap of paper, struck with its purport, and wondering much if
                     the law in it, which was new to him, were sound.
                  
                  "What shall I do?" said Miss Jenny. "That's the long and the short of what I've
                     come for."
                  "This is what you must do," he said, with a profound air, after a short muse:
                     "keep out of the way till the time for giving you the notice is past. Send word
                     to your man that you are off on particular business, and won't be back for some
                     days."
                  "Why?" said Miss Jenny.
                  "It is your only course. Don't be nervous. I will watch and ascertain if the
                     notice is delivered, and communicate with you. You are sure it is not a hoax:
                     therefore it is well to take the precaution, and keep out of the way of getting
                     the notice till the twenty years are up; then it will be too late for them to
                     serve it, you see."
                  The evils of leaving home, some large orders to be attended to, no efficient
                     hand there, and no head either efficient or inefficient: it seemed quite
                     impossible; and a very long-drawn drawn "Haw!" came from the troubled Miss
                     Jenny. But Mr. Brasher, who declared with unblushing assurance that such cases,
                     though modified, had often come before his notice, and that he was perfectly
                     familiar with their treatment, and that her only chance of escape was by
                     following his advice, mastered her reluctance; and she resolved to hazard all,
                     and hide for three days. But where to hide?
                  "Mrs. Brasher will be most happy to see you, Miss Hornbeck, at my place, No. 2
                     Westphalia Villas; and you can be secure enough with us. I will send Ben to the
                     mill with your horse, and a message to your head man. Who is he?"
                  "A man without a head!" said Miss Jenny, ruefully surveying the next three
                     days.
                  "Well, some people have head enough for all the house, you know. Now, will you
                     write? or shall I? or will a message do?"
                  "Better send him word," said Miss Jenny, who thought a letter might come expensive.
                  So Mr. Brasher, who would not allow her to go home, lest the notice should come
                     a day before the time expected, despatched Ben on the black mare, with very
                     full instructions, and then prepared to escort Miss Hornbeck to the omnibus,
                     just starting, which could put her down at his house. He advised her certainly
                     to go inside, and to get out before she stopped at the door, that she might not
                     be tracked, and told her to acquaint Mrs. Brasher with the affair, and say he
                     would be at home in the evening.
                  While sitting in the omnibus, Miss Jenny resolved to give no clew to her
                     proceedings by imprudence. She had noticed a sharp-eyed man on the outside of
                     the 'bus when she got in. She fancied he looked curiously at her, Whether it
                     was fancy or not, she would be on the safe side: so, at some distance from West
                     phalia Villa, Mr. Brasher's four-roomed residence, she alighted, and, instead
                     of going towards it, climbed a gate that led across the fields in a contrary
                     direction, intending to turn back when the 'bus was out of sight. Yet, as she
                     walked, the doubt grew stronger and stronger whether she would take up her
                     abode at Westphalia Villa at all. "He'll charge pretty heavy for it; that's
                     certain. And how do I know what his wife's like? A word from her might let the
                     secret out; and I should be no safer there than at home. After all, Brasher may
                     be wrong: he's only a lawyer's man, as you may say, though he's pretty knowing.
                     I wish I'd seen Lawyer Kays." She paused. Should she go back to the mill, and
                     venture all?
                  There was a very small cottage close at hand: it was empty. A woman was behind,
                     stacking a small heap of turf.
                  "I'll go back to the mill," thought Miss Jenny; "but I must have a rest first. I'll step
                     in here."
                  Through the half-open door she saw that it was one of the poorest of poor
                     dwellings, and not so clean as suited her tastes. But she had been up since
                     four: she had a good deal of exertion, excitement, and perplexity. Her
                     breakfast, in consequence of the peddler's visit, had been a meagre one. She
                     felt the need of rest: so she made a tour of the house, to find the owner.
                  "I'm very tired," she said abruptly. "Might I rest in your place here?"
                  "Rest, and welcome," said the woman, walking before her into the cottage. "I'm
                     sorry there isn't a better fire; but I'll rake the ashes, and it'll soon burn
                     up."
                  "Could you help me to a drink of water?" said Miss Jenny, taking a seat, while
                     she held her skirt tight round her legs.
                  The woman offered her some whey, which she was glad to accept.
                  "Missus," said Miss Jenny, "I don't want to put upon you. I see you haven't got
                     much to spare; but, if you'd give me a mouthful to eat, I'd pay for it, and
                     thank you."
                  The woman went to her cupboard, and brought out part of a loaf, saying, "This
                     is all I've got in the house: take a bit of it, and welcome."
                  Miss Jenny cut a slice; and the woman, begging her not to stint, went back to
                     her turf-stack, saying times was precious, and she had other jobs to do.
                  The bread was dry and hard, but Miss Jenny was not particular; and she was
                     quite as well satisfied to be without company as with it.
                  While she plodded through her crust, she took note of the room, so very, very
                     poor it was.
                  "After all," she thought, with a critical air, "I don't think it is dirt, but
                     just the dingy look of things worn
                     out, and want of paint and whitewash."
                  The only bright object to be seen was an oblong of white hanging on the wall
                     directly opposite. She advanced two steps, and then, with a dissatisfied look,
                     re-seated herself.
                  The woman, having finished her turf, came in; and Miss Jenny, feeling in her
                     pocket for a copper, rose to go.
                  "Won't you wait a bit till the drizzle is gone off? The day is turned wet; but
                     this may be only a shower," said the woman.
                  "Maybe it'll get worse; and I shall be in your way," said Miss Jenny.
                  No: she was assured that there was no one to be interfered with there,—no
                     husband, no children.
                  "What, you live alone here? I don't remember ever seeing you about," said Miss
                     Jenny.
                  "I came here only a week back, to let my husband's father go to Hickleton. I'm
                     keeping house for him the while."
                  Miss Jenny stared at her. What did the man want at Hickleton? She fancied no
                     one could go to Hickleton without being concerned in her affairs.
                  "Who is your father?" she asked.
                  "Price of the Milestone, he was used to be called, and is called now, for all
                     he's done with the Milestone long ago."
                  Miss Jenny looked very queer. This, then, was another promise made by her
                     father that she had broken.
                  In her zeal for improvement, she had turned Price, an old servant of the
                     miller's, out of the little farm of the Milestone, obliging him to have a
                     forced sale at a grievous loss, and given him no recompense.
                  "Father's gone to see Mr. Hornbeck," said the woman; who, unconscious of the
                     effect of her words, had urged Miss
                     Jenny to take her seat again. "Father was man to his father for many years,
                     till he got deaf; and then he wasn't fit for a miller, you know: so he put him
                     into the Milestone, and promised him, while he paid his rent, he should never
                     be disturbed; but his daughter, as got the mill after his days, turned him out,
                     and ruined him," the woman continued. "I wouldn't be in her shoes for a mill of
                     gold,—that I wouldn't."
                  Miss Jenny tapped her strong leather boots with her stick, and looked as if she
                     were examining what was the particular objection to that portion of her
                     dress.
                  "Since I come," continued the woman, "father and me's heard that she's turned
                     out some old folks as had had their houses given 'em for life by the old man.
                     Shame upon her! she'll come to want afore she dies."
                  "Haw!" cried Miss Jenny.
                  "Why, father's been telling me, since I come to him, as she's turned every
                     thing into gold. He expects, he says, to see the mill turned into gold. But do
                     you believe as twenty gold mills, and twenty on top of 'em, will be any good to
                     her as has sold herself for money? Never a bit."
                  Miss Jenny's favorite exclamation died on her lips. She had not breath to utter
                     it, neither could she move, but felt chained to her chair.
                  "Oh! it's slow a-coming," said the woman, who had no doubt her auditor entirely
                     coincided with her way of thinking,—"it's slow a-coming; but it's sure: and her
                     as has taken bread from the hungry, and a home from the destitute, will know
                     what God means by 'the robbery of the wicked shall destroy them,' when she is
                     on her dying bed."
                  The less she liked what she heard, the more incapable did the astonished lady
                     miller feel of getting out of hearing's way.
                  
                  "Ah!" continued the woman, who had been busy about the room all the time she
                     had been talking, "you might well look sorry for her: I am sorry enough, poor,
                     miserable creetur! She'll cry out for pity some o' these days; and who'll
                     listen to her? Nobody! She'll be a lost creetur here, and worse than lost where
                     she'll go to. Oh dear, oh dear! to think of being under such a curse!"
                  In proportion as the woman worked herself into a fever, Miss Jenny got into an
                     ague fit. Her emotion almost mastered her: she could not have stood if she had
                     risen.
                  "Why, now," said the woman, pausing in the act of cracking a stick with her
                     knee, that she might make a more cheerful fire for her guest, "I remember
                     hearing father say to my husband, when he came to see us, as the miller's wife
                     were as good a Christian as any one could be; and she was used to go and see
                     him, and tell him about heaven, and how to get safe there: and many a good word
                     she said for him to the old man. And by reason of them he gave him the
                     Milestone, and promised as he should keep it to his dying day; and so he would,
                     if his daughter hadn't set light by her father and her mother. 'Cursed be he
                     that setteth light by his father or his mother:' that's in the Bible, and it's
                     true; and it matters none if it's son or daughter as does it. So this daughter
                     'll find there's a curse upon her, as sure as I'm breaking this stick." The
                     stick broke with a loud crack, that gave emphasis to her words; and, having
                     tired herself for a time, she began to blow the fire.
                  "Come," she said, her face losing its fierce expression as she noticed the
                     pallor and distress of her guest's,—"come, you don't look over comfortable.
                     Come nigh the fire; and I'll go and see if the hens have laid, and you shall
                     have an egg. Father's got a few fowls; but it's hard work to keep 'em: eggs is
                     too cheap to pay for their keep."
                  
                  Miss Jenny had something so very ungovernable in her throat she could not
                     speak; but she drew a little nearer the fire.
                  "Why, now," said the woman, forgetting the egg, as she laid aside the bellows,
                     "they say as her man as she've got now is just frightened out of his senses at
                     her; and she pays him as little as she can, and 'll be sure to turn him off
                     when he gets deaf or ailing: and she puts all upon him as ever she can.
                     Oh!—she's—a"—
                  "Why does he stay?" demanded Miss Jenny rather fiercely, having somewhat
                     recovered her voice.
                  "Oh, because he's so simple! but this is how it is: her mother was always good
                     to him, and teached him when he was little; and he can't make up his mind to go
                     from the place till he's sent, afeared of being ungrateful. Poor fellow! it's a
                     pity he can't put some of his soft-heartedness into her, isn't it?"
                  "Haw!" said Miss Jenny, strange thoughts whirling about in her brain.
                  "Well, God keep us from covetousness! I'd rather live on bread and water all my
                     days than sell my soul for gold," said the woman.
                  "Sell your soul," repeated Miss Jenny, with a bewildered air.
                  "Ay! it is selling her soul she is, no more, nor no less: she thinks it's
                     nothing but get, get, and hold fast; but she'll find out, one day, her money
                     'll be like fire upon her in the place she'll go to."
                  The look of exulting wrath with which this was uttered was a bar to any good
                     effect it might otherwise have produced. Miss Jenny got up, firm and herself
                     again, quite herself, and none the better for the truth so harshly spoken.
                  "I wish you good-day: there's a copper for the bread. I didn't eat the worth of
                     it; but the rest can go for the warm I've had," she said, making for the
                     door.
                  
                  "It rains harder than ever," said the woman, sorry to lose company of any kind
                     in her solitary state.
                  It did rain in torrents: should she go on, or wait till the storm had subsided?
                     Generally, she was entirely regardless of weather; but just now she felt
                     disinclined to face the risk of a bad cold, especially as a strange shiver had
                     come over her. She gazed wistfully at the rain as she stood dangling her stick
                     in the open doorway, and did not vouchsafe look or reply to her hostess.
                  "Better stop a bit," said the latter; who was quite pleasant in her manner,
                     except when speaking of Miss Hornbeck.
                  "Here's a pretty piece as I got this morning of a peddling man,—a good man he
                     was. He come in and sat down by the fire, as you did; and he'd got a good round
                     to make: so he was glad to eat his bit of dinner in a snug place."
                  With this she unpinned the paper, and read aloud for the benefit of her guest:
                     "'Labor not for the meat that perisheth, but for that which endureth unto
                     everlasting life.' 'Boast not thyself of to-morrow, for thou knowest not what a
                     day may bring forth.' 'What is your life? it is even a vapor that appeareth for
                     a little time, and then vanisheth away,'" commenting on each text as she
                     finished, and making a special application of each to the lady miller.
                  "Life! why, how do we know, supposing as it lasts so long, what's a-coming
                     to-morrow? I shall leave this here for poor father, for all it was given to me:
                     he aren't so poor neither; for, if her at the mill has robbed him of the bread
                     that perishes, she can't come in the way of the best bread: no, no, he'll keep
                     that for all her."
                  Here she pinned up the paper again. Miss Jenny had not profited so much by what
                     she had said as could have been wished: the angry, hostile tone of it had set her on the
                     defiant; and other thoughts, suggested by the old man's going to Hickleton, had
                     also interfered with their effect. With a strong effort to appear undisturbed,
                     she said, "What took your father to Hickleton?"
                  "That's between him and him as sent for him," said the woman with a mysterious
                     air. "I don't know, and he didn't know when he went, but only this, as he
                     wanted to have a talk with him of old times; and, if things turned out as they
                     was bound to, it would be a good thing for him. But there, poor father's so
                     content with what he's got, that I don't believe he hankers after any thing Mr.
                     Hornbeck can give him: he just went for gratefulness to the old gentleman, who
                     did his part to making him easy all his days, as he would have been if that
                     poor crittur at the mill had been a Christian woman."
                  Miss Jenny stepped out of the doorway. The woman pressed her vehemently to
                     stay, regretting that the rain had prevented her from looking for an egg, but
                     promising to search "as soon as it had 'bated;" but all in vain: there was such
                     a hurricane within Miss Jenny's heart and mind, that the outward storm was
                     nothing. And she stalked out, regardless of entreaty.
                  "So," she thought, when definite thought became at all possible, "he's gone to
                     Kit to help plot against me. I see how it is." This idea powerfully
                     strengthened the charge, "Boast not thyself of to-morrow," which more than any
                     other Scripture sounded a knell in her ears. "Let him do his worst: it's
                     mine—my own by right,—and nobody shall turn me out: nobody can."
                  She walked on, not knowing whither; which way to shape her course she could not
                     tell. One moment she resolved to go to Westphalia Villa: but she had not taken
                     many steps in that direction when all the old objections to such a course revived; and she turned
                     back.
                  "I've got not much opinion of Brasher, after all," she thought; "he's only
                     Lawyer Kays's man; I might have to pay a long bill for nothing, if I went
                     there."
                  But where to go? The rain came down in a straight, determined stream. She was
                     soaked through. Her drabbled skirt clung close round her legs, and her strong
                     boots got saturated from the spongy sod surcharged with wet, which splashed up
                     at every step. She feared to leave the fields for the road, lest she should
                     meet people, and be recognized. She, who had never owned to weariness, now felt
                     her limbs tremble; and the threat held out of depriving her of her home, which
                     now made her a cheerless wanderer from it, made that home ten thousand fold
                     more desirable in her eyes than it had ever been. Oh! that she could go and sit
                     by her own fireside, in the comfort and security she had enjoyed there but
                     yesterday! How little had yesterday foreshown to-day; and what might to-morrow
                     be?
                  "Uncommon wet, missus," said a man, who looked very much as if he had just come
                     out of the river, as he climbed the stile by which she had at length halted, to
                     consider what she should do.
                  "It'll do good somehow, I'll be bound; but it's bad for handsome clothes." As
                     he spoke, he glanced smiling at his own, which were of the poorest kind.
                  "Yes!" said Miss Jenny. "Which way do you go?"
                  "I'm going home. Bless the Lord I've got one!" he replied.
                  "Near about? I'm a good way off mine, and would be glad of a shelter," she said
                     almost with bitterness.
                  "Come, and welcome," said the man; "but I doubt you won't stop no longer than
                     you can help: it's a poor place for
                     any but such as me. We're close there."
                  "If I could dry my things a little, and shelter till the rain stops, it's all I
                     want," said Miss Jenny.
                  "Ay," said the man: "that won't be to-day, I fancy. I doubt if it will
                     to-morrow; but there's nobody knows what's coming to-morrow."
                  Miss Jenny followed in silence, pondering in her mind those words fraught with
                     mysterious terror, "To-morrow, and the day after tomorrow!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  THE STILL SMALL VOICE.
                  IT was indeed a poor place, little better than a shed; so frail, that it looked
                     as if the first stout gust of wind encountering it would throw it down.
                  "You see, missus, I get my house very cheap: so it hasn't got the 'commodations
                     of your'n, very likely; but home's home, be it never so homely."
                  The little man delivered himself thus, as he stood unlocking the padlock that
                     hung from the staple in the rickety door. If Jerry Miffler had nothing to lose,
                     what could be said of the owner of
                     this place?" The floor was mud, the walls a miscellaneous collection of mud,
                     stones, and brick, which had been separately supplied, as need demanded.
                     Probably but little of the original structure remained: window, it had none;
                     but enough light (and by far too much air) came through the various crevices in
                     the roof and sides for the requirements of the tenant: who, as he remarked,
                     never was at home by daylight, in the ordinary way, being in his business
                     abroad; therefore that was a trifling inconvenience.
                  "There's one thing that was not so easy got over," he remarked. "The chimbly
                     being so wide and so straight, I found, when I first come, that, when it
                     rained, out went the fire as soon as it was lit; and, if I goes to stop up the
                     chimbly, thinks I, I gets choked with the smoke. But it isn't a little as puts
                     me off; and I wasn't going to give up a home like this, with such a manageable
                     rent, for that: so, you see, this is my way,—when the rain slants that way, I
                     pull my brazier this side; and, when it's this way, I pull it t'other: oh, it's
                     wonderful what contrivance will do! Now it's coming straight down; but I've got
                     a match for that too: I just pulls it out a bit into the room, and sets the pan
                     behind to catch the water."
                  He was not idle while talking: he kindled a fire, and brought it out of harm's
                     way; then he moved the eight bricks which served him for a seat, and built up
                     one for his visitor close by it; then he put on a little tin kettle, and
                     produced from a hanging shelf a teapot and a half-pint mug: inside the former
                     was a small screw of paper, which held his tea. "It's not everybody as has got
                     a teapot and tea-caddy all in one, like me," he remarked, with a laughing air,
                     as he took first one pinch, then another, from his paper, and put it in the lid
                     of the pot till the kettle boiled, replacing the paper on the shelf.
                  
                  Miss Jenny would have been more amused and interested in his proceedings, if
                     the rain dropping upon her through the roof, and the sickening sense of her own
                     perplexities, had not diverted her thoughts from him. He made her welcome to
                     her bricks and her half-pint of tea, as he called it, having neither milk nor
                     sugar, with as much courtesy as if he had been dispensing the honors of the
                     most magnificent lordly mansion,—sitting on the floor himself, and waiting with
                     great politeness till she had finished, to refresh himself from the same
                     cup.
                  "It's a wonderful good thing when things match," he said, as he sat sipping his
                     tea when his turn came, while she cowered over the fire, drying as much of her
                     clothes as she could: "now, this house being so small, what could I do with a
                     lot of heavy goods? but it's no trouble for me to set up my bricks wherever
                     it's pleasantest,—by the chimbly, when the fire's there, and in the room when
                     it isn't. Oh, dear, missus, what a deal a man has got to be thankful for as has
                     a home over his head!"
                  Miss Jenny, upon questioning him, which she felt bound to do for civility's
                     sake, though, she cared for nothing in her heart but how to get over the
                     dreadful to-morrow, discovered that he was a tinker, and had a regular beat in
                     the country opposite to the mill.
                  "I suppose you never go to Hancock?" she said.
                  "Not often, except of Sundays," he said.
                  "Sundays! what, do you work of a Sunday?" she asked quickly.
                  "No, no, missus; that would be a poor consarn, indeed. I've done with ways like
                     that," he answered. "I goes to church of Sundays, reg'lar, all weathers; and
                     Parson Hope always gives me my dinner, he does. God bless him! And he will, no
                     danger about that. 'Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the Lord shall
                     deliver him in the time of trouble.'"
                  
                  "It's a long way to Hancock," said Miss Jenny inquiringly; for she did not know
                     where she was, being quite unacquainted with the district on the other side of
                     Hancock.
                  "Ay, it's a nice walk of a Sunday,—four miles and a half, or more; but it's
                     nothing to me. I'm thinking of what I'm going for all the while I'm on the
                     road; and I'm as happy as a bird."
                  "Thinking of your dinner?" said Miss Jenny.
                  "Well, missus, I don't deny as I like the thoughts of a comfortable dinner,
                     with a bit of meat, such as I don't see at no other time; but I can tell you
                     it's all the sweeter that it comes to me from the love of our Master, Christ.
                     And, if I didn't break bread at the parson's, nor any other Christian house,
                     I'd go just the same; for I love the Lord's house and his word and his praise,
                     and—and—I love the Lord! and I wouldn't do no other for all that the world
                     could give me."
                  "It don't seem that the Lord has given you much," said Miss Jenny.
                  "O missus! what a hard speech!" said the man reproachfully. "Didn't he give
                     himself for me?"
                  "For you?" said Miss Jenny, looking at him curiously.
                  "Ay, and for you, if you'll believe it," said the tinker, sipping his tea at
                     intervals. "Blessed is she that believeth; for there shall be a performance of
                     those things that were told her from the Lord."
                  "What things?" said Miss Jenny.
                  "Every thing," said the tinker.
                  "What, every thing we want?"
                  "Every thing," said the tinker with energy.
                  "What! suppose if I was in trouble, and wanted to get out of it, do you think
                     if I asked the Lord to help me out, and believed he would, that he would?"
                  "Yes, I do; and I'm sure on it: but mind you, he mightn't bring you out by the way you
                     fancied. He's got his own ways of dealing with us; and, his ways being better
                     than our ways, it's a good thing for us as he has."
                  "I should think you've never asked for much, by what I see you've got," said
                     Miss Jenny, with a scoffing smile.
                  "Ah, missus!" he replied with much feeling, "don't speak that way: why, if he's
                     done by me as I deserved, I should have been amongst the lost this day,—I
                     should, I should!"
                  Miss Jenny stared at him, and said, "What, you've been a bad liver, I
                     suppose?"
                  "Yes, missus, the worst of livers: a better chance of a decent, comfortable
                     life than I was born with, none ever had; but I was that fool the Bible tells
                     of, 'a fool despiseth his father's instructions.' I did that, and followed my
                     own wicked likings, till I broke his heart. Poor fellow! poor fellow! I didn't
                     believe then, missus, that what a man sows he shall reap: but I've been made to
                     believe that, and a many other things; only God is so merciful, that there has
                     been a light reaping for me, compared with my sowing."
                  "Haw!" exclaimed Miss Jenny thoughtfully.
                  "You see, missus, I never heeded the time to come: I went on in the way of my
                     own heart, I did, till God said, 'Stop!'"
                  "Said stop?" exclaimed Miss Jenny.
                  "Ay, he gave me just enough of the fruits of my doings to show me which way
                     they was leading me; and I was like Balaam on his ass, I couldn't go no
                     further."
                  Miss Jenny recollected very little of Ballam's history, and was silent.
                  "I wasted every thing, and spent every thing, and spent every thing,—substance
                     and health and peace and comfort; and when I was at the worst, without a friend
                     to pity me, without a penny to help me, after all I'd done, and I gave myself up for lost, I found out
                     that it wasn't too late to be saved,—I found the meaning of Jesus being the
                     Saviour of sinners."
                  "Suppose you got among the ranters?" said Miss Jenny contemptuously.
                  "Well, missus, I've heard many a good thing among the ranters; but it was
                     Parson Hope as first helped me out of the fire. 'Trust,' he says, trust: 'your
                     sins have been great; but Jesus is greater. Repent, and believe.'"
                  "Haw! that's the talk," said Miss Jenny, tossing her head: "believe, believe:
                     do what you like, as long as you believe.'"
                  "Missus," said the tinker, "there's no such thing as believing and living in
                     sin: it's a thing unnat'ral, and not to be done. When I turned my face to my
                     Saviour, I turned my back on my sins. It's the Holy Spirit that makes a man
                     believe; and the spirit changes his life as well as his opinions."
                  "But how do you know you are forgiven?" said Miss Jenny.
                  "Here, here it is!" said the tinker, striking his breast with emotion: "peace,
                     missus, peace! And then, you know, God never goes off his word; that's my
                     comfort. He says, 'Him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out;' but he
                     says too, 'Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.' Now, I sowed a
                     curse on all my worldly store and lot; and what right have I got to look to
                     reap such as (I s'pose) you've got? I must be thankful for being out of hell,
                     for a shelter and a bit of bread, and wait till he calls me to a better home.
                     Hunger's hard to bear, and bread's hard to get; but, when times is at the
                     worst, I says to myself, 'This is the fruit of your doings,' and that settles
                     me down at once."
                  "It doesn't rain now," said Miss Jenny: "I'll get on. Here, take this" some
                     day, maybe, I'll see you again."
                  
                  "The Lord bless you, missus! I didn't get paid for my work to-day: so I
                     couldn't bring any thing home; but now I shall go to the little shop just by,
                     and get me some supper. The Lord bless you!"
                  The tinker looked so grateful, that Miss Jenny was touched.
                  "What! you never go on trust?" she said.
                  "No, for fear I couldn't pay: nobody knows what'll come to-morrow. I might die
                     before I paid; and that would be robbing my neighbor."
                  "To-morrow, still to-morrow!" Miss Jenny sighed.
                  Indirectly she questioned him on the best road to the mill by the fields, and
                     went out, resolving, come what would, to return there. Chilled and weary and,
                     wanting food, she felt so dispirited, that further wandering was
                     impossible.
                  The rain had ceased: but a mist succeeded it; which, as it shrouded her from
                     view, she was glad of. And she plodded on, resolution supplying strength. While
                     the way over the wide fields was plain before her, she did not play much
                     attention to her route, but dwelt on the confessions of the tinker. The rough
                     rebukes of the woman had stirred up her wrath: she like the prophet, found not
                     the Lord in the tempest, but in the tenderness of that confession was the still
                     small voice. She was unable to analyze her feelings; but, in their confusion,
                     there floated about a half-formed resolve to let the widows remain, at any rate
                     for the present, in their houses: and still more indefinitely, a thought of
                     restitution to Price of the Milestone, to whom she well knew she had done great
                     injustice, besides having disobeyed her father's express command.
                  Leaving her in her cheerless walk, we will return to Mr. Hope, whom we left
                     starting for Hickleton. The information given him by his wife made him doubt
                     still more if he ought to leave at
                     such a juncture: he learned, to his surprise, that Mr. Flood, who had lived in
                     the first style, had died, if not insolvent, with no more than would meet his
                     debts.
                  "Who could have thought it!" he exclaimed. "If he had only insured his life, or
                     made some investment, to meet such a contingency."
                  "Ah, my dear! he lived only for to-day: he put off and put off, Mrs. Flood
                     says, intending to make some provision for his family out of his very handsome
                     income; and she always hoped that some day he would do it, knowing that
                     everything would die with him. Now she is left wholly on the charity of her
                     family and friends; and what makes it worse is, that all her family are poor,
                     and have enough to do for their own children."
                  "We must see what can be done," said Mr. Hope thoughtfully. "I will apply to
                     Augustus Flood: he is well off."
                  "Ah! so people think: but poor Mrs. Flood says he has done just like her
                     husband; who, indeed, has several times advanced money to get him out of
                     difficulties,—money that she will never recover. He can only give them a refuge
                     for the present."
                  "Amazing! what can men be thinking of? so entirely ignoring their obligations,
                     their plan scriptural duty, and what common feeling and common sense and common
                     honesty require of them; living as if there were no to-morrow, as if the
                     present moment were all there is. As I told that poor woman, the day after
                     to-morrow will show up their conduct in its true colors. Not that I judge poor
                     Flood: to his own Master he must stand or fall; but I'm glad I preached that
                     sermon,—very glad, though Miss Hornbeck accused it of conniving at her
                     sin."
                  "Mrs. Flood said that that sermon made him very thoughtful, and that he was
                     often saying to himself, 'The day after to-morrow,'" said Mrs. Hope.
                  
                  "As far as this life goes, it had no practical effect," said her husband: "so
                     now we must help to do the work he has left undone; we must strike while the
                     iron's hot. Just help me put down a list of names; and I will write to those I
                     think most advisable."
                  "Then you won't, go to Hickleton?" said Mrs. Hope.
                  "Hickleton? Well, I ought; I must: but I should like to write a letter or two
                     first. I have an hour, indeed, if I go by the evening train."
                  "With your asthma?" said Mrs. Hope.
                  "I'd rather go without it; but what's to be done?" he replied cheerfully.
                  "If you please, sir," said Mary, coming in as she knocked at the door, "you
                     must please go directly to Four Meadows Mill."
                  "Four Meadows Mill! Why, what's the matter?"
                  "Please, sir, I don't know: but the man that brought the message said, if you
                     didn't come quick, you'd be too late, and then he ran off for the doctor."
                  "Tell Thomas to get out the carriage," said Mr. Hope. "That poor woman,
                     perhaps; or it may be some one hurt in the machinery. Just help me on with my
                     coat again, my dear, and make out the list while I am gone. I'll go and hurry
                     Thomas."
                  But there are some, people that either won't or can't be hurried; and Thomas
                     was among them. His mistress often used to say, that he would walk
                     out of a house on fire. Mr. Hope doubted that; but being himself of an anxious
                     temperament, and very lively in his own movements, he wouldn't have minded
                     trying him with an experiment as startling, could he have hit on one, when he
                     vainly desired to stir him up or push him on.
                  "Now, Thomas, almost ready?"
                  "That miss from the mill has made such work with the harness, it's hindered me ever
                     so," said Thomas, examining a buckle with as leisurely an air as if he had been
                     a connoisseur criticising a work of art.
                  "Anyhow, anyhow," said Mr. Hope. "Put it on: it may be too late. I'll ride, if
                     the harness is damaged. Put on the saddle."
                  "Ride!—what, such a day as this?" said Thomas, quietly passing the strap
                     through the buckle. "Not weather for your riding. And, as for going with the
                     harness unsafe, why, one upset in the day is enough for most people,—more than
                     enough for you, sir!"
                  Mr. Hope fretted a little, and remonstrated a little, and began to be
                     peremptory, when Molly Martin made her appearance in the yard.
                  "Oh, sir, what a good thing!—catched you afore you was gone out. I wanted to
                     know if you'd be so good as give me a recommend to the 'firmary for a
                     nurse."
                  
                     
                        Molly Martin wants a line from Mr. Hope.—Page 177.
                     
                  
                  
                  "Molly!—you a nurse! What are you thinking about?" he exclaimed, turning from
                     Thomas and the horse.
                  "I thought, sir, if you would give me a word, as that I was nimble and that,
                     and a deal better than my years, the gentlefolks at the 'firmary would take me
                     in. And I know I could nurse: for I've done my share that way with the old
                     missus, and the master after her; and many's the poor soul I've seen through
                     the trouble of a sick-bed since."
                  "But, my good friend, you are not strong enough now. You know it's very hard
                     work sitting up at nights, and that sort of thing."
                  "When I can't do no more, I'll stop. I've got a bit of work left in me; and why
                     shouldn't I bring it out? No use going to 'the house' while I can keep from
                     it."
                  "I know 'the house' doesn't sound pleasant, Molly but really"—Mr. Hope
                     began.
                  "Pleasant, sir! I hope that poor me, as lives in the hope of the humble, isn't going to
                     say a word of disrespect to 'the house.' No, sir: when my time comes to go into
                     it, I hope I'll know my duty to be thankful for the home God has chosen for me
                     to end my days in; but, while I can work, I don't see as it's honest to eat the
                     bread of idleness. So please, sir, to give me a recommend. I know, by reason of
                     this great accident, that nurses is very much wanting; and I'd rather go for
                     nothing than not go at all: but they'd think better of me if I brought a slip
                     of a note from you."
                  Molly was so urgent, and looked so bright, that Mr. Hope could not refuse her,
                     sorry as he was to put her to work he thought so ill befitting her years.
                  "Well, I'll write, Molly, and tell them, that, if I were ill, I would sooner
                     have you for a nurse than anybody I know," he said.
                  "Carriage is ready now, sir," said Thomas.
                  "Oh, well! I'm in a great hurry, Molly. I can't stay to write now; but—but go
                     in to Mrs. Hope, and explain all to her: she will write to them, I am
                     sure."
                  Molly looked musingly for a moment. Would the 'firmary gentlefolks care as much
                     for a recommend from the missus as from the master? Well, all she could do was
                     to take the help offered, and trust. "After all," she thought, "it mayn't be
                     right for me to go there. I may be putting myself out of my right place; and
                     this is meant to stop me. However, I don't know: I feel longful to try; and
                     I'll ask the missus. And, if it goes well—well; and, if it don't, it won't be
                     that first time I've had to say, 'The will of the Lord be done.' Sure enough is
                     the word, 'And man's heart deviseth his way; but the Lord directeth his
                     steps.'"
                  But Mrs. Hope thought so well of the plan, knowing the energy of the old woman,
                     and how well she was adapted for a nurse, that her letter was quite successful. It happened that
                     the board was sitting at the time she made her appearance at the infirmary; and
                     the dearth of help was one of the subjects that occupied them. In a very short
                     time, then, Molly was installed in a small side single ward, where lay a
                     gentleman who had been severely hurt, but not seriously injured. He had
                     signified that he would pay well for any help to his ease and comfort, and had
                     been treated accordingly; but the specimen he had given of his irritable temper
                     and impatient spirit had made it doubtful if any nurse would attend him to his
                     satisfaction. Her pleasant face, her cheery tone, and a certain firmness and
                     decision of expression, easily read by the doctors, told them at once that she
                     was just what they wanted.
                  "You mustn't go out of the room, Mrs. Martin," said the night nurse, after she
                     had shown her all that had been place ready for the patient's use during the
                     night. "I will come in before long, and see if any thing is wanted."
                  Molly had her blind eye to the bed, when this was said; and at that moment, and
                     ever since she had been in the room, the patient was lying with his face to the
                     wall, as if to shut out the sight of human nature entirely; and he was groaning
                     most piteously.
                  Molly's cheerful voice in replying to the night nurse roused him; and when she
                     turned to look at him, after the door was closed, she was startled to see him
                     staring at her with something of the expression of a baby suddenly interrupted
                     in a passionate crying-fit.
                  Molly returned his scrutiny with her old-fashioned country courtesy, and asked
                     if he wanted any thing.
                  "Why, you've got but one eye!" he exclaimed peevishly. "The idea of their
                     giving me a nurse with one eye!"
                  "It's a capital good one, sir,' said Molly, not at all disturbed.
                  
                  "That's the way I am treated; and that fellow of a doctor hasn't been to see me
                     since he dressed my arm. Oh, dear! oh, dear! I told them I'd pay liberally; and
                     this is the way they serve me! Oh, dear! oh, dear! What possessed me to get
                     into that train? Why did I trouble myself with other people's affairs? How my
                     throat burns! Parched, parched, quiet parched!"
                  Molly allowed him to go on till he had tired himself a little, and then said,
                     "Won't you please take a little lemonade?"
                  "I detest lemonade," he said, with his face to the wall.
                  "A little toast and water is cooling," she suggested.
                  "I hate toast and water," he cried.
                  "There's barley-water here: try that, sir," said Molly.
                  "Leave me alone! You haven't got half an eye, or you wouldn't go on plaguing
                     me," he cried. "Oh, my arm!—my arm! It burns, it shoots. I burn all over!"
                  "Shall I take off the rags, and put fresh stuff on 'em?" said Molly. "Poor
                     thing! it do look very red!" and she looked compassionately on the injured arm,
                     which was extended on a pillow.
                  "Oh, you can't, you can't! The fellow has strapped it up in his oil-silk; and
                     how can you?" he cried peevishly.
                  "How? As easy as a bird finds her nest when she's got young ones in it."
                  This answer brought his face round again; and he looked at her with another
                     curious gaze.
                  "What's your name?" he asked.
                  "Molly, sir," she said, with another courtesy.
                  "Got any children?"
                  "No, sir, not to my knowledge: not in this world," she said in a soft and
                     serious voice.
                  
                  "Widow?" he asked again.
                  "Yes, sir; this many a year."
                  Here a pause ensued; and he turned away his face again, but suddenly cried out,
                     while it was still towards the wall,—
                  "Do you think you could take off the oil-silk, and dip the rags in lotion?"
                  "Eh, sir! do I think? Please let me do it, and you shall find out."
                  "But you can't see with one eye," he cried peevishly.
                  "I'll put on my specs, sir; and then I shall have two," she said merrily,
                     proceeding to loose the oil-sick with great tenderness.
                  She went through her work with such dexterity, that, unreasonable as the
                     patient was, he couldn't find fault, though he kept up a moaning cry all the
                     time. The soothing produced by her good offices sent him to sleep; and he had a
                     comfortable little dozen, from which he awoke somewhat refreshed.
                  "Are you a regular nurse?" he asked, startling Molly from a brown study.
                  "No, sir; not reg'lar," she replied.
                  "I dare say you're not a nurse," he cried, looking fixedly at her.
                  Molly laughed, and assured him she was an old hand in the business.
                  "Not a hospital nurse?" he said quickly.
                  "No, sir: I never was inside the 'firmary till to-day, and never was out of
                     Hancock parish all my life; so I couldn't well be a 'firmary nurse, could
                     I?"
                  "I knew it, I knew it! I was certain you were not a regular nurse. Who taught
                     you? How did you learn to do these things? and how came you here?"
                  "Almighty God, by his good providence, brought me here, sir; and the same mercy
                     gave me wit enough to do the work, and enough love to my neighbor to make me
                     like it," she replied.
                  
                  "Did you ever see an arm like mine before?"
                  "Yes, sir. My old master got badly hurt by a thing in the mill they call a
                     governor; and he was in a sad low way about it a long time: and I nursed him
                     through it."
                  "Who was your master?"
                  "One Mr. Hornbeck,—a miller, sir."
                  "A miller? Then he was a rogue," said the patient peevishly.
                  "Well, sir, they do say there never was but one honest miller, and he died
                     young; but I don't believe it. Master was as honest as most folks as isn't
                     millers."
                  "But not as honest as he ought to have been," said the patient sharply.
                  "Sir, he's dead; and I'd rather not to meddle with the dead, if it's the same
                     to you," said Molly firmly but humbly.
                  He turned away, and seemed to doze again; and Molly took the good-sized Bible
                     that lay on the table, and read.
                  "You won't sit up with me?" he cried with his former suddenness.
                  "Ay, sir, I hope so," she answered.
                  "I shall give you plenty of trouble. You'll have a night of it, I promise
                     you."
                  "Thank'ee, sir: I didn't expect no other," said Molly.
                  "I am sure not to sleep," he cried.
                  "Not so sure as I am, sir;" she answered merrily.
                  "You can't keep awake; too old, too old," he said peevishly.
                  Molly assured him she was so happy as to be able to do with or without most
                     things, sleep among the rest, very contentedly; and, finding he was not averse
                     to listening, she told him so much of her history as she thought might amuse
                     him: and, though he broke in occasionally with groans and expressions of
                     impatience, upon the whole he was quieted and refreshed by her pleasant voice
                     and simple talk.
                  
                  "And who put it into your head to come to this place?" he asked.
                  "Well, sir, I think it was my heavenly Father,—I do truly," she answered.
                  "Psha! psha! you don't suppose the great God interferes with every old woman's
                     affairs, do you?"
                  "Yes, I do, sir, and every old man's too," said Molly decidedly;" and I'll tell
                     you what you will call good proof, I think, that he put it into my head to come
                     here. When first I was thinking about leaving my home, and what I could do to
                     keep out of 'the house' a bit longer, I pondered them words, 'Commit they way
                     unto the Lord, and he shall bring it to pass; 'and so I did commit it to him. I
                     asked him to show me a new home, and how to work for it: and, when I'd done
                     that, I expected, in my foolishness, to be told like what the answer was; but
                     no answer come. Days come and went; but I was all in the dark still: so I
                     thought there's nothing for it but 'the house;' for you see, sir, though I've
                     always been able to work for my bread, I couldn't earn enough to pay for my
                     lodging too. Well, sir, this very day my neighbor Wood tells me of the great
                     accident; and she says, 'Molly, I wish I was ten years younger, I'd go offer
                     myself for nurse to the 'firmary: there's sure to be some wanted.' So then I
                     praised the Lord in my heart; for I knowed in a minute that that was what I was
                     to do, being ten years younger in nimbleness than Widow Wood: and I got a
                     recommend, and was took in, for the gentlemen wouldn't disbelieve any thing
                     Parson Hope said; and here I am. And now, sir, just let me wet the rags again:
                     the poor arm is getting very red."
                  This time the patient suffered it to be done without demur; and, when the night
                     nurse came in to see if any thing was wanted, he was calm and quiet, and in the
                     interval of Molly being despatched
                     to her supper said, "You'd no business to give me a nurse with one eye. But she
                     does very well: I'll keep her while I'm here. Don't change her."
               
               
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  DEEPER AND DEEPER STILL.
                  MISS JENNY walked in and out of field after field, getting more and more
                     confused, and, if possible, more and more miserable, till at length she began
                     almost to despair. "It's my belief," she said, "I shall never see home again:
                     the worst part of the country this is that I could have lit upon: I know no
                     more of it than London. I haven't got it in me to go father: It's too dark to
                     see; if I could, but get into a road, and ask, I would. What do I care for his
                     notices? what good hiding, when I'm letting my life go from me?"
                  
                  If she could have got back to the tinker's hovel, she would: she liked him, and
                     would have been glad to lie down on his clay floor, all dripping as she was. If
                     she could have got back to Price's cottage, she would, though her heart rose
                     against his daughter and her anathemas. But the mist was now as thick as a
                     many-folded veil; and there was no moon.
                  "As well sit down as go on," she exclaimed in a tone of desperation; and she
                     sat down under a hedge, to which she did not know she was near till she felt it
                     as she sank beside it. Now that action had ceased, and she was restrained from
                     all effort, hope died; and the indomitable spirit of Miss Jenny gave way. She
                     burst into a passionate flood of tears. Oh, if Jerry Miffler could have seen
                     her! it is doubtful if he would have believed his own eyes,—Miss Jenny crying!
                     Yes, crying, and crying heartily too: the prospect of a night under that
                     hedge—and her limbs were benumbed numbed, so that there seemed no possibility
                     of her leaving it,—was almost a prospect of death; for she felt sure she should
                     lay the foundation of such a disease as must needs be fatal.
                  "It's too late being sorry," she sobbed and sobbed again, as the advice of
                     Brasher, which had caused her all her present trouble, came before her. But he
                     was not the only one that occupied her thoughts: the whole of the day's
                     adventures, and all who had figured in them, made a strange, incongruous maze.
                     One moment she saw Molly disentangling her petticoat, and cheerfully assenting
                     to the wrong she was about to do her: then Mr. Hope, and his solemn warnings,
                     so gentle and so kind; then that dreadful woman, with her curse upon curse;
                     and, last of all, the tinker, with his twinkling eyes and merry smile, and that
                     things he had said. She remembered but little of the last, and that little but
                     very indistinctly tinctly; but he
                     had impressed her with a feeling of his reality. Mr. Hope had often said that
                     God answered prayer; but then he wanted for nothing: he had nothing to pray
                     for. This poor man wanted every thing, and so had full proof of the usefulness
                     of prayer: thus she argued in the intervals of her sobbing-fits under the
                     hedge.
                  Her own question, "If I was in trouble, and asked the Lord to help me out of
                     it, would he?" and his answer, "Of course he would," occurred to her. To be
                     sure, he had added, "but not by the way we have a fancy for, perhaps." But what
                     of that? all she cared for was to be delivered from trouble,—the trouble she
                     was in; and she inwardly resolved, after some deliberation, to ask to be helped
                     to get home, concluding with the resolve, that, if she did get home by help
                     sent, she would,—she could not fix exactly upon what she would do; but it
                     amounted to a vow of faith and good works in some measure, in time to come.
                  She had no idea of prayer without kneeling; but she was so stiff that it was
                     some minutes before she could rise, and take the fitting posture: and, when on
                     her knees, how was she to ask? Her prayers, so-called, at night, were extremely
                     brief, and muttered half asleep; in the morning, she never had time. She could
                     not recollect any thing but the Lord's Prayer; and what had that to do with her
                     getting home? But at last her heart spoke out; and she cried in the midst of
                     her bewilderment, "O merciful God! only take me safe away from this place home;
                     and I'll"—
                  She did not go on; for something over the hedge, which was low where she knelt,
                     gently pushed against her head.
                  She exclaimed in terror, and put out her hand to protect herself: it came in
                     contact with something alive, wet and cold, but moving ing. What was it? A loud neigh dispelled all her
                     perplexities.
                  "If it isn't the black mare!" she cried, forgetting in her delight half her
                     weariness and misery.
                  It was the black mare, who, having highly disapproved of the liberties of the
                     "young man," alias Ben, when riding her back
                     on the side-saddle to the mill, had deposited him in very unpleasant
                     circumstances, and taken to her heels from her pursuer, and wandered off into
                     the very same regions in which lay her unhappy mistress; and being now quietly
                     grazing by the roadside,—for the hedge alone separated Miss Jenny from the road
                     she had so longed to find,—had been struck by the sound of her voice, and poked
                     her head through, as described, being well pleased to find her again.
                  To scramble through the hedge, find that the saddle was just as she had left
                     it, and that she had nothing to do but to mount and go onwards, was all the
                     work of a very few minutes.
                  "On, my wench! on, my good wench!" she cried, her little strength rapidly
                     increasing with her renewed hopes; and finding, by inquiry of a wagon that
                     passed, she was no great distance from home, she joyfully went onwards.
                  The black mare seemed disposed to atone for all her misbehavior during the day,
                     and made good speed and sure. Miss Jenny's heart beat quick with delight, as
                     she saw the light feebly streaming from her parlor, window,—a sight she had
                     almost despaired of ever seeing again; but, with the imperfection common to
                     most human joys, a question of doubt and displeasure arose in her mind as to
                     how a light came in that room when she was away. Did not Jerry believe that she
                     wasn't to be looked for home for several days? Did not he know very well that
                     she never allowed any one to go into her parlor without invitation? "Perhaps it's thieves," she thought; "or
                     perhaps Mr. Jerry is having his friend Wood to supper, and thought he'd treat
                     him to the best room." Whatever it was, she would soon find it out, and let
                     them know she was come home.
                  She led the mare into the stable, which she found open, and in confusion. "So,
                     Mr. Jerry," she muttered between her teeth, "this is your goodness, is it? you
                     and I shall have a short reckoning, I fancy, before to-morrow."
                  She noticed, dark as it was, several proofs in the yard that all was left
                     unguarded: and she heard Wolf growing in his kennel, still chained up" but he
                     was silent when he heard her voice.
                  "I've got a good mind to set him loose, and turn him in upon the party, that I
                     have," she thought; for a party she was sure there was, carousing, doubtless,
                     at her expense, so far as they could get access to the means.
                  She fumbled in her soaked pocket, and found the key of the little buttery, and
                     that of the cellar safe: so far, she was comforted; but she was not at all
                     appeared. She had conjured up a great misdemeanor; and it was as real in her
                     mind as if her eyes beheld it. After a moment's debate, she resolved to catch
                     them in the act, and charge them through the window, before which was neither
                     curtain nor shutter; and mounting a heap of stones, which lay below it, ready
                     for some repairs, she got on a level with it, and speedily had a full view of
                     the room and all its inmates. Was she awake? or was she in a delirious dream
                     under the hedge? By her bewildered gaze, a spectator might have been justified
                     in thinking that she so questioned herself; but Miss Jenny never experienced
                     any thing approaching to delirious dreaming: her life was a succession of the
                     most commonplace realities. She stared wildly indeed; but it was not wonderful,
                     considering what she saw.
                  
                  Stretched on a bed upon the floor lay a man, either dead or sleeping, or
                     somehow stupefied: his face was partially hidden by bandages, on which were
                     stains of blood. What remained of it was ghastly in color and fixedness, and
                     looked more terrible from the bush of grizzled hair that surrounded his mouth.
                     At his head sat Mr. Hope: kneeling by his side were Jerry Miffler and the
                     peddler. The iron lamp from the ceiling had a spectral light on all. Not a
                     sound escaped them: they seemed to her to be transfixed, or, to use her own
                     description afterwards, "all dead together."
                  She leaned on the window-sill, and listened breathlessly for some voice, some
                     sound, to solve the mystery; but all was silent as the grave. Surprise and some
                     measure of awe gave way to impatience; and she was about to descend, and make
                     an attack on the front door, when a deep groan from the prostrate figure stayed
                     her,—such a groan it was! even through the thick glass, it pierced to her very
                     marrow.
                  She could not hear Mr. Hope's words: but she saw that he spoke; and by his
                     countenance, and the lifting up of his hands and eyes, she supposed that he was
                     giving thanks. Jerry and the peddler at the same moment rose from their knees,
                     and moved about as if in want of something: at length they stood consulting
                     together by the corner cupboard, directly opposite the window. Jerry inclined
                     his head to it; the peddler moved his hand towards the lock. Jerry shook his
                     head, as if to say, "No, use." The peddler—could she believe her eyes?—took a
                     bunch of keys from his pocket, and tried several, till one, it was plain,
                     turned easily; and at the cost of every breath in her body, from sheer
                     amazement, he opened the door, and proceeded to make an inspection of her
                     peculiar treasures, on which no eye but her own ever rested, and finished by
                     putting a bottle into Jerry's hands.
                  
                  The strange man, Mr. Hope, her own adventures, her present condition of wet and
                     weariness,—all gave place to this invasion of her cupboard. It was more than
                     nature in any condition could stand; and she rattled violently upon the window
                     with her knuckles: if she could have been through it, and upon them, she
                     would.
                  The sudden harsh noise in the midst of such a silence produced the natural
                     effects on nervous people. Mr. Hope started to his feet: and Jerry dropped the
                     bottle he had seemed almost afraid to take; and it fell with a crash on the
                     sanded floor, a dark stream issuing from among the fragments. The peddler, who
                     was not nervous, turned to the window whence the noise came, and, walking
                     straight towards it, was just in time to see something, he knew not what,
                     disappear. A thundering attack on the house-door followed in a very few
                     seconds. Jerry, as far as looks went, might have changed places with the
                     spectral figure on the floor.
                  "Go, go to the door," said Mr. Hope, recovering himself a little: "perhaps it's
                     a summons for me elsewhere. In times of calamity like this, people lose their
                     self-possession; but go at once, or the knock may be repeated. You," he said to
                     the peddler, having addressed himself before to Jerry, "pray manage to get up a
                     drop or two of the brandy he has spilled with your handkerchief, and wet his
                     lips with it,—quickly, quickly, pray!"
                  Jerry dared not refuse; yet he hardly dared to obey. Shaking like an aspen
                     leaf, as if under a presentiment of what awaited him, he went to the door just
                     in time to save another salute.
                  "Haw!" was all he heard; but he felt the strong hand that had been on his
                     collar before now; and he reeled under it, tumbling headlong in the passage.
                     Miss Jenny, wasting no thought on
                     him, left him there, and rushed to the parlor: the door was open. At the moment
                     she reached it, the prostrate man, reviving a little from the effects of the
                     brandy, unclosed his eyes, and fixed them on her. She stood for a moment as if
                     paralyzed, and then exclaimed, "Kit! Haw!"
                  "You must be silent, Miss Hornbeck," said Mr. Hope, anxiously whispering, and
                     raising his hands as the eyes slowly closed again. "You will kill him: you will
                     really kill him, if you are violent! You had better go away: you shall hear all
                     about it presently. Go away! pray go away!"
                  Here was a coming home,—the coming home she had so earnestly longed for under
                     the hedge, and so triumphed in the prospect of, as she urged on the black
                     mare.
                  Her deadly enemy had taken possession of it, not in very congratulatory
                     condition, indeed, still, there he was; and she was ordered out of her own
                     parlor, while before her very eyes the peddler stood with the key that opened
                     her cupboard in his hand, and her particular bottle of brandy, kept more for
                     the dignity of having it than for its use, was curling in and out in little
                     streams upon the sand.
                  "Take her away, and explain," said Mr. Hope appealingly to the peddler: for he
                     saw that the eyes were opening again; and he dreaded what might follow.
                  "Touch me if you dare, Dick Banks! I'll go: it's time I did, when I can stand
                     to be told. I don't want your company. I suppose I've got liberty to go
                     alone."
                  So saying, she strode away, giving Jerry, who still stood by the door, and
                     indignant glance, and ordering him to be off and rub down the mare.
                  Bolting herself into the kitchen, she proceeded to strip off her saturated
                     garments; and, going to the buttery, she fetched out her pie and some ale, and, sitting down before the fire,
                     with a dry sack that she caught up from the settle on her shoulders, satisfied
                     the cravings of hunger, and brought back warmth to her half-frozen limbs.
                  She heard voices, she heard footsteps, she heard scuffling in the passage. The
                     door was tried; but she took no notice. "They've got the run of the parlor
                     (good job there's no more brandy in the cupboard)," she said, scoffingly: "they
                     may be satisfied with that. I'm not going to be turned out of my kitchen while
                     I can keep the door between us."
                  It was not wonderful that warmth and a hearty meal, the amount of which her
                     excitement did not interfere with, coming after the hardships of the day,
                     should have the effect of sending her to sleep. She meant not to go to sleep;
                     and generally she kept her resolves. But nature was strong against her; and not
                     many minutes after she had placed herself in a listening ing attitude (taking
                     care that it should also be one of rest), fully intending, when all was quiet,
                     to go out softly, and reconnoitre, she was as fast asleep, and snoring as
                     audibly, as if she had been in her bed, and her little dog outside the
                     door.
                  She slept long beyond her usual hour of waking. When first she awoke, she was
                     at a loss to account for her cold quarters, her semiupright posture, and the
                     stiffness of her limbs: the rough sack on her shoulders also much perplexed
                     her. It was pitch dark: she could not catch a glimmer of light; for the fire
                     was quite out, and the shutter was shut, so that not one dim twilight ray could
                     enter. By degrees, consciousness of the truth dawned upon her: in a very
                     mystified way for some time, indeed; but at length she was aware that she was
                     in the kitchen, and that, before she could appear out of it, she must don the
                     clothes she had taken off the night before.
                  
                  She was as much at home in the kitchen in the dark as at noonday, when once she
                     was fully possessed of her true circumstances: so, with a little difficulty
                     from her stiffness, she soon got her tinder-box, struck a light, kindled a
                     fresh fire, and unfastened the shutter. Her wardrobe was not so easily managed.
                     Her skirt, which she had hung before the fire on the back of the settle, stood
                     upright in its own strength when she took it down, being so thoroughly cemented
                     over with baked mud that its proper color could hardly be distinguished.
                  "I must wash it," she exclaimed, as she surveyed it with disgust, "before I can
                     put it on!" Her bonnet, which had been battered by the rain into innumerable
                     angles, she had also suspended before the fire; and now, thoroughly dry, the
                     angles remained stiff and unalterable: and, when she put it on, it looked more
                     like a helmet out of the wars than a peaceable woman's head-covering.
                  With great reluctance, she attired herself, making grim faces of disgust all
                     the time.
                  "I sha'n't be long getting to the chamber," she thought: "I'll soon clean
                     myself, when I'm there."
                  She listened at the door before withdrawing the bolt. All was silent. With a
                     stealthiness foreign to her, and therefore very difficult to practise, she
                     opened it. The passage was clear: the door at the bottom of it closed; but a
                     feeble light fell across the other end of it, from which she argued that the
                     parlor door was open, and the shutter of its window too.
                  The stairs leading to her chamber were exactly opposite the parlor door: she
                     hesitated before venturing to leave the kitchen. What would she see there? At
                     last she went onwards. She meant not to look into the parlor, but to pass
                     silently to her room: she could not help, however, giving a furtive glance, and
                     saw that it was empty. This produced a strong feeling of relief: she breathed freely, and
                     began to make an examination of it.
                  "Some of 'em shall pay for that!" she cried, as she looked at the stains of the
                     brandy, and the fragments of the bottle. "Here's a dirt and mess!" she added,
                     surveying the marks that the wounded man and those around him had left. "I
                     suppose Master Kit came to serve me his notice with his own hands, and came by
                     an accident in the way. But what brought Parson Hope with him? and that Dick
                     Banks? I believe they're all against me together; but I'll match 'em, that's
                     what I will! This is the 'day after to-morrow." I'll just go and clean myself a
                     bit, after I've taken good care I'm locked into the house: and I'll never stir
                     out till twelve o'clock tonight; and then a brass farthing for their notices!
                     I'll tell 'em the law's on my side; and I'll teach 'em how to try and bring it
                     against me."
                  Miss Jenny rather thought than spoke out her plans; and, consoled by the
                     prospect of ar end to her troubles, she turned to go to her chamber.
                  "Please, miss,—please, missus," said Jerry, who was shaking in the doorway,
                     "I'm come to tell you as you must please come along to Parson Hope's."
                  Miss Jenny's only answer at first was a terrific stare; but, seeing Jerry
                     beginning to sidle off, she seized him by his arm, and cried, "Where's the man?
                     What have you done with him? Who brought him here?"
                  "He was carried here, miss. It was no doings of mine," said the terror-stricken
                     Jerry, looking down the passage, away from her face.
                  "Where is he?—nowhere in the place."
                  "He's a-bed at Parson Hope's, miss," said Jerry. "The doctor comed arter you
                     went off. And he said as he'd bear moving; and Parson Hope said as he'd take
                     him: so—so he was took."
                  
                  "How was he took?" demanded Miss Jenny, not relaxing her grasp.
                  "Four on us carried him down the hill; and arter there was a thing from the
                     'firmary to take him on," said Jerry.
                  "Four? what four?" demanded Miss Jenny.
                  "Well, miss, there was me, and the peddler, and Wood, who'd been for the
                     doctor, and a man as brought this here for you arter you was gone, and ordered
                     me to see you had it safe in your hands."
                  With this, Jerry brought from his pocket, under his smock, a paper, and gave it
                     to her.
                  Fancying for the moment that it was an order from a customer, she took it
                     before Jerry could add, "He said as 'twas a notice to quit; and you was to have
                     it the first time as I see you."
                  "Haw!" Miss Jenny articulated with some difficulty, as the notice dropped from
                     her hands.
                  Jerry, having given up himself to despair, did not know whether the presenting
                     of the notice, about the import of which he was mystified, would be for or
                     against him; and he hardly cared. He couldn't be in worse liking than he was:
                     so he stood still, staring down the passage, though she had released his
                     arm.
                  "Saddle the mare!" she cried fiercely, when she had regained her voice; for she
                     was now, that, the notice having been delivered, her hiding would be of no
                     avail.
                  "Yes, miss," said Jerry, involuntarily obeying his usual habit; and then
                     adding, "Please, miss, she b'ain't at home."
                  "Where is she?" cried Miss Jenny.
                  "We was forced to tackle her to the 'firmary cart, to take muster—him—down to
                     Hancock. 'Firmary hadn't got never a one."
                  Miss Jenny was too exasperated to speak. Motioning him to get clear out of her
                     way, a proceeding greatly to his satisfaction, she made but few steps of the passage, and, forgetting
                     the strange figure she cut, was half way to Hancock before Jerry had
                     sufficiently recovered himself to be able to consider which he had best
                     do,—follow her, and be ready for orders, or open the mill, and go to work. He
                     decided finally on the latter course, remembering Mr. Randall's wheat that was
                     coming in to be ground.
                  Miss Jenny was soon in sight of Hancock; but, instead of going to Mr. Hope's,
                     she made for the office of Lawyer Kays.
                  The young man had just swept it out, and was cleaning the doorway, and
                     regulating the mat, when, without asking him a question, she passed him so
                     roughly that she nearly sent him and his broom into the street. She did not
                     expect to see the lawyer himself; but she wanted to get what help she could
                     from Mr. Brasher, whose advice she bitterly regretted she had rendered useless
                     by returning home.
                  But it so happened that Lawyer Kays had reached Hancock that very morning, not
                     an hour before, by the early train, important business having called him back
                     before his time.
                  He was a sedate man, and not easily frightened, or taken by surprise; but when
                     the apparition of Miss Jenny, with her wild face and remarkable costume,
                     confronted him, without any preparation, he was considerably startled.
                  "I didn't expect to find you, lawyer," she exclaimed. "I'm glad you're come
                     back. I suppose your man has told you all my trouble."
                  "I have not seen Mr. Brasher, Miss Hornbeck," said the lawyer. "I have but just
                     returned home."
                  "Haw! then here's all about it," said Miss Jenny, sorry to have to pay for two
                     hearings.
                  With all the clearness she could command, she stated her case, Mr. Brasher's
                     advice, and the misfortune of her having run into the evil he had tried to save her from, by disregarding
                     it. The lawyer looked grave.
                  "With regard to your brother's claim, Miss Hornbeck"—
                  "Ain't my brother," interrupted Miss Jenny.
                  "True, your half-brother. I must think further, or rather learn more about
                     that, before giving you an opinion. But as to the notice, your receiving it or
                     not receiving it does not affect its force. The issue of a write of ejectment
                     bars the statute of limitation. You would have been open to the notice any day
                     you returned home."
                  "Then I sha'n't pay for that advice," said Miss Jenny quickly.
                  "No, you shall not," said the lawyer with a smile. "Mr. Brasher didn't
                     sufficiently consider what he said; and perhaps he wanted to save your feelings
                     for a short time, at any rate."
                  Very rueful did Miss Jenny look, sitting on the high office-stool, staring
                     wistfully as the lawyer read the scrap of paper which bore the pith of her
                     threatened loss.
                  "There's nothing in it, lawyer?" she said anxiously.
                  "There is something in it. Miss Hornbeck; but how much I cannot tell you now.
                     The truth is, I have travelled all night, and have had no breakfast. I must
                     take an hour for a little rest and refreshment. If you will call towards noon,
                     I shall be free from another engagement which I came home purposely to attend
                     to."
                  "Forgot my own breakfast," muttered Miss Jenny, as she left the office, half
                     angry with the lawyer for remembering his, while her affairs were standing
                     still for want of notice.
                  She hesitated whether she should go to Mr. Hope's. What was to be done by her
                     going? Why had she been sent for?
                  
                  "I'll not go near him,—not I!" she exclaimed at last, and turned her face
                     resolutely towards the mill.
                  "Miss Hornbeck," cried the peddler, close behind her, "stop, miss! you're going
                     the wrong way."
                  "Haw!" exclaimed Miss Jenny, coming to a halt.
                  "He's dying, miss: he's dying! You'll never be so wicked against grace and
                     nature, too, as to refuse to see him and forgive him," said the peddler.
                  "Who says he's dying?" she demanded, suspecting that it was a trick to get her
                     there.
                  "Everybody says so; and he says so," replied the peddler.
                  "Never told the truth since I knew him!" she answered, demurring whether to go
                     or not.
                  "You'll repent it to the last day of your life, if you don't; and what good
                     will it do to any but yourself to go to him? It's only for your own sake we
                     want it, and to give him what comfort we can."
                  The last argument was a forcible one,—if it could do no one any good (and she
                     couldn't see that it would),—there could be no hidden motive in pressing her to
                     go. It prevailed, therefore; and she turned after the peddler, and followed him
                     to the vicarage gate. They were met at the door by Mr. Hope, who had seen them
                     from the window.
                  "Be very quiet, very quiet!" he said. "I am thankful to say he sleeps; and that
                     is the best symptom possible, our good doctor says."
                  He was so much taken up with the thoughts of the wounded man, that he did not
                     observe Miss Jenny's condition till they had all entered the dining-room, the
                     orderly and comfortable aspect of which for the first time brought it to her
                     recollection. The soft bright carpet, the spotless wainscot, and the fresh
                     chintz covers were so many mirrors
                     in which she saw herself, and an actual one of good size over the chimney-piece
                     reflected her head and face, and completed her portrait.
                  "I'm not fit to be here," she said disconsolately, looking supremely disgusted
                     with herself.
                  "You don't look well, Miss Hornbeck," said Mr. Hope,—"not at all yourself. Pray
                     sit down."
                  "Wouldn't dirt 'em for a guinea," she said, looking at the bright chintz
                     covers. "I'll go home and get my breakfast." She seemed almost ready to
                     cry.
                  "Banks, will you go and take watch by the wounded man, and send Mary down?"
                     said Mr. Hope, getting between Miss Jenny and the door.
                  Banks obeyed: and, alone with her, Mr. Hope suggested that there was no place
                     like his study for a private talk such as he wanted to have; and that, as she
                     had not breakfasted, Mary should bring her some there. "I have something so
                     important to say, you really must not refuse me," he urged.
                  She was no longer the positive, impracticable lady miller. She went after him
                     to the study with a hanging head, her mud-cased skirt leaving fragments of its
                     unsightly encumberments in her progress.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER VIII.
                  SOWING AND REAPING.
                  IT all comes of that unpardonable selfish carelessness," said Molly Martin's
                     patient to the doctor the next day. "If that man had done his duty, I should
                     never have got into this. I have kept from the place purposely: I hate the
                     place,—the very name of the place; never was near it before."
                  The doctor smiled.
                  "Ah! you may smile. It's very well for them to laugh that haven't got to pay
                     the damage," said the patient with much irritation. "I tell you it's a
                     scandalous thing! How would you like to have a widow with a whole tribe of
                     children thrown on you?"
                  The doctor looked as if he certainly should object to it.
                  "No: you wouldn't like it,—of course you wouldn't; but these go-easy people,
                     good-natured, generous people, that live like merchant princes, and feast all
                     that will feast with them, have no conscience: they first bring up their
                     families in luxury, that makes them fit for nothing, and then leave them to
                     other people to clothe and feed. Sir, I call such men first-class robbers!
                     Generous? why, such conduct is the quintessence of meanings! unjust to their
                     families, unjust to society!"
                  "'Tis a pity, indeed," the doctor began.
                  "Pity! a sin, sir, a sin. Didn't I warn my niece, when they began to launch out
                     carriages and horses and a fine establishment and dinner-parties and finery and
                     feasting, when he ought to have
                     spent all he could spare in insuring his life? What was an income worth that
                     was to die with him? And she! a pretty sort of mother, to let all those
                     children grow up in idleness, and give them habits they've no right to end life
                     with, how much less to begin it with them?"
                  "Were you aware of poor Flood's true circumstances?" asked the doctor, who had
                     often been a guest at his abundant and elegant table.
                  "I? how was I to be aware?" said the patient petulantly. "I suspected the
                     truth, but washed my hands of them. I told them so: I was sure it must come to
                     this. What was the use of my interfering? he was always going to insure, always
                     going to save, and invest: that was the tale whenever I remonstrated."
                  "Pity you didn't pay them a visit now and then. Mr. Flood was so kind and so
                     easily persuaded suaded into things, I should think a friendly word from you,
                     on the spot, might have been useful," said the doctor.
                  "Not a bit, not a bit: he would have listened and gone on just the same; and my
                     niece is as bad and worse."
                  "It will be a sad reverse for her," said the doctor.
                  "I know it; I have nothing for her: she had all I could give on her marriage. I
                     took care that that should be settled on her; and on that pittance she must
                     live, and be thankful. What more I have is settled at my death on her sister;
                     and that shall not be touched."
                  "Then you cannot very well have a widow and a tribe of children thrown on you?"
                     said the doctor.
                  "I can't see them starve; can't see them grow up ignorant. They must be taught
                     to get their bread: I don't know how it's to be done; but it must be done."
                  
                  "Have you seen Mrs. Flood?"
                  "No. I hear all the fine furniture is to be sold to pay off debts, and get a
                     little ready money: and they are going to stay with another of your
                     good-natured people,—his brother Augustus,—who is doing the same thing, and
                     will come to the same end; for these people will not learn."
                  "You came, intending to see them," I presume.
                  "Not I: I was on my way to London, to see the assignees, and find out if any
                     thing could be done."
                  "I will take the second boy. He is a promising lad. I will try if he is likely
                     to take to my profession; and if he is, with very little help, I will see him
                     through his education. I have no children: I was fond of poor Flood; and it
                     will be pleasant to me to do it," said the doctor.
                  The patient felt a little abashed at his own harshness. "Really, it's too much:
                     they've no claim on you at all," he said.
                  "The claim of wanting help," said the doctor; "and indirectly Mr. Flood did me
                     much kindness: he was of use in introducing me to good society, when first I
                     settled in Hancock; so his boy will only reap what he sowed. One good turn
                     deserves another. I don't excuse his improvidence, far from it: I think such
                     conduct very culpable. But I have realized a competence for my wife, if I am
                     taken first; and I have, from first starting in business, insured my life: so I
                     can afford to help a friend, you see."
                  "That is true generosity," said the patient.
                  "I don't think any one can be generous that is not just," said the doctor. "At
                     the same time, I make a distinction between what is done from weakness and what
                     is done from wilful wickedness.
                  "Poor Flood, out of his profession, was a weak man, always making good resolves, and losing
                     sight of them, or putting off till to-morrow."
                  "Lived entirely for to-day," said the patient.
                  "Well, he is gone, to answer for all," said the doctor: "and I can tell you,
                     that Mr. Hope has exerted himself, and will do more, and hopes to carry the
                     eldest boy through college; and that will give the widow time to think for the
                     rest."
                  "She never did think," said the patient.
                  "We must—you must—try to make her think now. A word from you to her husband
                     formerly might in some degree have saved her."
                  "I wish I had come, if I thought so," said the patient; "but, sir, she was
                     thoughtlessly brought up by a foolish mother, just as she has brought up her
                     children; and now her mother wants help from her who has no power to help
                     herself."
                  "The old story of sowing and reaping; but it's too late now to look back: we
                     must deal with the present, and work for the future," said the doctor.
                  The sudden death of Mr. Flood had caused great trouble to many besides his
                     immediate family. His wife's uncle was not the only person that had to complain
                     of the burden and anxiety thrown on them. The children were to be scattered
                     among relatives and friends; some of whom, in order to help, were compelled to
                     make sacrifices far greater than would have enabled their thoughtless parents
                     to save them from their humiliating position of dependence. "We really must
                     begin to think of saving, my dear," Mr. Flood would sometimes say, when any
                     slight ailment reminded him that life was uncertain.
                  "Yes, dear, we will," Mrs. Flood would answer: but, in the mean time, she could
                     not resolve to part with a single servant, or put down a carriage, to dress plainly, or to live
                     simply.
                  If her husband could save while she went on in her old way, she would highly
                     approve of it; but her old way she positively could not give up, it would have
                     such a strange look. They would lose caste in society: it would injure their
                     children's prospects. In a few years comparatively, the daughters would marry,
                     and the sons settle in life: when that was done, all would be straightforward
                     enough.
                  Mr. Flood had occasional qualms of conscience, that he ought not to listen to
                     such delusive nonsense; and, on the Sunday when Mr. Hope preached the sermon on
                     which Miss Hornbeck declared she had based her theory of wrong and robbery, he
                     had returned home dejected and trembling, under a presentiment of near
                     retribution; and in his heart he resolved fervently to see about a
                     life-insurance immediately, and prove to his wife that a reduction in their
                     expenses was absolutely necessary. Moreover, he resolved to go to Mr. Hope, and
                     talk to him about the great day of reckoning he had so solemnly spoken of. To
                     be unready for death, so far as this world went, seemed grievous enough; but to
                     be in danger of meeting a just Judge, instead of a merciful Saviour, on that
                     day, was a thought that weighed him down.
                  A few days after, most of them being spent in a state of insensibility, and the
                     tree had fallen!
                  "If I could have foreseen sudden death,—if I could have foreseen the
                     difficulties,—if and if and if,"—were part of the poor widow's lamentations,
                     which were of equal wisdom with,—
                  "When the mountains fall, and when the sea dries up!"
                  Mr. Hope, whose heart was more ready to look into its own shortcomings and
                        misdoings than those of others,
                     had reproached himself for not having sought more sedulously the good of his
                     parishioner. All the atonement he could make for what he called his
                     lukewarmness, he did: he resolved, himself, to help liberally, and to obtain
                     all the help he could from others; to provide for the eldest son, and give some
                     assistance to the widow.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IX.
                  THE LAST STRAW BREAKS JERRY'S BACK.
                  WE left Mr. Hope in his study with Miss Jenny. What conversation took place
                     there, the reader need not listen to; indeed, Miss Jenny would have been put
                     still more to the blush than she was, if she had suspected any eavesdroppers or
                     witnesses. It is sufficient to say, that her yesterday's experiences all seemed
                     to be brought as evidences of the truth of the charge against her,—a charge
                     which Mr. Hope could not accuse himself of being lukewarm in preferring.
                  True to her nature, she was at intervals almost unconsciously rubbing off a dull mark on
                     the bright table by which she sat,—a mark made by a tear; for Miss Jenny's eyes
                     had acquired an entirely novel art in the last twenty-four hours, and she could
                     weep like other people. When Mr. Hope had denounced her special sins of
                     hardness of heart and unbelief, his words vividly brought before her the plain
                     statements of Price's daughter, which had so roused her wrath; when he had
                     spoken of the mercy shown to penitent sinners, and the peace that
                     reconciliation with God through Jesus Christ brings into the heart, whatever
                     may be the trials of life, he seemed to be describing the tinker; and when,
                     seeing her softened countenance and evident distress, he entered her to pray
                     for the gift of the Spirit, that she might rejoice in that peace, she
                     remembered with emotion her prayer under the hedge, so immediately answered,
                     and, with the answer, so soon forgotten.
                  "I hope I'll forgive him, whether the law goes against me or not: I won't
                     promise; for I doubt before I'm half-way to the mill I shall feel as angry
                     against him as ever. I don't see how I can help to be angry,—I don't, I'm
                     sure," she cried; when, with her hand on the study-door, and in the act of
                     departing, the difficulty of her task rose fresh before her. She could almost
                     have added, without going half-way to the mill, "And what's more, when I come
                     to think of it, I won't forgive him," but she checked herself.
                  "You cannot do it in your own strength; but ask for power, and you will have
                     it," said Mr. Hope.
                  "Really, she seems softened," he said to his wife, after the lady miller had
                     gone home to make the necessary alterations in her costume, promising to return
                     after she had paid her noontide visit to Lawyer Kays.
                  "Where's the key of the beans and the Injy corn?" said Wood to Jerry
                     Miffler.
                  
                  Jerry had felt all his pockets for it, and it was not forthcoming.
                  "It was that bustle last night as finished me up: I can't mind any thing," he
                     remarked, looking vacantly round, as if he expected the key to fall from the
                     ceiling-roof or the walls.
                  "You ain't got a bit of head, Jerry," said Wood; "and what's a miller without
                     never a bit of head?"
                  "I had a bit once: I warn't so wanting in the old gentleman's time. 'Jerry,'
                     says he, 'you're a good worker when you will, and when you go quiet to it,' and
                     that's the truth; but she has so dothered me with her ways, and her black
                     staring eyes, I feel as if I couldn't 'bide to stay any longer, for all I
                     should have liked to stop in the old place for the poor old missus's sake. Oh!
                     what a good thing to be in heaven along wi' her!"
                  While he was speaking, he was hunting after the lost key; which he at last
                     discovered in a spout-hole. He was overjoyed at having found it, more
                     especially as Wood, from the window, saw Miss Jenny striding up the hill, and
                     announced her with a rather malicious grin to his companion.
                  "Whatever would you ha' done if you hadn't found it, and she'd come in and
                     catched you?" he said, laughing.
                  "Hid in the old hopper till she was gone again," Jerry answered. "Is she close
                     at hand?"
                  "No: she've gone into the house, and shut the door," said Wood, still at his
                     post of observation.
                  Jerry was still more relieved: he had had so severe a turn, that he felt as if
                     he could not bear many more shocks. All the while he was at work, his thoughts
                     were on the question of a new place, where what with he had would be allowed to
                     remain in him.
                  Meantime, Miss Jenny, little supposing that, if she kept the mill, her harshness had filled
                     its measure of provocation, and driven from her if not the most efficient of
                     servants, still the most valuable she could have for honesty and steadfast
                     principle and grateful attachment to her mother's memory, went up to her
                     chamber, and speedily got rid of her unseemly garb. A plentiful bath and clean
                     raiment made a wonderful change in her inward and outward condition.
                  "There's nothing so bad as dirt," she ejaculated, plunging the skirt into water
                     with an air of supreme satisfaction, "except sin," came into her mind. She had
                     heard the words with little attention; yet they had lodged in her memory.
                  "Sin!" she exclaimed, sitting down to rest both body and mind a little. "I'm
                     sure Kit's a great sinner," she thought; "and however I'm to forgive him, I
                     don't know."
                  Then came in Mr. Hope's counsel, "Ask for power."
                  "He says I'm as great a sinner, and want pardon as much as he does: don't
                     believe that; can't believe it!"
                  Then came in the counsel, "Ask, that you may believe it."
                  "Ask? how?"
                  How had she asked to be delivered from last night's terror?
                  "Well, I'll just do what Parson Hope told me. I'll ask straight out to believe
                     what I don't believe,—that I'm as great a sinner as Kit, and that I may have it
                     in my heart to forgive him."
                  As she went on her knees by the hedgeside, so she knelt by her bed: and, having
                     put her wants into the fewest possible words, got up, and considered that she
                     had done all she could: and if she did not afterwards feel disposed to confess
                     her equality in guilt with Kit, and a good-will to forgive him, it would be
                     because neither of these was necessary towards her possessing the tinker's peace, and escaping
                     the anathemas of Price's daughter.
                  "I'll just give a look to the mill," she said, when her mind was relieved of
                     this duty; "and then I must go to Hancock again: it will be noon by the time
                     I'm at the lawyer's."
                  "Jerry, I see no sign of the wheat from Randall's," she exclaimed at the bottom
                     of the steps, he being on the first upper floor, near the hopper, in case any
                     catastrophe, for which he was nervously on the lookout, should make hiding
                     advisable.
                  "No, miss," he answered, rejoicing in the hope that the stairs would remain
                     between them.
                  "What can be the reason?" she demanded.
                  "Don't know," said Jerry.
                  "Come down," said Miss Jenny.
                  Jerry sighed, but, plucking up courage from the resolve that he would soon have
                     done with it all, came down the stairs. His scared face and averted eyes
                     reminded her involuntarily of the words of Price's daughter.
                  "I'll be bound you brought a wrong message," she said: "it won't be here till
                     to-morrow. Get to work on that old runner, and begin to dress it, and let Wood
                     go home from his half-day: you don't want help."
                  "Yes, miss. Please, miss," he began.
                  "I can't stop: do what I say," she answered sharply, and left him despairing of
                     ever having the courage to give her warning.
                  He watched her till she was half-way down the hill, when she paused to look at
                     a piece of fencing that had been injured during the bringing up of Christopher
                     Hornbeck to the mill the night before. She was on the point of returning, when
                     he determined, come what would, to go out and tell her his mind.
                  "Pretty clumsy work there," she said angrily, as she met him.
                  "Yes, miss. Please, miss"—
                  
                  "See and put it right," she said. "Take the wattles from the little coppice. I
                     suppose that was last night's business."
                  "Yes, miss. Please, miss," Jerry began again.
                  Miss Jenny, entirely disregarding him, turned round to go on to Hancock.
                  "Miss, Miss Jenny, missus, I'm a-going," bawled Jerry after her.
                  "Going?" said Miss Jenny, turning round, and looking at him in surprise,
                     "where?"
                  "Going to leave, miss," said Jerry, his eyes fixed on the damaged fence.
                  "Leave? what, the mill! me?" cried Miss Jenny, hardly able to believe her
                     ears.
                  "Yes, miss. Please, miss: it is you as I want to leave. I've got no objections
                     to the mill; and maybe I'll get into another mill."
                  "Oh! you want to leave me, do you? That's your gratitude, is it?"
                  "Yes, miss. Please, miss, you're always a-saying I'm no good to you, and I'm
                     getting dooller and dooller; and maybe I be: and I'd raither to try somewhere
                     else. If so be I could ha' done the work to please you, I'd have staid for less
                     wages, or any thing: but I get so badly wi' being foreverlasting rated, I
                     bain't fit for no work; and it's my belief I shall be setting the mill a-fire
                     some o' these nights, all along o' being dothered."
                  Jerry did not get through his oration without sundry stops and gulps; but he
                     did get through it, and, having done so, would not wait for Miss Jenny's reply,
                     but lumbered off towards the spinney, where he was to get the wattles to mend
                     the fence.
                  "Wood says I am afraid of telling her my soul is my own; but now he'll see
                     different," he thought, having been in some measure goaded to the act by the
                     jeers of his fellow-workman.
                  "So," soliloquized the lady miller, "just at this time too! Well, if I lose the mill, I
                     sha'n't want a man." But lose the mill,—the thought was too terrible to
                     entertain.
                  "What possessed the fellow?" she asked herself. "Am I such a bugbear,—such a
                     sharp hand?" She passed from the subject: she could not answer the question
                     satisfactorily.
                  Lawyer Kays was still engaged, and sent down a message, begging her to call
                     again at five o'clock. So she was to go and see Kit, uncertain whether his
                     intentions against her would be put in practice or not. She went towards the
                     vicarage with a heavy heart,—all the heavier for Jerry Miffler's summary
                     dismissal of himself from her service, founded as it was upon a charge of
                     tyranny, of which her conscience told her she had been verily guilty. The sound
                     of wheels behind her made her look round: surely it was Mr. Randall's wheat on
                     its way to the mill for next day's grinding,—yes, there was the name on the
                     wagon; no doubt about it. What should she do? Go to the mill, or go on to Mr.
                     Hope's? What was she going to Mr. Hope's for? She could not tell. Not to,
                     forgive Kit? She felt sure, when it came to the test, she should be unable to
                     do that. She resolved to follow the wagon, or rather get before it. As Jerry
                     had turned upon her in so unexpected a manner, how could she answer for what he
                     might do further? There were various ways in which he might be as willing as he
                     was able to annoy her; and she would not trust him.
                  Oh, what a stone was in her heart as she went once more up the hill! She left
                     the wagon far behind her, notwithstanding, and was up at the mill before it was
                     in sight on the road below.
                  The mill was shut: she recollected that she had told Jerry to mend the fence,
                     and had sent Wood home. How perplexing! She went at once to the fence, and
                     found not Jerry, but Wood, at work there.
                  
                  "Where's Miffler?"
                  "Gone home. He's so put about, he says, what with loss of rest and one thing
                     and another, he can't keep up no longer: so he put me to do this, and went off
                     home to bed," said Wood.
                  "The wheat is come from Randall's: leave that job, and come up and help us get
                     it in," said Miss Jenny.
                  Wood obeyed: but Miss Jenny, who had for so many years declaimed against her
                     old servant, and stupefied him by rating him for his stupidity, now keenly felt
                     his loss; for, with all his dulness, he was as honest as the day, and as true
                     to her interest as she herself could be. Poor Jerry, he whom she could have
                     left without any mistrust with these men, sure that there would be fair play,
                     was away, broken down by her harshness and unreasonableness. It seemed as
                     though she were deserted by all. Even old Wood, whom she did not half like nor
                     confide in, feeling sure that he would help himself at her expense whenever he
                     had a chance, looked now as if he were quite indifferent to the honor of
                     serving her. Could she wonder at it? Had not she turned his mother out of a
                     home, with which, in justice, she had no power to interfere?
                  When at last the grain was housed, she locked up the mill, and, dismissing Wood
                     to finish the fence, went home, to consider what was to be done.
                  Look where she would, a blank wall seemed to arise before her. She, who had
                     never winced at difficulty, but had borne down all before her, now beheld
                     insurmountable evils on every side. She had asked in the morning for help to do
                     what she ought to do, whatever that might be. She thought now, that, instead of
                     being helped, as she had been the night before, when she asked for deliverance,
                     she was only getting thicker into trouble. She was ignorant, as all naturally are, that it is often by
                     making our sins our scourge that our heavenly father brings us to his fold.
                  "I'm sorry for Miffler. Wonder if he's really bad, or only mumping?" she
                     thought, after she had sat some little time in what might have been called
                     "mumping" herself. "I'll go and see him. I'll take him a mess of porridge. He's
                     got nobody to do for him. I wish I hadn't been so short with him."
                  Very soon she was on her way to the cottage, with the porridge in a covered
                     basin. She looked through the window: instead of lying on the bed, he was
                     standing at his little table, packing up a bundle. Without any ceremony, she
                     lifted the latch, and walked in.
                  "Thought you had gone to bed!" she exclaimed.
                  Jerry started, but, not being prepared with an answer, fumbled still at his
                     bundle, and said nothing.
                  "Heard you'd gone home poorly; knocked up with last night, I suppose. That
                     wasn't my doing."
                  Jerry still fumbled at his bundle in silence.
                  "I've brought you some porridge": you'd best eat it, and get a sleep. You'll
                     have to be early to-morrow; the wheat's come," she said, setting the porridge
                     before him.
                  "Please, miss," he said, not daring to look up, "I'm going to see for the place
                     at the Ripplestone Mills."
                  "Ripplestone? Why, that's thirty miles away! What put Ripplestone into your
                     head?"
                  "Wood told me about it. It's his mother's parish. He's been to see if they'll
                     take her in there when she's turned out of her house."
                  "And who's to do your work to-morrow?"
                  "Please, miss, Wood. He's a better hand than me,—leastways, you don't flout
                     him, like you do me continually," said Jerry.
                  "There, eat your porridge. I was put out. I've had trouble,—a great deal of trouble. You
                     mustn't mind a sharp word or two. Undo your bundle, and get to sleep: you'll be
                     all right to-morrow," said Miss Jenny, after an inward struggle.
                  "Don't feel as if I should. I'm all abroad; and I sha'n't get no better
                     here."
                  "Eat your porridge, man, and don't talk nonsense," said Miss Jenny, in a
                     soothing tone; Jerry's bloodshot eyes and trembling voice smiting her
                     conscience.
                  "Please, miss, I don't want no words. I ax your pardon; but at Ripplestone
                     Mills there's no tricks, Wood says," Jerry stammered out.
                  "Tricks!" exclaimed Miss Jenny.
                  "Yes, miss,—such as grinding beans and Injy corn into the flour, and sending it
                     out for first and best seconds, and such as that."
                  "Haw!" exclaimed Miss Jenny, after a pause.
                  "Please, miss, I'm afear'd for my soul, I am. Your mother,—old missus,—she was
                     used to tell me to remember that above all and every thing; and I can't
                     remember it here."
                  "Been twenty years finding it out!" said Miss Jenny sternly, but with no little
                     agitation.
                  "No, miss. It's the like of this: you've got more into them ways continually
                     every year. You wasn't the same when you began first; and I've gone on along:
                     and I be afear'd to do it any more,—I be."
                  "Oh!" said Miss Jenny, "so you'll go to the honest folks at Ripplestone, and
                     say you can't live any longer with such a rogue as Miss Hornbeck?"
                  "Miss," cried Jerry, "I wouldn't cast a bad name on you for a world of money
                     now; but I don't know what I might come to, if I stopped longer."
                  "Eat your porridge,—it's getting cold,—and listen to me, Jerry. I may have
                        been hard upon you: I hope I'll
                     take things easier; and it must be by-gones with both of us. You know you've
                     often plagued me more than enough to make me sharp; but I mean to alter: so you
                     may keep from Ripplestone, so far as that goes. As to the tricks, as you call
                     them, they're done in every mill; and I suppose some millers go to heaven."
                  "None as cheats and thieves will, millers or millers," said Jerry. "Parson Hope
                     said as good in sermon last Sunday; besides, it's in the Bible. I've often
                     minded it; but, when one goes on in a thing, one gets used to it like."
                  The day of account, the day after to-morrow,—was she to have this forced on her
                     by every one, even down to her half-daft man, as she had so often called him?
                     She pushed the basin to him in silence, and motioned him to eat, while she sat
                     considering what answer to make.
               
               
                  CHAPTER X.
                  GOOD SOWING AND GLAD REAPING.
                  HARDLY a fortnight had passed since Miss Hornbeck's disastrous "day after
                     to-morrow," when Molly Martin presented herself at Mr. Hope's house with her
                     usual merry face.
                  "Well, Molly," cried Mrs. Hope, who was busy scraping lint for Christopher
                     Hornbeck's wounds, "what brings you here? You haven't left the infirmary, have
                     you?"
                  "No, ma'am: I'm to stay another week; and, after that, there won't be extra
                     help wanted. But I've come to say that Miss Hornbeck isn't going to turn us out of the cottages: she says,
                     while they are hers, we sha'n't be disturbed," said Molly.
                  "That's right: any more good news? Your face looks quite full of pleasant
                     things," said Mrs. Hope.
                  "Yes, ma'am: the gentleman as I nursed has been so good as to order the doctor
                     to pay me two shillings a week for life; and he's going to put it in his will,
                     in case I live the longest."
                  "Come, that is good indeed: any thing else?"
                  "Yes, ma'am, the best of all. A poor man, badly wounded, was on his way to
                     Hancock, to bring me news of my poor son. He was a convict with him; and, his
                     time being out, he came home. But, if I hadn't been in the 'firmary, I should
                     never have been the better for it: for the poor fellow died last night; and it
                     was only by nows and thens he was sensible. And when I was put into the ward to
                     nurse, he heard me called Mrs. Martin: and he saw I'd got but one eye; and he
                     says to me, in a minute, in a whisper, "Haven't you had a son a convict?" And
                     then he told me that my poor boy had died a true penitent believer, and had
                     begged him, when his time was up, to see me, and say he had prayed for me on
                     his dying bed, and that we was sure to meet in the kingdom; for the merciful
                     Lord had blessed his punishment to him, and given him true repentance: and I
                     was to comfort myself that my prayers and teaching of him had not been lost. He
                     told it me bit by bit," said Molly, who was herself often interrupted by her
                     motherly feeling in repeating the story.
                  "You know, ma'am, it was bad company led him away: he told his friend and
                     everybody about him, to mind to look well how the company they was in was
                     leading them. 'Mine would have taken me to destruction; but God stopped me, and
                     sent me to this place, to bring me
                     to my senses:' that was the way he talked."
                  "This is indeed the best of all," said Mrs. Hope. "What are the few years yet
                     left to you compared with the eternal rest and joy which you now look forward
                     to sharing with him?"
                  "Ay, ma'am, ay! what indeed?" said Molly, wiping away her tears of mingled
                     sadness and delight. "And please, ma'am, is it true Master Kit is here?"
                  "Quite true, and badly wounded," said Mrs. Hope.
                  "The gentleman I nursed was very friendly with the doctor; and I heard the
                     doctor say as much, and say he'd come to turn Miss Jenny out of the mill. But
                     my gentleman talked a deal about it; and, by what I understood, he thought he
                     couldn't do it," said Molly.
                  "Mr. Kays says differently, I believed, Molly; but the cause will be tried, and
                     settled; and I hope, for your sake, Miss Hornbeck won't be turned out."
                  "So do I, for her mother's sake: unless it's for her soul's good; and that her
                     mother would have been that first to wish for and care for," said Molly.
                  "Haw!" interrupted Miss. Jenny, who had been ushered in without any noise, the
                     whole household having learnt to move and speak in muffled tones since
                     Christopher's advent there.
                  Molly was doubtful if her words had been heard: but, if they had, they were
                     true; and what harm could come of truth?
                  "I'm come to see Kit, if it's convenient to you and Mr. Hope," said the lady
                     miller rather abruptly.
                  Molly withdrew; and Mrs. Hope led the way to the study, and left her visitor
                     there.
                  Miss Jenny took the seat placed for her, looked up at the ceiling, round the
                     room, across the table, and at length fixed her eyes on Mr. Hope.
                  
                  "I've led a nice life of it lately," she said, in a trembling voice.
                  "Yes, you must have gone through some painful anxiety. I hoped to see you here
                     before this, my friend, to have a kind meeting with the sufferer
                     up-stairs."
                  "It was no manner of good to come before I was able to forgive him," said Miss
                     Jenny.
                  "None at all; and therefore"—said Mr. Hope.
                  "That's what I've come for now," said Miss. Jenny.
                  "I rejoice,—I do, indeed: he is better, quite able to bear the meeting. Shall
                     we go up at once?"
                  "You might tell him, as far as that goes," said Miss Jenny: "but
                     I've got a word to say to him besides; and I should like you to be by."
                  Miss Jenny stood at the bedside, and looked for some seconds on her
                     half-brother; he reminded her so strongly of her father, when he was on his
                     dying bed, when she had promised to attend to all his wishes, that she had some
                     difficulty in speaking.
                  "Kit, I forgive you, whether you turn me out or not," she said, with a
                     spasmodic effort, and a look of relief after; as much as to say,
                        "That's done."—"And mind, I own I haven't been kind to you, and
                     that offering to take the boy wasn't enough. I promised father to do handsomely
                     for you in some way; and now it's come back on me. If I'd looked for this day,
                     we might have been friends; and you'd never have thought of hurting me: but
                     it's too late now. Lawyer Kays thinks maybe you'll get the best of it: and what
                     I want now is, that you'll promise, if you do, never to turn out the widows;
                     and likewise to do something for Price of the Stone; and to do well by Jerry
                     Miffler, who has been faithful to me, and will be faithful to you, if you're an
                     honest miller."
                  
                  This was all Miss Jenny's demand; and, having finished, she waited the sick
                     man's answer.
                  It was faintly given in the affirmative.
                  "Promise it fair before Mr. Hope and me," she said; "and I can tell you, Kit,
                     it's worth more than the mill to keep your promise. You'll have to do it
                     afterwards, in a way you'll never forget, maybe, if you dare to try and break
                     it."
                  The promise was renewed; but Mr. Hope, glad at heart as he was to hear Miss
                     Jenny's words, put little confidence in his promises. His unworthy conduct, so
                     vindictive and crafty, so unjust,—for he was trying to rob her on the strength
                     of a mere legal quibble,—made him quite distrustful of a guest whom he would
                     gladly see depart, when able, from under his hospitable roof.
                  "I am so glad, my friend," began Mr. Hope again, when they were once more in
                     the study.
                  "So am I: but I didn't do it to please you, though I give you thanks; for I owe
                     them in plenty. Haw!"
                  There was something so hearty in her tone, and so softened in her manner, that
                     Mr. Hope was much impressed, and felt sure thanks were owing to another and a
                     higher cause.
                  "I might as well tell you plain," she said, after a pause. "I see you're right;
                     and, though I don't mean to pretend I shall be satisfied if I'm turned out, I
                     shall do my best to bear it. I've deserved"—Here she broke down.
                  "My dear friend," said Mr. Hope, deeply affected, "we are all poor sinners, and
                     richly deserve any ills that may befall us."
                  "Not you, not you," she said, sobbing, "but me and Kit,—we are. And I wish
                     you'd speak to Kit about it: it doesn't do for me, that's as bad. He looked so
                     like poor father: it almost did for me, as I stood by him."
                  "I have spoken to him, and will again," said Mr. Hope. "And he has had our prayers; and
                     you must pray for him. I think you have learnt to pray."
                  Miss Jenny did not conceal all that had passed through her mind, and the
                     discipline and teaching she had received from the date of Mr. Hope's visit to
                     her, when she had found him straining his eyes under the iron lamp. She told
                     her tale in her blunt way, but plainly enough, and with sufficient feeling to
                     show him that she had not been taught and exercised in vain.
                  "Well, Miss Hornbeck, if the law goes against you, never mind: we will help you
                     to fight through. Fellowship in the gospel is the very strongest of all bonds;
                     and you will have a right to the active sympathy of all your friends," Mr. Hope
                     said, as he led her from the door. This, however kind, was not consoling to
                     Miss Jenny, whose independent mind rejected the thought of resting on others
                     for subsistence.
                  "If I do lose? Well, haw!" she exclaimed, striding homewards.
                  One thing much perplexed her. If the case was tried, and went against her, she
                     would have incurred a great expense when she was unable to meet it. She was
                     sometimes tempted to throw up her case as hopeless, so very unpromising had
                     been Lawyer Kays's tone.
                  Mr. Hope had many affairs on his mind. The sudden crash at Mr. Flood's had
                     filled him with perplexity,—so many little tradesmen who had implicitly trusted
                     the poor man came to him in great distress, to know where they were to look for
                     redress. Friends, who had flocked to the hospitable mansion in the days of
                     sunshine, disappeared like summer flies when the chill of ruin came over
                     it.
                  Very few were found to respond to the call for sympathy and assistance. Willing
                     and energetic as he was in seeking such, he found in the good doctor and
                     himself the only substantial helpers.
                  
                  This business divided his attention with that of Miss. Hornbeck; and he was
                     busy poring over the bills of creditors, to see what ought to be first and most
                     fully discharged, when Mary announced "A gentleman."
                  Molly's old patient entered the study, and introduced himself as uncle to Mrs.
                     Flood.
                  The first few minutes were taken up in expressions of gratitude for the
                     kindness Mr. Hope had shown to the widow and the orphans; and then followed an
                     account of their prospects, and a discussion as to what could be done for
                     them.
                  After a considerable time had been thus occupied, the visitor said, "I have
                     been interesting myself for another parishioner of yours since I have been in
                     town,—one Miss. Hornbeck."
                  "Have you, indeed?" said Mr. Hope anxiously.
                  "You had been so very kind in my niece's affairs, that I took a leaf from the
                     doctor's book, and thought one good turn deserved another: so I went to a
                     barrister of my acquaintance, to be satisfied on a point which would, I felt
                     sure, settle the case."
                  Mr. Hope was all attention.
                  "The fellow who is plaintiff has waited till the last minute to give the
                     notice, and then has gone into a law-court to recover. Now, the question is one
                     of equity, not law. I saw that from the first (I was brought up to the law, and
                     should have followed it; but I was too nervous and irritable: but I always was,
                     and still am, fond of it). Now, there can be no trial of an equity case in a
                     law-court: so he'll get no verdict, of course; and he's too late to go into
                     equity, now the statute of limitation is passed."
                  Mr. Hope was delighted. He made his guest repeat his words, till he had clearly
                     taken in their meaning, and then asked if he would have any objection to accompany him to Mr.
                     Kays.
                  "None at all; but, even if he does not see the thing, it is no less true."
                  As they were leaving the house, Mr. Hope said, "I should like to let Miss
                     Hornbeck know: I should have such pleasure in telling her. I will send and ask
                     her to come down."
                  The tinker, who had just been operating on a tin pan, and was packing, up to
                     depart, made him a low bow, as he paused to think of a messenger; for Thomas
                     was out, and Mary and the other maid were busy in the house. Sixpence would be
                     very acceptable to the little man, he felt sure: so he despatched him, with his
                     compliments, to Miss Hornbeck, and a request to her to be at his house as soon
                     as she conveniently could.
                  Mr. Kays was at his office; and, when Mr. Hope introduced Mrs. Flood's uncle,
                     concluding that it was about the affairs of that family, he said, "I shall be
                     happy to speak to you, sir; but I must first tell Mr. Hope of something that
                     will greatly interest him."
                  "About Miss Hornbeck?" inquired Mr. Hope quickly.
                  "Yes, about Miss Hornbeck. In this case,—a most inquitous one—the plaintiff has
                     overreached himself. Supposing him really entitled to the property, his remedy
                     would have been in the court of chancery: and, as twenty years have elapsed, it
                     is too late for him to take further measures: therefore, if he pursues the case
                     in a law-court, he will be non-suited."
                  Mr. Hope exchanged triumphant glances with his companion, and related the cause
                     of their visit.
                  Mr. Kays smiled. "I suspected that it must be so. But it is not a common case,
                     and I did not wish to raise false hopes: therefore I have taken measures to be
                     secure on the point, and have
                     informed the plaintiff's solicitor of the result; and he has decided on
                     withdrawing from the case," said Mr. Kays.
                  "I wonder at that; for he must be a terrible rogue to have gone into it at all:
                     and he would have got his expenses, whatever the end might be."
                  "He would have charged them; but his only chance of payment was out of the
                     estate. Hornbeck has next to nothing: so he would have had his trouble for his
                     pains," said Mr. Kays. "I have but this minute received his decision, and was
                     going up to the mill, to carry the good news to my client."
                  Hearing that the lady miller was expected at the vicarage, Mr. Kays, after
                     further discourse on the subject, walked home with Mr. Hope and his friend.
                  The little tinker was so alert in carrying his summons, and Miss Jenny in
                     obeying it, that she met them at the vicarage door. She read good news in their
                     faces,—at least, in that of Mr. Hope. Mr. Kays's face never betrayed much of
                     his feelings.
                  "So you see, madam, your fears are at an end; and at a very trifling cost you
                     are delivered from any further anxiety," said Mr. Kays.
                  "You said, lawyer, if Kit lost, the expense would be on him," said Miss Jenny,
                     her black eyes fixed on him with less joy than Mr. Hope had expected to see in
                     them.
                  "If he had proceeded, and said lost, certainly," said Mr. Kays. "But he will
                     not proceed: therefore, through his mistake, you are spared both trouble and
                     the risk of loss; and I hope you are satisfied."
                  Miss Jenny liked justice: and she thought, for the moment, that Kit ought to
                     pay for her consultations with Lawyer Kays, and any other items in the bill she
                     must expect from his office; which, although a trifling cost in his eyes, would be another thing in
                     hers, she suspected. But she got over the demur without giving utterance to it,
                     and declared she was very glad it was so well over.
                  "You don't seem so rejoiced as I should have expected, my friend," said Mr.
                     Hope, when the lawyer and Mrs. Flood's uncle had returned to the office on the
                     business of the widow and the orphans.
                  "Haw!" she replied, "I am glad enough for all that; but"—
                  "But what?" asked Mr. Hope, a little surprised.
                  "Oh, it's nothing I can talk much about! but does Kit know?"
                  "No: we have but just been told; and it must be broken to him quietly."
                  "Best leave me to tell him," she said, without any triumph in her tone or
                     manner.
                  "As you please, my friend: bad news is no light burden to carry to any one; he
                     will doubtless hear from his solicitor. Will you leave it till then?"
                  "No: I'll go up now, please. Haw!" said Miss Jenny.
                  Mr. Hope could not understand her, but, not feeling at liberty to make any
                     further opposition, once more accompanied her up-stairs.
                  "I'd best see him by himself," she said bluntly. And Mr. Hope withdrew.
                  "Kit, there's my hand: forget and forgive," she began. "You've lost: the
                     lawyers up in London have settled it; but all the better for you, as well as
                     me. The mill would never have done you good, got that way, mind that. And now I
                     promise you, that, if you behave as you ought, I'll leave all I'm worth to your
                     boy; and I'll have him here, to learn the business; and I'll be friends with
                     you wherever I can. There!"
                  She extended her hand; but Hornbeck angrily declared he did not and would
                        not believe in the decision of
                     the London lawyers, and refused his hand.
                  "Haw!" said Miss Jenny: "you mind. Kit, you'll be sorry for it; but I'll do
                     well by the boy and for you, as I promised father I would. I won't lay up more
                     burdens for myself, if I know it: so you can let me know when you've come to a
                     better mind."
                  She stood for a minute, to see if he would relent; but, no signs appearing, she
                     stalked down stairs, and knocked at the study-door.
                  "Can't bring him to believe me, nor to be friends. Never mind: he'll have to
                     believe, and he'll have to be friends. Let him be a little. I'm glad I forgave
                     him before I knew he couldn't hurt me."
                  She then briefly related what had passed.
                  From that time, Miss Hornbeck of the Four Meadows' Mill was a
                     gradually-improving character. The change in her principle of action had been
                     indeed immediate. The kindling of heavenly, as of earthly light is
                     instantaneous; but conversion of heart does not always at once show itself in
                     conversion of life. When, at what precise moment, the Almighty Spirit had said
                     "Live!" she did not know: but the word had been spoken; and she lived feebly,
                     as an infant at first, but growing up into a goodly stature before she was
                     carried from the Four Meadows' Mill, in an honored old age, to be laid beside
                     that mother whose prayers had so constantly arisen for her soul's
                     salvation.
                  She always dated her new life, when she was old enough in grace to see that she
                     really was alive to God through Jesus Christ, from that day of days when" she
                     had gone through such troubles from the fear of to-morrow, and never forgot one
                     of those who had been then instrumental in her change. Price's daughter-in-law
                     she had no love for; but she made a
                     right recompense to Price, though he had gone to Hickleton to plot against
                     her.
                  As to the widows, nothing would have induced her to turn them out. On the
                     contrary, she added certain privileges to their homes, thinking within herself
                     that she owed it to Molly's prayers. She gave all her tinning work to the
                     little tinker, and interested herself in his behalf: so that, as he richly
                     deserved employment, he was soon able to take an improved dwelling of her near
                     the mill, at an equally "manageable" rent, and became in time her very useful
                     factotum and stanch ally, helping Jerry's hands with his brains, and
                     strengthening him in those principles which had been nearly stifled by his
                     mistress's former influence,—an influence turned the other way, now that she
                     was no longer a harsh mistress nor a dishonest miller.
                  So far, so good. The affairs of poor Mr. Flood, after causing endless trouble,
                     cost, and perplexity to his friends, were arranged as well as they could be,
                     though not to the satisfaction of the widow; who, to the end of her life,
                     fretted over the mortifications and privations entailed upon her by her own and
                     her poor husband's neglect of common honesty, in providing for to-morrow, when
                     God had placed the means of doing so before them.
                  Mr. Hope, as his day drew nearer to its close, became more and more in earnest
                     to redeem the time.
                  "Sure the parson never gives himself any rest: the older he gets, the harder he
                     works," said Jerry to Wood. "He's give notice of another prayer-meeting."
                  "He works more than he needs," said Wood, who did not greatly sympathize with
                     the increasing religious movement: "I don't know what he can be thinking
                     of."
                  "Don't you? Then I'll tell you," said Miss Jenny, who had entered the mill unperceived: "he's thinking of what
                     you'd better think more of yourself, Wood; and that is, the day after
                     to-morrow. Haw!"
               
            
            
               SINGED BY THE FIRE.
               
               SINGED BY THE FIRE.
               
                  CHAPTER I.
                  THE DEPARTURE.
                  SO you be to lose your Jenny? Well, I hopes, for one, she'll be happy; for
                     she's a good lass and no mistake. I don't know a betterer,—nor indeed as good,
                     for the matter of that."
                  "Thank'ee kindly for saying so, Mary: thee be always ready to put up a good
                     word for a neighbor, whenever thee canst; I may truly say that of thee. Yes,
                     Jane be a good lass; and I shall miss her sore, I shall: she be so handy and sharp-like, and as
                     ready in heart as in deed. But there: thee knows I have five more on 'em to
                     feed, and bring up. And it's a niceish sort of a offer I have had for Jenny,
                     who's getting up into a big girl now, and old enough to be a keeping of
                     herself, if not helping us a bit too: so I didn't go for to refuse; though for
                     sure, it's a long way off, it is."
                  "How old be she? I forget."
                  "She be seventeen the twenty-fourth come this July. She have always looked a
                     deal younger than she be, 'cause she never grow'd much till quite late like;
                     then she took to starting away wonderful, she did, and overtook, and for the
                     matter of that overtopped me in no time. And now I hopes she'll stop: for she's
                     rin up high enough for health and use; and that's all poor folks need care
                     for."
                  "Yes, that's all indeed. I don't like them long girls: there's no heart or
                     gumpshion in 'em, as we may say; and they tire in no time."
                  The foregoing conversation took place between two respectably-dressed
                     countrywomen, Mrs. Grove and Widow Bennet, while plodding leisurely home on a
                     Sunday evening from a little chapel in one of the picturesque towns of South
                     Wales. A stream of persons were also wending their way up the beautiful hill
                     overlooking the magnificent ruins of the ancient castle. They had been
                     attending the time-honored preaching of their venerable minister, the reverend
                     David Selkirk, and were now retracing the oft-trodden path to their village
                     home, a mile distant from their place of worship.
                  So well and deservedly loved was the good old Mr. Selkirk, that few of his
                     flock would have allowed any but the most stringent reasons to hinder their
                     presence at the sanctuary. Come wet or dry, cold or heat, no house of God held
                     each sabbath a goodlier show of earnest, honest faces, than did this same
                        chapel. "If you would save the
                     souls, win the hearts of your flock," was a favorite saying, as it was the
                     constant endeavor, of their worthy minister.
                  "How be's Sukey now? I hain't seen her a long spell. Be she coming round at
                     all, dost thee think?" asked the first speaker, Mrs. Grove.
                  "Oh, no! poor daft thing!" responded the widow with a sigh: "she be as witless
                     as ever. The doctor says as how she'll never be no better; nor I am sure she
                     ever will. Ah, me! if thee was but to see her sometimes: she do laugh and sing,
                     and talk and hop, and make no end of Mag's diversions; and, oh, dear! I do wish
                     she would hop into t'other world, I do." Widow Bennet said this in a tone of
                     pity, not of intentional irreverence.
                  "Oh, but, Mary!" gently interposed her companion, "it bain't right to say that.
                     The Lord gave: don't thee forget; and, though it hath not pleased him yet to
                     take away again, still it behooves thee to say all the same, 'Blessed be the
                     name of the Lord!' 'Thy will be done.'"
                  "Ay, ay; for sure thee be right, Hannah," sighed the poor mother. "But 'deed I
                     was not murmuring against God's providence: our good minister have discoorsed
                     too well to us about that for me to go and fly in his face, as you may say,
                     directly after; but when I watch that simple critter, and think of her, and
                     what's to become of her when I be gone,—which I may any day, for thee knowest
                     my heart bain't all right, the doctor said,—I do wish truly she was in that
                     blessed land afore me, where I hopes my John is, and where I prays to go to
                     myself when I leaves this world."
                  "Talking of the minister's discourse," rejoined Mrs. Grove, after a few
                     minutes, silence, "have thee any notions, Mary, what it was he particular
                     alluded to when he spoke so beautiful about children a loving and a helping
                        of their parents, and providing
                     for 'em in their old age? and he said, did'st thee mind? how things on that
                     subject had come to his knowledge which had made his old heart glow with the
                     fire of youth again, and his eyes to weep tears of joy,—ay, tears of joy!"
                  "No: I've not the faintest bit of notion," replied Widow Bennet.
                  "Well, if thee will bide, and take a dish of tea with me, thee'll be sure to
                     hear what 'twas from my good man; for he stopped behind, to give his arm to our
                     schoolmaster, who have hurt his foot somehow, and can get along but badly. My
                     Jim, he's always ready, he is, to give a help to any that needs it."
                  "Ah! that he be, and the both of thee, as I know to my comfort. Howsomedever, I
                     can't stop to-night; for Jane Price and me takes it by turns a Sundays to stay
                     and take care of each other's bairns, she bringing her'n to my home, and I
                     taking mine to her'n; and she will be wanting to get back to have tea ready for
                     her Bill."
                  At that instant, two young men passed the speakers of apparently the ages of
                     one and two and twenty, sturdy-looking, well-made lads, whose open, honest
                     countenances were heart-cheering to see, as they turned to greet the widow and
                     her friend with a frank "Good-evening, Mrs. Grove; good-evening, Mrs.
                     Bennet."
                  "Wishing you both the same, John and Harry Brock," responded the women.
                  Now, it was about these two young men that Jim Grove had got from the
                     schoolmaster the key to the minister's allusion in the sermon of that evening,
                     and which had puzzled the majority of the congregation, as well as our friends
                     Mrs. Grove and Widow Bennet. The Brocks were the sons of honest, hard-working,
                     God-fearing parents; who having brought up their five children, three of whom
                     were girls, to follow the same path
                     they had trodden themselves, were now justly reaping that harvest of earthly
                     reward which in a greater or lesser degree seldom fails of blessings the latter
                     days of such parents.
                  Some six or eight years previous to the Sunday commencing our narrative, the
                     two Brocklads, then little more than mere boys, conceived the magnanimous
                     scheme of earning or saving, by every means in their power, a sum of money
                     sufficient to purchase a couple of good-sized, comfortable cottages, the which
                     to present to their parents as a final resting-place and provision for their
                     old age, living in one themselves, and receiving rent for the other. To carry
                     out this truly noble project, the lads devoted every spare hour to labor; and,
                     as the farmers round the country were only too willing to engage for any time
                     the strong, ready hands of the well-known honest young Brocks, there was soon
                     no lack of employment for all their spare time. So it was, therefore, little by
                     little, to a fast increasing extent, that amazed while it delighted the boys
                     themselves, the hoarded sum accumulated marvellously; and at last, for of
                     course their gains increased with their advancing age, the required amount was
                     complete, and the purchases made.
                  One friend and adviser they had from the beginning taken into their confidence,
                     and made their banker; viz., the good old minister, Mr. Selkirk. Not that he
                     retained the sum in his own possession; for directly he could do so, he placed
                     it in the savings bank, thereby causing more to grow out of the little store.
                     As the whole proceeding approached its termination, Mr. Selkirk obtained,
                     through the interest of his numerous friends, sufficient furniture to
                     comfortably fit up the two houses, and stock for the garden appertaining to
                     that designed for the old couple. Words cannot describe the gratitude and
                     astonishment of the parents, who had
                     throughout been kept in total ignorance of the blessing awaiting them, when one
                     bright warm morning they were put in possession of their new and pretty
                     cottage, and the rent receipts for the other, to be theirs for the remainder of
                     their well-spent lives.
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  THE NEW HOME.
                  THE day of Jane's departure arrived; and, although possessed of a brave, strong
                     heart, the girl's spirit naturally sank somewhat at thought of the distance,
                     with all its intervening variety of town and country, land, water, hill, and
                     dale, which would stretch away betwixt the tranquil, happy abode of her
                     childhood and girlhood and her future unknown home. She had been piously
                     brought up; and many were the warnings and much the advice now bestowed upon
                     her by both parents, to keep that fear of God before her eyes, and his law in her heart
                     and in her practice, which they had lovingly and prayerfully taught her.
                  The sun shone brightly, as, with tearful eyes, she stood at their cottage-door,
                     waiting for the small cart to convey her and her humble box to the station.
                     Never before had the sweet view, extending far and near around the loved place
                     of her birth, seemed so beautiful in her eyes as at this moment, when on the
                     point of quitting it, perhaps for years. Days after, the quiet hillside on
                     which stood their cottage; the bright valley beneath, its sparkling brook and
                     fields and peaceful cattle; and all the numerous rural charms of scene and
                     sound,—haunted her memory, in painful contrast with the crowded streets, and
                     the ceaseless stir and strife, of the great bewildering town-world in which for
                     the first time she found herself.
                  But young natures are very pliable, and quickly learn to accommodate themselves to
                        Jenny leaving home for her place.—Page 290.
                     
                      every variety of circumstance. In a
                     brief while, therefore, Jenny regained that happy joyousness of temper for
                     which she was always remarkable; and the first strangeness and discomfort of
                     her situation wore off.
                  Certainly her new home was admirably calculated to restore this peaceful state
                     of feeling; for a constant glow of contentment and good humor pervaded it, from
                     the drawing-room to the kitchen. The family consisted of her master and
                     mistress, Mr. and Mrs. Carpenter; four children,—two little girls of eight and
                     six years of age, a boy about four years old, a younger child; and two
                     servants. As might be supposed, the establishment denoted but limited means;
                     and so it was. Mr. Carpenter, the cashier of a branch bank, realized a salary
                     of three hundred a year; which, with fifty pounds a year of his wife's,
                     comprised the whole of their income. With skilful management, however, they
                     gathered around them an amount of
                     comfort, with occasional luxury, which many far richer, but ill-managing, did
                     not possess. Their happily constituted dispositions inclined them to cheerfully
                     make the most of that they had, and, in another sense, little of that they had
                     not; by which I mean, they gathered and enjoyed the fruits, without repining at
                     the unavoidable thorns. None could be kinder or more considerate to Jenny
                     during the first stage of her ignorance that was Mrs. Carpenter and the two
                     servants; one of whom was to leave in a week to be married, and whose thus
                     vacated place Jenny came to fill. Conjointly they endeavored to instruct her in
                     the ways of the house, and the duties of her situation; by which means she was
                     tolerably well able to enter upon them unaided at the expiration of the week,
                     and to render herself generally useful.
                  Of Mr. Carpenter she saw little: he left directly after their early breakfast,
                     and did not return until the tea-time, six o'clock, his dinner being partaken
                     of at an eating-house near the bank; which latter was too considerable a
                     distance from the quarter of the town where his house was situated to admit of
                     his going and returning in the middle of the day. His rap at the door in the
                     evening was instantly recognized by his expectant little ones; and the whole
                     household as unmistakably informed on the point by the jubilant exclamations in
                     every variety of childish tone, from Annie the eldest girl, to baby Alfred.
                     "Oh! there's papa! there's papa!" was accompanied by a rush and clatter of
                     small feet, succeeded by the jumpings and huggings in the passage, and further
                     endearing expletives, as the door closed on the equally delighted father. Even
                     little Alfred was permitted, by request of papa, to remain up until he came
                     home, and then with a few minutes' game of play and a hearty kiss was dismissed
                     to bed; Teddy, the four-year-old, following half an hour after.
                  
                  Well, thus much for the bright side of Jane's first situation.
                  My readers will doubtless think it impossible there could be a dark side to a
                     house and people encircled, as it were, with such a radiance of love, peace,
                     competence, and contentment; but there was a very dark side, dark as the total
                     absence of the Sun could render it,—that Sun that alone can bring true light
                     and life into the world and into a home.
                  Jenny's amazement was great, when, expecting the evening summons to family
                     prayer, she was informed by Hannah, the servant who was soon to leave, that no
                     such custom was pursued in the house; that, in fact, religion formed no part of
                     the duties or pleasures of the day, and that even Sunday brought no exception.
                     Mrs. Carpenter scarcely ever went to church, for she could not, she said, leave
                     the children; but Mr. Carpenter attended it occasionally in the afternoon, not
                     in the morning, being too glad of this one weekly opportunity of allowing
                     himself a couple of hours longer in bed. Jenny could not help thinking, that,
                     if he did not, on the same principle, allow himself to stay up a couple of
                     hours later the night before, he would not require the sluggard's time in the
                     precious morning. But she did not say so; and a strange chill fell upon her
                     heart as, the communicative Hannah, who chatted away, not with any feeling or
                     intention of censure, but from a love of taking, further told her, "She had
                     thought a deal of religion herself when first she came to the house, three
                     years ago; for she was Welsh, and her parents had brought her up to be pious.
                     But somehow she had got out of it all now; for as master and mistress didn't
                     seem to trouble about it, and did very well all the same,—for there couldn't be
                     a better master or mistress than they were, and good schollards too,—why, she
                     saw no call for her troubling about it, either; and so she didn't."
                  
                  "And the children," faltered Jenny,—"those four dear little children. Does
                     not"—
                  "Oh, no!" interposed Hannah, "no one troubles about their religion, either.
                     When first I came, mistress bid me hear them their prayers morning and evening;
                     and I did for a bit: but, dear me! it was such labor to make 'em do it. And, as
                     their mamma never knew or seemed to care whether they said any or not, I came
                     to think, Why should I care, either? They wasn't my children, you see; and
                     their being pious or not was no concern of mine: so I gave that up too. And now
                     they never say any."
                  "And we servants," questioned Jenny, her young heart sinking lower and lower:
                     "aren't we let go to chapel, either?"
                  "Oh, yes!" replied Hannah, laughing gayly at the sight of her distressed face:
                     "you will not be required to go; you may do as you like about that. But you
                     will be allowed your turn to do so every Sunday, either morning or evening, as
                     you and cook choose to settle it between you."
                  This assurance comforted the poor girl somewhat; and, as she pursued her work,
                     she inwardly resolved that every day, as long as she remained in the house, the
                     sweet little children should, the first thing and the last, raise their young
                     voices, their hearts, and souls in prayer and praise to the great God who made
                     and so mercifully preserved and blessed them: and Jenny was as good as her
                     mentally registered word. She slept in the nursery, its care devolving
                     principally upon her; and remembering how in early youth the word and the love
                     of God had been, instilled into her mind, she spared no favoring opportunity of
                     imparting to the little creatures, who were scarce less simple-natured than
                     herself, the divine truths she had learned to reverence.
                  At first she naturally encountered some opposition on the part of her lively charge, and
                     a good deal of difficulty in fixing their attention, and exciting their
                     interest: but they were amiable, manageable children; and, as by degrees their
                     love increased for her, so did their wish to please her. And, at the expiration
                     of the commencing year of her service, she joyfully thanked God on her inmost
                     soul, that her labors were even now blessed with more than the success she
                     dared to hope for. Of course the parents were soon aware of this spiritual
                     anxiety for her nurslings manifested by Jenny; but, as in every instance her
                     conduct fully bore out the sincerity of her principles, it served to enhance
                     yet more the good opinion already entertained of her by Mr. and Mrs.
                     Carpenter.
                  Every fortnight, according to a promise required of her by her father and
                     mother previous to her leaving home, Jenny wrote to them, giving an account of
                     all her doings, alluding no further to the actions or concerns of others than
                     as necessary links in the chain of her narration; this latter restriction upon
                     her pen being earnestly enjoined by her parents.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER III.
                  A MYSTERIOUS STRANGER.
                  ONE day Mrs. Carpenter was out walking with her three eldest children. Jenny
                     was sitting sewing in the nursery, having just laid baby Alfred, wearied with
                     play, fast asleep in his crib, when Martha the cook came in, wearing a very
                     mysterious, but withal amused face.
                  "I say, Jenny, what do you think," she began in a low tone, after giving a
                     satisfied glance at the sleeping child, and advancing close to Jenny, "while I
                     was at the hall-door polishing the bell-handle and plates, up comes a gentleman
                     to me,—such a queerlooking man, with a whole lot of hair and whiskers on his
                     face. He was a gentleman, through, because he had gold rings and chains, and
                     dressed so smart! So he began talking about master and mistress, and asking
                     ever so many questions. They were very handsome, were they not? and mistress
                     was very fond of dress, was she not? and fond of pleasure, too, both of them?
                     And so he went on with lots of things of that sort, and which I had no notion
                     how to answer. However, I spoke civil to him; and, after a good deal more, he
                     went away."
                  "I wouldn't have spoke civil to him," replied Jenny disapprovingly,—"leastways,
                     I wouldn't have answered a stranger like that at all. What business is it of
                     his what master or mistress like or don't like? And, as to his gold chains and
                     dress, it isn't dress that makes a gentleman."
                  
                  Martha would no doubt have entertained the same opinion as Jenny about a
                     stranger asking such questions, had not the "gentleman," as she called him,
                     anticipating some such proceeding on her part, provided against it by first
                     skilfully talking of herself and her good looks,—with which latter she was very
                     moderately endowed,—winding up by presenting her with half a crown to buy a
                     pretty cap. From that, he, unobserved by the flattered Martha, quietly merged
                     into matters touching Mr. and Mrs. Carpenter; which she answered to the best of
                     her ability. It was not until his departure she became conscious of how much he
                     had talked of, and how far she had improperly entered into, the private affairs
                     of her master and mistress; but all this she kept to herself.
                  Jenny knew that her handsome young mistress was very fond of dress; that her
                     great weakness was a love of fine clothes and jewelry; and, if her good sense
                     and wifely feelings had not mastered this inclination, she might often have
                     been tempted into gratifying it, to the great inconvenience, if not positive
                     injury, of her husband's limited means. And this would have been the more easy;
                     for Mr. Carpenter, who was as proud as he was fond of his amiable wife, knowing
                     her predilections on that point, frequently pressed upon her the purchase of
                     dresses and ornaments, which he saw she was wisely and properly rejecting, in
                     preference to those which were less showy but more useful.
                  "Well, don't you go to say any thing to missis about it," pursued Martha, in
                     reply to Jenny's grave observation. "I didn't mean any harm, you know, in what
                     I said; nor was there any harm in what he asked, for the matter of that; nor
                     any harm either in missus being fond of pleasure and dress, if she is so, or of
                     my saying he was, if I knew it; which I don't."
                  
                  "Oh, no!" Jenny said, "of course I shall not go for to repeat any such
                     nonsense; but another time, Martha, were I you, I would just say to anybody who
                     came and asked questions about master or mistress, that you had no time to
                     waste in talking, and then leave them straight away."
                  "Yes; to be sure, that would be that right style to treat 'em in," responded
                     cook;" and that's just what I'll do," adding to herself, as she descended the
                     stairs, "unless they crosses my hand first with a half-crown:" and she smiled
                     gayly to herself.
                  Two months from that day, three months, and Jenny could no longer resist the
                     conviction that something,—an indefinable something—had come over the spirit of
                     the house. A scarce perceptible shade—a shadow—was darkening more and more the
                     brightness of its sunny side. Then, by degrees, the mystery, for so she felt it
                     to be, assumed more tangible forms.
                  An expression of anxious thought and care began to mark its presence in deep
                     lines and curves across and around the before smooth, unclouded brow and mouth
                     of her kind mistress. And not only in her fair face did it declare itself, but
                     in the tones of her voice, in her look and manner. She was now seldom heard to
                     laugh; and a sad change had come over her once equable temper.
                  Martha also began to take note, "that some how," as she expressed it, "things
                     were not as they used to be;" and yet neither Jenny nor herself could detect in
                     whom this change originated, or by what it was caused. It was as though an
                     invisible evil spirit had entered the house, and was poisoning the once clear
                     atmosphere with the baleful influence of its presence.
                  Martha, who, having no higher object in view in the performance of her duty
                     than the pleasing an earthly master,
                     grew discontented and angry, now that failed, and took umbrage at the faults
                     found with her by her mistress; whose irritability of temper was shown about
                     trifling concerns, which before she would have rectified either with her own
                     hand or by gentle, cheerful advice. This irritability evidently sprang from a
                     deeper source than lay within the mere subject-matters of annoyance at the
                     moment.
                  Upon Jenny, these uncertain moods of her mistress, although they sorrowed her
                     heart to see and feel, wrought not the slightest difference in her respectful
                     conduct towards her, nor in her duties of any kind. The last text she, at her
                     mother's desire, learned to repeat to her, ere leaving her beloved home, was,
                     "Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and
                     gentle, but also to the forward" (1 Peter ii. 18). Now surely was the time, if
                     ever, to bring such a text to bear on her life and conduct.
                  Upon Mr. Carpenter, likewise, had the mysterious change wrought its strange
                     effects, but not in the same way as in his wife. He did not seem saddened or
                     nervous, as was her case; but all trace of that gay, light-hearted look and
                     bearing, before so pleasant to witness, was gone. The frank, friendly,
                     outspeaking tone and manner, whose kindly greeting cheered every living thing
                     within his house, was gone also; and now had gathered in their stead a grave,
                     thoughtful, taciturn, but withal restless, excited manner, that appeared to
                     utterly unfit him for the enjoyment of those domestic pleasures he had been
                     wont to delight in. So it was, therefore, that although the children still
                     hearkened and waited for his evening rap, and rushed down with glad warmth to
                     meet and greet him at the door, the answering welcome did not satisfy their
                     loving natures as it used to do. It was now generally hasty, and often mingled
                     with an impatience, not the result
                     of indifference, but of a preoccupied mind,—a mind engrossed by matters too
                     weighty to be thus lightly and easily cast off. No games of play followed his
                     return, as heretofore. "Papa had a headache, or was tired, or too busy this
                     evening," was one or other always now the alleged excuse; and certainly his
                     looks quite confirmed the truth of the assertion. All the disappointed young
                     things were consequently dismissed early to bed, thus terminating their bright
                     expectations. More and more rarely, too, did his wife, as of yore, beguile the
                     evening hours with music, in which, both as a vocal and instrumental performer,
                     she excelled; but long, low-spoken conversations now often occupied the time
                     until far into the night.
                  During the past month, on several occasions, to Martha's and also to Jenny's
                     extreme surprise, the acquaintance of the former of two months previously,—the
                     man with the hairy face and the gold rings,—again presented himself at the
                     door, and left sealed notes for Mr. Carpenter. On each of these deliveries, the
                     master had quitted the house immediately after tea, not returning until
                     midnight, his wife waiting up to let him in. On the first delivery of a note he
                     also left a card, bearing the name "Marsden."
                  "My persuasion is, they are getting deeper and deeper into debt and difficulty,
                     and that there'll be a smash and a general break-up afore long," Martha said,
                     as one afternoon the two servants sat at dinner, and were just then commenting
                     on the probable character of the singular-looking man who had that morning
                     again brought a note.
                  Jane's heart sank at these careless words of her companion; and she presently
                     answered in a faltering voice, that she as yet saw no reason for thinking so.
                     They did not seem a bit poorer than they had been: on the contrary, she should say, that, if any thing, they
                     were richer; for missus had just bought much handsomer dresses for herself and
                     the young ladies than she had ever done before, judging by the clothes they
                     possessed when she first came.
                  "Oh, that goes for nothing!" argued Martha, who was several years older than
                     Jane, and had seen a great deal of service in other places, previous to
                     entering her present one. "Folks often do such things when they know that
                     sooner or later it will be all up with them. "In for a penny, in for a pound,'
                     as the old saying has it, you know; and you may depend that's the principle
                     they are going upon."
                  Jenny's face glowed with indignation, for she had become much attached to her
                     handsome young mistress. "I don't, and I won't, depend on any thing of the
                     sort!" she exclaimed impetuously; "and I wonder, Martha, how you can think and
                     say such wicked things of such good, kind people! I am quite sure they would
                     never act in that way!"
                  "Hoity, toity! what a tragedy queen we are, to be sure!" said the amused
                     Martha;" and now just tell me this, you dear little innocent. If it's not that,
                     what is it? Don't you see, you silly, that, if it's not that, it must be worse?
                     Though, what that worse could possibly be, I must confess I've no notion
                     myself."
                  "I don't know, and I don't want to know," rejoined Jenny, trying to calm her
                     vehemence: "it's nothing to us, and we oughtn't to talk about it."
                  "But it will be a good deal to us, when some fine morning we find ourselves
                     suddenly on the wrong side of the house. However, I don't care for that,"
                     pursued Martha: "there are as good fish in the sea as have ever come out of it,
                     and I shall quickly find plenty as good places as this anywhere."
                  "I am quite sure I should not," sighed poor Jenny; "and I hope I shall never be
                     driven to try for it."
                  
                  "Oh! you will though, I can tell you; and much better too. Why, there are lots
                     of 'em, of the pious sort, you know, who would give any money for a servant
                     like you, made to their hand, as you may say. And look you here, Jenny: you
                     calls master and mistress good and kind. Well, as far as it suits their
                     interest, so they are, I grant you that. But stop a bit till you are in
                     trouble, or sick, and can't work as hard as usual, and overboard they'll bundle
                     you in no time, and there leave you to your fate,—yes, that would they,"
                     concluded cook, nodding her head knowingly.
                  "O Martha! how do you know?" exclaimed Jenny, with shocked wide-open eyes.
                  "Only too well. The girl who was in my placed before I came here, two years
                     ago, was turned away because the doctors said she had a heart-disease, that
                     made it bad for her to work too hard; and though she was a poor orphan, as they
                     knew, and had no friends, they packed her off at once. A year ago, I fell bad
                     with pleurisy, the doctor called it; and off they sent me to the hospital, and
                     never took any trouble to inquire about me, or send me a single little comfort
                     of any kind. Hannah good-naturedly filled my place for me here, till I was well
                     enough to come back again. I have always had a fancy like for your real pious
                     ones,—real, mind you, for there are sham pious: they are the only folks who,
                     after all, are sound at the core. I have no pretence for being good myself, but
                     I likes others that are; and 'twas this first made me. Years ago I lived with a
                     mistress whose place was worth keeping, and no mistake. She was one of your
                     really good sort. Nothing would have made her turn a poor girl into the street:
                     if she couldn't no ways keep her, she got her housed and cared for elsewhere,
                     and looked after her, like the good Christian she was. Oh! that's a place I've
                     always sorrowed for, and which my silly, proud temper lost me,—more fool
                     I!"
                  
                  This conversation left Jenny very sad-hearted. Although her master and mistress
                     were not of the "really good sort," as even Martha knew the difference, yet
                     they had been so kind to her, and were so amiable, that she could not help
                     loving them, and pitying them if there was any trouble upon them.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  A SHADOW OVER THE HOUSE.
                  DAYS and weeks came and went, but brought no lightening of the mysterious
                     cloud. On the contrary, its shadow deepened continually.
                  "Don't you think, Arthur dear," suggested the wife one evening, as her husband,
                     again disregarding the solicitations of his children to come this beautiful
                     weather and play with them in the garden, threw himself with an abstracted air
                     into a large chair, and with his feet thrust out, and his hands in his pockets,
                     thereby elevating his shoulders to his ears, sat gazing into vacancy,—"don't you think," she
                     repeated, lowering her voice, and, while looking markedly at him, emphasizing
                     her words, "that you might manage to-night, and occasionally, to play for a
                     short time with the children? They have all their lives been so accustomed to
                     it, you know; and—and I think you had better go on doing so, if for only once
                     in a way."
                  "Upon my honor I cannot, Fanny: I haven't got it in me. Those days are gone for
                     the present. The children must wait till they come again," exclaimed Arthur, in
                     a tone of impatience altogether new to him. "Well, there, come along," he
                     cried, suddenly bethinking him, and with a movement of impetuous recklessness
                     he sprang up, and, catching baby Alfred in his arms, strode to the door: "come
                     into the garden till tea is ready, and try who can run the fastest." A burst of
                     delight from all the little ones followed this proposal, as they sped
                     down-stairs and out. It was like a gleam of sunshine in a lowering, cloudy
                     sky.
                  On Mrs. Carpenter the change was daily telling more painfully; though, to all
                     eyes but her husband's, she strove with tolerable success to conceal the fact.
                     Every knock and ring at the door made her start, and tremble, and turn pale;
                     and a scared, frightened look came into her face, as of one who longed to run
                     away and hide,—she who was before so composed, so bright and fearless! The
                     bloom on her cheeks was fast losing its richness of hue, and her form its
                     rounded beauty. It was clear, if matters did not speedily return to their old
                     peaceful state, the young wife's health, as well as looks, would fall a
                     sacrifice to the influence of the evil spirit whose black wings were thus
                     darkening the once sunlit house.
                  One evening Jane—as had been her pious habit since her installation in the
                     nursery, in conjunction with her many household duties— was reading and explaining portions of the
                     Scriptures to the two girls, their little brothers being fast asleep in bed.
                     Her plan was to select a text, and, having read it, require one or other of her
                     young ladies to explain its meaning to her; after which performance on their
                     part, she would find out corresponding texts in various parts of the Bibles,
                     bearing upon the one first selected, and thereby show them how large a sense
                     was contained in every little sentence of holy writ. She was on the point of
                     reading, "But what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose
                     his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" when the door
                     softly opened, and Mrs. Carpenter came in. Jenny ceased reading, and instantly
                     stood up; but her mistress requested she would resume both seat and lesson. She
                     did not purpose staying long, she said: but Mr. Carpenter was out this evening;
                     and, feeling more than usually lonely, she thought she would come and see how
                     they were getting on in the nursery.
                  Poor lady! there was indeed a sad look in her pleasant face, and a listless,
                     melancholy tone in her voice, that went to Jenny's tender heart to hear. But of
                     course she could say nothing, and presently continued her Bible instructions,
                     again reading the foregoing text.
                  Her mistress had seated herself before the window, and with her side to Jenny
                     and the little girls. As she repeated those beautiful, impressive words of our
                     gracious Redeemer, Mrs. Carpenter started, and gazed eagerly at Jenny. The
                     latter did not see her features, or she would there have detected fear, mingled
                     with surprise, and a questioning expression of whether any pre-intention or
                     motive had induced the reading them. But the grave earnest, undesigning voice
                     and manner of her servant allayed her momentary apprehensions; and she again
                     turned towards the window, and silently listened.
                  
                  The commentary on the texts by her little daughters, simple and childlike
                     though it was, proved how well, during the time she had been with them, Jenny
                     had informed their young minds on the great truths of the gospel; and how, in
                     the same clear style she had herself been taught by both minister and parents,
                     the girl instructed the children. She showed how contentment and humility are
                     at the foundation of true religious happiness. Thereupon she quoted several
                     texts: namely, "Godliness with contentment is great gain;" "Better is little
                     with the fear of the Lord, than great treasure and trouble therein;" and many
                     more such; concluding with that beautiful parable, "The ground of a certain
                     rich man brought forth plentifully." (Luke xii. 16, 21.)
                  During the reading and commenting on the above, Mrs. Carpenter several times
                     again glanced nervously towards Jenny; finally, at the words, "But God said,
                     Thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee, then whose shall all
                     those things be which thou hast provided?" she buried her face in her hands;
                     and, to Jenny's extreme distress, she could see that her whose frame was
                     convulsed with weeping. To withhold the little daughters' attention from their
                     mother, who would have been yet more discomposed by their sympathizing
                     questions, Jenny immediately but quietly engaged them in reading aloud one of
                     the psalms,—the verses alternately, during which their mother hastened from the
                     room, with averted face and unsteady step.
                  Some days after that little event, Martha announced to Jenny her intention of
                     quitting Mrs. Carpenter's situation. She could not, and she would not, stand
                     her temper any longer, she said, and had that day told her, as she didn't seem
                     to give satisfaction, it would be better for all parties she should leave.
                  "O Martha! I am so sorry!" exclaimed
                     Jenny, who was just at that age, and of that warm nature, that every parting
                     with a friend, even though but little love united them, made a melancholy
                     impression not quickly effected.
                  "Yes: in some sorts I'm sorry too," replied Martha, with an assumed
                     indifference which she was in truth far from feeling. The heat of her silly
                     temper had now cooled down; and she was beginning to feel that this last act
                     swelled yet more the list of follies she had already scored against herself,
                     and by which the rolling-stone of her fortune was still as smooth and valueless
                     as when she first started in on her path of life. She had been very happy for
                     two years in her present situation. Her master and mistress were kind, and easy
                     to please,—the latter, perhaps, had been a little too much so. Be that as it
                     might, now, in the worried state of her mind, faults and mistakes annoyed Mrs.
                     Carpenter which had not done so before; and she more frequently fell into
                     reproving Martha. The result was, that, trifling though these complainings
                     were, they stirred up the leaven of silly, unreasoning pride and rebellion,
                     which had so often before marred Martha's prospects in life, and again hurried
                     her into the commission of that which in her heart she now regretted.
                  "I won't stand her tempers any more, that's the long and the short of it,"
                     continued Martha, trying to rouse her heart again into a belief of its injured
                     innocence: "nothing I can do now pleases missus; and when it comes to that, as
                     I told her, it's better a deal to part."
                  "Oh, I am so sorry!" repeated Jenny, the tears welling up into her kind blue
                     eyes: "we have been so comfortable together; and mistress will be sure to be
                     all right again soon, I am certain of that: she's only a bit put out by
                     something that worrits and makes her impatient at times; but it passes off
                     directly if you don't say any thing to vex her."
                  
                  "Oh, that's all very fine!" interposed Martha;" and it would pass off with me
                     too, if I wasn't vexed. Oh, I'm sick of it all, I am!" In her heart she meant
                     she was sick of herself, and went on wiping her dishes in a rough, impatient
                     manner, that sadly perilled their safety.
                  "You know, Martha," Jenny presently resumed, "it's servants' duty to submit
                     patiently to their masters and mistress: we are paid to do so in the first
                     place; and so, as our minister used to say to us, we are debtors to them, and
                     owe them our best services, quite as much as tradespeople owe fair, honest
                     goods to those who buy of them. But more than all else, Martha, don't you
                     remember what God has said, 'Servants, be obedient to them that are your
                     masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your
                     heart as unto Christ; not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as the servants
                     of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart."
                  "Ah, well! that all sounds very nice," exclaimed Martha, whisking and flouncing
                     about among her pans and dishes; "and it's all very well, too, for them to say
                     such things and advise 'em, who know nothing about the matter; but when you are
                     as old as I am, and seen as much of the world, you'll have a different speech,
                     I'm thinking."
                  "Oh, I hope not!" said Jenny warmly; then added with increased earnestness, "do
                     you know, Martha. I would rather die, yes, far rather die, than come to think
                     and feel as you say of God's word, and disobey his laws. I may as well die for
                     any true happiness that would remain for me in this world."
                  "Well, you are a through good girl, Jenny, I do believe," rejoined her
                     companion; "for your words and ways always agree, which I have very seldom
                     found the case with any one else. I certainly am sorry to leave you, and that's
                     the fact; but it does rile me so, the manner ner in which ladies put upon one: it drives me
                     to give 'em warning, I know, straight away out of spite, 'cause I know that
                     will at least, inconvenience 'em, if nothing more."
                  "O, Martha! don't you see how much more you injure yourself than them?" pleaded
                     Jenny: "indeed, it don't injure them at all, only inconvenience them for a bit;
                     but every time you are kept out of place you spend your small earnings, and
                     then, if you get sick and can't work, you have nothing to fall back upon,
                     and—
                  "There, that will do, Jenny. How you go on!" interrupted cook, in a tone of
                     bitterness: "what's done can't be undone; so there, let it bide, do."
                  "But won't you ask missus to forgive you this once, Martha?"
                  "Ask her to forgive me?" repeated cook scornfully, "not I indeed! I never asked
                     any one's pardon in my life, and ain't going to begin now, I can tell you,
                     Jenny!"
                  Her look and tone were too unmistakably determined to admit of any hope of
                     relenting; and Jenny, whose duties called her away, left the kitchen with
                     tearful eyes and a sad heart.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER V.
                  A DISCOVERY.
                  THE following evening, Jenny, bringing in the toast for tea, overheard a remark
                     of her master's that distressed as much as puzzled her. She was sure it was not
                     intended for her hearing; but the weather was stormy, and both husband and wife
                     were with their backs to the door, the first standing at the window
                     unconsciously watching the drifting rain, the latter seated at the table
                     preparing tea. The high wind prevented Jenny's honest, outspoken steps, if I
                     may use such a term, from being audible until close at the table. I employ the
                     word "outspoken," because purposely demonstrative was always her approach when
                     she thought persons held converse on any matters not intended for other ears
                     than their own. She had been taught that listening or praying into the affairs
                     of others was mean and hateful. It was her own natural good breeding which made
                     her afraid of overhearing; whereas servants of bad breeding would have drawn
                     near quietly for the purpose of listening.
                  "Let her go by all means," Mr. Carpenter was saying, as she entered the room:
                     "nothing can be more lucky as it turns out; there's been a sort of something in
                     her tone and manner lately, I haven't liked at all,—a kind of inquisitiveness,
                     a praying curiosity"—
                  "My dear, come to tea now," interposed his wife in a guardedly admonishing
                     voice, as Jenny appeared beside her.
                  Although her master's words struck clearly on her ear, it was not until
                     afterwards that Jane fully realized
                     their meaning, and even then the reason of the application was wanting to her.
                     She knew the words must refer to Martha; but why a little inquisitiveness on
                     her part should have so annoyed Mr. Carpenter as to make him wish for her
                     dismissal, Jane could not conceive, or how it was be perceived it at all,
                     indeed; he was not prone either to notice or to care what the manner of the
                     servants was, when not deficient in proper civility and attention. So it was,
                     therefore, Jane's face, at the moment her mistress glanced anxiously up at her,
                     expressed neither surprise nor interest. Had she seen it half an hour later,
                     its look would have awakened different feelings.
                  Time passed on. Martha, to her great annoyance, and little to her expectation,
                     was the following day paid her wages, including the month in advance, and at
                     once dismissed. Mrs. Carpenter disliked, as many ladies do, keeping a servant
                     about her who had given warning to quit: this at least was the alleged reason
                     for so summary a proceeding. In a short time, her place was supplied by a
                     servant from a distant part of the town.
                  One morning a rumor suddenly arose, a vague, uncertain panic, and floated far
                     and wide on the world's great surging tide of announcements, discoveries, and
                     surprises.
                  And each day it gained in strength and magnitude; the more report of its
                     existence paralyzing some, and terrifying all but those whose poverty-stricken
                     position placed them beyond reach of its influence.
                  "I say, Jenny: there's been such an awful business going on, and is now, as to
                     that; and they can't no ways find out who's at the bottom or top of it,"
                     exclaims Susan, the new cook; who, seated before a large old-fashioned fire,
                     was dividing her time between a newspaper, and basting a leg of mutton,—a
                        division of care manifestly to
                     the disadvantage of the latter.
                  "Why, what is it?" asked Jane.
                  "What is it? why, such awful forgery, that some of the greatest houses in the
                     town will be a'most ruined, if not quite, should it all prove true. Here, just
                     you baste this here meat for a bit, while I read it to you. It won't take a
                     minute."
                  Thereupon Susan read aloud the paragraph, announcing the recent coming to light
                     of a system of forgery, which was as villanously skilful in design and
                     practice, as the results were extensive and ruinous. The whole infamous
                     business must have been carrying on for some time, the paper continued; for,
                     like a fearful disease, the effects had spread far beyond what present
                     discovery and calculation could estimate, and must therefore have been long in
                     operation. The account concluded with a declaration that the police had their
                     eye on the suspected parties, and hoped soon to bring them to justice.
                  That evening, the entreaty of the children that papa would come into the
                     garden, as the weather was so beautiful, and have a game of play, was answered
                     with such impatience, amounting even to angry repulse, that Mrs. Carpenter
                     started, and gazed at him, her face blanching, and her eyes filled with terror.
                     The effort to appear calm before the children, and the servants bringing in the
                     tea, was almost beyond her power; and it was fortunate that the engrossing
                     occupations of the moment kept their attention from their mistress. Mr.
                     Carpenter had hastily quitted the room, and did not return until the tea was
                     ready, and his wife was the only person now present.
                  "What is it, Arthur?" she asked in a low, frightened voice.
                  He looked very pale, and glanced behind him and round the room, in a nervous,
                        anxious manner, then sat down
                     near his wife, saying, "We must get to America as fast as we can, Fanny;
                     there's no time to be lost; the whole affair is becoming known, and before long
                     the tempest will burst. Brush and Marsden are off to-night to Liverpool, and
                     intend sailing to-morrow morning, but Hunt is a family man like myself, besides
                     belonging to this town; neither of which was the case with the others, and
                     can't get off without care and caution, for fear of attracting attention. As
                     far as lies with me, I'll make every preparation, and you must do what you
                     can." Fanny's face became white as snow, as she exclaimed,—
                  "O Arthur! that we had never, never allowed ourselves to be tempted! I have not
                     known one hour of true happiness or peace since the day we listened to that
                     Marsden, with his promises of wealth and pleasure and plenty! And we were so
                     happy before—so perfectly happy; and—and now"—The poor guilty wife, guilty as
                     her husband, could say no more.
                  "It is late in the day to say all this now, Fanny," replied Arthur gloomily:
                     "you should have thought of it sooner; it will perhaps seem unmanly, unjust, in
                     me to make a declaration with apparent intent to in any degree lighten my own
                     shoulders of the crime, by throwing it on you; but I can honestly affirm, that
                     my sincere love and admiration of yourself first inclined me to listen to that
                     fellow Marsden. He got about me with his talk of you and the children; and how
                     pleasant it would be to me to possess the power of conferring pleasure upon you
                     all, to say nothing of the advantages in education it would secure to my little
                     darlings. For a long time I withstood his temptations; but, as ill-luck would
                     have it, one circumstance after another occurred just at that period, regarding
                     you and the children, and then those fellows, every one of them, with their promises and persuasions
                     ringing in my ears. But there!" he broke off impatiently, and wearily pushing
                     back his hair from his aching forehead, "what's the use of looking back at all
                     this,—what's the use?"
                  "O Arthur, Arthur!" exclaimed his unhappy young wife in a voice of agony,
                     gazing at him with pale face and tearless eyes, "don't say that! don't say
                     that! Oh! if any harm befalls you because of all this, I shall go mad! It's my
                     fault, all my fault! I ought to have dissuaded you from it from the beginning.
                     Oh! if I had never encouraged myself in my silly, vain love of dress and
                     pleasure,—for I did encourage myself quite sufficiently to betray my weakness
                     to you, if not to others, and quite enough to grieve you, my dear, kind
                     husband, that it was not in your power to gratify my weakness,—it would not
                     have happened,—I feel sure it would not have happened. Ah! I see now what it is
                     to live without God in the world. Had we made his laws our guide, and been
                     known to do so, those wicked men would not so readily have selected us as
                     objects of temptation. God would not have allowed the Devil to work every thing
                     together to our ruin, as he has done. And O Arthur! even should we succeed in
                     our plans, and roll in our sin-gotten wealth, can we be happier than we have
                     been? Happier? we can never, never be as happy any more. I am sure, for myself,
                     years of such dearly-purchased pleasures could not efface from my remembrance
                     the months of terror, anxiety, and self-reproach, which have been mine during
                     the past summer."
                  "Fanny, Fanny! I tell you it's too late now to think of these things!" answered
                     her husband in a mingled tone of impatience and despair. "We have gone too far
                     not to go further: report is already at work,—fortunately as yet but vague and
                     uncertain. Few of the false notes have at present come to light: and the public opinion runs upon the belief,
                     that the principals in the affair are working abroad,—France, or somewhere on
                     the Continent,—and employing agents in dispersing their forgeries in England;
                     but if once suspicion enters my bank, abounding as it does just at present in
                     false moneys replacing the true, it will be all up with me forever. Never again
                     shall I see the outside of the jail but as a degraded, ruined, condemned man.
                     Whether I shall be able to bear that, and live, I know not,—dragging all those
                     I love better than life down with me, as such a fate would."
                  There was a tone and a look of desperation in her husband's voice and features
                     that turned cold the blood in Fanny's veins, and made her shudder as though
                     suddenly brought under the influence of a winter east wind.
                  "For how long, do you think, you are likely to be safe?" she gasped, after a
                     brief silence.
                  "I am not sure I am safe for even an hour," he replied gravely; "but I think I
                     might venture to remain one day longer, not more."
                  "Then to-morrow night we leave this for any place you decide upon," rejoined
                     Mrs. Carpenter, in a quivering, but determined tone,—"you and I,"—not for
                     worlds would she let him go by himself. "Our children must remain under Jane's
                     care: I can perfectly trust her until I have written to mother to sent for them
                     to stay with her, till—till"—
                  Unable any longer to control herself, poor Fanny, covering her fair young face
                     with her hands, burst into such an agony of weeping, that her whole frame was
                     convulsed. Arthur, to whom his affectionate, devoted wife was inexpressibly
                     dear, drew his chair close to her side, and, pressing her warmly to his heart,
                     endeavored to soothe her distress. He soon succeeded; for she felt it was no
                     time to yield to her feelings, and struggled bravely against them.
                  
                  "I assure you, dear," he murmured, "that I was led unguardedly to be mixed up
                     in this sad business. Those fellows, those scoundrels, persuaded me that for
                     years there was no fear of any thing being discovered, managed with the skill
                     they exercised; certainly not, at least, till the false notes were so
                     inextricably mingled with the true, and spread far and wide, that even a
                     revelation would not then materially harm any one. But that was a lie, and they
                     knew it. Hunt this morning confessed to me that such success had never within
                     his memory, and he is an old man, been known to attend the forging of notes.
                     However, I was only too willing to believe them,—that's the truth. Little did I
                     dream of the rapid ruin such proceedings were certain of bringing down on
                     innocent people."
                  Fanny sat back, and listened to her husband, her beautiful face very white and
                     troubled, and full of a noble resolution.
                  "We will fly to-morrow night, Arthur. God in mercy pardon and assist us, and
                     not a shilling of our sin-gotten gains will we keep; no, all that lies in our
                     power to do we will, to repair the great evil we have committed. Make every
                     arrangement you can for our departure; and I will second you as far as
                     possible."
                  Arthur looked irresolute, but half-repentant: he again kissed his wife in an
                     abstracted, hurried manner; and after some further conversation, during which
                     she became much calmer, he, late in the evening, went out to see and consult
                     with Mr. Hunt,—a lawyer in a small way of business, residing in an adjoining
                     street to the one inhabited by the Carpenters.
                  Mrs. Carpenter waited until she heard the hall-door close upon her husband;
                     then throwing herself on her knees, she with bitter tears, such as were
                     strangers to her eyes before that evening, earnestly implored Heaven to
                        pardon her beloved husband and
                     herself, to pardon their life-long forgetfulness and ingratitude towards him,
                     but especially this their last great sin, and to save them from its deserved
                     fearful consequences. Presently she rang for Jane, whose sense of propriety was
                     greatly disconcerted when, upon her entrance, she was desired by her mistress
                     to come and sit beside her on the sofa. "I have that to say to you," continued
                     the latter, "which must not reach other ears than your own."
                  Briefly as the subject admitted of, she then confided to Jenny that a sad
                     trouble had, through their own guilt, fallen on herself and husband,—a trouble
                     that necessitated their immediately quitting their home for a while, until the
                     cloud had passed away; that, meanwhile, they must leave their precious children
                     to her sole care for an indefinite time. Was she willing to undertake so
                     responsible a charge? to adhere to her trust through any evil reports that
                     might reach her of the parents, or any difficulties or changes attending her
                     position?
                  Jane's astonishment at this address would have been much greater, had she not
                     in some degree been prepared for it by that change in her master and mistress
                     which in secret she had long sorrowed over; nevertheless, so unlooked for a
                     conclusion as this to her doubts and fears was altogether so different from her
                     expectation, so distressing and bewildering, that for a few seconds she could
                     only gaze with wide open eyes at the pleading mother, utterly at a loss what to
                     answer. But Mrs. Carpenter's kind face, filling instantly with an expression of
                     anxiety and hopelessness amounting to positive agony, quickly decided her
                     generous young heart. Her duty seemed now to protect the children; and a
                     trembling promise was given, which experience had proved to her mistress
                     nothing Jenny had power to resist
                     would induce her to swerve from the performance of.
                  "You are a good, noble-natured girl," exclaimed the unhappy mother, grasping
                     Jane's hand gratefully in her own;" and do not think you shall lose in
                     consequence,—not for worlds would I let you do that." Mrs. Carpenter then
                     counted out the wages due to her, adding thereto a month in advance.
                  After some further instructions, both regarding the children and her own secret
                     requirements, in which Jane was to aid her on the morrow; and having extracted
                     a promise that to no one would she mention a word of what had now passed
                     between them,—an unnecessary request to make to the faithful-hearted
                     Jenny,—Mrs. Carpenter dismissed her.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  PLANNING A CHANGE OF HOME.
                  WHEN Arthur returned, the anxious eyes of his wife detected at a glance an
                     increase of that harassed, nervous expression in his pale face that had
                     terrified her before. He was evidently desirous, however, of sparing her any
                     further distress that night; for he volunteered no explanation, and immediately
                     proposed their going to bed, and, if possible, obtaining some rest, to prepare
                     them for the next day's undertakings. Had it been any one else but her husband,
                     Mrs. Carpenter would gladly, in her present saddened, jaded condition of mind and body, have favored this
                     reticence; but to know him oppressed by an additional care unshared in by
                     herself was not to be thought of for a moment. By degrees she learned to her
                     dismay, that so vigorous and successful had been the efforts of the police in
                     discovering the perpetrators of the great forgeries,—the report of which had so
                     electrified the public mind, that they had traced the crime to its source,
                     viz., the very house occupied alone by Marsden and Brush, also their names and
                     sudden departure. Information had been instantly despatched to the police
                     authorities in all the large seaport towns, suspicion at once pointing to
                     America as their probable destination; and so rapidly had the whole affair been
                     managed, that there could be no doubt, Arthur added, they would both be
                     arrested before the next evening, and certain to betray all their
                     accomplices.
                  "And now, dearest, what are we to do?" he concluded, with look and voice so
                     forlorn and despairing, that, making a strong effort to speak encouragingly,
                     she replied,—
                  "During your absence this evening, dear Arthur, I spent a large portion of the
                     time in considering every point of our unhappy position, and its possible
                     fearsome difficulties and dangers."
                  "Yes, you look as though you had, my poor darling," interposed her husband
                     sorrowfully.
                  This nearly upset her; but, crushing down the rising feelings, she continued,
                     through in a less firm voice, "Among other things, I gave particular, through
                     to the very misfortune which has now so quickly come upon us,—the being
                     prevented quitting England, and the probable arrest of some or one of those
                     men. Just what I feared has, you see, come to pass. It is now impossible to
                     leave this country, and yet imperative upon us to fly somewhere; and no place
                     can I think of as safer, or even so safe, as Wales. Friends have told me, that, in many of
                     the solitary parts among the hilly districts, the people do not speak or
                     understand one word of English: they hold little or no communication with the
                     civilized world, and are in fact as secluded as the aborigines of New South
                     Wales. We must manage in some way to get there, Arthur. Don't you agree with
                     me? You will carry your photographic machine with you, and appear to be
                     constantly engaged in taking views of the surrounding country; which, by
                     satisfying the curiosity of the inhabitants, will no doubt prevent any inquiry
                     into our concerns."
                  Arthur cheered up a little while listening to his wife, and agreed that, all
                     things considered, if they could only effect the securely getting there, an
                     out-of-the world part of North Wales might indeed afford them as safe a retreat
                     as any place, until matters were in some degree settled. After a little more
                     talking and planning ning on the subject, Fanny then gently but earnestly
                     entreated of her husband, that, before their unhappy flight, he would
                     unhesitatingly make the one only reparation now in his power for the evil they
                     had committed towards God and man, by going early in the morning to his bank,
                     and withdrawing all the false notes he possessed the power of replacing with
                     true, and at once destroy the hateful counterfeits.
                  Arthur looked sorely perplexed. "What were they to do," he said, "when their
                     money was spent, which is surely would be in a very short time? Suppose, too,
                     they were driven to fly the country altogether—"
                  Fanny interrupted him anxiously, eagerly. "Oh, let us do now what is right! Oh,
                     my beloved husband! I have thought and felt tonight as I never did it before. I
                     see now how sinful my past life has been. I have lived without God in the
                     world; and, ah me! how fearful are the consequences! That money would not prosper with us, Arthur: I feel it
                     would not. I feel that only evil and sorrow will cling to us in companionship
                     with those illgotten gains. Take it back to the bank, dear, dear Arthur! At all
                     risk, take it back!"
                  Her earnestness increased to agony, as in bitterness of soul she thought that
                     had she always feared God, and in the first instance exercised that influence
                     to restrain him from evil which mutual love gave her over her kindhearted
                     husband, this disgrace and sorrow, this breaking up of all their once sunny
                     tranquillity and joy, would have been kept far from them.
                  Mr. Carpenter did not possess the same strength of character as his beautiful
                     wife, and gazed into her pleading face, his mind in a whirl of uncertainty what
                     to do. He had never refused her anything in his life, however, and could not
                     begin now. Yielding, therefore, to her almost wild entreaty, he at last
                     promised to exchange the money early the next morning. He then went on to say,
                     he had that evening called upon old Mr. Cranford; who had been, and still was
                     nominally, manager of the bank he (Arthur) was in, until his failing health
                     obliged him to retire from business, but, as he was now much better, had kindly
                     consented to fill his old place again during Arthur's absence for a few weeks.
                     "By that time," added Mr. Carpenter, in an unsteady voice, "our fate will be
                     sealed one way or other."
                  Early the following morning, Arthur, again urged by his wife, set off to
                     exchange the money at the bank. Meanwhile Mrs. Carpenter, with sad and heavy
                     heart, that filled her eyes with blinding tears, went about the once to her so
                     pleasant house, making preparations for their hurried departure,—a departure
                     that, for ought she could tell to the contrary, might be final,—final in
                     duration, ruin, and disgrace. Every thing, she knew, depended on the escape or capture of her husband's
                     accomplices; who, if taken, would be certain, one or other, to betray all. Even
                     Hunt was quite as capable, she thought, of doing so, as any of the rest: and no
                     choice therefore remained for Arthur but flight and concealment, or voluntary
                     surrender of himself to justice; which latter the unhappy wife shrank from the
                     bares thought of with intense horror.
                  Mr. Carpenter was longer absent than she had anticipated. All was a ready,—the
                     fly at the door, the luggage upon it, the nursery finally visited, and its
                     beloved inmates embraced, and bid farewell with a cool, composed manner, but an
                     agonized, burning heart, that could scarce contain without breaking its fearful
                     load of sorrow. She was sitting at the drawing-room window now, watching for
                     her husband's return, and weeping bitterly.
                  "Dear mistress, don't cry so!" murmured a kind young voice close beside her;
                     and she turned to meet poor Jenny's tearful blue eyes fixed pityingly upon her.
                     "All will go well yet,—oh, I'm sure it will!" continued Jenny earnestly. "Pray
                     to God, dear mistress, to—to forgive you, if you feel you have offended him,
                     and beg him to take care of you, and bring you safe-like through your troubles,
                     and home? again to those who love you so well."
                  The poor wife sank her face on her trembling hands, and, utterly unnerved by
                     the sympathy, so sincere and simple, of her cottage servant, sobbed as though
                     her heart would break. Jenny's childlike, tender nature gave way too; and,
                     bursting into tears, she exclaimed in broken but low-toned words,—
                  "O dear mistress! I'm so sorry for you! Oh, please don't cry so! and please,
                     don't think it a liberty I have brought you this. It's so small, it won't take
                     up scarce any room in your carpet-bag. Mother gave it to me; but I know she
                     will be glad you had it, you have
                     been so good to me:" and Jenny began hastily turning over the leaves of a
                     little Bible she held in her hands. "Last night, ma'am, I couldn't help crying
                     when, as I read my little Bible, I thought of what you had been saying to me;
                     and wasn't it strange-like? I came of a sudden on these texts:" and Jenny read
                     them, the earnestness of her feelings studying her voice as she went on, "'If
                     any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me
                     not, he will deliver his soul from going into the pit; and his life shall see
                     the light.'"
                  "Yes, yes," she murmured, after a while, "I see now it is good for me I am in
                     trouble; and it will be good—yes, I do hope it will—for my beloved husband.
                     There he is, thank God!" added the young wife with a relieved sigh, as hasty
                     steps sounded in the hall.
                  Mr. Carpenter at that instant entered the room; and his wife rose to meet him,
                     unconsciously sciously allowing Jenny at the same time to take the little Bible
                     from her hand, and place it in a corner of the carpet-bag, which had been
                     retained until the last moment, to accommodate small, forgotten articles.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  A HOME AMONG STRANGERS.
                  IN a wild and beautiful part on the north-western coast of Wales, far from the
                     beaten track of the tourist, there stood, and still may stand, a large,
                     rambling old farmhouse. The farmer and his wife, elderly people, and two young
                     men, their sons, inhabited one side of the illcared-for building; while in a
                     couple of spacious rooms, a sitting and bedroom, scant of furniture, and scant
                     of comfort of every kind excepting light, which flooded in through a great
                     window in unlimited abundance, Mrs. Carpenter and her husband were domiciled
                     four days after the events last narrated. The photographic machine was
                     arranged, as well as circumstances admitted of, in a one-sided shed at the back
                     of the farm; and the fame of the owner was already established in the
                     neighborhood around. The solitude of the place may be conceived of, when the
                     reader is told that photography was as yet an unknown art to its inhabitants.
                     Two or three had, as they said to each other in Welsh, "heard tell of such
                     things;" but that in truth an exact likeness of their own faces and of the
                     exquisite spots of scenery on every side of the country could be produced in a
                     few minutes, and purchased for a shilling or two, possessed a charm and a
                     wonder in their eyes amounting almost to the miraculous.
                  Well, as I said, four days had passed since Arthur and his wife had fled their
                     home. It was a glorious evening in August, the pleasantest month in Wales, the
                     summer being of brief duration
                     there. Mrs. Carpenter sat alone by the large open window, bending over the
                     little Bible Jenny had placed in the carpet-bag. Not only were those
                     texts—whose divine comfort had sent a soft ray of sunshine into her chilled
                     heart on that saddest morning of her still young life—marked by a slip of
                     paper, but several other parts of the sacred volume contained like indications
                     of the presence of verses full of soothing and encouragement, or of warning and
                     advice. The leaves being thus marked, she was helped in the search for suitable
                     passages. Occasionally she raised her eyes, to let them wander over the
                     beautiful view without, stretching far away in the distance. She often did so;
                     for there was a harmony so perfectly in unison between the Creator's works,—the
                     wooded dells; the mountain-sides, clad in golden-blossomed furze; the soft and
                     balmy air, filled with the music of birds and distant sound of falling water;
                     and, more distant still, the horizon, bounded by the glittering waters of St
                     George's Channel; while over the whole descended a sea of golden sunshine,
                     glorious to behold,—such a perfect harmony, I repeat, between these exquisite
                     works and the yet more sunlit words of revealed religion, that the poor wife
                     unconsciously united the two in her rapt regard and admiration.
                  While thus reading and meditating, many keenly bitter regrets mingling with her
                     reflections that she had not always felt and thought as she had done within the
                     last few days, her husband came in, and threw himself full length on an
                     old-fashioned horse-hair couch standing against the wall, nearly opposite his
                     wife. There was a weariness of mind and body in this action very unlike the
                     once gay, active, untiring Arthur: and as the light, falling with unshaded
                     clearness upon his outstretched figure, disclosed unreservedly the sad havoc which the ceaseless anxiety, sorrow,
                     and remorse of the last few weeks had wrought on his whole person, a pang shot
                     through Fanny's heart; and she turned her face to the window, to conceal the
                     irrepressible tears. But they were not hid. Arthur, too, had noted at a glance,
                     as she sat before the open window, the paled complexion and altered appearance
                     of his wife, and, furtively looking again, detected the evidence of grief
                     stealing down her fair cheeks. Yielding, however, to her obvious wish to avoid
                     observation,—as much perhaps that his own heart was already so sore, every
                     additional touch would have increased the pain to agony,—he affected not to see
                     her distress, and spoke cheerfully, telling of his photographic success, even
                     assuming to laugh at the difficulties and misunderstandings arising betwixt
                     himself and the villagers, through their ignorance of each others'
                     language.
                  Mrs. Carpenter listened with a forced attention tion, that, despite herself,
                     often wandered; and when, in conclusion, he asked her what she had been doing
                     with herself since dinner, replied thoughtfully,—
                  "Several things, dear, and amongst others reading. Shall I read a little to you
                     now, as you lie there?"
                  Arthur looked objectingly at the holy volume in her hand, then at her sweet,
                     anxious face, so eagerly waiting his answer, and said kindly, but reluctantly,
                     "Well, if you wish it, darling; but not much, please, for I am very tired
                     today."
                  "No, dear: I'll stop directly you like." She then continued more hurriedly,
                     "The morning we came away, do you remember, Arthur, how bitterly we repented of
                     the sin we had committed? For myself, I know my greatest sorrow was the thought
                     of my past life of forgetfulness of God, and my utter neglect of all religious
                     influence, not only as regarded
                     myself and children, but you also, my beloved, precious husband. I was very,
                     very miserable, and sat crying at the window, watching for your return, full of
                     vague fears at what had kept you, as I thought, so long away."
                  "Yes," interrupted her husband: "I was much longer than I intended; for I went
                     to see Hunt. And then I was delayed at old Crawford's house. No one was up;
                     and, when at last I got in, there was a further difficulty in my obtaining a
                     personal interview with my old friend, who was still of course in bed: but you
                     know I couldn't venture to leave the keys of the bank in any hands but
                     his."
                  "Of course not, dear. Well, as I was saying, I sat crying, and miserable to the
                     last degree; when just then in came that dear creature, Jenny, with this little
                     Bible in her hand, which she begged me to accept. She spoke so cheeringly, and
                     with evidently so much sympathy in my sorrow, that I really became in a measure
                     comforted at once, and especially by these beautiful texts which she read to
                     me." Thereupon, Mrs. Carpenter slowly and earnestly repeated them, partly from
                     memory, partly from the book. "Now the contrition I felt for all the wrong I
                     had done," she continued, "and my grief at all the good I had left undone,
                     would have driven me to distraction but for these merciful words of hope and
                     encouragement; and the words came to my soul like a heaven-sent message, and
                     have so continued since that hour."
                  An expression moved Arthur's care-lined face somewhat like that of a person
                     awakening out of sleep. "Yes," he answered in a low voice: "those are cheering
                     promises, indeed. God grant," he added mournfully, "that my sin doesn't place
                     me without the pale of such mercies!"
                  "If it does you, my beloved husband, how much more so in my case?" rejoined his
                        wife. "You had a loving motive in
                     the temptation that led you astray; but I—I—oh! we will not think that,
                     Arthur,—we will not think that. Listen to what God further says to those who
                     repent, and turn to him;" and Fanny read divers other texts full of
                     encouragement, of promise, and of hope, most of which the good, affectionate
                     girl Jenny had, as it were, pointed out to her notice by the slips of paper
                     between the leaves.
                  The next day was Sunday; and Mr. and Mrs. Carpenter set off together to walk to
                     the little church,—a distance of about a mile from the farm. The weather was
                     exquisite,—quiet, bright, and balmy; and the way so solitary and silent, that,
                     after leaving the hamlet behind them, no other habitation of even the poorest
                     kind did they meet between their dwelling and the church, nor did any sound
                     break the silence save the song of birds and soft bleat of sleep and goats on
                     the hillsides. It was, indeed, an out-of-the-world spot where this erring pair
                     had sought a refuge.
                  Despite the cheeriness of the morning, however, there walk was a sad one to
                     both; for many bitter, repentant feelings welled up into their hearts at
                     thoughts of how, in the days of their prosperity, in which a gracious God had
                     blessed them with every reasonable happiness, they had forsaken and forgotten
                     him, had come to regard his mercies as their right, and to murmur within their
                     souls they had not more, while his sabbaths were neglected,—nay, for years they
                     had openly dishonored his holy day, living only for themselves in the world.
                     And behold the result! But the heaviest sorrow of all was the remembrance of
                     their children, of not only the utter neglect, both by precept and example, of
                     their eternal interests, but also of their temporal; and an icy sensation crept
                     into the mother's heart, and made her shudder at the instant, and cling convulsively to her
                     husband's arm, as she realized, it seemed to her almost for the first time, the
                     full magnitude of the disgrace hanging like a black pall over these innocent
                     ones.
                  Arthur looked down into her pale face, and read her thoughts, but said nothing:
                     he knew not what to say; he only pressed her hand to his side.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VIII.
                  JENNY MEETS AN OLD FRIEND.
                  WHEN her kind mistress left her, and the last sound of their carriage-wheels
                     died away in the distance, Jenny, leaning against the table, and burying her
                     face in her apron, relieved her distressed feelings by a flood of tears. Not
                     that she was usually prone to be thus violently demonstrative either in grief
                     or joy, but her situation had suddenly become of so peculiarly painful,
                     difficult, and mysterious a character; her happiness, as regarded the
                     Carpenters, so entirely broken up for an indefinite period,—if not permanently,
                        indeed,— that the young,
                     inexperienced heart felt for a while overwhelmed: and all that day, like one
                     who had received a stunning blow, she went about still dizzy from the effects
                     thereof.
                  A week came and went, bringing no additional trouble or further interruption to
                     the quiet of the house in any way. Jenny continued unvarying in her close
                     guardianship of the children: indeed, so devoted was she, and so anxious, that
                     it told upon her health and looks, and drew down upon her Susan's frequent
                     half-angry, half-amused ridicule.
                  "I tell you what it is, Jenny," she exclaimed one day. "if you go on worriting
                     after them children in the way you do, you'll be laid up,—that's what you'll
                     be; and won't there be fine mischief to pay? Who's to attend to 'em then? I am
                     sure I won't, as mistress didn't choose to leaves any care of 'em to me. Take
                     my advice, and bring them down, and come you and sit in the kitchen, and let
                     'em run in and out and about the house: believe me, 'twill do you and them all
                     the good in the world. Leastways come of evenings; for it ain't fair by me
                     either,—that it ain't: I am a'most moped to death, I am."
                  Jenny smiled. "I don't know how that can be, Susan; for you so often go out of
                     the house. Indeed," she added diffidently, "I don't think it's right of you to
                     leave your kitchen so much as you do."
                  "Oh! that's your opinion, is it?" laughed Susan. "Well, then, come and stay
                     down there with me, and I won't."
                  But no persuasions could induce Jenny to change her line of conduct; for,
                     besides that her own good sense and right feeling were strongly opposed to her
                     doing so, she was well supported in this resolution by the admonitions she
                     received from her parents. "For mind thee, my child," concluded her mother at
                     the end of a rather lengthy epistle on the subject, "thou knowest that art at any rate safe on thy
                     present path, even were thee not bound so strick-like to be there; but for
                     t'other way, thee canst be sure of nothing save that it be open at every point,
                     to let in mischief upon thee!"
                  One afternoon Jenny was returning with the children from a long walk: they were
                     very tired; and the two younger ones clung to her arm and hand for support,
                     which she good-humoredly rendered to the best of her ability, trying at the
                     same time to keep up their flagging spirits by lively conversation. Turning the
                     corner of a street, they suddenly encountered a tall, good-looking young man,
                     who started and stopped at sight of Jenny, his honest open countenance beaming
                     all over with delight at sight of her. Jenny, on her part, responded with a
                     much more surprised, and equally bright, gratified look,—brighter, indeed, by
                     reason of a vivid blush that covered her cheeks.
                  "How d'ye do, Jenny?"—"How d'ye do, John?" exclaimed the two young people,
                     shaking hands warmly.
                  "I didn't know you was here, John," murmured Jenny in her quiet, shy voice, and
                     drawing back her hand, which he seemed reluctant to part with.
                  "Well, I knew you was: so you see, Jenny I had the best of it,"
                     replied John cheerfully, and turning to accompany her and the children
                     home.
                  John Brock was one of the two brothers introduced to the reader at the
                     beginning of this narrative. The reader will remember him as belonging to the
                     same village as Jenny. The Groves and Brocks had known and respected each other
                     for years; and of course the juvenile members on both sides, adopting the
                     opinions of their parents, were equally friendly.
                  John had business to transact for his master in this town, he went on to inform
                     Jenny, and was then on his way to
                     call and see her, having promised her family he would do so. He had lots of
                     messages from every one for her, and should like to have a good long chat about
                     home and old times, if she was agreeable; and so would she come out in the
                     evening, and take a walk with him? He didn't need to return to his village that
                     night, he added; for he was stopping at a friend's house till the morrow.
                  "Oh, no! I can't do that, John. I'm very sorry; but I can't come," replied
                     Jenny unhesitatingly, but yet with a perceptible tone of regret in the abrupt
                     words.
                  "Why not, Jenny?" inquired the young man with a greatly disappointed, but not
                     offended voice. "I am sure if you explain to your mistress that I come from
                     your own village, straight from your parents, as it were, and that they know'd
                     I was going to see, and have a long chat with you, and were not agin it
                     they"—
                  "But there it is, John," interrupted Jenny hurriedly; "that's just the trouble:
                     they be away, and can't know any thing about it. I only wish they could; for
                     missus is so kind, I feel certain she'd let me go in a minute: but, as she
                     ain't at home, I can't do it. Nor can I even ask you into the house, John,"
                     added poor Jenny, reddening violently, and speaking with nervous haste: "they
                     ain't at home, you see; and it wouldn't be right."
                  John's sunburnt features wore a curious, mixed expression of vexation, and yet
                     approval of the young girl's conduct; nor in his heart did he wish her to act
                     otherwise, or feel desirous of tempting her to do so. John Brock was of a
                     resolute, determined nature; which, happily for him, his excellent training had
                     always kept steadily in the right course. So it was, therefore, no other was
                     now pleasant to him; the strong points of his character setting as firmly and
                     unflinchingly that way, as, had he
                     been untaught by Christian parents, unrestrained by God's laws, they would in
                     all human probability have rushed to ruin on the other. His was a disposition
                     to be decided in good or evil; and although, with that inconsistency
                     inseparable from our fallen nature, his self-love was unconsciously to himself
                     slightly mortified by Jenny's uncompromising adherence to her duty, had she
                     departed from it, she would have utterly forfeited his esteem, and with it his
                     love.
                  "All right," said John, seeing how matters stood,—"all right. If we cannot have
                     a walk and a talk together, I am glad at any rate that I have seen you."
                  "Oh! but Jenny," interposed the eldest little girl, who alike shared in her
                     mother's charming disposition and her looks, "I am sure mamma won't be a bit
                     angry at your walking with your brother" (so she thought him); "and I'll tell
                     her for you when she comes home. I know she won't be angry; so you must
                     go."
                  "Thank you, miss," replied John. "But Jenny bain't my sister, you see; and that
                     maybe'd make a difference. Though, for the matter of that, we have been as good
                     as brother and sister all our lives,—leastways all hers; for she's a big bit
                     younger than I am, you see," and John reddened deeply while thus speaking.
                  The little Fanny looked perplexed, not very well understanding the drift of
                     John's argument, which seemed to affirm that they were not, and yet that they
                     were, brother and sister, or as good as such; which was the same thing, Fanny
                     thought. However, his words left one point clear to her amiable mind,—that
                     Jenny and himself were both good, considerate people, and undoubtedly deserving
                     of a walk together, to chat over old times, as John expressed it. Thereupon she
                     again urged Jenny, in her childish,
                     eager way, to go with her brother, as she persisted in calling him, and she
                     (Fanny) would take care mamma was not angry with her.
                  Had they been in the nursery instead of the street, Jenny would have hugged the
                     little thing for her good nature,—that is, if John had not been by; but, as it
                     was, she only murmured, in broken, reluctant sentences, coloring vividly the
                     while under the painful conviction that young Brock might care no more for her
                     after the proof of indifference she was apparently manifesting, "Thank you,
                     dear: you are very kind. Thank you very much: but I can't go. You are too
                     young, dear Miss Fanny, to know. I couldn't listen to you, dear: so there's no
                     help for it."
                  They had now arrived at the door of their house, which Jenny opened with a
                     latch-key; and having, in an irrepressibly sorrowful manner wished John
                     good-by, she and the children entered the house, and the door was, as poor
                     Jenny felt, most inhospitably shut in her lover's face.
                  "There," she inwardly sighed, hastening up-stairs to conceal the tears welling
                     up into her kind eyes, "I have done for John, that's certain,—good, excellent
                     John: he'll never care no more for me; how can he? Well, no matter. Father and
                     mother will, I know, say I was quite right; and what different could I do?"
                  "In all our parts there's not so nice and good a girl as that little Jenny,"
                     murmured John, as, slowly sauntering down the street, he several times stopped
                     and meditatively contemplated the house she was in. "I always thought her an
                     uncommon well brought up lass, but had no real notion how right-thinking and
                     sensible-like she be till to-day."
                  He stood silent a while; and presently a change came over his comely face.
                  
                  "I wonder, now, do she care for me?" he muttered. "I begin greatly to fear me
                     she don't. That's just how it always is. If she weren't worth any thing, she'd
                     be sure to care a deal for me; but, as it's just t'other way, the chances are
                     she don't: and she never may care that," gloomily snapping his fingers, as he
                     turned, and pursued his course to his friend's house. Could poor Jenny have
                     seen how different was the expression his features wore all that day to what is
                     presented when first they met in the street, her own sweet-tempered face would
                     have brightened wonderfully; for she would have known that no feeling of anger
                     or offence was there, but simply one of love and doubt.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IX.
                  A VISITOR.
                  A FORTNIGHT had come and gone, drifted away forever on the great ocean-tide of
                     time, and Mr. and Mrs. Carpenter still remained undisturbed in the romantic
                     solitudes of Wales. It had been a painfully exciting, trying period to both:
                     but, during after-years, those anxious fourteen days stood out the most
                     blessed, the most treasured, of their lives. Little did poor Jenny know how
                     divinely favored to her kind but erring mistress would be the humble present
                     she had made her, and, yet more the few words and texts with which, on that
                     last morning, she sent her, so to speak, rejoicing on her way. Mrs. Carpenter's more pliable woman's
                     nature—more pliable, possibly, because a keener, quicker instinct shows to
                     woman the truth and value of things more speedily than it comes to man's
                     slower, heavier judgment—opened out at once to a full conviction of the beauty
                     of holiness and of the sinfulness of the whole of her past life, as tested by
                     God's pure and perfect laws. And now to bring her beloved husband, by humble,
                     gentle means, to view their conduct in the same condemning light was the
                     earnest desire of her heart, and her constant endeavor. Oh that her beloved
                     husband could also feel the peace to the truly penitent from the faith in the
                     mercy of God through Jesus Christ!
                  And, to her great joy, she succeeded,—succeeded as probably under no other
                     circumstances, no other "position," could she have done so effectually and so
                     readily: yes, highly blessed to them had been the change; for the complete
                     isolation from the world's great stir and strife of their present abode, amidst
                     the magnificent beauty of surrounding objects of nature, gave them
                     opportunities for quiet meditation and prayer, and made them more readily
                     impressed with abhorrence of sin under the Spirit's teaching.
                  Arthur became acquainted—he could not well avoid it—with Mr. Hoyde, the
                     clergyman of the village church they had attended. He was an amiable, worthy,
                     sad-faced little many, with a hard-worked, ill-paid look generally, but was
                     intelligent and well-read; which, united to a character whose every sentiment
                     proclaimed the truly Christian minister, made him exactly the style of
                     companion most desirable for Arthur under his present state. His wife rejoiced
                     at the intimacy, and encouraged it as much as possible.
                  One evening Mr. Hoyde called at the farm; and, Mr. Carpenter being absent, Mrs.
                        Carpenter ter received him alone.
                     The conversation turned at first on subjects connected with Wales, especially
                     its antiquities, on which he was an enthusiast. The country abounded in
                     beautiful remains of all kinds, he said; scarcely a country that did not
                     possess a ruined castle, or some monastic remnants, picturesque and interesting
                     in the highest degree. "This very building," he added, "now degenerated into a
                     farm, was once a stately manor-house, in the possession, no doubt, of one of
                     the great Welsh chieftains of by-gone times."
                  But soon the conversation took a turn that sent the blood in a wild rush to the
                     poor wife's heart and head, and made her rejoice that the pastor's visit had
                     been paid in the gloaming, instead of in mid-day.
                  No doubt she must have heard, he said, of the extensive and skilful system of
                     forgery that had been going on for so long a time in the town of—?
                     "Unfortunately," he continued ued, "the culprits as yet have escaped—gone off
                     to America, it is supposed; that, at least, is the latest announcement in the
                     'Times.' Two men, answering to the description given of those supposed to be
                     principals in the dreadful affair, were traced to Liverpool, and from thence
                     set sail for America, notwithstanding the rapid endeavors made to stop all such
                     line of action on their part."
                  "Then they have quite escaped?" inquired Mrs. Carpenter in a voice so low and
                     husky that involuntarily Mr. Hoyde looked at her, but hastily coughing, as
                     though to clear her throat. He replied without further notice,—
                  "Yes: if those were the men, they have escaped past human means to capture
                     them, and there seems to be every reason to believe they are. But it is thought
                     there are others; and it is to be hoped that one at least amongst them will be
                     secured, and made an example to the rest and to the world generally."
                  
                  "If that should be poor dear Arthur,—the least guilty of them all!" thought the
                     unhappy wife. She dare not yet trust her voice to speak again; and Mr. Hoyde,
                     imputing her silence to indifference, added hastily, and with a touch of
                     sternness in his tone that thrilled her to the heart,—
                  "Of all crimes, few appear to me so dreadful in its effects, or more sinful,
                     than forging and issuing false money. I have always pictured it to myself under
                     the form of a frightful invisible foe, entering the dwellings of poor,
                     unoffending people ere they are aware of its baleful presence. Thank God!"
                     continued the poor clergyman, with painful earnestness,—"thank God that I do
                     not live in the town of ——! My receipts are very small, my family large, and my
                     beloved wife in extremely delicate health: what would be my feelings,
                     therefore, to find that the only few notes I possessed in the world were
                     valueless! Thank God, that affliction is saved me!"
                  The shades of evening had so darkened the room they could not see each other's
                     expression; and Mr. Hoyde was on the point, after a brief silence, of rising to
                     take his departure, unaware that his companion was sitting, her fair face in
                     her hands, weeping so bitterly that he started as if electrified, when a burst
                     of convulsive sobs she could not repress broke on his ear. He was greatly
                     distressed, and, naturally a nervous man, stood silently gazing at her, not
                     knowing what to say or do. That her grief was in some way connected with the
                     events he had just spoken upon, there could be no doubt; and equally convinced
                     was he that some near and dear relation of her own was some way implicated in
                     the business,—her brother, perhaps, or even her father,—how could he tell?
                     Longing to give her Christian comfort, to entreat her to seek consolation for
                     herself and pardon for the erring beloved one at that source which never failed
                     those who sought it in faith, he was
                     on the point of speaking, when the sound of approaching footsteps, which Fanny
                     immediately recognized as her husband's, caused her to start and sit up.
                  Making a violent effort to subdue her agitation, she wiped the tears from her
                     eyes and cheeks, faltering, "Please don't notice it. You drew such a—a
                     distressing picture, I felt very ill; but I am better now."
                  Arthur at that instant came in; but Mr. Hoyde, with delicate consideration for
                     Mrs. Carpenter, who he felt sure would at present prefer being alone, refused
                     to again sit down; and, after the interchange of a few friendly greetings
                     between the gentlemen, he took his leave, accompanied a short distance on his
                     road by Mr. Carpenter.
                  When the latter returned, candles were lit, and his wife quietly engaged in her
                     work.
                  "Fanny, I have got a letter by this evening's post from Hunt!" he exclaimed in
                     low excited tones, shutting the door, and hastening towards her. "Look here
                     what he says!" he continued, sitting down, and taking a paper from his pocket.
                     He then read a lengthened account, confirming the announcement in "The Times,"
                     and containing private information of which the public knew nothing. The two
                     men, whose arrest Arthur and Hunt had so feared, had positively sailed for
                     America; though, as several other vessels were departing at the same hour for
                     all parts of the world, their real destination was as yet uncertified to any
                     but their immediate friends. Hunt's knowledge on the point came from the
                     fountainhead itself, putting all doubt out of the question. Marsden had written
                     him a long letter on board "The Firefly," bound for Canada; and which letter,
                     with numerous other despatches from the passengers, was brought back by the
                     pilot, and posted. It contained two very contradictory pieces of news,—a great
                        success, viz., their escape—and a
                     great failure, in the loss of a box conveying all their ill-gotten gains. The
                     vessel, which with several more lay at anchor some distance out at sea, was, at
                     the time of their boarding her, pitching and rolling considerably, under the
                     influence of a high wind and rough tide. How it happened, they could never
                     quite make out; but, while all the other trunks and boxes, before and after,
                     were safely deposited on deck, this one containing their treasures got suddenly
                     loosed from its holdings, and, tumbling into the sea, sank at once to the
                     bottom. It was unfortunately very heavy; for, besides a large quantity of gold,
                     obtained in change for the false notes, with bundles of true Bank-of-England
                     notes, it held a good deal of plate, and a large number of books. To recover it
                     was out of the question, the captain assured them.
                  This ruinous accident had "taken it so completely out of them," so Marsden's
                     letter continued tinued, "that he and Brush had that very night sworn together
                     never again to return to their former sinful practices, but to turn over a new
                     leaf in the new world to which they were going. They were the more persuaded to
                     make this resolution," he added, "from the conviction, that, unless they did,
                     some terrible misfortune would certainly come upon them, and that before the
                     voyage was over, so utterly forsaken of God did they feel. In proof of the
                     honesty of their intention, they, when all was dark that night, pitched every
                     forging implement they possessed into the sea, and so did away, as far as lay
                     in their power, with any possibility of a relapse into that fearful sin, at
                     least." These resolutions may have been only the fruit of disappointment and
                     fear; but, from a letter at a later period, it seemed as if they were adhered
                     to.
                  All this, and much more, did Arthur read from Mr. Hunt's letter. For himself,
                     he concluded cluded, he would now
                     make speedy preparations to leave his present residence, and, with his family,
                     return to their native place in the south of Ireland. I will here add, however,
                     he was not permitted to carry out his plan. The same evening that saw him post
                     the letter, containing its announcement, to Arthur, saw him, one hour
                     afterwards, borne to his home a poor unconscious paralytic. But death did not
                     immediately summon him. On the contrary, he was spared to linger on for some
                     years, his reason wholly restored, his limbs partially so. Time was thus
                     mercifully given to him also to seek forgiveness and to amend his ways, by the
                     help of God's grace.
                  Thus in a brief space, and in God's own way, was broken up and dispersed that
                     iniquitous band of forgers, never to be again united in the bonds of sin. It
                     had been a deep-laid and skilful scheme of crime. They had obtained some of the
                     paper specially prepared for the Bank of England. The imitation of the notes
                     was perfect. But for the system of numbering the true notes by the bank,
                     detection might have been difficult. It was on this ground they tempted Mr.
                     Carpenter to be an accomplice. It was merely making, they represented to him, a
                     small addition to the currency of the country, with notes so perfect that no
                     loss would fall upon those into whose hands they might come.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER X.
                  THE FAMILY RE-UNITED.
                  SINCE Mr. and Mrs. Carpenter had quitted their home, a month had elapsed,—a
                     month of reflection, of repentance, and so of priceless value to their immortal
                     souls. They had indeed gone forth weeping, but yet in their penitence bearing
                     precious seed; and that seed had grown, and sprung up, and brought forth
                     plentifully: and now, laden with fruits meet for repentance, they returned.
                  Oh! what a joyful day was that which saw the father and mother again clasping
                     their beloved ones to their hearts; their children's bright, healthy, happy
                     appearance proclaiming the tender, Christian care Jenny had taken of them
                     during their absence! And the good Jenny herself looked so sunny, so gladsome,
                     as, waiting to receive them, her honest face beaming all over with pure
                     delight, she watched the heartfelt joy of the meeting between parents and
                     children, that Mrs. Carpenter impulsively threw her arm round the neck of her
                     faithful friend and servant, and, kissed her sunburnt cheek with such
                     affectionate warmth, that excited into a forgetfulness of all distinction of
                     rank, Jenny returned the embrace of her mistress as lovingly as though she had
                     been her own sister.
                  As it was, however, the weight of responsibility that had rested on Jenny, more
                     especially because of the secret mystery involving the departure of her
                     employers, and which had been in part confided to her, added to the painful
                     misgivings she could not banish from
                     her mind concerning her last interview with John Brock,—all this had so thinned
                     and paled the poor girl, that her kind mistress came to the conclusion she must
                     be home-sick; and, as soon as she and her husband were again peacefully
                     settled, she immediately sent Jenny back to her native village for a change of
                     air and scene.
                  As might be expected, upon her return, she, with low, faltering tone and
                     blushing cheeks, informed Mrs. Carpenter she should be obliged to leave in a
                     month, as she was going to be married.
                  "O Jenny! you naughty girl!—how could you play me such a trick?" exclaimed her
                     mistress in a merry voice, but with feelings of truer sorrow than she had ever
                     experienced at parting with a servant before.
                  "Is it to that nice man you wouldn't walk with?" inquired the little Fanny,
                     catching her by the hand, and gazing up eagerly into her face.
                  "Yes, dear," murmured Jenny.
                  "Then he's not your brother really?"
                  "No: he's not my brother. How can he be?"
                  Thereupon followed an account by little Fanny of that evening's interview with
                     John, and Jane's refusal to walk with him, and his own seeming approval of her
                     conduct,—all which served yet more to enhance the high opinion Mrs. Carpenter
                     already entertained of Jenny, her friends, and her family.
                  And now my tale draws to a close. Suspicion of any hand in the great forgery
                     affair did not fall on Mr. Carpenter. God mercifully spared him this exposure.
                     Perhaps he saw that the man's weak mortal nature could not have borne the
                     disgrace and ruin that would have come upon him and those he loved better than himself,—saw, and, seeing his
                     true penitence, in mercy stayed his arm, that it smote him not.
                  News of the affliction that had so summarily cut short the career of their
                     companion Hunt reached Marsden and Brush, and let us hope so confirmed them in
                     the conviction of God's avenging hand having overtaken their whole party, that
                     they strove honestly to lead a new life,—to become henceforth as good and
                     useful members of society as they had hitherto been bad and dangerous.
                  Whatever could be done by Mr. Carpenter to lessen the trials of those who had
                     suffered by the forgeries was done, at much self-denial for a time; but before
                     long he had it in his power to make ampler reparation. No suspicion had fallen
                     upon him. Old Mr. Crawford had always liked him, and was now so pleased with
                     his increased zeal and attention, that he recommended him strongly as his
                     successor in the management of the bank. With thankful, humble hearts, the
                     husband and wife ever remembered the time of their temptation and fall. Of them
                     it might be truly said, "They were saved so as by fire."
               
            
            THE END.
