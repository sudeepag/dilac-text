                  INTRODUCTION.
                  DOUBTS SUGGESTED.
                  "MOTHER, have I ever been baptized?"
                  The questioner was a bright, intelligent, blue-eyed lad, some thirteen summers
                     old. The deep seriousness of his countenance, and the earnest, wistful gaze
                     with which he looked into his mother's face, showed that, for the moment at
                     least, the question seemed to him a very important one.
                  "Certainly, my son; both you and your sister were baptized by the Rev. Doctor
                     Fisher, at the time when I united with the church. Your sister remembers it
                     well, for she was six years old; but you were too young to know any thing about
                     it. Your aunt Jones said it was the most solemn scene she ever witnessed; and
                     such a prayer as the good old Doctor made for you I never heard before."
                  "But,-mother, rejoined the lad, sister and I have been down to the river to see
                     a lady baptized by the Baptist minister who came here last month and commenced
                     preaching in the school house. They went down into the river, and then he plunged her under the water and
                     quickly raised her out again. And sister says if that was baptism,
                     then we were not-baptized, because we stood on the dry floor of the church, and
                     the preacher dipped his hand into a bowl of water and sprinkled a few drops on
                     our foreheads. And she says cousin John Jones was not baptized either; for the
                     preacher only took a little pitcher of water, and poured a little stream upon
                     his head. Sister says she don't see how there can be three
                     baptisms, when the scripture says, one Lord, one faith, one
                     baptism."
                  "Your sister is always studying about things above her reach, my son. It is
                     better for young people like you not to trouble yourselves too much about these
                     knotty questions in theology."
                  "But, mother, this don't seem to me to be a knotty question at all. One
                     minister takes a person down into the water, and dips her under it; another
                     stands on the dry floor of the church before the pulpit, and sprinkles a few
                     drops into her face; another pours a little stream upon her head. Now, any body
                     can see that they do three different things; and if each of them
                     is baptism, then there must be three baptisms There is no theology about that,
                     is there?"
                  "Yes, my child, this is a theological question; and I suppose it must be a very
                     difficult one, since I am told that some very good and wise men disagree about
                     it."
                  "But, mother, they all agree that there is only one baptism, do they not? And
                     if there is only one, why don't they just look into the Testament and see what
                     it is? If the Testament says sprinkle, then it is sprinkling; if
                        it says pour, then it is pouring; if it says dip, then it is
                     dipping. I mean to read the Testament, and see if I cannot decide which it is
                     for myself."
                  "Do you think, my son, that you will be able to know as much about it as your
                     uncle Jones, or Dr. Fisher, who baptized you, or Dr. Barnes, whose notes you
                     use in learning your Sunday School lesson, and all the pious and learned
                     ministers of our church, and the Methodist church, and the Episcopal church?
                     They have studied the Testament through and through, and they all agree that a
                     child who is sprinkled is properly baptized."
                  "Yes, mother, but if the baptisms in the New Testament were sprinkling, (and of
                     course they were, or such wise and good men would not say so,) why can't
                        I find it there, as well as any body?"
                  "Very well, my son, you can read and see; but if you should happen to come to a
                     different conclusion from these great and learned men, I hope you won't set up
                     your boyish judgment against that of the wisest theologians of the age. But
                     here comes your sister. I wonder if she is going to become a theologian
                     too!"
                  Mrs. Ernest (the mother of whom we are speaking) was born of very worthy
                     parents, who were consistent members of the Presbyterian church; and she had
                     grown up as one of "the baptized children of the church." As she "appeared to
                     be sober and steady, and to have sufficient knowledge to discern the Lord's
                     body," she was doubtless informed, according to the directions of the
                     confession of faith, page 504, that it was "her duty and her privilege to come
                     to the Lord's supper." But she had felt no inclination to do so until after the
                     death of her husband. Then in the day of her sorrow, she looked upward and
                     began to feel a new though not an intense interest in the things of religion.
                     She made a public profession, and requested baptism for her two children.
                  The little boy was then an infant, and his sister was about six years old, a
                     sprightly, interesting child, whose flowing ringlets, dimpled chin, rosy cheeks, and
                     sparkling eyes, were the admiration of every beholder.
                  Twelve years had passed. The lovely girl had become a beautiful and remarkably
                     intelligent young lady. The little babe had grown into the noble looking,
                     blue-eyed lad, with a strong, manly frame, and a face and brow which gave
                     promise of capacity and independence of thought far above the average of his
                     companions.
                  Theodosia and Edwin. How they loved each other! She, with the doting affection
                     of an elder child and only sister, who had watched the earliest developments of
                     his mind, and been his companion and his teacher from his infancy; he, with the
                     confiding, reverential yet familiar love of a kindhearted and impulsive boy, to
                     one who was to him the standard at once of female beauty and womanly
                     accomplishments.
                  Theodosia came in not with that elastic step and sprightly, air which was
                     habitual with her; but with a slow and solemn gait, scarcely raising her eyes
                     to meet her mother's inquiring gaze, she passed through to her own room and
                     closed the door.
                  The mother was struck with the deep and earnest seriousness of her face and
                     manner. What could it mean? What could have happened to distress
                     her child?
                  "Edwin, my son, what is the matter with your sister?"
                  "Indeed, mother, I do not know of any thing. We stood together talking, at the
                     river bank, and just before we left Mr. Percy came up to walk home with her. It
                     must be something that has happened by the way."
                  The mother's mind was relieved. Mr. Percy had been for many months a frequent
                     and welcome visitor at their pretty cottage, and had made no secret of his
                     admiration of her accomplished and beautiful daughter; though he had never,
                     until a few weeks since, formally declared his love Mrs. Ernest did not doubt
                     but that some lovers' quarrel had grown up in their walk, and this had cast the
                     shadow upon Theodosia's sunny face. She waited somewhat impatiently for her
                     daughter to come out and confirm her conjectures. She did not come, however,
                     and at length the mother arose, and softly opening the door, looked into the
                     room. Theodosia was on her knees. She did not hear the door, or become
                     conscious of the presence of her mother. In broken, whispered sentences,
                     mingled with sobs, she prayed: "Oh Lord, enlighten my mind. Oh, teach me thy
                     way. Let me not err in the understanding of thy word, and oh give me strength,
                     I do beseech Thee, to do whatever I find to be my duty. I would not go wrong.
                     Help! oh help me to go right!"
                  Awe-struck and confounded, Mrs. Ernest drew back, and tremblingly awaited the
                     explanation she so much desired to hear.
                  When at length the young lady came out, there was still upon her face the same
                     serious earnestness of expression, but there seemed less of sadness, and there
                     was also that perfect repose of the countenance, which is the result of a newly
                     formed, but firmly settled determination of purpose.
                  Mrs. Ernest, as she looked at her, was more perplexed than ever. She was,
                     however, resolved to obtain at once a solution of the mystery.
                  "Mr. Percy walked home with you, did he not, my daughter?"
                  "Yes, mother."
                  "Did you find him as interesting as usual? What was the subject of your
                     conversation?"
                  "We were talking of the baptism at the river.
                  "Of nothing else?"
                  "No, mother, this occupied all the time."
                  
                  "Did he say nothing about himself?"
                  "Not a word, mother, except in regard to the question whether he had ever been
                     baptized."
                  "Why, what in the world has possessed you all? Your brother came running home
                     to ask me if he had been baptized; Mr. Percy is talking about
                     whether he has been baptized. I wonder if you are not beginning to
                     fancy that you have never been baptized?"
                  "I do indeed begin to doubt it, mother, for if that was baptism
                     which we witnessed at the river this evening, I am quite sure that I never
                     was."
                  "Well, I do believe that Baptist preacher is driving you all crazy. Pray tell
                     me, what did he do or say, that gave you such a serious face, and put these new
                     crotchets in your head?"
                  "Nothing at all, mother. He simply read from the New Testament the account of
                     the baptism of Jesus and of the Eunuch. Then he took the candidate and they
                     went down both of them into the water, and he baptized her, and then they came
                     up out of the water. I could not help seeing that this is just what is recorded
                     of Jesus and the Eunuch. If so, then it is the baptism of the scriptures; and
                     it is certainly a very different thing from that which was done to
                     me, when Dr. Fisher sprinkled a few drops of water in my face."
                  "Of course, my dear, it was different; but I don't think the quantity of
                        water employed affects the validity of the baptism. There is no
                     virtue in the water, and a few drops are just as good as all the floods of
                     Jordan."
                  "But, mother, it is not in the quantity of water, that the difference consists:
                     it is in the act performed. One sprinkles a little
                     water in the face; another pours a little water on the head;
                     another buries the whole body under the water,
                      and raises it out again. Two apply the
                     water to the person; the other plunges the person into the water. They are
                     surely very different acts; and if what I saw this evening was scriptural
                     baptism, then it is certain that I have never been baptized."
                  "Well, my child, we won't dispute about it now; but I hope you are not thinking
                     about leaving your own church; the church in which your grandfather and your
                     grandmother lived and died: and in which so many of the most talented and
                     influential families in the country are proud to rank themselves, to unite with
                     this little company of ignorant, ill-mannered mechanics and common people, who
                     have all at once started up here from nothing."
                  "You know, my mother, that it is about a year since I made a profession of
                     religion. I trust that before I did so, I had given myself up to do the will of
                     my Heavenly Father. Since then I have felt that I am not my own. I am bought
                     with a price. It is my pleasure, as well as my duty, to obey my Saviour. I ask
                     as Paul did, Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do? You taught me
                     this lesson of obedience yourself; and I am sure you would not have me on any
                     account neglect or refuse to obey my Saviour. If HE commands me to be baptized,
                     and the command has never been obeyed, I shall be obliged to do
                     it. And I trust my mother will encourage me in my obedience to that
                     precious Redeemer she taught me to love."
                  One who looked into the mother's face, at that moment, might have read there "a
                     tablet of unutterable thoughts." She did not try to speak them. We will not try
                     to write them. She sat silent for a moment, drew her breath deeply and heavily,
                     then rising hastily, went to look for something in her daughter's room.
                  Theodosia was not only grieved but surprised at the evident dent distress which she had given her mother.
                     While on her knees in prayer to God after her return from the river, she had
                     determined to do her duty, and obey the commandment
                     of Jesus Christ, her blessed Saviour, whatever she might find it to be. But she
                     had not determined to be immersed. That river
                     Baptism, connected with the reading of those passages of Scripture, had only
                     filled her mind with doubts; these doubts had yet to become convictions. The
                     investigation was yet to be made. The question, Have I ever been baptized? had
                     been prayerfully asked. It was yet to be conscientiously answered. But if the
                     very doubt was so distressing to her mother, and so ridiculous to Mr. Percy,
                     (as it had seemed to be from some remarks he made on the way home from the
                     river) how would the final decision affect them, if it should be made in favor
                     of immersion! Yet, aided by power from on high, she felt her resolution grow
                     still stronger to please God rather than those whom she loved better than all
                     else on earth. And she had peace verging almost on joy.
                  When her mother came back, Theodosia saw that she had been weeping; but no
                     further allusion was made to the subject of Baptism, until Mr. Percy came in
                     after supper.
                  This young man was a lawyer. He had united with the Presbyterian Society, to
                     which Mrs. Ernest and her daughter belonged, during an extensive revival of
                     religion, while he was yet a mere boy. Since he had come to years of maturity,
                     he had constantly doubted whether he was really a converted man, and often
                     seriously regretted the obligation that bound him to a public recognition of
                     the claims of personal religion. He often made it convenient to be absent when
                     the Sacrament of the Supper was to be celebrated, from an inward consciousness
                     that he was an unfit communicant; yet his externa deportment was
                     unexceptionable, and his brethren regarded him as a most excellent member, and
                     one whose intellectual capacity and acquirements would, one day, place him in a
                     condition to reflect great honor on the denomination to which he belonged.
                  He had already taken a high position in the ranks of his profession; and had
                     come to the sage conclusion that the possession of the heart and hand of the
                     charming Theodosia was all that was required to complete his arrangements for
                     worldly happiness; and having overheard her remark to her brother, that if what
                     they had just witnessed was baptism, they had never been baptized, he hastened
                     to her side, and on their way home exerted all his powers of railery to drive
                     this new conception from her mind.
                  As for himself he had never had a serious thought upon the question. He had
                     been told that he was baptized in his infancy, and took it for
                     granted that all was right. He had very serious doubts about his ever having
                     been converted, but never the shadow of a doubt whether he had been baptized.
                     When he listened to the religious conversation of some of his friends, and
                     especially of the young lady of whom we are speaking, he heard many expressions
                     which to him, were meaningless, and seemed almost fanatical. They talked of
                     sorrows which he had never felt; of joys, the source of which he could not
                     understand; and strangest of all to him, appeared that habitual subjection to
                     the Master's will which led them to ask so constantly and so
                     earnestly not what was desirable to themselves or agreeable to those about
                     them, but what was required by the command of Christ.
                  That one should do this, or that under the conviction that to refuse or neglect
                     to do so would endanger their soul's salvation, he could easily
                     understand, but how any one could attach much importance to any act not
                        absolutely essential
                     
                     to obtain eternal life, was to his mind an unfathomable mystery.
                     He had himself determined to secure his own soul's salvation at
                     any cost, and if he had believed that immersion would insure
                        salvation, he would have been immersed a hundred times had so much
                     been required. But thinking it as easy to get to heaven without as with it, the
                     whole business of baptism seemed to him as of the slightest imaginable
                     consequence.
                  "What difference does it make to you, Miss Ernest," said he, "whether you have
                     been baptized or not? Baptism is not essential to salvation."
                  "True," she replied, "but if my Saviour commanded me to be
                     baptized, and I have never done it, I have not obeyed him. I must, so far as I
                     can, keep all his commandments."
                  "But who of us ever does this? I am sure I have not kept them all. I am not
                     certain that I know what they all are. If our salvation depended on perfect
                     obedience to all his commandments, I doubt if any body would be saved but you.
                     You are the only person I ever knew who had no faults."
                  "Oh! Mr. Percy, do not trifle with such a subject. It is not a matter of
                     jesting. I do not perfectly obey. I wish I could. I am grieved at heart day
                     after day to see how far I fall short of his requirement. Oh, no. I do not hope
                     or seek for salvation by my obedience. If I am ever saved, it will be by
                     boundless mercy freely forgiving me. But then if I love my
                     Saviour, how can I wilfully refuse obedience to his
                        requirements? I do not obey to secure heaven by my
                     obedience, but to please Him who died to make it possible for a
                     poor lost sinner like me ever to enter heaven. I think I would endeavor to do
                     his will even if there were no heaven and no hell."
                  Mr Percy did not understand this. If he had been convinced vinced
                     that there was no heaven and no hell, he felt quite sure that all the rites,
                     and rules, and ceremonies of religion would give him very little
                     trouble. It was only in order to save his soul that he meddled
                     with religion at all, and all that could be dispensed with, without endangering
                        his own final salvation, he regarded as of very little
                     consequence. He read some portion of the Scriptures almost every day (when
                     business was not too pressing). He said over a form of prayer; and sometimes
                     went to the communion table, because he regarded these as religious duties, in
                     the performance of which, and by leading a moral life, he had some indistinct
                     conception that he was working out for himself eternal salvation.
                     Take away this one object, and he had no further use for religion or religious
                     ordinances.
                  "I know," said he, "that you are a more devoted Christian than I ever hope to
                     be, but you surely cannot regard baptism as any part of religion. It is a mere
                     form. A simple ceremony. Only an outward act of the body not
                     affecting the heart or the mind. Why, even the Baptists themselves, though they
                     talk so much about it, and attach so much importance to it, admit that true
                     believers can be saved without it."
                  "That is not the question in my mind, Mr. Percy. I do not ask whether it
                        is essential to salvation, but whether it is commanded
                     in the Word of God. I do not feel at liberty to sin as much as I can, without
                     abandoning the hope that God will finally forgive me. I cannot think of
                     following my Saviour as far off as I can, without resigning my hopes of heaven.
                     Why should I venture as near the verge of hell as I can go
                     without falling in? My Saviour died upon the cross for my salvation. I trust in
                     HIM to save me. But He says, 'If ye love me, keep my
                     commandments'—not this one or that one, but all his commandments.
                     How can I pretend to love, if I do not
                     obey him? If he commands me to be baptized, and I have not done it, I
                        must do it yet. And if that which we saw at the river
                     was baptism, then I have never been baptized."
                  "And so you think that all the learned world are wrong, and this shoe-maker,
                     turned preacher, is right; that our parents are no better than heathens, and a
                     young lady of eighteen is bound to teach them their duty and set them a good
                     example. Really it will be a feast to the poor Baptists to know what a triumph
                     they have gained. It will be considered quite respectable to be immersed after
                     Miss Theodosia Ernest has gone into the water."
                  "Oh, Mr. Percy," said the young lady, (and her eyes were filled with tears)
                     "how can you talk thus lightly of an ordinance of Jesus Christ? Was it not
                     respectable to be immersed after the glorious Son of God had gone into the
                     water? If my dear Redeemer was immersed, and requires it of me, I am sure I
                     need not hesitate to associate with those who follow his example
                     and obey his commandments, even though they should be poor, and
                     ignorant, and ungenteel."
                  "Forgive me, Miss Ernest, I did not intend to offend you; but really the idea
                     did appear exceedingly ridiculous to me that a young lady who had never spent a
                     single month in the exclusive study of Theology, should set herself up so
                     suddenly as a teacher of Doctors of Divinity. If sprinkling were not baptism,
                     we surely have talent, and piety, and learning enough in our church to have
                     discovered the error and abandoned the practice long ago. But pardon me. I will
                     not say one word to dissuade you from an investigation of the subject. And I am
                     very sure, when you have studied it carefully, you will be more thoroughly
                     convinced than ever before of the truth of our doctrines and the correctness of
                     our practice. If you will permit, I will assist you in the examination; for I
                     wish to look into the subject a little, to fortify my own mind with some
                     arguments against these new-comers, as I understand there are several others of
                     our members who are almost as nearly convinced that they have never been
                     baptized as you are, and I expect to be obliged to have an occasional
                     discussion, in a quiet way."
                  "Oh, yes. I shall be so happy to have your assistance. You are so much more
                     capable of eliciting the truth than I am. When shall we begin?"
                  "To-night, if you please. I will call in after supper, and we will read over
                     the testimony."
                  They parted at her mother's door. He went to his office, revolving in his mind
                     the arguments that would be most likely to satisfy her doubts. She retired to
                     her closet and poured out her heart to God in earnest prayer for wisdom to
                        know, and strength to do all her Heavenly Master's
                     will, whatever it might be; and before she rose from her knees, had been
                     enabled to resolve, with full determination of purpose, to obey the
                     commandment, even though it caused the loss of all things for Christ. The only
                     question in her heart was now, "Lord, what wilt Thou have me to
                     do?"
                  True to his promise, Mr. Percy came in soon after supper, anticipating an easy
                     victory over the doubts and difficulties which had so suddenly suggested
                     themselves to the mind of his intended bride. He could not help admiring her
                     more, and loving her better, for that independence of thought and conscientious
                     regard for right, which made the discussion necessary; and it gratified his
                     vanity to think how fine a field he should have to display those powers of
                     argument which he had sedulously cultivated for the advantage of his
                     professional pursuits.
                  How he succeeded will be seen in the next chapter.

                  FIRST NIGHT'S STUDY.
                  "NOW, Miss Theodosia," said he, "let us begin by examining the witnesses. When
                     we have collected all the testimony, we shall be able to sum up on the case,
                     and you shall bring in the verdict."
                  "That is right," said she, with a smile, the first that had illumined her face
                     since she stood by the water, "'To the law and to the testimony; if they speak
                     not according to his word, it is because there is no light in
                     them.' Here, may it please the court) is the record," handing him a well-worn
                     copy of the New Testament.
                  "Well, how are we to get at the point about which we are at issue? It is
                     agreed, I believed, that Jesus Christ commanded his disciples, in all ages, to
                     be baptized."
                  "Yes, sir, I so understand it."
                  "Then it would seem that our question is a very simple one. It is, whether you
                     and I, and others who, like us, have been sprinkled in their infancy, have ever
                     been baptized? In other words, Is the sprinkling of infants, in the name
                        of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the baptism which is required in this
                        book?"
                  "That is the question," she replied. "I merely want to know if I was ever
                     baptized. I was sprinkled in the church. That lady, to-day, was
                        immersed into the river. If she was baptized,
                        I was not. That is the point. There is but one baptism. Which
                     is it? the sprinkling or the dipping?"
                  
                  "Oh, if that is all, we can soon settle the question. Sprinkling and pouring
                     and dipping are all baptism. Baptism is the application of water
                     as a religious ordinance. It don't matter as to the mode of
                     application. It may be done one way or another, so that it is done with the
                        right design. I see from what your difficulty has arisen. You
                     have misapprehended the nature of the word baptize. You have considered it a
                     specific, rather than a generic term."
                  "I don't know, Mr. Percy, whether I quite comprehend you. My difficulty arose
                     from a conviction that the baptism, which we witnessed to-day, was just such a
                     one as is described in the Scriptures, where they went down into the
                        water and came up out of the water—whereas
                        my baptism had nothing about it that at all resembled the
                     scriptural pattern. Please don't try to mystify the subject, but let us see
                     which was the real baptism."
                  "I did not design to mystify the subject, but to bring it into a clearer light.
                     The meaning expressed by some words, is rather a result than an
                        act. If I say to my servant, go down to the
                     office, he may run there, or walk there, or
                        ride there, and he obeys me, equally, which ever he does—so
                     that he gets there, it is all I require of him. Go, then, is a
                        generic or general word, including a possible variety of acts.
                     If I say to him, run down to the office, he does not obey unless
                     he goes in this specified manner. So we call run a
                        specific term. That is very plain, is it not?"
                  "Certainly, Mr. Percy, I comprehend that."
                  "Well, then, I say that baptize is a generic term. Jesus Christ
                     said, baptize all nations. He does not say whether you shall do it by
                     sprinkling, or pouring, or dipping; so that you attain the end proposed, you
                     may do it as you please. If He had said, sprinkle all nations; that is
                     specific, and his ministers must have sprinkled. If he had said
                        pour upon them with water, that is a specific act, and they
                     must all have poured. If he had said, dip them in water, then they must all
                     have dipped. The word would have required it. But he used the general term
                     baptize, which signified any application of water as a religious
                        ordinance, and of course it does not matter as to the mode. You may
                     take your choice."
                  "But I should, even in that case," said she, "feel inclined to choose the
                        same mode that HE did, and which the early
                        disciples did. There must have been some reason for his preference.
                     But how do you determine that the word baptize is a generic term, as you call
                     it—having three or four different meanings?"
                  "Simply by reference to the dictionary. Look at Webster. He is good authority;
                     is he not? He defines baptism to be the application of water as a religious
                     ordinance. What more do you want?"
                  "But, Mr. Percy," said Edwin, who had been a silent, but very attentive
                     listener, "the Baptist preacher told Mr. Anxious, the other day, that baptize
                     and baptism were not English words at all, but the Greek words baptizo and baptismos, transferred into the English Bible and not translated.
                     He said that King James would not permit the translators to translate
                        all the words, for fear of disturbing the faith and practice of
                     the church of England, and so they just kept the Greek word—but if they had
                     translated it at all, it must had read dip or immerse instead of baptize."
                  "Very well, Edwin, but it is not likely that the Baptist preacher is much wiser
                     than Presbyterian preachers, or Methodist preachers, or Episcopal preachers. If
                     dip had been the necessary, or even the common meaning of the word, it is very
                     improbable that it would have remained for this unlearned and obscure seat to
                     have discovered it. Such statements
                     ments may do very well to delude their simple followers, but they cannot be
                     expected to impose upon the educated world.
                  "But, Mr. Percy, I have looked up the words in my Greek Lexicon, and I find
                        it is just as he said—Baptizo does mean to
                     immerse. Baptismos does mean immersion."
                  "Oh, as to that, I suppose you got hold of a Baptist Lexicon."
                  "Well, here it is; Donegan's Greek Lexicon. You can look for yourself."
                  Mr. Percy, (who, if he was not a thorough Greek scholar, yet knew enough of the
                     language to read it readily,) glanced at the word where Edwin had marked it,
                     and ran his eye along the cognate words.
                  "Baptizo—To immerse repeatedly into a liquid,
                     to submerge, to soak thoroughly, to saturate.
                  
                     Baptisis or Baptismos, immersion; Baptisma,
                     an object immersed; Baptistes, one who
                     immerses; Baptos, immersed, dyed; Bapto, to dip, to plunge into water, etc."
                  He was astonished. The thought had never occurred to him before, that baptize
                     was not an English, but a Greek word; and that he should look in the
                        Greek Lexicon, rather than Webster's Dictionary, to ascertain
                     its real meaning, as it occurred in the New Testament. He turned
                     to the title page and preface for some evidence that this was a
                        Baptist Lexicon, but learned that it was published under the
                     supervision of some of the Faculty of the Presbyterian Theological Seminary at
                     Princeton, N. J.; the very head quarters of orthodox Presbyterianism.
                  Here was a new phase of the subject. He could only promise to look into this
                     point more particularly the next day; when, he said, he would procure several
                     different Lexicons, by different authors, and compare them with each other.
                  "In the meantime," said Theodosia, "there is an idea that strikes my mind very
                     forcibly; and that is, that the Saviour himself has fixed, by his
                     own act, the meaning of the word as he employed it."
                  "How so, Miss Theodosia?"
                  "Just in this way; suppose we admit that it had a dozen meanings before he used
                     it, and that in other books it has a dozen meanings still, yet it is certain
                     that he was baptized. Now, in HIS BAPTISM a certain
                        act was performed. It may have been sprinkling, pouring, or
                     dipping; but whatever it was, that act was what HE meant by
                     baptism. That act was what HE commanded. His disciples must
                        so have understood it. He gave (if I may speak so) a Divine sanction
                     to that meaning. And when the word was afterwards used in reference to His
                        ordinance, it could never have any other. If He was immersed,
                     then the question is decided, baptism is immersion. If He was sprinkled,
                     baptism is sprinkling. If He was poured upon, baptism is pouring. So we need
                     not trouble ourselves about the Lexicons, but can get all our information from
                     the Testament itself."
                  "There is a great deal of force in that suggestion, Miss Theodosia. It is a
                     pity you could not be a lawyer. (And he thought what a partner for a lawyer she
                     would be, and how happy it was for him that he had been able to persuade her to
                     promise to become Mrs. Percy.) But while it is true that we may
                     find all the testimony that we need within the record, yet it is important that
                     we get at the real meaning of the record. And as that was written
                     in Greek, I see no reason why we should not seek in the Greek for its true
                     sense. If Baptizo means to dip, and Baptismos means a dipping an immersion, we shall be
                     obliged to rest our cause upon some other ground. There must, however, be some
                     mistake about this. I will look into it to-morrow."
                  
                  "I do not care what the Lexicons say,' rejoined Theodosia, "I want to get my
                     instructions entirely out of the word of God. I don't wish to go out of the
                     'record,' as you lawyers say."
                  "You are right in that; but how are we to learn the meaning of the
                        record? If any document is brought into court, it is a rule of law,
                     founded on common sense, that the words which it contains are to be understood
                     in their most common, every-day sense, according to the usage of the language
                     in which they are written. Now this document, the New Testament,
                     it seems, was written in Greek, and we are in doubt about the
                     meaning of one of the words. We go to the Lexicon, not for any
                     testimony as to the facts of the case, but only to learn the meaning of a very
                     important word used by the witnesses. Matthew and several other witnesses
                     depose that Jesus and others were baptized. If they were present
                     in court, we would ask them what they mean by that word, baptize. We would
                     require them to describe in other language, the act which was
                     performed—to tell us whether it was a sprinkling, a pouring, or a dipping. But
                     as we cannot bring them personally into court, we must ascertain what they
                     meant in the best way we can; and that is by a careful examination of the words
                     which they used, and the meaning that would have been attached to them at the
                     time they used them, by the people to whom they were addressed. Now as the
                     documents were written in Greek, of course they used words in the common Greek
                     sense. And we must ascertain their meaning just as we would any other Greek
                     word in any other Greek author; and that is by reference to the Lexicons or
                     Dictionaries of the Greek language."
                  "Very well, Mr. Percy, you talk like a judge. But what if you find all the
                     Lexicons agree with this? What if they all say that the word means dip, plunge,
                     immerse?"
                  "Why then, we must either admit that those who are said to have been baptized,
                     were plunged, dipped, immersed, or deny the correctness of the Lexicons."
                  "But if you deny the correctness of the Lexicons in regard to this word, what
                     confidence can we have in them in regard to other words? Brother Edwin is
                     studying Greek, and as often as he comes to a word which he has not met with
                     before, he finds it in the Lexicon, and so learns its meaning; but if the
                     Lexicons are wrong in this word they may be wrong in all. Is there no appeal
                     from the authority of the Lexicons?"
                  "Certainly, we may do in Greek as we do every day in English studies; we appeal
                     from Johnson to Webster, and from Webster to Walker, and from Walker to
                     Worcester. If one does not suit us we may go to another."
                  "One more question. Are any of these Lexicons Baptist books, made
                     for the purpose of teaching Baptist sentiments? If so, you know
                     they might be doubtful testimony.'
                  "On the contrary, the Lexicons are made by classical scholars for the sole
                     purpose of aiding students in the acquisition of the Greek language. I do not
                     suppose any one of them was made with any reference to Theological questions,
                     and probably no one of them by a person connected with the Baptist
                     denomination. It is certain most of them were not, and if they all
                        agree in regard to this word, it must be conceded that they did not
                     give it a meaning to suit their personal Theological views. There are a number
                     of them in the College library, and I will examine them all tomorrow, and tell
                     you the result."
                  Mr. Percy went back to his office studying the new phase of the question,
                     presented in the meaning of the word. If Baptizo in the Greek means to dip, in
                     its primary, common, every-day use, Jesus Christ was dipped. Then every time the record says a person was
                     baptized, it expressly says he was dipped. I wonder if it can possibly be so.
                     If so, why have our wise and talented preachers never discovered it? or knowing
                     it, can it be possible that they have systematically concealed
                     it?"
                  Theodosia retired to her chamber, where she spent a few moments in prayer to
                     God for the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and then took her Testament and read
                     how they were baptized of John in the river of Jordan. How Jesus,
                     after he was baptized came up out of the water. How they went down
                     both into the water, both Philip and the Eunuch, and he baptized
                     him, and when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of
                     the Lord caught away Philip. She compared these statements with what she had
                     seen at the river, and did not need any testimony from the
                        Lexicons to satisfy her that John's baptism and Philip's
                     baptism was immersion. Why else did they go into the water? Why else was it
                     done in the river? Ministers don't go into the river to sprinkle their subjects
                     now-a-days. There was no reason for doing it then. Must I then unite with this
                     obscure sect and be immersed? Must I break away from the communion that I love
                     so dearly—from all my friends and relatives? Must I part from my dear old
                     pastor, who was, under God, the means of my conversion—who has so often
                     counselled me, prayed with me and for me, wept over me and cherished me as
                     though I had been his own child? The very thought was terrible. She threw
                     herself on her bed and wept aloud. Her crying brought her mother to her side.
                     She kneeled beside the bed, took the poor girl's hand in both of hers, and bade
                     her try to banish this distressing subject from her thoughts. It was not worth
                     while, she said, for a young girl like her to set up her own opinions, or even
                     to entertain doubts in opposition to her minister and others who had spent
                     their lives in the study of this very thing. As for herself, if her pastor, Mr.
                     Johnson, said any thing was in the Bible, she always took it for granted
                        it was there. He had more time to look into these things than she
                     had. It was his business to do it; and he was better qualified to do it than
                     any of his people. And of course, if sprinkling was not true baptism, he would
                     never have practiced it.
                  "But, mother," sobbed the weeping girl, "I must answer to God, and
                     not to pastor Johnson. Much as I love him, I trust I love my Saviour better;
                     and if my pastor says one thing and Jesus Christ
                        another, Mr. Johnson himself has often told us to obey God
                     rather than man. I have no choice, I must obey my Saviour."
                  "Of course you must, my child; but Mr. Johnson knows better what the Saviour
                     commands than you do. He understands all about these questions. And he will
                     assure you that you have been properly baptized. I know that he agrees exactly
                     with Dr. Fisher, who baptized you, as you yourself well remember."
                  "I remember that he sprinkled a little water in my face, mother; but if that
                     was baptism which I witnessed to-day, he certainly did not baptize
                     me."
                  "Well, my dear, try and compose yourself and go to sleep; and I will send for
                     our pastor to come and see you to-morrow. He will soon satisfy your mind."
                  "I hope he may; and I will try to sleep. Good night, mother."
               
               
                  
                  THE SECOND NIGHT'S STUDY

                  SECOND NIGHT'S STUDY.
                  PUNCTUAL to his promise, Mr. Percy came in soon after supper on the next
                     evening, and found the Rev. Mr. Johnson, the pastor of their church, already
                     there. He had called early to take a social cup of tea, having learned that
                     Theodosia was "like to go crazy about these new-fangled Baptist notions."
                  He did not think she looked much like a maniac, however, though there was a
                     deep and saddened seriousness upon her face. Nor did she act like
                     a maniac, for never before had she seemed so respectfully affectionate to him
                     and to her mother.
                  He had not said a word upon the subject of dispute, and seemed reluctant to
                     approach it; but when Mr. Percy came in, it could no longer be postponed.
                  "I am very glad to meet you here, Mr. Johnson," said the young man. "Miss
                     Theodosia and I had quite a discussion yesterday evening on the subject of
                     baptism. She has taken a fancy that she has never been baptized; and I believe
                     that I nearly exhausted my logic in trying to convince her that she had. I hope
                     your arguments will be more effectual than mine."
                  "Really, my children, I don't know," said the old man, "what I may be able to
                     do; I have never studied these controversies much; I think it is better to live
                     in peace and let every one enjoy his own conscientious opinion. These
                        discussions cussions are apt to run
                     into disputes and quarrels, and often occasion a great deal of ill-feeling. I
                     have known them to divide churches, and even families. It is better to avoid
                     them."
                  "But what are we to do with such lovely heretics as this?" said the young man,
                     with a smile and a sly glance towards her mother. "She must be satisfied that
                     she has been baptized, or you will have her running to the school-house next
                     Sunday, to hear that uneducated Baptist preacher, and ten to one, she will ask
                     him to go down into the water and baptize her according to the New Testament
                     model. She says she wants to be baptized as Jesus Christ was, and that was in
                     the river you know."
                  "Oh, as to that," rejoined the pastor, "there is no evidence that Jesus Christ
                     was immersed in the river at all. It has been satisfactorily proved that he was
                     sprinkled or poured upon; and it is very certain that sprinkling was practiced
                     by the apostles and early Christians."
                  "Oh, I am so glad to hear you say that," replied the young lady. "You don't
                     know what a load it has taken off my mind. Do tell me how it is
                        ascertained that Christ did not go into the river, and what
                        evidence there is that he was sprinkled; and it was sprinkling which
                     he commanded You can't imagine how anxious I am to know."
                  "Well, I don't know that I can call up all the evidence just at
                     this time, and we would not have time to go over it, if I could; but you may be
                     assured that there is such evidence, and that of the most
                        satisfactory character, or else all the learned and talented
                     Theological scholars of the various Pædobaptist churches would not have
                     continued for so many ages to teach and practice it."
                  "Certainly, I have no doubt the evidence exists, since you say so; but can't
                     you tell me what it is, or show me where
                     to find it? I shall never be able to rest in peace till I am
                     convinced that I have been baptized. And if that which I witnessed at the river
                     yesterday was baptism, I am sure I never was."
                  "Oh, don't be so confident, my daughter. There are more modes of
                     baptism than one. That was, perhaps, one mode (though of that I
                     have some doubt). You were baptized by another mode. That
                        may have been baptism. Yours certainly was."
                  "Well, do please prove it to me some way, Mr. Johnson. What you say is
                     something like what Mr. Percy said yesterday. He told me that baptize was a
                     generic term, expressing rather a certain result than any specific act. I think
                     that was the idea, was it not, Mr. Percy?"
                  "Exactly; and if so, I leave it to Mr. Johnson if the manner of reaching the
                     result is not a matter of indifference."
                  "Certainly," said the pastor, "'baptism is the application of water as a
                     religious ordinance.' It does not matter about the quantity of water or the
                     mode of applying it."
                  "Yes; that is what mother said yesterday. And we looked in Webster and found
                     that such was, indeed, the present English use of the word baptize. But brother
                     says baptize is a Greek word slightly modified, and transferred from the Greek
                     Testament to the English. It is the New Testament meaning in the time of
                        Christ, and among the people for whom the Gospels were first written,
                     that we want, not the meaning that it has acquired in the English
                     since its transfer to our language."
                  "You see, pastor, she is going to be hard to satisfy. She pleads her cause like
                     a lawyer."
                  "No, no, Mr. Percy, I will not be hard to satisfy. I desire, I long, I
                        pray to be satisfied. I can never rest till I am satisfied. I
                     only ask for the evidence. You said yesterday terday that baptizo was a generic term meaning to sprinkle, to pour, or to
                     dip; but we found it in the Lexicon, and it proved to be a specific term,
                     meaning only to dip. Not a word was there about sprinkling or pouring. It was
                     simply and only dipping. To-day, Mr. Johnson tells me about several
                        modes—but they are not modes of dipping. And yet if the Greek
                     word baptismos, baptism, means
                        dipping, then they must, in order to be modes of baptism, be
                     modes of dipping. But, Mr. Percy, you have not yet told us the result of your
                     examination of other Lexicons."
                  "We can make nothing out of them. I am sorry to say they all agree
                     substantially with the one you have in the house. If we trust to them we must
                     grant that the word means primarily and ordinarily to dip, to plunge, to
                     immerse. Of this there is no doubt."
                  "Then I am more perplexed than ever. You said yesterday that in order to know
                     what the act was which the disciples performed and Christ commanded, we must
                     ascertain the precise meaning of baptize, as they employed it in the Greek
                     language. You have examined all the Lexicons (the highest authorities) and find
                     they all agree in saying it was dip, plunge, immerse. You admitted yesterday
                     that if they should agree in this, the question was settled. If they said
                     baptize meant to dip, and baptismos a dipping
                     or immersion, then every time we read that one was baptized, we must understand
                     that he was immersed. I thought that was a plain, straight-forward case. I felt
                     that I could understand it. Well, now you say you have examined carefully the
                     other Lexicons, and they all agree with this. No one says sprinkle, no one says
                     pour—all say dip, and consequently the Gospel says that Jesus was
                        dipped of John in the river of Jordan. But then our pastor
                     says, that he has evidence that Jesus did not enter the river at
                     all, and that he was sprinkled and not dipped. Of course he would
                     not say it unless it was so, but I really don't understand how it can be
                     so."
                  "I have some curiosity on that point myself," said Mr. Percy, evidently
                     relieved to find that he could (for the moment, at least) take the other side
                     of the question. "I find myself in a very close place. These Lexicons have
                     killed me. I don't know what to say. I suppose, of course, there is some way to
                     get around the difficulty; but I must leave it to our pastor to point it out.
                     For my part, I submit the case."
                  "Really," said Mr. Johnson, "the question never presented itself to me in just
                     this light before. You must give me a little time to consider about it. And in
                     the meantime let me beg of you both that you will examine some of the standard
                     writers upon the subject. I do not think you have done this yet. What have you
                     in the house?"
                  "Not a book upon the subject, except it be the Bible; and I don't much care to
                     read any other till we have examined that. If sprinkling is there, it ought to
                     be so plainly taught that I can see it for myself. If I can't find it, I will
                     always doubt if it is there," rejoined the young lady.
                  "True, my child," said the pastor, "but we often fail to see things at first
                     glance, which are very evident when they have once been pointed out, and our
                     attention fixed upon them. This is the advantage of using proper helps to
                     understand the Scriptures. Those not familiar with the language in which they
                     were written, and with the customs and manners of the people to whom they were
                     originally addressed, will derive great assistance from judicious criticisms. I
                     like, myself, always to read a Commentary on every chapter that I attempt to
                     understand."
                  "Oh as to Communtaries, we have Barnes' Notes on the Gospels, and on some of the Epistles. And we
                     have Me Knight's exposition and new translation of the Epistles. Uncle Jones
                     admires these old volumes of McKnight's very much, but they always seemed very
                     dry to me. I love Mr. Barnes, and have studied his Notes in Sunday School and
                     Bible class, all my life."
                  "Mr. Barnes is a very learned and eminent divine," replied the pastor. "His
                     notes have attained a wide circulation and won for him an enduring reputation.
                     You cannot follow a safer guide. Have you examined him upon the subject?"
                  "I suppose," said she, "that I have read it a dozen times, but I never thought
                     any thing particularly about it, and don't recollect a word."
                  "Suppose then you get his Notes and let us look at them a moment before I
                     leave. I can stay but a few minutes longer."
                  Edwin had found the volume while they were talking of it, and now handed it to
                     the pastor.
                  "I suppose we shall find it here, Matthew 3 : 6, as this is the place where the
                     word baptize first occurs. Mr. Percy, will you have the kindness to read it
                     aloud for our common benefit?"
                  Mr. Percy read: "And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins."
                     "The word baptize signifies, originally, to tinge, to
                        dye, to stain, as those who dye
                     clothes. It here means to cleanse or wash any thing by the application of
                     water. (See note, Mark 7 : 4.)
                  "Washing or ablution was much in use among the Jews as one of the rites of
                     their religion. It was not customary, however, to baptize those
                     who were converted to the Jewish religion until after the Babylonish
                     captivity.
                  "At the time of John, and for some time previous, they had been accustomed to
                     administer a rite of baptism or washing to those who became
                     proselytes to their religion that is, who were converted from being Gentiles."
                     * * "John found this custom in use, and as he was calling the Jews to a new
                     dispensation, to a change in the form of their religion, he administered this
                     rite of baptism or washing to signify the cleansing from their
                     sins and adopting the new dispensation, or the fitness for the pure reign of
                     the Messiah. They applied an old ordinance to a new purpose; as it was used by
                     John it was a significant rite or ceremony, intended to denote the putting away
                     of impurity and a purpose to be pure in heart and life."
                  Mr. Percy stopped reading, and looking up at Mr. Johnson, said, "Pardon me,
                     pastor, but if Mr. Barnes were present here as a witness in this case, I would
                     like to ask him a single question by way of a cross-examination. He says that
                        'Washing or ablution was much in use among the Jews as one of
                     the rites of their religion,' and yet he tells us that baptism was
                     not in use till after the captivity. Must not baptism then have
                     been something new and different from the washing or
                     ablution?"
                  "And I," said Theodosia, "would like to ask a question too; perhaps pastor
                     Johnson can answer it as well as Mr. Barnes. He says, when they received a
                     convert from the Gentiles they baptized him; John found this rite
                     in use, and merely applied an old ordinance to a new purpose. Now I want to
                     know how this ordinance was administered. What was the act which
                     they performed upon the proselyte? Did they sprinkle him, or pour upon him, or
                     was he immersed? If this can be ascertained, it will of course determine what
                     it was that John did when he baptized. Can you tell us, Mr. Johnson, which it
                     was?"
                  "Yes, my child; it is universally conceded that the Jewish ish proselyte baptism was immersion. I do not
                     know that this has ever been denied by any writer, on either side of this
                     controversy. It is distinctly stated to have been immersion by Dr. Lightfoot,
                     Dr. Adam Clarke, Prof. Stuart, and others who have espoused our cause."
                  "How then do you get rid of the difficulty? If, as Mr. Barnes says, 'John
                     applied an old ordinance to a new purpose,' and that old ordinance was
                     immersion, it is absolutely certain that John immersed. There is not room for
                     even the shadow of a doubt."
                  "It would seem to be so, indeed," said the pastor. "I never thought of it just
                     in that light before. But though it is admitted by all that the proselyte
                     baptism was immersion, it is doubted by many whether it existed at all before
                     the time of John. Some think it originated about the time of Christ, and that
                     the Jews practised it in imitation of John's baptism."
                  "I do not see," rejoined Mr. Percy, "how it can make the slightest difference
                     in the result of the argument, whether it was in use before the time of John,
                     or was borrowed from him. If they immersed before the time of
                     John, and he borrowed his rite from them, of course it was immersion that he
                     borrowed. If they immersed after the time of John, and borrowed
                     their rite from him, of course John immersed, or they could not have borrowed
                     immersion from him."
                  "But if John immersed," said Theodosia, "then Jesus was immersed by
                        John. This immersion was called his baptism. The disciples saw it,
                     and spake of it as such; and ever afterwards, whenever baptism was mentioned,
                     their minds would revert to this act; and so when Jesus said to them, 'Go and
                     baptize,' they must have understood him to mean, that they should go and repeat
                     on others the rite which they had seen performed on him. And not only so,"
                     added the young lady, "but Christ's disciples had themselves been accustomed to
                     practice the same baptism under his own eye. If John immersed, they had not
                     only witnessed his immersion of Jesus, but they had themselves immersed
                     hundreds, if not thousands, under the personal direction of Jesus himself."
                  "That would certainly settle the question. But where did you make that
                     discovery?" asked Mr. Percy, incredulously.
                  "Oh, it is in the record," she replied. "Here is the testimony, John 3 : 22, 23
                     : 'After these things, came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judea, and
                     there he tarried with them, and baptized. And John also was
                     baptizing in Ænon, near to Salim, because there was much water there; and they
                     came, and were baptized.' And in the next chapter it says that the Pharisees
                     heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John. Now John baptized
                     and Jesus baptized. They both did the same thing; that is, as plain as words
                     can make it: as plain as though it said Jesus walked, and John also walked; or
                     Jesus talked, and John also talked. Whatever it was that John did, Jesus was
                     doing the same thing. If John's baptism was immersion, then Jesus and his
                     disciples were immersing, and they immersed more than John."
                  "That is really," said Mr. Percy, "a complete demonstration. Don't you think
                     so, Mr. Johnson?"
                  "Well, I must confess it looks so at the first glance. We must look into this
                     matter another time. Let us, for the present, see what Mr Barnes says further.
                     Please read on, Mr. Percy; I have not much more time to spare this
                     evening."
                  Mr. Percy read on:—
                  "The Hebrew word (tabal) which is rendered by
                     the [Greek] word baptize, occurs in the Old Testament in the following
                     places:—Lev 4 : 6; 14 : 6, 51; Num. 19 : 18; Ruth 2 : 14; Ex. 12 : 22; Deut. 33 : 24; Ezk. 23
                     : 15; Job 9 : 31; Lev. 9 : 9; 1 Sam. 9 : 27; 2 Kings 5 : 14; 8 : 15, Gen. 37 :
                     31; Joshua 3 : 15. It occurs in no other places; and from a careful examination
                     of these passages, its meaning among the Jews is to be derived."
                  "Oh," said the young lady, "that is what I like; I like to find the meaning in
                     the Scriptures, then I know I can rely upon it. Just wait a minute, Mr. Percy,
                     if you please, till I can get my Bible and hunt out those places, and see how
                     it reads. If it reads sprinkle, then it is all right—sprinkling is baptism; if
                     it reads pour, then pouring is baptism; if it reads dip, then dipping is
                     baptism. We will soon see."
                  "Let me read a little further, Miss Theodosia, and perhaps you may not think it
                     necessary to examine the texts."
                  She had, however, got her Bible, and was getting ready to turn to each text in
                     order, when he resumed as follows:
                  "From these passages, it will be seen that its radical meaning is not to
                     sprinkle or to immerse. It is to dip. Commonly for the purpose of
                     sprinkling or for some other purpose."
                  "What! Do let me see that. Pardon me, pastor, but what does the good man mean?
                     It is not to sprinkle; it is not to immerse; it is to dip! Edwin,
                     please get Webster's Dictionary, and tell us the difference between the meaning
                     of dip and immerse."
                  "Here it is. Immerse is to plunge into a fluid. Dip is to plunge any thing into
                     a fluid, and instantly take it out again."
                  "Why, Mr. Percy, that just describes the act of baptism which we saw at the
                     river. It was not an immersion, strictly speaking, but a dipping, a plunging
                     beneath the water, and a raising out again. 'It is not to sprinkle or to
                     immerse merse; it is to dip! Commonly for the purpose of sprinkling, or for
                     some other purpose.'"
                  "What are you laughing at, brother Edwin?"
                  "I was only thinking how a preacher would look, dipping a man 'for the purpose
                     of sprinkling' him. But see! there goes my teacher, and I believe he is a
                     Baptist. At any rate he goes to all their meetings. Let me call him in; he can
                     tell us something more about these things."
                  And before any one could interfere, he had run to the door and hailed Mr.
                     Courtney.
                  Seeing this, the Rev. Mr. Johnson arose, and reminding the company that he had
                     an engagement at that hour, promised to call again to talk over the matter
                     more, at another day, and took his leave, passing out just as the teacher was
                     coming in.
                  "Mr. Courtney," said Mr. Percy, "perhaps you can help as a little. We were just
                     looking at Barnes on Baptism."
                  "I did not know he had ever written on the subject, except some very singular
                     remarks he made in his Notes on the third chapter of Matthew."
                  "It was those we were examining, and I infer that you do not think very
                     favorably of his argument."
                  "I think he makes a very strong argument for the Baptists."
                  "How so?"
                  "Simply thus: It is an axiom in logic as well as in mathematics, 'that things
                     which are equal to the same thing, are equal to one another.' Now he states a
                     very remarkable and exceedingly significant fact, when he says that the Hebrew
                     word tabal is rendered by the word
                        baptize. It occurs, he says, fifteen times in the Hebrew Bible.
                     Now when the Jews translated their Scriptures into Greek, whenever they came to
                     this word, they rendered it baptize and when our translators came to this
                     same word, they rendered it by the English word dip. It follows,
                     therefore, since dip in English and baptize in Greek are both equivalent to
                        tabal in Hebrew, they must be equivalent
                     to each other.
                  "Mr. Barnes says further, that the true way to ascertain the meaning of this
                     word among the Jews, is to examine carefully the fifteen places where it occurs
                     in the Old Testament. I see, Miss Ernest, that you have the Bible in your hand;
                     suppose you turn to those places, and let us see how they read. It will not
                     take more than a few minutes of our time."
                  "I had gotten the book for that very purpose, sir. I like this way of study,
                     comparing Scripture with Scripture. I always feel better satisfied with my
                     conclusions, when I have drawn them for myself directly from the Bible.
                  "Well, here is the first place, Leviticus 4 : 6 : 'And the priest shall
                        dip his finger in the blood.'
                  "The second, Leviticus 14 : 6 : 'And shall dip them into the blood
                     of the bird that was killed over running water.'
                  "The third, Leviticus 14 : 51 : 'And dip them in the blood of the
                     slain bird and in the running water.'
                  "The fourth, Numbers 19 : 18 : 'And a clean person shall take hyssop, and
                        dip it into the water.'
                  "The fifth, Ruth 2 : 14 : 'And Boaz said unto her at meal time, come thou
                     hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the
                     vinegar.'
                  "The sixth, Exodus 12 : 22 : 'And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop and
                        dip it in the blood.'
                  "The seventh, Deuteronomy 33 : 24 : 'And let him dip his foot in
                     oil.'
                  "The eighth, Ezekiel 23 : 15 : 'Exceeding in dyed attire.'
                  "The ninth, Job 9 : 31 : 'Yet shalt thou plunge me in the
                     ditch.'
                  
                     
                  
                  
                  "The tenth, Leviticus 9 : 9 'And he dipped his finger in the
                     blood.
                  "The eleventh, 1 Samuel 14 : 27 : 'And he (Jonathan) put forth the end of the
                     rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honey comb.'
                  "The twelfth, 2 Kings 8 : 16 : 'And he (Hazael) took a thick cloth, and
                        dipped it in the water, and spread it on his face.'
                  "The thirteenth, Joshua 3 : 15 : 'The feet of the priests that bare the ark
                     were dipped in the brim of Jordan.'
                  "The fourteenth, 2 Kings 5 : 14 : 'And he went down, and dipped
                     himself seven times in Jordan.'
                  "The fifteenth, Genesis 37 : 31 : 'And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a
                     kid, and dipped the coat in the blood.'
                  "The passage in the 2 Kings 5 : 14, is very remarkable, since it corresponds
                     precisely in the Septuagint to the text in Matthew. The Septuagint says of
                     Naaman, Ebaptizato en to Jordane. Matthew
                     says of the people baptized by John, Ebaptisonto en to
                        Jordane. Nobody has ever questioned the correctness of the
                     translation in Kings. He dipped himself in Jordan; and had Matthew
                     been translated by the same rule, it must have read, they were
                        dipped by John in Jordan.
                  "But I fear this subject may be disagreeable to you. Mr. Barnes, I know, is a
                     most eminent minister of your own denomination, and I ought probably to have
                     avoided speaking thus in your presence."
                  "Oh, no, sir," said the young lady; "I want to learn the truth, the whole
                     truth, and nothing but the truth, on this subject. I am glad to learn it from
                     any source, and in any way. Perhaps you can assist us further; but let us see
                     what further Mr. Barnes has to say."
                  Mr. Percy read again:
                  
                  "In none of these cases can it be shown that the meaning of the word is to
                        immerse entirely. But in nearly all the cases the notion of
                     applying the water to a part only of the person or object, though it was by
                     dipping, is necessarily supposed. . . . . It cannot be proved, from an
                     examination of the passages in the Old and New Testaments, that the idea of a
                     complete immersion ever was connected with the word, or that it
                        ever in any case occurred."
                  "Stop, Mr. Percy," said the young lady. "Pray stop, and let me think a moment.
                     Can it be possible that a good man, a pious minister of Jesus Christ, could
                     dare to trifle thus with the holy Word of God? Oh, it is wonderful! I cannot
                     understand it! He said just now, that the meaning of the word 'was to dip for
                     the purpose of sprinkling, or for some other purpose.' To dip means to plunge
                     any thing into a fluid, and immediately take it out again. To immerse means
                     merely to plunge the object in the fluid. Whatever is dipped, therefore, is
                        of necessity immersed, to the same extent that it is dipped;
                     and yet he says these things which the Word says were dipped, were none of them
                     entirely immersed."
                  "Do not think too hardly of him," said Mr. Percy. "An advocate who has a bad
                     cause to sustain, (I know from experience,) is sometimes obliged to resort to
                     just such a jumble, to cover the weak points of his argument."
                  "Perhaps," said Theodosia, "it might be excusable in a lawyer, though even of
                     that I am doubtful; but that a minister of the holy Word of Jesus should thus
                     stoop to 'darken counsel with words without knowledge,' is something I never
                     conceived of till now."
                  "When you have become more familiar with the influence which passion and
                     prejudice, and especially early education and church attachments, exert upon
                     the minds of even the wisest and best of men," said Mr. Courtney, "these things
                     will not appear so strange to you. Mr. Barnes doubtless believes that
                     sprinkling is baptism. He was taught so in early life, and has for many years
                     taught others so. To convince him of the contrary, would now be almost or quite
                     impossible, and when any text of Scripture comes in opposition to this opinion,
                     he can hardly help perverting or misunderstanding it. You desired to know the
                     true meaning of the word baptize, as it was used in our Saviour's time among
                     the Jews; and you applied to him for information. He told you very properly
                     that you must go to those places where it occurs in the original of their own
                     Scriptures, and pointed out to you the fifteen places, which he assures you are
                     the only places in which it occurs. He has thus given the matter into your own
                     hands. You turn to the places, one by one, and find that in fourteen out of the
                     fifteen it clearly means to dip. That such is the case, he does
                     not deny. He is obliged to grant that 'its radical meaning is to
                        dip.' This, now, he has proved from the Scriptures themselves.
                     But this overthrows his sprinkling, so he must get rid of its force. This he
                     undertakes to do—1. By intimating that there is some important difference
                     between dipping and immersion. 'It is not sprinkling nor immersion,' he says.
                     'It is dipping,' and then he tries to confuse the matter by mixing in the
                     object, 'for the purpose of sprinkling, or for some other purpose,' as though
                     the purpose modified the act performed. The baptism mentioned in these fourteen
                     places was equally dipping, whether it was performed for the purpose of
                     sprinkling, as when the priest dipped the hyssop, or for the purpose of
                     smearing; as when the priest dipped the tip of his finger in oil; or for the
                     purpose of cleansing, as when Naaman dipped himself in Jordan; or for the
                     purpose of pollution, as when Job was plunged in the ditch; or merely for the purpose of wetting, as when Ruth
                     dipped her morsel, or Hazael his thick cloth. The wetting, the defiling, the
                     cleansing, the smearing, were not the baptism; they were not the dipping, but a
                     consequence of it. The sprinkling was not the baptism, the dipping, but a
                     subsequent and altogether a different act. Then to make 'confusion worse
                     confounded,' he intimates some vast distinction between entire immersion and
                     dipping. These things, said to be baptized in these fourteen places, he can't
                     deny were dipped; but 'none of them,' he says, 'were entirely immersed.' But
                     the extent of the immersion does not affect the meaning of the word. The word
                     immersed expressed only the act of plunging the object into the fluid. The word
                     dip expressed this act, and the additional one of taking it out again; and
                     this, he said and proved, was the Scriptural meaning of baptize. As far, then,
                     as they were baptized, they were dipped; and as far as they were dipped, they
                     were immersed. We learn the extent of the dipping from other words, not from
                     this one. If Naaman is said to have dipped himself, or Hazael the cloth, there
                     is not the slightest reason to doubt that the whole person and the whole cloth
                     were immersed. If Jonathan dipped the end of his staff, why the end only was
                     immersed. It was immersed, however, just as much as it was dipped or
                     baptized."
                  "But," said Mr. Percy, "what will you do with the hyssop, and the living bird,
                     &c., that were to be baptized into the blood of the slain bird, and where
                     Mr. Barnes says it is clearly impossible that they all should be immersed in
                     the blood of the single bird."
                  "I simply say that they could be immersed in it as easily as they could be
                     dipped in it. If you will turn to Leviticus 14 : 6, you will see that the blood
                     of the slain bird was to be caught over running water; and as it rested on, or
                     mixed with the water, these things could all be entirely immersed, if need be.
                     You will remember, however, that in common language the whole of a thing is
                     often mentioned when a part is only meant. I say, for instance, that I dipped
                     my pen in ink, and wrote a line; you do not understand that I dipped more than
                     the point—enough to take up the ink to write. If I tell you that I dipped my
                     hair-brush in water, and smoothed my hair, you do not understand that I dipped
                     it in, handle and all, but only the bristles. So only enough of the cedar wood,
                     and hyssop, and scarlet, &c., may have been dipped to take up enough to
                     sprinkle with; but as much as they were baptized, so much were they dipped; and
                     so far as they were dipped, just so far were they immersed. But it does not
                     make any difference to Mr. Barnes or his sprinkling brethren, whether the
                     dipping was partial or complete; for they do not dip their subjects of baptism
                     at all, in whole or in part, for the purpose of sprinkling, or for any other
                     purpose; and, therefore, if the Scriptural meaning of the word baptize is to
                     dip, as Mr. Barnes has so clearly proved by Scripture itself, then they do not
                     baptize at all.
                  "Oh yes, I see now how it was," said Theodosia, "when Dr. Fisher performed this
                     ceremony upon me. He baptized his own hand, for he dipped that in the bowl, but
                     he only sprinkled me; and therefore according to the showing of Mr. Barnes,
                     himself, I have never been baptized."
                  "Do not put down the book yet," said Mr. Courtney. "Just turn to Matthew 20 :
                     22, and you will find that Mr. Barnes has no more difficulty than the greatest
                     Baptist in the land in understanding the word baptism to signify not only
                     immersion, but complete immersion, whenever it does not refer to
                     the ordinance."
                  "'The baptism that I am baptized with' On this Mr. B.
                        remarks as follows: 'Are ye able to suffer with me the trials and pains which shall come upon
                     you in endeavoring to build up my kingdom? Are ye able to be plunged deep in
                     afflictions? to have sorrows cover you like water, and to be sunk beneath
                     calamities as floods, in the work of religion? Afflictions are often expressed
                     by being sunk in the floods and plunged in the deep waters.' (Ps. 59 : 2; Isa.
                     43 : 2; Ps. 124 : 4-5; Sam. 3 : 54.)"
                  "You see Mr. Barnes has no more difficulty than the translators of the Old
                     Testament in giving the word its true meaning—to dip, to plunge, to sink
                     beneath the waters, etc., when it does not refer to the ordinance; but when it
                     does all is confusion and mystery."
                  "I begin to think," said Theodosia, "that Theological writers are not to be
                     relied upon at all. And I feel more than ever inclined to trust to the Bible
                     alone, and study it for myself. When such a man as Mr. Barnes can be so far
                     blinded by education and prejudice as to come so near the truth and not see
                     it—to point out the way towards it so plainly, and yet refuse to walk in it,
                     and endeavor to hide it from others by such a strange medley of words, I have
                     no further use for any book on the subject but the word of God. I will study
                     that; and it shall be my only guide. If I find that Jesus was sprinkled in
                     Jordan, I will be content. If I find that he was poured upon, I must be poured
                     upon. If I find that he was dipped, then I must be dipped."
                  "Oh, no, Miss Theodosia; you are decidedly too hasty. I have often found in
                     court that a witness whom I expected to testify in my favor, and who evidently
                     desired and intended to do so, has nevertheless, on a cross-examination, given
                     such testimony as was altogether favorable to the opposite party. But I did not
                     abandon my client, and give up my suit. I sought for other witnesses. Our
                     information on this subject is, as yet, very limited. There are other sources
                     of evidence dence; let us examine them. Something may yet turn up to change
                     your opinion of Theological writers. Did you not say that you had McKnight on
                     the Epistles in the house?"
                  "Yes; and uncle Jones, who you know is one of the Elders in our church, says it
                     is one of the best, if not the very best of commentaries."
                  "Well, let us see what he says. How will we find the place?"
                  "Take a concordance," suggested Edwin, "and look at every place where the word
                     baptize occurs."
                  "That is a first rate idea. Well, here is the first place. Romans 6 : 4. Buried
                     with Christ by baptism. In the note he says : 'Christ's baptism was not the
                     baptism of repentance, for he never committed any sin. But he submitted to be
                     baptized—that is, to be buried under the water by John, and to be raised out
                     again—as an emblem of his future death and resurrection. In like manner, the
                     baptism of believers is emblematical of their own death, burial and
                     resurrection; perhaps, also, it is a commemoration of Christ's baptism.'"
                  "Stop, Mr. Percy, are you sure you are not reading falsely?"
                  "Yes, I am perfectly certain. Here is the book, you can see for yourself."
                  "No; but I thought you must be playing some trick on me. At any rate, McKnight
                     must have been a Baptist, No one who believed in, and practiced sprinkling,
                     could have written in that way."
                  "Perhaps he was a Baptist. Let us look at the title-page and preface, and see
                     who and what he was. It appears from this, that James McKnight, D.D., was born
                     Sept. 17, 1721. Licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Irwine of the Scotch
                     Presbyterian church. Ordained at Maybole in 1753.— Chosen Moderator of the General Assembly of the
                     Presbyterian church in 1769, which position he held for more than twenty years.
                     This brief history of his life affixed to the first volume of his Notes,
                     informs us further, that he spent near thirty years of his life in preparing
                     these Notes, and "that the whole manuscript was written over and over, by his
                     own hand, no less than five times." They were therefore the deliberate and
                     carefully expressed opinions of a most eminent and very learned Presbyterian
                     Doctor of Divinity, and presiding officer of the Presbyterian church in the
                     country where he lived. Of course he cannot be suspected of any bias towards
                     the obscure and despised sect called the Baptists."
                  "Well, read on then. Theologians are mysterious men."
                  "That is all he says on this verse. But here is verso 5th. Planted together,
                     &c."
                  "The burying of Christ and of believers, first in the water of baptism, and
                     afterwards in the earth, is fitly enough compared to the planting of seeds in
                     the earth, because the effect in both cases is a revivescence to a state of
                     greater perfection."
                  "Surely, he must consider baptism to be a burial in water. But perhaps he
                     thinks there were several baptisms, and that dipping was one form or mode,
                     while sprinkling was another."
                  "No, for here is his note on Ephesians 4 : 5. One Lord, one Faith, one
                     Baptism."
                  "'Ye all,' says he, 'serve one Lord, and all have the same object of faith, and
                     have all professed that faith by the same form of baptism.'"
                  "Has he any thing else on the subject?"
                  "Yes; here, on 1 Cor. 10 : 2, 'And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud
                     and in the sea.'"
                  "'Because the Israelites, by being hidden from the Egyptians under the cloud,
                     and by passing through the Red Sea, were made to declare their belief in the
                     Lord and his servant Moses, the Apostle very properly represents them as
                     baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea.'
                  "And here again: 1 Cor. 15 : 29, 'Else what shall they do who are baptized for
                     the dead.'
                  "'Otherwise what shall they do to repair their loss who are immersed in
                     sufferings for the resurrection of the dead.'
                  "And here again: Heb. 9 : 10, 'Divers washings, (Baptismos).'
                  "'With nothing but meats, and drinks, and divers immersions, and
                     ordinances respecting the body.'
                  "One more place, and we have all that he says upon the subject."
                  "1 Peter 3 : 21, 'The like figure whereunto baptism doth now save us, etc.'
                  "The water of baptism is here called the anti-type of the water of the floods,
                     because the flood was a type or emblem of baptism in three particulars:
                  "1. 'As by building an ark and entering into it, Noah showed strong faith in
                     the promise of God concerning his preservation by the very water which was to
                     destroy the Antediluvians for their sins. So by giving ourselves to be buried
                     in the water of baptism, we show a like faith in God's promise, that though we
                     die and are buried, he will save us from death and the punishment of sin by
                     raising us up from the dead at the last day.'
                  "2. 'As the preserving of Noah alive during the nine months of the flood, is an
                     emblem of the preservation of the souls of believers while in the state of the
                     dead, so the preserving believers alive while buried in the water of baptism is
                     a prefiguration of the same event.'
                  
                  "3. 'As the water of the deluge destroyed the wicked but preserved Noah by
                     bearing up the ark in which he was shut up till the waters were assuaged, and
                     he went out to live again upon the earth; so baptism may be said to destroy [or
                     represent the destruction of] the wicked, and to save the righteous as it
                     prefigures both these events. The death of the wicked it prefigures by the
                     burial of the baptized person in the water, and the salvation of the righteous
                     by the raising of the baptized person out of the water.'"
                  "Well, Mr. Percy," said Theodosia, "what do you make of this witness? Do you
                     wish to cross-examine him, or ask him any further questions?"
                  "Yes, I would like to ask the Rev. Dr. McKnight if he practiced sprinkling for
                     baptism; and if he did, upon what grounds he could sustain a practice so
                     different from his own exposition of the teachings of the scripture."
                  "As Dr. McKnight has not answered in his writings, and is not present in
                     person, it may be satisfactory," suggested Mr. Courtney, "to enquire of some
                     other representative of the same church establishment. If you have Dr.
                     Chalmers' Lectures on Romans, you will find the question answered."
                  "Yes, sister, don't you know mother bought Chalmers' Lectures only the other
                     day? I will go and get the book," said Edwin.
                  "Ah, here it is—page 152; Romans 6 : 4-7. 'The original meaning of the
                        word baptism is immersion; and, though we regard it as a point
                     of indifferency whether the ordinance so named be performed in this way or by
                     sprinkling, yet we doubt not that the prevalent style of the administration in
                     the apostle's days was by the actual submerging of the whole body under water.
                     We advert to this for the purpose of throwing light on the analogy which is
                     instituted in these verses. Jesus Christ, by death underwent this sort of
                     baptism, even immersion under the surface of the ground, whence he soon emerged
                     again by his resurrection. We, by being baptized into his death, are conceived
                     to have made a similar translation—in the act of descending under the water of
                     baptism to have resigned an old life, and in the act of ascending to emerge
                     into a second or new life.' Here we have a distinct avowal of the
                     well-established fact that the meaning of the word baptism is immersion, and
                     that the practice of the Apostolic church was conformable to this truth. But in
                     the very face of it we have the candid declaration 'that we (Presbyterians)
                     regard it as a matter of indifferency whether the ordinance so named be
                     performed in this way or by sprinkling.'"
                  "But, Mr. Courtney, how can it be a matter of 'indifferency'? If the word means
                     immersion, then immersion was what Christ commanded—then the 'ordinance
                     so-called' is 'immersion.' How can immersion be performed by sprinkling?
                     Really, these theologians are a strange, mysterious people. I cannot comprehend
                     them. Christ commands me to be baptized—baptism means immersion; then, of
                     course, if he meant any thing, he meant immersion. But these great and good men
                     tell me it is a matter of 'indifferency' whether I do what he commanded, or
                     something else altogether different from it."
                  "Pardon me, Miss Theodosia, it is only when the theologians are in error, and
                     blinded by their educational prejudices or attachment to their church forms and
                     dogmas, that they are so unreasonable and so mysterious."
                  "Yet I have been accustomed to think they could hardly be in error at all. I
                     have taken it for granted, until yesterday, that what the ministers of our
                     church said about the teachings of the word of God was all true, as a matter of
                     course. I can hardly believe now that it is not so. I can't understand how those who are so wise, so
                     learned, so pious so anxious to know the truth, and who spend all their time in
                     learning and teaching it, can be wrong; or how a simple girl like me may differ
                     from them and yet be right. I am afraid to take a single step in opposition to
                     my pastor's teaching, though I see clearly (as I think) that I shall step upon
                     the rock of God's unfailing truth! How can it be, that such good men talk one
                     way and act another? How do they try to justify their 'indifferency' to the
                     commands of Christ? They give some reason, do they not?"
                  "I think most of them don't trouble themselves on the subject; they think
                     little and care little about it—not deeming it essential to salvation. When
                     they do think or read upon the subject, it is in order to quiet their minds or
                     reply to an opponent. They have the practice of their church, received by
                     tradition; they take it for granted it is right. They are where you were a day
                     or two since, when you took it for granted that the ministers of your
                     denomination could not be wrong. They don't think their church can
                     be wrong; and they twist, pervert and torture the Scriptures, as you have seen
                     Mr. Barnes do, or openly set aside their teachings as a matter of
                     'indifferency', as we have seen Dr. Chalmers do, in order to continue the
                        usage of the church."
                  "But," asked Theodosia, "does not Dr. Chalmers stand alone upon this point of
                     'indifferency'? It surely is not common for the ministers of our church (who in
                     learning and piety I have always thought had no superiors in the world) to
                     speak of literal obedience to Christ's commandments as a matter of no
                     consequence. To me it seems to border upon absolute impiety, almost upon
                     sacrilege. I am in a maze of astonishment."
                  "If you will continue your investigations for a little time, you will cease to
                     be astonished at almost any sort of assertions tions made by the advocates of
                     sprinkling," said Mr. Courtney. "You will, for instance, find them admitting,
                     in one sentence, that immersion was submitted to by Christ and practised by the
                     Apostles; and in another, holding it up to the reprobation and abhorrence of
                     every Christian as an indecent and abominable rite. But in regard to your
                     question: Dr. Chalmers, so far from standing alone, simply echoes the
                     sentiments of Calvin, the founder of your church, and others of its most
                     eminent supporters. 'It is of no consequence at all,' says Calvin, as quoted by
                     Prof. Stuart, 'whether the baptized person is totally immersed or whether he is
                     merely sprinkled by an affusion of water. This should be a matter of choice to
                     the churches in different regions, although the word baptize signifies to
                     immerse, and the rite of immersion was practised by the ancient church.' 'To
                     this opinion,' says Prof. Stuart, 'I do most fully and heartily
                     subscribe.'"
                  "Well, I declare; these Presbyterian Doctors of Divinity are the most
                     mysterious of people to me. They freely admit that the meaning of the word is
                     to immerse or to dip, and that immersion was practised by the first churches,
                     (and of course if such is the meaning of the word it must have been practised
                     by the first churches, as they could not misunderstand the commandment.) Yet
                     they tell us that it is of 'no consequence at all' whether we obey the
                     commandment or not. Do the other denominations opposed to the Baptist, occupy
                     the same position?"
                  "I cannot answer for all," said Mr. Courtney; "I can for some. I have here a
                     transcript of some of the writings of Mr. John Wesley, who was the founder of
                     the Methodists, the most numerous of the Pædobaptist sects in this country. He
                     says, in his notes on Romans, 6: 4 'The allusion is to the ancient manner of
                     baptizing, by immersion.' And he
                     relates in his journal, vol. 3, page 20 'that Mary Welch, aged eleven days, was
                     baptized according to the custom of the first church and the rule of the church
                     of England, by immersion.'"
                  "On page 24 of the same volume, he says, 'I was asked to baptize a child of Mr.
                     Parker's, second bailiff of Savannah; but Mrs. Parker told me, neither Mr. P.
                     nor I will consent to its being dipped. I answered, if you certify that the
                     child is weakly, it will suffice (the Rubric says) to pour water on it. She
                     replied nay, the child is not weak, but I am resolved it shall not be dipped.
                     This argument I could not confute, so I went home, and the child was baptized
                     by another.'"
                  "It would seem then," said Theodosia, that Mr. Wesley conformed his practice to
                     his belief. He believed that baptism was immersion, and refused to baptize at
                     all unless he could do it according to the word of God. I honor the man for his
                     consistency."
                  "Still," said Mr. Percy, "it does not seem that he was influenced by the word
                     of God, but by the 'Rubric.' The word of God makes no exceptions in favor of
                     those who may be certified to 'be weak,' but yet on the authority of 'the
                     Rubric' or formula of the church of England, Mr. Wesley was perfectly ready to
                     dispense with the dipping and employ pouring, if the parents would only
                        certify."
                  "Moreover," added Mr. Courtney, "it seems from his conduct afterwards, that he
                     felt as much at liberty himself to change the ordinance of Christ, as the
                     makers of the Rubric had done; for when he organized his societies, and gave
                     them 'the Discipline' as their organic law, he directed baptism to be performed
                     by sprinkling or pouring, if the parties preferred it."
                  "And though Mr. Wesley once refused to baptize a person son at all unless he
                     could do it by dipping 'according to the custom of the first church,' or under
                     a certificate of weakness, his followers, by his direction and by authority of
                     his discipline, employ sprinkling almost exclusively, and call immersion a
                     vulgar and indecent practice; although they will sometimes perform it to
                     satisfy a weak conscience rather than lose a member.
                  "Martin Luther, the great reformer and founder of the Lutheran church,
                     evidently entertained the same opinion with the other noted Pædobaptists we
                     have been speaking of. After speaking of baptism as a symbol of death and
                     resurrection, he says, 'On this account I could wish that such as are to be
                     baptized, should be completely immersed into the water, according to the
                     meaning of the word and the signification of the ordinance, as also without
                     doubt, it was instituted by Christ.' Yet Luther is the father of a sprinkling
                     church—the Lutheran, and whether he did so or not, it is evident that his
                     followers, like Drs. Chalmers and Calvin, regard it as a 'point of
                     indifferency.'"
                  "That is sufficient, Mr. Courtney," replied the young lady, "I merely wish to
                     know if the other denominations were guilty of the same inconsistency with our
                     own."
                  After a little further conversation, Mr. Percy and Mr. Courtney took their
                     leave.
                  Mrs. Earnest, the mother, had, during the time of this interview, been sitting
                     quietly in a corner, very busily engaged in hemming some ruffles. She took no
                     part in the discussion, but as soon as the gentlemen were gone, she turned to
                     Theodosia, and said—
                  "My dear child, I am perfectly astonished at your behavior this evening."
                  "Why, mother," said the young lady, in amazement, "what have I done? I am not
                     conscious of any impropriety."
                  
                  "Do you think, then, that it is perfectly proper and becoming in you to talk as
                     you did this evening about the good and eminent clergymen of our church? It
                     made my flesh quake and my heart burn to hear that impertinent little Baptist
                     pedagogue accuse such a man as Dr. Albert Barnes of perverting the Scriptures
                     and mystifying the truth. I wonder if he thinks a learned and pious
                     Presbyterian minister, like Mr. Barnes, is more likely to be 'blinded by
                     prejudice and passion' than an ignorant Baptist school master. You thought I
                     was not listening; but, though I did not take any part in your conversation, I
                     assure you I heard every word of it, and if it had not been for the presence of
                     Mr. Percy, I do believe I would have been tempted to order the fellow out of my
                     house. How could he be so destitute of every particle of self-respect, and of
                     all regard for your own church—the church of your mother and your grand
                     parents, in which you was born and raised, as to permit a man to talk in that
                     way in your presence! I declare I was perfectly ashamed of you! If that Mr.
                     Courtney ever shows his face in my house again, I do think I shall insult
                     him."
                  "Mother, what was it that Mr. Courtney said that was so unbecoming and
                     offensive? I am sure he seemed to me only as one anxious to get at the
                     truth."
                  "Why! did he not say that our preachers perverted the Scripture? Did not he say
                     that they set aside the commandments of Christ as matters of 'indifferency?' I
                     wonder if he thinks he knows more about the Scriptures than Dr. Chalmers or Mr.
                     Barnes, or even the weakest preacher in our church? I always heard that the
                     Baptists were an ignorant, bigoted, and intolerant sect, and I believe it now
                     more than ever. Just to think that—"
                  "But, mother, please let me say one word. Mr. Courtney did, indeed intimate
                     that Mr. Barnes had mystified and perverted verted the Scripture, but did he
                     not prove it before he said it? It was Mr. Percy who read in Mr. Barnes' Notes
                     that we must look in the Old Testament at those fifteen places, to learn the
                     meaning of the word baptize. We looked, and found that in fourteen of the
                     fifteen, the action was dipping, and in none of them sprinkling or pouring. It
                     was Mr. Percy who read that 'the meaning of the word is not to sprinkle or to
                     immerse, but it is to dip for the purpose of sprinkling, or for some other
                     purpose.' It was Mr. Percy who read in Dr. Chalmers that 'we (Presbyterians)
                     consider it a point of indifferency' whether the ordinance of Christ is
                     performed as he commanded, or in some other way. Now, if Mr. Barnes does prove
                     that the word means 'to dip,' 'for the purpose of sprinkling, or for some other
                     purpose,' and yet tells us that it can be done by pouring, does he not mystify
                     the subject by a strange medley of words? Was it so very wrong in Mr. Courtney
                     to point out these self-evident prevarications of Mr. Barnes, or the openly
                     avowed disregard to the commandment of Jesus Christ and the practice of the
                     Apostolic churches in Dr. Chalmers?
                  "If Presbyterians are guilty of such inconsistency, I am sorry for it, and
                     ashamed of it, but I can't help see it when my attention is directed to it; and
                     I really do not see how it could have been becoming in me to get angry with
                     those who were so kind as to point it out to me. On this subject I feel that I
                     would be willing to learn the truth even from an infidel or an idiot if they
                     could aid me."
                  "It is the part of a true friend," said the mother, "to hide a friend's
                     infirmities, not to divulge and glory in them. And even if our ministers have
                     done and said some thoughtless and silly things, it is not for a Presbyterian
                     like you, to speak of them, or permit others to speak of them so
                     contemptuously, in your presence. If you have no spirit of resentment sentment, I'll let you know that I
                     have, and Mr. Courtney too, if he comes here with any more of his Baptist abuse
                     of our pious and learned ministers."
                  "But, mother, if our ministers are wrong (as being human they surely may be)
                     how can it be wrong to point out their errors, and guard inquirers after truth
                     from falling into them?"
                  "I don't say," replied the mother, "that it is wrong to point out any trifling
                     errors, which they may have inadvertently taught; provided it were done in a
                     mild, gentlemanly, courteous, and Christian manner. But is it kind, is it
                     courteous, is it Christian-like, to accuse a great and good man like Mr.
                     Barnes, of torturing, perverting, and mystifying the Word of God, to sustain
                     some church dogma or church practice? Do you call that gentlemanly?"
                  "My dear mother, please don't be so angry with me; I really can't see why we
                     should not call things by their real names. And I must confess that so far as I
                     can understand the meaning of the words, Mr. Barnes does, on this subject,
                     mystify and pervert the language of Scripture, and Dr. Chalmers does clearly
                     intimate that it is no matter whether we do what Christ commanded in this
                     ordinance, or something else—which he did not command. And I begin to fear that
                     others on our side of this controversy are in the same predicament. Whether
                     those on the other side are not equally inconsistent, I have yet to learn."
                  "Well, my child, I don't know what to do with you. You have no more respect for
                     the opinions of the learned and excellent ministers of our church, than for
                     those of the most ignorant people."
                  "I am determined, mother, that I shall never trust any more to the mere
                     assertions of any man, or set of men, except those holy men who spake as they
                     were moved by the Holy Ghost. Whatever I can find for myself clearly put down
                     in The Book, that I will believe. Henceforth the Bible is my only guide, and I
                     will myself judge of its meaning for myself.
                  "But, my child, do you, can you think that you are as competent to judge of the
                     true interpretation of the Word as the great and good men who have given all
                     their lives to its study?"
                  "No, mother; but how if these great and good men disagree? Must I turn
                     Catholic, and so secure an infallible Priest? If I don't do this,
                     I must maintain my right to my own private judgment. I am accountable only to
                     God; I will be guided only by his Word. I thought you and pastor Johnson would
                     have encouraged and assisted me in the investigation of this or any other
                     question connected with my religious faith and practice. I know that he has
                     always told us to examine the Scripture for ourselves—and 'each to be fully
                     persuaded in his own mind.'"
                  'Certainly, my child; but then we thought that your investigations would tend
                     to confirm rather than shake your faith in our doctrines; but you seem to be
                     losing confidence rather than increasing it. These studies seem only to disturb
                     and unsettle your mind; and I fear, if you continue them, they will end in your
                     separation from us all. How, then, can I help desiring that you should leave
                     off these distressing investigations? Till you do so, I can hardly feel that
                     you are my own dear Theodosia. You begin almost to feel like a stranger to me
                     now. I declare I believe you will break my heart." And overcome by her maternal
                     feelings, she burst into a flood of tears, in which the daughter freely
                     joined.
               
               
                  
                  THE THIRD NIGHT'S STUDY
                  WHICH CONTAINS THE TESTIMONY OF THE PASTOR'S WITNESSES.
                  TO PROVE THAT JOHN DID NOT IMMERSE AT ALL, AND THAT CHRIST DID
                     NOT GO DOWN INTO THE WATER, BUT WAS BAPTIZED BY SPRINKLING ON THE BANK OF THE
                     RIVER.
                  
                  THIRD NIGHT'S STUDY.
                  THE Rev. Mr. Johnson had been the pastor of a large and wealthy congregation
                     for more than twenty years. Most of the young people of his charge had grown up
                     under his pastoral supervision, and old and young had been accustomed to regard
                     his word as Gospel truth; and when Miss Ernest ventured to suggest that she had
                     never been baptized, and asked him for the proof, it was probably the first
                     time that one of the "baptized children of his church" had ever expressed in
                     his presence any serious doubt of the full authority of his bare and
                     unsupported word.
                  After the brief visit at Mrs. Ernest's which we have recorded, he went to his
                     study and commenced the preparation of a sermon, which he hoped and intended
                     should prevent any others of his congregation from any attempt to investigate
                     this subject for themselves.
                  He did not propose in this discourse to mention the Baptists by name, or to
                     make any attempt to refute, or even to denounce their opinions or practices.
                     (To do so might direct attention to them, whereas he desired to divert it from
                     them.) But he determined to describe and denounce, as degenerate and vile
                     apostates, all those who, reckless of the obligations which had been placed
                     upon them in early infancy, and all the thousand nameless ties which had, in
                     childhood and youth, bound them to the church in which they had been born, and
                     solemnly dedicated to God in baptism, in whose doctrines they had been
                     instructed by parental lips, and into
                     whose communion they had been received by a public profession of their faith,
                     and who should, after all, be induced by the new coming proselyter, to abandon
                     the faith of their fathers, and the communion of their own church, and break
                     off like the wandering stars, to be lost in the darkness of anti-Presbyterian
                     errors.
                  This course, he was confident, would be more effectual in preserving the peace
                     and unity of his church, and the dignity of its pastor, than any attempt to
                     reason about the doctrines of this obscure sect of Baptists, who had so
                     suddenly begun to attract attention in his village. He would overwhelm the
                     doubters and inquirers with such a storm of public indignation, that hereafter
                     no one would dare to doubt; but in the meantime it was necessary, privately, to
                     satisfy such doubts as had already been expressed.
                  When, therefore, he had arranged the heads of his discourse, he repaired to his
                     book-case, and took down such authorities as would refresh his memory on the
                     subject of baptism—especially in regard to the points of difficulty, suggested
                     by Theodosia and Mr. Percy. The examination of these occupied the time till in
                     the night, and was resumed again the next morning.
                  Very early the next evening, having his mind fully charged with all the
                        "strong reasons" upon which Pædo-baptists are accustomed to
                     rest their cause, he called on Mrs. Ernest and her daughter again.
                  "Well, madam," said he, "how has our conversation the other evening affected
                     your daughter? I trust she has ceased to be so much distressed about these new
                     notions as she was."
                  "Indeed, Mr. Johnson, she gets worse and worse, and I begin to think Mr. Percy
                     is going the same way. I am so sorry Edwin called in that
                     little Baptist schoolmaster. It made my heart burn to hear them talk as they
                     did about the good and pious ministers of our church. It seemed to me they had
                     no more respect for a minister of the Gospel, or even a Doctor of Divinity,
                     than they had for a house carpenter or a French dancing-master."
                  "How so, Mrs. Ernest? I am sure your daughter has been too well raised to speak
                     disrespectfully of any minister of the Gospel, or permit another to do it in
                     her presence."
                  "That is just what I told her. I said I was ashamed of her, and —"
                  "But pray tell me, madam, what has happened? What was said that was so
                     improper?"
                  "Why, only to think that that little impertinent Baptist pedagogue had the
                     impudence to say, sir, here in my house, that our ministers perverted the
                     Scriptures, deluded their hearers, set aside the ordinances of Christ, and
                     substituted others in their place, and I don't know what all. I was so angry, I
                     could hardly see."
                  "Is it possible! and your daughter heard all of this?"
                  "Yes, sir; and the worst of it is, I do fear, sir, she more than half believes
                     it. You can't think how changed she is, sir! I never knew her to have a
                     particle of self-will before. She was always so gentle and affectionate, and
                     ready to yield every thing to any body; but on this subject she is very
                     stubborn, and declares she won't believe a single thing but what she can see in
                     the Bible for herself, even though she had it from your own lips, and all the
                     rest of the preachers in our church.
                  "Oh, sir," she continued, sobbing, (for her maternal feelings had begun to
                     overcome her,) "if you don't do something for her she will be lost to us all!
                     Do try to show her where that sprinkling is in the Bible. If she
                     can see it there, she will believe it."
                  
                  Mr. Johnson was fully resolved to make her see the sprinkling, if he could; but
                     was not quite certain as to the place where he would find it; and
                     before he had time to reflect much upon the subject, the young lady came into
                     the parlor.
                  She seemed for the moment slightly embarrassed, evidently from the conviction
                     that she had been the object of remark, but greeted her pastor cordially and
                     most respectfully. It seemed to him, though she was paler than before, that she
                     had grown more beautiful in the last few days. The unusual mental activity, the
                     excitement of a new object of investigation, and the calm, yet firm and solemn
                     determination to learn and to do her whole duty, had imparted to
                     her eye a new and intenser light, and to her countenance a strange, unwonted
                     brightness, as though the spirit, stirred to its inmost depths by these new
                     impulses, and burning with celestial fire, shone through its covering of flesh,
                     and illuminated her face with almost more than mortal radiance.
                  Could it be possible, he asked himself, that this lovely young creature could
                     speak irreverently of sacred things?
                  Alas! how much her mother and himself had misapprehended the nature of her
                     feelings. Never in her life had sacred things appeared to her so sacred. It was
                     because those great and good men, whom she had been accustomed from her infancy
                     to look upon with reverence, now seemed to her, themselves, to trifle with
                     sacred things, that she could no longer regard them as she had done. The Word
                     of God; the commandments of Jesus Christ; the ordinances of the Gospel; these
                     were sacred things. Never so fearfully sacred as now. And what could she think
                     of those, who, ministering at the altar of God, perverted and mystified his
                     Word, to hide the truth from those who sought for knowledge? What could she
                     think of those who counted the commandments of Christ, and the ordinances which
                     he had instituted a "matter of indifferency?" She had, indeed, in
                     some degree, ceased to reverence the (so called) ministers of Christ, who could
                     be so false to their sacred obligations as to trifle with God's holy Word, in
                     order to sustain a creed or a custom of their church; but oh! how deep, how
                     ardent, how unutterable was her reverence for the Word itself! How anxious, how
                     agonizing her desire to know what it required her to believe and to
                     perform!
                  It may be that the pastor had some suspicion of the true state of her mind in
                     this respect, for when he addressed her, it was with an expression of unusual
                     and most respectful consideration. He felt instinctively that she was not now
                     to be rated like a school girl, or convinced by unsustained assertions.
                  Indeed, he felt a strange restraint in the presence of the earnest-hearted,
                     strong-minded girl; and was revolving in his mind how he could best introduce
                     the subject which he came to talk of, when she relieved him by introducing it
                     herself.
                  "You did not have time the other evening," said she, "to finish your remarks on
                     the subject of baptism. You told me, you will recollect, that there was good
                     and sufficient evidence to show that our Saviour was not baptized in the river
                     at all, and that he was baptized by sprinkling, and, of course, if this was so,
                     sprinkling is the Christian baptism."
                  "You state the case a little too strongly, my daughter; I meant to say only
                     that there is no evidence that he was baptized in the river; and that the
                     baptism which he commanded (the baptism of the Gospel dispensation) was
                     performed by sprinkling."
                  "Please, Mr. Johnson, don't try to mystify me. Do you mean to say that the
                     baptism which Christ submitted to, and the baptism which he commanded, were two
                     different things, and that one was immersion and the other sprinkling?"
                  
                  "Not exactly, my daughter; I only meant to say they might be different. John's
                     baptism was not Christian baptism. It was the baptism of repentance, designed
                     to introduce Christianity. It prepared the way for the Gospel, but was itself
                     no part of the Gospel dispensation."
                  "And yet, Mr. Johnson, Mark says it was 'the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus
                     Christ.' But it does not make any difference to me whether it was Christian
                     baptism or not. I simply want to know about the act performed. John did
                     something, which is called baptism. Multitudes came to him, and were baptized
                     by him in the river of Jordan. Jesus also came to him, and was baptized in the
                     river of Jordan. Then Jesus went himself into Judea, and there He tarried and
                     baptized; and at the same time John also was baptizing in Ænon, near Salim; and
                     Jesus baptized more than John baptized. These baptisms were confined to the
                     Jews, but after his death, Jesus told the disciples to go and preach his Gospel
                     to all other nations, and baptize them; and we learn from the Acts
                     that they who gladly received the Word were baptized, both Jews and
                     Gentiles.
                  "Now, what I want to know is this: when John baptized, he performed a certain
                     act. When Jesus and his disciples baptized, did they not perform the same act?
                     and when he commanded to baptize the Gentiles also, did he not command the same
                     act to be performed, and did not the disciples perform the same act, in
                     obedience to that command? The same word is used, does it not mean the same
                     thing?"
                  "If it does, my child, it must mean something else besides immersion, for in
                     many of these cases of baptism, immersion was out of the question. In fact, it
                     is very certain, that John did not immerse those whom he baptized; though if he
                     had, it would not follow that Christ commanded immersion. John may have done
                     one thing, and Christ may have commanded something else."
                  "Very true, Mr. Johnson, he may have done it, but where is the proof that he
                     did? My name might have been Susan, but then I would not have been called
                     Theodosia. If he had meant another act, he would have used a different
                     word."
                  "Not if the word might mean either one or the other. You know that we contend
                     that the word baptize means to sprinkle, to pour, to wet, to wash,*
                        as truly as it means to dip or to immerse."
                  
                     
                     *See Dr. Miller.
                  
                  "Well, Mr. Johnson, even supposing it does have all these meanings, the
                     disciples must have understood the Saviour to use it (when speaking in
                     reference to his ordinance) in some one of them, and that one would be fixed by
                     his own example. What He received as baptism from John in Jordan, they would
                     ever after consider to be baptism; and would necessarily suppose he meant that
                     act when he used the word, even though it had a hundred meanings. But if you
                     will pardon me for being so troublesome, I would like to know what proof there
                     is that baptize in the Greek language has all these various meanings? We looked
                     into a Greek Lexicon the other day to find the meaning of the word, and we
                     could not find anything at all about sprinkling or pouring among the
                     definitions there."
                  "You looked in a Greek lexicon. You can't read Greek, can
                     you?"
                  "No, sir; but brother Edwin is studying the language, and he found the word,
                     and I could read the definition."
                  "And so you think you and Edwin are competent critics of a disputed point in
                     the Greek language?"
                  "Oh, no! Mr. Johnson, don't laugh at me. If you knew how anxious I am to learn
                     the truth, I am sure you would
                     sympathize with me and assist me. We did not think we knew any thing about it,
                     and that is the reason that we went to the Lexicon to learn. It is not Edward's
                     opinion that I referred to, but that of the learned Prof. Donegan. And Mr.
                     Percy has since examined quite a number of other Greek scholars upon the same
                     subject, and he has not found that any one of them gives sprinkling as one of
                     the meanings of baptize, though all agree in dipping."
                  "And so you and Edwin and Mr. Percy set yourselves up to teach such men as Dr.
                     Miller and other learned Theological writers of our church, the meaning of the
                     Greek language! Don't you intend presently to write a commentary on the
                     Scriptures? or a book of Practical Divinity? Edited jointly by Miss Ernest and
                     Mr. Percy!"
                  The young lady looked at her pastor in astonishment. She blushed deeply; tears
                     filled her eyes, and her utterance was choked. She had expected sympathy and
                     assistance; she met with ridicule and rebuke. Poor girl, she did not know how
                     hard it is for one who has long been accustomed to rule other minds, and have
                     his bare assertion received as unquestionable truth, to be called on for
                        proof. If he said baptize meant to sprinkle, what right had
                     she, poor, simple girl, to doubt his word or ask for evidence? Why, even he, a
                     minister of the Gospel, had never asked for proof when Dr. Miller said it. He
                     had always taken it for granted that baptism was sprinkling, or such men as Dr.
                     Miller would not have asserted that it was, nor would the church have enjoined
                     or permitted it.
                  There was an awkward pause in the conversation, for Theodosia was too deeply
                     mortified and embarrassed to know how to begin again.
                  Mr. Johnson saw that he had made a deep impression, though he did not feel
                     quite certain of its nature. And he said very mildly, "My dear child, don't
                     pretend to be wiser than your teachers. I can solemnly assure you, as a
                     Christian man and a Christian minister, that the word we render baptize does
                     legitimately signify the application of water in any way as well as by
                     immersion, no matter what the Lexicons may say; and if so, sprinkling is as
                     much baptism as dipping. The quantity of water used does not effect the
                     validity of the ordinance.
                  To this Theodosia did not reply. She felt that it was useless to ask again for
                     proof; and if she did not feel disposed to trust even her pastor's solemn
                     declaration in regard to the meaning of baptize, it was because she remembered
                     that Dr. Barnes had proved it to mean "not to sprinkle," but "to dip;" that
                     Stuart admitted this to be its prevalent and common signification; that the
                     great Dr. Chalmers expressly asserted that its meaning was to dip, and that it
                     was immersion which was practiced in the early churches; that McKnight and
                     other most eminent and learned Pædobaptists all agreed perfectly with the
                     Lexicons in giving immersion as its true meaning, and proving that such was the
                     understanding and practice of the apostolic churches. What Baptists might teach
                     she did not know, for as yet she had not read a Baptist book. She had common
                     sense enough to understand that if there had been any sprinkling or pouring in
                     the word, such men as Stuart, and Chalmers, and McKnight would have been sure
                     to find it and parade it before the world as a justification of their practice.
                     Though she was silent, therefore, she was far from being satisfied.
                  Mr. Johnson, acting on the adage that "silence gives consent," considered this
                     point as settled; "and now," he continued, "if this be the case, if
                        the word means to sprinkle or to pour as well as to immerse, it is evident
                        have dipped and Christ might
                     
                      and yet have used the same word,
                     which is used to describe John's baptism. I might rest the case here; but I
                     will go farther, and assert that John's baptism was not immersion at
                        all."
                  "Good evening, Mr. Johnson, I am glad to hear you say that," said Mr. Percy,
                     who chanced to come in at the moment and heard this strange assertion. "If we
                     can only establish that position we will throw the Baptists out of court."
                  "Nothing is easier done, Mr. Percy," said the pastor. "It could not have been
                     immersion, in the first place, because immersion was
                     impossible."
                  "Of course," said Mr. Percy, "if immersion was impossible, it could not have
                     been immersion. What was impossible could not have been done."
                  "Very well then, that settles the question, for it was clearly impossible for
                     John to have immersed the thousands and thousands, (not to say the millions)
                     that resorted to him for baptism."
                  "I don't know about that," said Mr. Percy. "In the first place we must
                     determine just how many there were, and then just how many John was able to
                     dip."
                  "Do you know how many there were?"
                  "Not precisely," said the pastor, "but there were great multitudes. The
                     Evangelist says, Jerusalem and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan
                     went to him and were baptized. Now the population of Jerusalem itself was a
                     prodigious multitude, and that of all Judea added to it would surely be more
                     than one man could dip in the time of John's public ministry."
                  "But," said Mr. Percy, "it does not say that all the inhabitants
                        went. It says the places went, by which we are to
                     understand that some of each place mentioned went. Just is if I should say that
                     in the great political Convention of 1840, all Tennessee was gathered at
                     Nashville to hear Henry Clay. I would not mean that every man, woman and child
                     in the State was there, but only that there were some from every part of it.
                     Just so, Matthew says Jerusalem came, that is, a great many people from
                     Jerusalem and Judea, and the country round about Jordan came, that is to say,
                     the country as well as the city was fully represented in the crowd. Besides,
                     John did not baptize all who came. He positively refused the Pharisees and
                     Sadducees, who composed a great part of the Jewish nation. I do not see,
                     therefore, that we have any means of knowing the exact number of the
                     baptized."
                  "But it can't be denied," said the pastor, "that it was an immense multitude,
                     too many for one man to have immersed."
                  "Will you permit me to ask a question," said Theodosia, timidly, (for she had
                     become almost afraid to speak at all, since that suggestion of the pastor about
                     a joint editorship with Mr. Percy in a body of divinity).
                  "Will you permit me to ask how much longer it would take to
                        immerse them, one at a time, than it would to
                        sprinkle them one at a time, in a decent and reverent way?"
                  "We do not know," said the pastor, "that they were sprinkled
                        one at a time. They might have stood in regular ranks along the
                     bank, and John taking a bunch of hyssop might have dipped it in the river and
                     sprinkled them by dozens as he passed along."
                  "Or," suggested Mr. Percy, "he might have provided himself with a large sized
                     syringe or squirt gun, and filling it from the river have turned its stream
                     along the ranks, as I have seen the boys do at school, sprinkling a whole bench
                     of boys before the master could see who did it."
                  This was uttered with such a perfectly serious air that the pastor was obliged
                     to receive it as an amendment to his own supposition, though he could not help seeing in what a ridiculous light it
                     placed both the baptizer and his subjects; and surely there is, in the
                     narrative of the Evangelists, quite as much evidence of the use of the squirt
                     as of the hyssop.
                  "There is another thought," said Theodosia, "which, it seems to me, will
                     obviate all the difficulty in the way of either a personal dipping or a
                     separate sprinkling of each individual. The Evangelist says that Jesus made and
                     baptized more disciples than John—and when the disciples were
                     gathered together after his death, there does not seem to have been a
                        very great multitude. So it is probable, I should think, that though
                     great multitudes came to John, and great multitudes followed
                        Christ, yet comparatively few brought forth fruit to
                     justify their baptism. And besides this, as Jesus is said to have
                     baptized, though he did not do it personally but by his disciples, so John may
                     have done a portion of his baptizing by his
                     disciples."
                  "Spoken like yourself, Miss Theodosia," said Mr. Percy. "That does indeed
                     obviate all difficulty. The baptism whatever it was, must have been a personal,
                     individual transaction; and as it would take as long to sprinkle a person, and
                     say over the proper formula of words, as it would to dip him, one is just as
                     possible as the other, and either entirely practicable with the aid of the
                     disciples. Don't you think so, Mr. Johnson?"
                  "No, I do not, but let it pass. I have another reason for believing that John
                     did not immerse. It says expressly that he baptized in Bethabara, beyond
                     Jordan—and in the wilderness, as well as at the much waters or many waters of
                     Ænon, and at the river Jordan. Now, as there is no mention made of a river at
                     Bethabara, or of a lake in the wilderness, it is fair to infer that no great
                     quantity of water was required—and, consequently, whatever he may have done in
                     Jordan, he did not immerse in Bethabara or in the wilderness."
                  "Why not, Mr. Johnson? I can easily understand that he was baptizing in the
                     wilderness, Bethabara and Jordan, at one and the same time. The
                     Jews (as I have learned in my Sunday-school lessons) called any sparsely
                     settled place a wilderness; and Bethabara was a ford or ferry-house, on the
                     east bank of the Jordan. If the neighborhood was lonely, it would be said to be
                     in the wilderness; and a baptism performed in the Jordan, at that place, might
                     be said with equal propriety to be performed in the wilderness, in Bethabara,
                     or in Jordan. Just as I might say that a person was baptized in Davidson
                     county, or in the city of Nashville, though the act was performed in the
                     Cumberland river, where it passes the city."
                  "Well," said Mr. Johnson, "I do not insist on this point; and I leave it more
                     readily, as I have an argument that is perfectly unanswerable; and
                     that is, that John says himself that he did not immerse—over and
                     over again he repeated this testimony: 'I indeed baptize you with
                     water, but he that cometh after me shall baptize you with the Holy
                     Ghost and with fire.' 'I am come,' he says, 'baptizing
                        with water;' and again: 'he that sent me to baptize
                        with water.' Now, when I want to know how John baptized, I go
                     right up to the reverend man with the hairy garment, and ask me to tell me for
                     himself. Did you baptize by immersion? 'No, sir; I baptized with
                     water, not in water. I was sent to baptize
                        with water, not in water—as he that cometh after
                     me baptizes with the Holy Ghost, not in the Holy Ghost, and
                        with fire, not in fire. So I baptize
                        with water, not in the water. I apply the water to
                     the subject, not the subject to the water.'"
                  
                  "There does seem to be some force in that," said Mr Percy.
                  "To be sure, there not only seems to be, but there is
                     a world of force in it. It is perfectly unanswerable, sir. I am willing to rest
                     our cause on this one point alone. You can easily understand how one can
                     sprinkle with water, or pour upon with water, but no one would ever speak of
                        immersing WITH water."
                  Theodosia began to think of her pastor as she had done before his visit. He was
                     not, after all, disposed to rest every thing on his bare word. He
                     had the proof, and had produced it, and that, too, just as she desired, from
                     the Book itself. Still there was a difficulty. If John did not immerse, why did
                     he baptize in the river? Why did Jesus, after he was baptized, come up out of
                     the water?
                  These were insuperable difficulties, but she knew not how to present them
                     without seeming wiser than her teacher.
                  Mr. Johnson, seemingly satisfied with the victory he had won, was about to take
                     his leave, although it was yet early, promising to call again soon, and show
                     that there was no instance of immersion as baptism recorded in the whole New
                     Testament.
                  "Not only is it true," said he, "that John did not immerse, but there is no
                     recognition of immersion as baptism in the Book. Neither before the death of
                     Christ, nor afterwards, did the disciples ever dip the baptized person in the
                     water."
                  "Please stop a minute longer," said Mr. Percy. "While we are on John's baptism,
                     I want to ask a single question. If John did not immerse, who did he baptize in
                     the river? If Jesus was not immersed, how does it happen that he had been in
                     the water? If Philip did not immerse the Ethiopian Eunuch for what reason did
                     they go down both of them into the water, before the baptism, and came up out
                     of it after it was done? Nobody in these days goes down into the water to
                     baptize unless he is a Baptist."
                  "They did not go into the water, then," replied Mr. Johnson, "any more than we
                     Presbyterians do now. There is no proof that John, or Jesus, or Philip, or the
                     Eunuch, ever went into the water at all."
                  "How can that be," asked Theodosia, "when the Scripture says expressly that
                     they were baptized 'in the river of Jordan,' and that Jesus 'came up out of the
                     water,' and that both Philip and the Eunuch 'went down into the water,' 'came
                     up out of the water?'"
                  "I know it reads so in our version," said the pastor, "but in the original it
                     reads near or at the river, not in it. And down
                        to the water, not into it, and up from the
                     water, not out of it."
                  "Were the translators of our version Baptists?" asked Mr. Percy.
                  "No, sir. It is well known that they were of the church of England."
                  "Had they any motive to favor the cause of the Baptists?"
                  "None at all, that I can conceive of."
                  "How, then, did they come to make such blundering work?"
                  "I cannot tell; but if they had known that the Baptists would make such a
                     handle of these little words 'in, and out of,' I have
                     no doubt they would have been more cautious. I hope now, Miss Theodosia, that
                     your mind is relieved. I will try to see you again to-morrow, when we will
                     finish the subject. For the present, I must bid you good night."
                  Theodosia accompanied him to the door, to light him out, and glancing up the
                     street in the opposite direction to that which he took she discovered Edwin and
                     Mr. Courtney returning turning from an
                     evening recitation—and could not resist the desire to hear what the teacher
                     might have to say about baptizing with the water at the bank of
                     the river. She accordingly waited till he came by, and invited him in.
                  "Well, Courtney," said Mr. Percy, as he entered the parlor, "we have got you in
                     a tight place now."
                  "Why? what has happened? Any thing wonderful? You look as though you thought
                     so."
                  "Yes, sir. The truth is, Mr. Johnson did have some strong reasons,
                     and he has brought them out on us to-night. He has in fact proved
                     what he said, and what you seemed to think impossible; that John's baptism was
                        not immersion, and that the Saviour never went into the water
                     at all, but was sprinkled on the bank."
                  "Well, how did he make all that out?"
                  "From the testimony of John himself. John says that he baptized not
                        in but with water. It is easy to conceive of
                     sprinkling with water, but no one ever heard of immersing with water."
                  "Is that all?"
                  "Yes, that is the substance of the argument."
                  "Is it possible!" said Mr. Courtney, "that a minister of Jesus Christ can take
                     such liberties with the Word of God!!"
                  "What do you mean! Mr. Courtney. Is it not all so?" asked Theodosia, in alarm,
                     for she felt that if her pastor had deceived her, even in this point, she could
                     never trust the word of any one again upon this subject.
                  "Mr. Percy," said Mr. Courtney, "can you read Greek. But never mind, Edwin
                     shall set us right."
                  "I can read a little, and, when in practice, could do as well as most of our
                     graduates," said Mr. Percy.
                  "Well, then you can judge if I attempt to deceive you Now, what will you say if
                     you find that John's assertion, so often repeated, reads in the Greek
                     Testament, in every instance, I baptize you 'in' water, never
                        'with,' in a single case? What will you say if you read, not
                     only that Christ was baptized 'in' Jordan, but 'into'
                     the river of Jordan?"
                  "Why, I will say that you have gained a victory over all the doubts and
                     difficulties which remained in my mind, and I will be convinced that John
                     immersed, and that Jesus was immersed by him in Jordan."
                  "And I," said Theodosia, "will be convinced that Theologians are the strangest
                     people in the world."
                  "Say rather, Presbyterian or Pædobaptist Theologians, Miss Ernest, for the
                     Baptists do not have to bear up and twist about under such a load of error and
                     inconsistency, and can consequently afford to talk right out, the truth, the
                     whole truth, and nothing but the truth. They can afford to take the Bible, the
                     whole Bible, and nothing but the Bible, with every word truly translated into
                     plain English, and abide by its decisions. They shun no investigation, avoid no
                     controversy, and have no need to change or keep concealed one single word of
                     the Holy record. But let us to our task, for it is growing late. Edwin, have
                     you your Greek Testament here?"
                  "Yes, sir; and my Lexicon and Grammar."
                  "Please bring them in."
                  "Edwin, can you tell us what is the primary and ordinary meaning of the Greek
                     preposition 'en'?"
                  "It means in, sir; or within, with the idea of rest in a place."
                     (See Bullion's Greek Grammar, p. 170.)
                  "What is the difference between en and
                        eis?"
                  "Eis signifies motion from without to within.
                        En corresponds to the English preposition
                        in—eis corresponds to the
                     English into."
                  
                  "I asked those questions, Mr. Percy, not on your account, but to satisfy Miss
                     Ernest. You are perfectly aware (as every school-boy who has gotten through his
                     Greek Grammar must be) of the correctness of Edwin's answers."
                  "Now be kind enough to take the Greek Testament, and find John 1: 26—'I baptize
                     with water.' How does it read?"
                  "It reads, 'baptizo en udati,'
                        in water, true enough."
                  "And so you will find it in every place. See the 31st verse, 'en' again; so in the 33d, and every place where
                     this expression, which your pastor so much relies upon, can be found.
                  "In any other Greek book, any school-boy would without hesitation translate it
                     'I immerse you in water,' 'I am come immersing in water,' etc. But
                     now if you will turn to Mark 1:9, you will find that the preposition is not
                        'en' but 'eis.' So that Jesus is said to have been baptized
                     or dipped, not merely in but ('eis') into the river of Jordan.
                  "Now these two words, en and eis, are the only words by which the Greek language
                     could express, without circumlocution, the idea of going into, or being in a
                     thing or place; and, therefore, if neither of them says that the baptism was
                     done in the river, I do not see how it could be said
                     to have been done there.
                  "Now I grant that very rarely en does mean
                     with, and that it sometimes, though very seldom, does mean at or near; but
                     neither of these is the primary, common, every-day use of the word. En means in, in Greek, as much as
                        in does in English. Eis means
                        into, in Greek, as much as into does in English."
                  "But, Mr. Courtney, there must be some foundation for Mr. Johnson's
                     supposition, that en means with,
                     or it would not have been so translated."
                  "Very true, Miss Ernest. En does sometimes
                     (though very rarely) mean with in the sense of the instrument—by
                     which an action is accomplished. But when a man would found an argument on its
                     having that meaning in every particular case, he must first prove that
                        such is OF NECESSITY ITS MEANING IN THAT INSTANCE. If 'En udati' necessarily meant with
                     water—if that was even its common, primary meaning, as it would be
                     naturally understood in any other book, or in connection with any other
                     subject, then it might form the basis for an argument; but no school-boy would
                     think of any thing else but in water, whenever he would see it;
                     and, consequently, for a classical scholar, like your pastor, to form an
                     argument upon 'with,' as the common meaning of 'en,' is indicative either of great carelessness, or
                     wilful perversion of the Word of God.
                  "Here is a fact which will enable you to form some more definite conception of
                     the nature of the case. Some very industrious gentleman has counted the places,
                     and so ascertained that this little preposition 'EN' occurs no less than two
                     thousand seven hundred and twenty times in the New Testament. In about
                     twenty-five hundred of these places, it is in our version correctly rendered
                     IN. In over twenty other places, in would better
                     express the evident meaning of the original. In only about forty places, out of
                     over twenty-seven hundred, does it of necessity mean with, in the
                     sense of the instrument or material with which any thing is done. The chances,
                     therefore, are as twenty-seven hundred to forty, that an argument based on the
                     word 'with' (where it stands for the Greek word 'en' will lead to a false conclusion, and the
                     chances are as twenty-seven hundred to forty that an argument based on
                        'in,' as the real meaning of the word, will lead to a true
                     conclusion. I baptize you in water, or, if we translate both words, I immerse, or more
                     properly, I dip you in water, is therefore the true
                     reading."
                  "But why, Mr. Courtney, should our translators have employed
                     'with' whenever 'en' occurs in
                     connection with baptize?"
                  "For the same reason, Miss Ernest, that they refused to translate baptize. They
                     were forbidden by King James to change the 'Ecclesiastical words.' They must
                     not teach immersion. But if they had said baptize 'in' water, it
                     would have been just as plain that there was no sprinkling or pouring in the
                     ordinance, as though they had translated 'baptize' in the New Testament, in the
                     same way that you have seen they did in the Old, in all the places where
                     (according to Mr. Barnes) the word occurs."
                  "But they did not use 'with,' in every case, because that
                     construction would have been, in some instances, such a monstrous perversion,
                     that every one could see it. They did not venture to say that the people were
                     baptized WITH the river of Jordan, confessing their sins; or that
                     Christ was baptized WITH the Jordan; or that John was baptizing
                     WITH the wilderness. Mark 1 : 4. It was only where connection did
                     not make the meaning clearly obvious to the unlearned, that they ventured to
                     mystify the ordinance by the substitution of with, in the place of the common
                     and primary meaning of the 'en.'"
                  "If I do not forget," said Mr. Percy, "with, when signifying the
                     instrument by which any thing is done, is in the Greek language, commonly
                     expressed by 'dia' construed with the
                     genitive."
                  "Yes, but even if John had said 'dia,'
                     instead of 'en,' the pastor would have had no
                     sufficient basis for his argument; for even 'dia' would have been a very slight, and very narrow, and very
                     sandy foundation. It would only have told that it was water, and
                     not oil, or mud or sand, or any other instrument or material with which the
                     baptism was performed. It would have said nothing at all about the
                        mode of performing the act. If I say that the cloth of which my
                     coat was made was colored with a solution of Indigo, I don't even
                     intimate that the solution was sprinkled on it or poured on it. The cloth was
                        dipped in it, I only mean that it was dipped in
                        Indigo not in logwood, or madder, or any other dye-stuff. If I say
                     that the leather of which my boots are made, was tanned with an
                     infusion of hemlock bark, I don't deny that it was dipped in the infusion, I
                     only mean that it was hemlock, not black oak, or red oak, or any other kind of
                     material that was used."
                  "Oh, yes!" exclaimed Edwin, who all the time had been a most attentive, though
                     a silent listener. "I asked old aunt Chloe, the cook, only this morning, how
                     she would get the feathers off the chicken she was killing for dinner. 'I will
                     scald it,' said she, 'with hot water.' And I went into the
                     kitchen, and saw her doing it by putting it into the water. And
                     big Joe, the butcher, when he killed our hogs last Christmas, loosened the
                     bristles and hair with hot water, but he did it by
                        immersion, for he dipped them several times into the barrel and
                     then pulled them out and scraped them."
                  "That will do, Edwin," said Mr. Percy, laughing. "I see we must give it up. If
                     you won't give us any more illustrations, I will promise never to mention
                        'with' again, by way of argument on this subject, as long as I
                     live; and seriously, Mr. Courtney, I feel that I have reason to be ashamed of
                     myself, for having been so easily imposed upon by this mere semblance of
                     argument, presented with so much parade, and such an air of confidence, by our
                     pastor, Mr. Johnson. I shall soon begin like Miss Ernest, to lose confidence in
                     all teachings but those of the Bible, and in all teachers but my own
                     judgment"
                  
                  "These, sir, are your only safe-guards," replied Mr. Courtney, "but it is well
                     to remember, that though God's word is infallible, our judgment may be biased
                     by our feelings; and when we study the Word therefore, we should pray for a
                        heart willing to receive, and a will ready to obey
                     all the commandments of our Heavenly Master. The difficulty with many persons
                     is not so much that they cannot understand as they are
                        unwilling to obey. You will, I fear, find it much easier to
                     satisfy your mind that immersion is the only scriptural baptism, than to
                     abandon your church connections, and submit to be baptized according to the
                     commandment of Jesus Christ. But I must bid you good night. It is time I was at
                     home."

                  FOURTH NIGHT'S STUDY.
                  ON the following day, the Rev. Mr. Johnson called at Mrs. Ernest's cottage soon
                     after dinner. Mrs. E. was delighted with this evident token of his interest in
                     her daughter's welfare. She had now given up all hope of inducing her to
                     abandon the investigation; and was only anxious to get through with it as soon
                     as possible. Much as she had disliked Mr. Courtney's remarks at the time of his
                     first call, she made no objection to the second visit; and even went so far as
                     to ask her daughter why she did not invite some of the Baptists to meet Mr.
                     Johnson face to face, when she would see what would become of all their hard
                     sayings about the 'Ministers of our church.'
                  "That little Baptist pedagogue," said she, "would no more dare to say such
                     things as he did about Dr. Barnes, and Dr. Chalmers, and Dr. McKnight, in the
                     presence of Mr. Johnson, than he would to put his head into the lion's month.
                     He finds that he can twist you and Mr. Percy about his thumb just as he
                     pleases, but let him come where Mr. Johnson is, or anybody else who has studied
                     this subject, and I'll warrant you he will be as mute as a mouse."
                  "Well, Miss Theodosia," said the pastor, as soon as the young lady came in, and
                     had exchanged with him the compliments of the morning, "I proved to you last
                     evening, I trust beyond the shadow of a doubt, that John's baptism was not
                     immersion. And now, as I have an hour to spare, I will if you can give me your
                     attention, show you that we have quite
                     as good ground for believing that the Apostles did not immerse any more than
                     John did; and that in fact there was never any such a thing as even a single
                     instance of immersion as baptism mentioned in the sacred Scriptures."
                  (Theodosia was about to interrupt him, and ask some further explanation
                     concerning the Greek preposition 'en,' and
                     the English preposition 'with;' but remembering the 'Book of
                     Divinity,' and thinking it safer not to seem 'wiser than her teacher,' she
                     continued silent. He went on, therefore, in blissful ignorance of the utter
                     overthrow of all the beautiful edifice which he had so ingeniously erected the
                     night before.)
                  "Now be kind enough to get your Bible, and turn to Acts 1: 5."
                  "Yes, yes, Mr. Johnson," said the mother, "that is the way to study the
                     subject. Show it to her in the Bible itself, for she declares she won't believe
                     a single word but what she can see in the Bible with her own eyes."
                  "Well, then, here it is, just read it, my child."
                  Theodosia read, "For John indeed baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized
                     with the Holy Ghost, not many days hence." And as she read, she could not help
                     giving the passage, in her mind, the true rendering, "John indeed immersed you
                        in water," etc.
                  "You see from this," resumed the pastor, "that not only John himself said that
                     he baptized with water, but that Jesus Christ also declared the
                     same thing. But that is not the point to which I wish now to direct your
                     attention. We settled that point yesterday. (Yes! thought Theodosia, but it did
                     not continue settled.) What I want you to notice now is the prophetic
                     declaration in this text: 'Ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many
                     days hence.' Now turn to the second chapter, and you will see the fulfillment
                     of this prediction. When the Day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all
                     with one accord in one place, and then and there they received this baptism of
                     the Holy Spirit. Now tell me how this baptism was performed. Just read the 17th
                     verse, and you will see. 'And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith
                     God, that I will pour out of my spirit,' etc. And now read the 33d
                     verse: 'Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received
                     of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth
                     this, which ye now see and hear.' Here then you see that the influences of the
                     Spirit are called a baptism, and they are distinctly said to be
                        'poured out,' and to be 'shed forth.' And from
                     this it follows, as a matter of course, that baptism is pouring
                     and shedding forth or sprinkling. I do not see how it
                     is possible for any thing to be clearer or more convincing than this."
                  "Certainly," exclaimed Mrs. Ernest, the mother; "that must convince any body in
                     the world. I should like to know what the school-master could say to that. I do
                     wish, Mr. Johnson, you would preach a sermon on this subject, and just set the
                     matter at rest."
                  "Pardon me," Mr. Johnson, said Theodosia, "if this argument does not appear so
                     conclusive to me as it seems to you. I was reading this very chapter this
                     morning, and the same difficulty came into my mind then which you have
                     presented now. It was on my mind when I engaged in prayer, and it was not until
                     nearly dinner time that I was able to see clearly how it could be that 'baptism
                        is immersion, and yet the Spirit be said to be poured
                        out in this most remarkable baptism. Now it is all perfectly
                     plain."
                  "Well, Miss Ernest, will you please favor us with your explanations?"
                  "Certainly," she replied. "Mr. Barnes, in his Notes on Matthew 20: 29, explains
                     baptism in sufferings and distress, to be an overwhelming of the soul with
                     great and intense afflictions. 'Are
                     you able,' he says, 'to be plunged deep in afflictions, and
                     to have sorrows cover you like water, and to be sunk beneath calamities as a
                     flood? Now in this there is no literal immersion, but the sorrow is represented
                     as covering and swallowing up the mind as water does the body in the act of
                     baptism. It is a metaphorical but not a real baptism.
                  "So in the case before us. As Christ had told James and John that they should
                     be immersed or overwhelmed by suffering and sorrows, so now he tells all the
                     disciples that they shall in a few days be immersed or overwhelmed by the
                     influences of the Holy Spirit. That these influences should cover, overpower,
                     and swallow up their minds, as the water in baptism did their
                        bodies. It is no more a literal baptism than the baptism of
                     suffering in Matthew. It is a metaphor; and the allusion is not to the
                        act done in baptism, so much as to the result;
                     that is, the swallowing up and overwhelming of their
                     minds by the flood of life, and light, and joy, and heavenly influence which
                     that day came upon their souls."
                  If the mother was surprised at the temerity of her daughter in venturing to
                     differ from her pastor, (to her a most unheard of event) yet her maternal pride
                     was so much gratified by the force and beauty of her reasoning, that she could
                     not be angry, and there was even a smile—a very slight smile of
                     exultation, which crept along the curves of her mouth as her daughter, with
                     animated face, and a new and strange light in her soul illumined her eyes,
                     entered into the discussion; and from this time forth (though she was
                     determined never to be convinced that her pastor was or could be wrong) she
                     could not help feeling secretly gratified whenever her daughter had the best of
                     the argument; and she inwardly enjoyed the evident amazement and perplexity
                     depicted in the Rev. Mr. Johnson's face.
                  He was amazed, that one of the "baptized children of his church"
                     should have ventured not only to differ from his opinions, so
                     forcibly expressed, but even to reason with him out of the
                     scriptures. He was perplexed, because he could not, for the moment, see what
                     reply he could successfully make.
                  "Surely, Mr. Johnson," resumed the young lady, after a moment's pause, "you do
                     not imagine that there was in this Pentecostal baptism any real, actual,
                        literal pouring out of the Spirit, like water is poured out of a
                     pitcher, or any literal sprinkling of the Spirit, as the minister sprinkles the
                     water off from the ends of his fingers?"
                  "It does not matter at all," he replied, whether it was literal or figurative,
                     actual or metaphorical, the conclusion must be the same in any case. There is
                     here clearly a baptism, a scriptural baptism; a baptism too of the Gospel
                     dispensation, and this baptism was performed by pouring. Jesus Christ
                     prophetically foretold that they should be baptized with the Holy Ghost, and
                     when the prophecy was fulfilled, Peter says expressly that the Holy Ghost was
                     poured out."
                  "But he does not say, Mr. Johnson, that the pouring out was the
                        baptism. The Holy Spirit cannot be literally poured out
                     or sprinkled out, nor could the disciples be literally immersed in him any more
                     than they had already been; for He is, and always was, every where present and
                     had always surrounded them on every side. It was clearly impossible therefore
                     that there could be any literal baptism, in any sense of the word, by
                     sprinkling, pouring, or immersion. It was not the Third Person of the Trinity,
                     the Divine Spirit, that was poured out and shed forth, but the miraculous and
                     wonderful influences of the spirit operating on the hearts and minds of the disciples, and others.
                     And if these influences were so powerful, and so universal, as to
                     surround and overpower the minds of the Apostles, they might most beautifully
                     and appropriately be said to be immersed in them. The baptism of the
                        spirit is a soul baptism, not a baptism of the
                        body, and the minds of the disciples are
                     represented by Christ as about to be taken so completely into the control and
                     direction of the Holy Spirit, that they would, as it were, be immersed in
                        it and swallowed up by it. Such a baptism actually did occur. The
                     minds of the disciples were thus overwhelmed and swallowed up by the wonderful
                     influences of the Spirit of God; and this is what, it seems to me, was intended
                     by Jesus when he said they would be immersed in the Holy Ghost."
                  "Well, as to that," rejoined the mother, (whose heart had begun already to
                     follow her daughter,) "I can see that their bodies were immersed too as well as
                     their souls, for there came a sound as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled
                     all the house where they were sitting; and of course it covered them all up and
                     entirely surrounded them, and they were in this way immersed in it."
                  "If the pouring," resumed Theodosia, encouraged by this open expression of her
                     mother's approval, "if the pouring had any thing to do with the baptism at all,
                     it was only by way of preparation, for as water might be poured into a vessel
                     preparatory to immersing any object or person in it, so the preparation of the
                     Holy Spirit for these wonderful influences might be here called his
                        pouring out, as such preparation is sometimes called a
                        coming down, or an entering into, or a
                        springing up."
                  "I am ready to admit," said the pastor, "that these Pentecostal influences were
                     called a baptism by Jesus Christ only in a figure I hope neither
                     of you think me so silly as to be capable of believing that the personal
                        substance (if I may speak so) of the Holy Spirit could be literally
                     poured out or sprinkled. But while it is true that this baptism was a figure,
                     it is equally true that our baptism is a figure also. It is designed to exhibit
                     in an emblematical manner the cleansing and purifying influences of the Holy
                     Spirit, in our hearts; how very beautiful and appropriate is it therefore, as
                     the Holy Spirit is represented as being figuratively poured out in this
                     baptism, that the water which represents his influences should be
                        actually poured out on us when we are baptized."
                  "It might indeed," said Theodosia, "have been a very beautiful and appropriate
                     emblem, and had our Saviour thought as highly of it as you do, HE probably
                     would have appointed it. But HE seems to have preferred immersion in
                        water; and this, while it may signify the cleansing of the Holy
                     Spirit, equally well, or better than the other, signifies also our death and
                     burial to sin, and our living again to righteousness; and it is thus that Paul
                     explains it when he says, 'we are buried with him by baptism into death, that
                     as Christ was raised from the dead, so we should walk in newness of life.' It
                     serves also to remind us of the burial and resurrection of Jesus, and
                     prefigures also our own coming death, burial and resurrection."
                  "What Baptist book have you been reading to learn all that?"
                  "I found it, Mr. Johnson, in a Presbyterian book; in the Notes of Dr. James
                     McKnight on the 6th of Romans. I have never read any Baptist book in my life,
                     unless (as I greatly suspect) the Bible is a Baptist book."
                  "I fear—I greatly fear, my child," rejoined the pastor, 'that you are running
                     into very serious and alarming errors I have exhorted you, and reasoned with
                     you, but I fear my labors have been
                     almost in vain. And now, before I take my leave, I feel it my duty solemnly to
                     warn you before God, to take heed where you are going. I should be greatly
                     pained, if we should find it necessary to expel you from the church."
                  "Expel me from the church! Why, Mr. Johnson, what do you mean? Have I been
                     guilty of any improper conduct? What have I done?"
                  "Nothing as yet, my child. I am happy to say, you have always been a faithful
                     and consistent communicant since you first approached the table of the Lord.
                     But now I find you growing wayward and self-willed, whereas, the Scripture
                     says, 'be not high-minded, but fear—and be in subjection to those who have the
                     rule over you in the Lord.' As yet, you have only imbibed some false and
                     injurious notions on the subject of one of the ordinances of the church. So
                     far, this has not led you to any overt act of evil which could subject you to
                     the discipline of the church, but if you persevere in this way, and especially,
                        if by your conduct and conversation you lead others to distrust
                     the purity of our doctrines, the propriety of our practice, and validity of our
                     ordinances, it will become our painful duty to deal with you as a disturber of
                     the peace and unity of the church."
                  The pastor uttered this significant warning with all due solemnity of
                     countenance and impressiveness of manner, but it did not have the effect upon
                     the young lady which he had expected. A week before this time she would have
                     heard it with very different emotions. Now she had not only
                        learned to fear God rather than man, but she had, upon
                     her bended knees, solemnly resolved before her Maker and Redeemer that, in
                     regard to this subject, she would both learn and do her whole
                     duty, whatever it might cost her.
                  This was indeed an unexpected, and, to her sensitive spirit a most terrible
                     test of the sincerity and firmness of that resolution, but it did not cause her
                     to waver even for one moment.
                  She did, indeed, turn deathly pale. Her chin quivered, and the light for a
                     moment went out in her eye. It was but for a moment, however, and before he had
                     completed the speech, the blood had come back to her face, and her eyes were
                     suffused with tears, which, however, did not overflow; and with perfect
                     collectedness of mind and calmness of manner, though with a scarcely
                     perceptible tremulousness of voice, she mildly replied:
                  "If it was your purpose, Mr. Johnson, to deter me from making a conscientious
                     and complete investigation of this subject, and then governing my conduct by
                     the written word of God, I beg you will remember that you have yourself
                     instructed me that I ought to obey God rather than man—and this, God helping
                     me, I mean to do, whatever may be the consequences to me or others."
                  "No, no, my child, you do not understand me. I desire you should be governed by
                     the word of God; but I would have you remember that God has given you
                        teachers to help you to a true understanding of His word. It is
                     for this purpose that he has appointed us his ministers, to guide the young,
                     instruct the ignorant, and make known to all what are the teachings of that
                     word."
                  "But what if our ministers should chance to disagree? Am I to remain all my
                     life in doubt, or take the matter into my own hands and decide for myself? Will
                     the ministers answer for me in the day of judgment? You tell me,
                     Mr. Johnson, that Jesus Christ was sprinkled, but James McKnight, another
                     eminent minister of our own church, a Doctor of Divinity, and for twenty years
                     the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian church in the country where he lived, tells me
                        'that Jesus submitted to be baptised, that is, to be put under the
                        water and taken out again by John;' and Dr. Chalmers, another most
                     eminent minister of our church, tells me 'that the meaning of the word
                        baptism is immersion;' Martin Luther, the great reformer, says
                     expressly, that it was immersion, which was 'without doubt instituted by
                        Christ;' and John Calvin, the father and founder of our Presbyterian
                     church, distinctly states that 'the word baptize signifies to immerse,
                        and the rite of immersion was practised by the ancient church?'"
                  "Yes, my child, but then do not all these great and good men, at the same time
                     assure you that it is a matter of no importance which way the rite is
                     performed?"
                  "They do, indeed; but that is only their own private or individual opinion.
                     They don't even pretend that the word of God teaches that it is of no
                     consequence whether we do what Christ commanded or not. I cannot think, like
                     Dr. Chalmers, that it is a 'matter of indifferency,' or like Calvin, that 'it
                     is of no consequence at all.' I dare not set aside the commandments of Christ
                     for the doctrines of men; and if you will pardon me for saying it, I do not see
                     how any minister of Jesus Christ can dare to teach such
                     sentiments. If Jesus Christ commanded us to believe and be immersed, I
                     surely did not obey that command by being sprinkled.
                  "Pardon me, Mr. Johnson, for talking so plainly, but you have driven me to it.
                     You promised, this evening, to show me, out of the Scriptures, that the baptism
                     of the Gospel dispensation was sprinkling, and all you have done was to show me
                     where the Holy Ghost was, by a figure of speech, said to be poured
                        out on the day of Pentecost, and where Christ had prophetically
                     declared that they should, in some sense, that day be
                        metaphorically immersed in the Holy Spirit—for you do not
                     pretend that it was more than a mystical and figurative baptism
                     which the Saviour foretold. You did not, and you cannot prove, that this
                     prophecy referred to the preparatory 'pouring out' any more than to any of the
                     wonderful influences that followed the outpouring.
                  "Now I had learned from ministers of our own church, from Calvin and Chalmers,
                     and as directed by Mr. Barnes, from the word of God itself, that the meaning of
                     the word baptism is a dipping or immersion. I knew that when Jesus was baptised
                     it was done in the river, as immersions are now performed. And that when the
                     Eunuch was baptised they went down into the water, and when the solemn rite was
                     done they came up out of the water just as they do in immersions now. I knew
                     that Paul called our baptism a burial. And that our own ministers,
                     as Chalmers and McKnight, explained this as an allusion to the custom of the
                     first Church, of baptising by immersion, and because in the face of all this
                     visible and tangible evidence that the real and literal baptism submitted to,
                     and commanded by Christ, and practised by the Apostles in the first church was
                     immersion, I could not, on the authority of a mere figure of
                        speech, and that of doubtful application, believe it to have been
                     pouring, you tell me I am wayward and self-willed, and intimate that I may
                     expect soon to be dealt with as a disturber of the peace and unity of the
                     church."
                  "I think, Mr. Johnson,' said the mother, "that you were a little
                     too hard on Theodosia about that. I never could myself see much force in these
                     figures of speech or metaphors as Theodosia calls them."
                  "Why, mother," resumed the young lady, "if Mr. Johnson will let me reason in
                     the same way that he does, I will prove to him that the poor little boy of whom
                     we were reading ing this morning,
                     that was drowned in the river, was actually drowned on dry land by a few drops
                     of water sprinkled on his face."
                  "I don't see how, my daughter, but here is the paper containing the account of
                     the accident. I would like to hear you try."
                  "'MELANCHOLY ACCIDENT.
                  "'It is our painful duty to announce that little Charlie Freeman, a sprightly
                     lad about nine years old, of a most lovely disposition and extraordinary
                     promise, the only son of his mother, and she a widow, was accidently
                        drowned this morning in the Cumberland river. We were one of
                     those who recovered the body and bore it to the dwelling of the now doubly
                     bereaved mother. We cannot describe the sorrow with which this sad event has
                     filled our hearts. We have just left the melancholy scene, where the
                     heart-broken mother is sitting in the midst of a large circle of friends who
                     are all drowned in tears.'
                  'Now, Mr. Johnson tells me that the disciples, on the day of Pentecost, were
                     figuratively or metaphorically baptized by pouring, and if so,
                     then he asks me to believe that Jesus Christ must have been literally and
                     actually baptized in the same way, that is, by pouring, in the river Jordan.
                     This is the whole argument. Now I say here was a large circle of this poor
                     lady's friends who were metaphorically said to be drowned in a little water
                     running down their faces out of their own eyes; and if so, then the dear little
                     boy must have been actually and literally drowned by a few drops of water
                     running down his face."
                  "But you forget," said the pastor, "that the lad was said to be drowned
                        in the river."
                  "Not at all," she replied, "for so also Jesus Christ is said to have been
                        baptized in the river; but you try to persuade me that he only
                     stood upon the bank, and John took up some of the water of the river, and
                     sprinkled it on his face. And some of our writers tell me that he might have
                     gone a few steps into the water, and there, standing in the river, John took up
                     a little water and poured it on his head out of a mussel shell, or a cup. So I
                     will grant that this poor little lad may have gone to the bank of the river,
                     and that some of the water of the river was thus splashed up into his face; or
                     that he waded in a little way, and some other boy did the same, took up some
                     water with his hand, and threw it in his face—but that he must have been
                        drowned by a little water running over his face, is perfectly
                     self-evident, for this is the only way in which the large circle
                     of his mother's friends could have been drowned."
                  "I see," rejoined the pastor, "that your mind is already made up, and it is
                     scarcely worth while to argue the subject with you any further. You have
                     determined that you will not be convinced. But before I leave you to-day, I
                     will suggest one more point for your consideration, which, if you are not
                     already hardened in unbelief, can hardly fail to satisfy you."
                  "Oh no, Mr. Johnson, I am ready and anxious to be convinced. What have I to
                     gain by believing that immersion is the only baptism? You have already
                     intimated what I may expect from you and from the church which I have loved so
                     dearly. I fear I have already lost in part the affection of my precious
                     mother,"—and her eyes filled with tears.
                  "No, my daughter," said Mrs. Ernest, "you have not lost my love, and I will
                     love you still, do what you may. I know you are a dear, good, conscientious
                     child; and would not for the world do what you did not believe to be right. If
                     you leave us, my child, I can't help mourning over you, but I will love you still. But do listen to Mr.
                     Johnson, my darling, and see if he can't convince you."
                  "Certainly, mother, if Mr. Johnson will show me one single place
                     in the Word of God where baptism is called sprinkling or pouring (not in the
                     way of a metaphor or a figure, but literally and plainly), I will be content.
                     If he will show one single instance in which baptism is plainly
                     said to have been done by sprinkling or pouring—not
                     dimly and metaphorically, as those good ladies were drowned in tears, but
                     actually and really, as the dear child was drowned in the river—I will ask for
                     nothing more. But till he can show it to me in the Bible, I can't
                     believe that it is there."
                  "As to that," said the pastor, "I can show you sprinkling and pouring oftener
                     than I can immersion, for there is no such word as immersion used in the whole
                     Book."
                  "I know," said she, "that sprinkling and pouring are mentioned often enough,
                     but not as baptism; what I want is the place where they are literally
                        said to be actual baptism. I know that immerse does not
                     occur in our version, because dip is generally used where the word
                     baptize occurs; but if baptism means immersion, as Calvin,
                     McKnight, Chalmers, and others of our ministers say it does, and as the
                     lexicons of the Greek language say it does, then immerse occurs, in fact,
                        every time baptize occurs."
                  "Well, well, I see you are not to be easily satisfied on this point; and I have
                     no more time to spare to-day. I was about to direct your attention to another
                     argument in this same chapter, which will, I trust, set your mind at rest
                     forever.
                  "You see here that there were no less than three thousand souls converted by
                     Peter's sermon; and all this vast multitude were added to the church that very
                     day. Now it is clearly impossible that they could have been
                     baptized by immersion mersion, and, therefore, it must have been done by
                     sprinkling or pouring; and if so, then sprinkling and pouring must be the
                     Gospel baptism. I consider this argument entirely conclusive. I want you to
                     examine the record of the transaction carefully and candidly, and if you can
                     believe that these three thousand people were all immersed, you can believe
                     almost anything. I will call again next week, and you can tell me what you
                     think of it."
                  The Rev. Mr. Johnson, as he was saying this, arose and took up his hat to
                     depart.
                  "Please tell me one thing before you go," said Theodosia. "You said it
                        was impossible that these three thousand persons could have been
                     immersed. Please tell me why."
                  "For two good and sufficient reasons," he replied. "In the first place, there
                     was not water enough; and, in the second place, there was not
                        time enough. And either one of these circumstances was clearly
                     sufficient to render immersion impossible. We will not discuss the subject any
                     farther at present. Examine it at your leisure, and I trust, when I see you
                     again, I will find your mind entirely satisfied. For the present, I must bid
                     you good evening."
                  Mr. Johnson walked home, thinking what strange perversity it was in a young
                     girl to venture to form an independent opinion on a theological subject, and to
                     question the infallibility of his reiterated assertions, and even
                     to undertake to argue the matter with her pastor.
                  The young lady took her Bible, and began to examine again the passages to which
                     the pastor had referred in their conversation; but before she had made much
                     progress, her mother required her assistance in some household duties, which
                     occupied her attention till after supper.
                  Scarcely was supper over, and the table cleared away, when who should come in
                     but her UNCLE JONES.
                  
                  "Well, Theo.," said he, in his unceremonious way, "I am told that I am about to
                     lose my niece, and that you are on the point of turning Baptist."
                  "Oh, uncle, don't say that! I shall not be lost to you or any of those I love,
                     even though I should feel it my duty to be baptized. I will still be your own
                     niece, and love you as well as ever."
                  "You will? Then your mind is about made up on the subject, I suppose?"
                  "Very nearly, uncle. I have some other points yet to examine, which were
                     suggested by pastor Johnson this afternoon, and unless I find them more —"
                  "Some other points to examine! Suggested by the pastor! Do you, then, undertake
                     to differ with your pastor; and talk about deciding for yourself in regard to
                     one of the most difficult and complicated questions in theology?"
                  "Oh, please, uncle, don't be angry; and don't laugh at me. I know I am only a
                     poor simple girl, but I am accountable only to God, and must be decided by my
                     own understanding of his Word. What I can't find in the Scripture for myself, I
                     can't be sure is there. If I don't examine for myself, how can I know anything
                     about it?"
                  "Can't you take your pastor's word for it?"
                  "Yes, if he will show me a 'thus saith the Lord,' as his authority."
                  "But can't you take it for granted that he has such authority, without his
                     pointing to the chapter and the verse?"
                  "It is God's Word, uncle, that I must obey, not man's. If it is in the Book, he
                     can't object to showing me where it is I want to see it for
                     myself. The Apostle praised the Bereans, not because they took Paul's word for
                     all he said, but because 'they searched the Scriptures for themselves 'to see
                     whether these things were so.'"
                  "But what if you come to a different conclusion from the pastor? Do you think
                     it will be wise to trust your own judgment, rather than that of the many great,
                     and good, and learned men of our church, who have examined this subject more
                     thoroughly, and under much more favorable circumstances, than you can hope to
                     do? Do you think it will be indicative of the humility required by the Gospel
                     of Jesus Christ, for a simple girl not yet out of her teens, and without any
                     theological education, to set up her own opinions against those of
                     the wisest and best men of the age?"
                  "No, uncle, I don't intend to set up my opinions against those of the great and
                     good men you speak of. But I find that others, equally great and good men,
                     after a careful examination of the subject, have come to a different
                     conclusion; and that some of these same Doctors of Divinity in our church,
                     while they practice one thing, and instruct us to do it, yet expressly declare
                     that it was another and a very different thing which Christ commanded and the
                     first Christians practiced. Now 'when the doctors disagree,' not only with each
                     other, but with themselves, what is a poor, simple girl like me to do? I can't
                     study theology, but I can study the Bible. If sprinkling, as
                     baptism, is there, I can see it. Pastor Johnson says it is there; other learned
                     theologians say it is not. What can I do? I say to each of them, if sprinkling
                     is commanded, show me where; if pouring is commanded, point out the place; if
                     dipping is commanded, let me see it for myself. If I can't find it, and you
                     can't show it to me, I won't believe it's in the Book at all. I hope, uncle,
                     you don't really think that I am proud or egotistical; I only want to know just
                     what my Saviour requires. I will believe anything, and do anything, if you will
                     only show me that he has said it or commanded it."
                  
                  "No, my dear child, I don't think you are egotistical or proud. I admire your
                     independence, and I wish every person, in every place, would in the same way
                     search the Scriptures, and understand perfectly the grounds on which their
                     faith and practice rests. It is not only the privilege, but the
                        duty of every person, to examine and decide for themselves
                     personally, what the Word of God requires. Religion is a personal
                     thing. It requires personal obedience—and that too of the heart,
                     which cannot be rendered without some degree of personal
                        understanding of the Word. If you trust your conscience in any man's
                     keeping, you place yourself in a dangerous condition. I am rejoiced to see you
                     studying this subject for yourself. And indeed I was only trying your courage a
                     little, when I affected to be surprised at your doing so. But seriously, my
                     dear Theo., why did you not come to your uncle with your difficulties?"
                  "I did intend to consult you, uncle, before my final decision, but the question
                     came up so unexpectedly, and our investigation has gone on so rapidly, that I
                     have not yet had any very convenient opportunity; and besides, uncle, to tell
                     the truth, I was afraid you would either be angry, or laugh at me."
                  "You were! Well, then, I will disappoint you, for so far from laughing at you,
                     I consider it a very serious and most important question; and instead of being
                     angry with you, it will give me great pleasure to assist you in the
                     investigation; and if I can't show you the sprinkling baptism in the Bible, I
                     will be immersed myself. I will not be like those Doctors of Divinity you spoke
                     of, who say one thing and practice another. If Jesus Christ did not command
                     sprinkling, I for one will neither teach nor practice it. I have felt for some
                     time that it was my own duty to investigate this subject, and I will do it
                     now—and with your assistance."
                  "Oh! uncle, don't talk of my assistance; I am but an ignorant, though anxious
                     inquirer after the truth, and am obliged to call for help on others at every
                     step. If I should speak of rendering assistance to you, I should indeed deserve
                     to be called proud and egotistical."
                  "Well, well; any, way my child. If you won't help me, I will help you. Tell me
                     just how far you have got along; what discoveries you have made, and where you
                     are standing now; and then we will consider of the rest."
                  "It will be too long a story, uncle, to go over all the road that I have
                     traveled. But I have learned that there is 'one Lord, one faith,
                        and ONE BAPTISM.' I have been inquiring whether that baptism is
                     sprinkling, or pouring, or dipping. I have discovered that baptize, as it is
                     used in the New Testament, is a Greek word, and must be understood as those who
                     read and spoke the Greek language in our Saviour's time would understand it.
                     Dr. Albert Barnes told me I could learn this by examining the fifteen places
                     where, he says, the word occurs in the Old Testament. I hunted out each place
                     and found it meant 'to dip.' I looked in Webster's dictionary, and found that
                     to dip in water was to plunge an object into the fluid and instantly take it
                     out again. The very act which the Baptists perform when they baptize. I got
                     Edwin to look in his Greek Lexicon, and he found that the word had the same
                     meaning there,—that baptism was immersion. I read McKnight and Chalmers on the
                     6th of Romans, and found that these great Doctors of Divinity in the
                     Presbyterian church agreed in declaring the same thing, and further, that it
                     was immersion that was practised by the first church. I am told that Luther,
                     and Calvin, and Doddridge, and a great many others of the most eminent of our
                     Theologians, teach the same things. And I have not yet found in the word of God
                     a single passage which leads me to
                     any different conclusion. Unless, there fore, I should find, as paster Johnson
                     assures me I shall, that it was clearly impossible to immerse the three
                     thousand that were added to the church on the day of Pentecost, I must be
                     convinced."
                  "On what ground does your pastor think it impossible?"
                  "He says there was neither water enough, nor time enough."
                  "Well, how can you prove that there was?"
                  "It don't seem to me, uncle, that it is necessary that I should be able to
                     prove it in any other way than by the mere statement of the Scripture that they
                     were baptised, for if the word baptize means to immerse, then the book
                        says they were immersed; and if they were immersed, there
                        must have been time enough and water enough, whether I can
                     prove it or not. If I do not believe this, I make God a liar."
                  "But what if it can be clearly shown that there was not water
                     enough, or time enough; then would it not be more reasonable to suppose the
                     word has some other meaning, than to believe the record to be
                     false?"
                  "Perhaps it would, but the pastor only said it. He did not
                        try to prove it. Nor do I see how it would be
                     possible now to determine how much water there was in Jerusalem
                     1800 years ago. Even if we knew the exact number of gallons it would require to
                     immerse three thousand people. I remember that we read in 2 Kings 18: 17, about
                     the 'upper pool,' and in 2 Kings 20: 20, about the
                        'pool' that Hezekiah made, and in Nehemiah about another
                        'fountain' and 'pool,' and in Isaiah 22: 9, about
                     the 'waters of the lower pool,' and in John 5: 2, about the
                        'pool of Bethesda' that had five porches, and John 9: 7, about
                     the 'pool of Siloam.'"
                  "I think the pastor will be obliged to give it up, Theo., so far as the want of
                        water is concerned: for in addition to this testimony from the
                     Scripture, we have that of many distinguished travelers who were like ourselves
                     opposed to the Baptists, and yet all agree that Jerusalem was, and is, one of
                     the best watered cities on the globe. Dr. Robinson, one of these travelers,
                     speaks of 'immense cisterns now, and anciently, existing within the area of the
                     Temple, supplied partly from rain water, and partly by the aqueduct,' and tells
                     us also that 'almost every private house had a cistern in it,' p. 480. Speaking
                     of the reservoirs, he says, p. 483, 'With such reservoirs, Jerusalem was
                     abundantly supplied, to say nothing of the immense pools of Solomon beyond
                     Bethlehem, which were no doubt constructed for the benefit of the Holy
                     City.'
                  "'There are,' he says, 'on the north side of the city, outside the walls, two
                     very large reservoirs, one of which is over 300 feet long and more than 200
                     feet wide, and the other nearly 600 feet long by over 250 feet wide;' and
                     besides these he mentions the pool of Siloam and two others as being without
                     the walls. Within the walls he mentions 'the pool of Bathsheba,' 'the pool of
                     Hezekiah,' and 'the pool of Bethesda.' The pool of Hezekiah he says was about
                     240 feet long by about 144 broad; the pool of Bethesda 360 feet long by 130
                     wide; and besides these he mentions an aqueduct and numerous other fountains.
                     (Rob. Resh. in Pal. pp. 480 to 516.)
                  "But we might have known, without any of this testimony that a city to which
                     the whole male population of a vast and fertile country were required to resort
                     several times a year, and whose religious ceremonial required such frequent
                     ablutions as did that of the Jews at the time of Christ, would be abundantly
                     furnished with the means of bathing, and consequently present sufficient
                     facilities for immersion. Moreover, the water would not be destroyed by dipping
                        in it; and therefore the same
                     quantity that would suffice for one would do for a hundred. And it is evident
                     that so far as the water is concerned, any one of these numerous
                     pools, either in or out of the city, would have sufficed. But was there not
                     another and more serious difficulty? These pools and fountains belonged to the
                     Jews. The same men who hated and crucified Christ now had control of the water
                     of the city and the suburbs, and is it probable that they would permit the
                     disciples to use them?"
                  "Certainly they would," said Theodosia, "for in consequence of the wonderful
                     events of this day, the Scripture says that 'fear came upon every soul,' and
                     that the disciples 'did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,
                     praising God and having favor with all the people.' They gave them
                     the Temple to preach in, and it is not likely that they would refuse the pools
                     to baptize in."
                  "Surely," said uncle Jones, "that must remove all conceivable difficulty as to
                     the water; but we may not find it so easy to arrange matters in regard to time.
                     Time has always been a very unaccommodating old fellow; and a day among the
                     Jews was only twelve hours, from six in the morning till six at night, and if
                     we can't get the three thousand into the water within that period, we shall be
                     obliged to leave some or all of them out, and dispose of them in some other
                     way."
                  "Well, uncle, I don't see why we can't dispose of some of them in
                     some other way, for the Scripture does not say they were all
                        baptized that day, but only all added to the
                     company of the disciples; and some of them may have been baptized
                     by John or by the disciples of Jesus Christ before his death, and now only come
                     out publicly and consorted with the Apostles; and some might have gone up to
                     them and joined their ranks that day and have been baptized afterwards wards.
                     As a person is now said to have joined the Baptists when he makes a profession
                     of religion among them, and is received by them for baptism.
                  "But is it by any means certain that three thousand could not all have been
                     immersed that day? It would not be hard to tell if we knew how much time there
                     was; how many administrators there were; and just how many each one of them
                     could immerse."
                  "Well, stop a little, Theo., let us take up one point at a time. How many hours
                     had they to go upon? though as to that, I don't see why it would not take about
                     as long to sprinkle or pour upon them, one at a time,
                     and reverently repeat the formula, 'I baptize thee in the name of the Father,
                     and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,' as it would to immerse them; but
                        we will examine. What says the record? It seems that when Peter
                     commenced his speech, it was not yet nine o'clock in the morning, which, as the
                     Jews counted from six, would be the 'third hour in the day.' How long before
                     nine it was we cannot tell. We will suppose it was just nine, and there were,
                     consequently, only nine hours remaining, before six in the evening, which
                     closed the day. Peter's speech, as it is recorded, would not have occupied a
                     quarter of an hour in its delivery; but it is said that he exhorted them with
                     many other words; so we will suppose he spoke an hour, or we will say
                        two hours. It would then be eleven o'clock. Now we will give
                     them another hour to go to the water, so that it is twelve o'clock when the
                     baptism begins. Now they must finish, you see, in six hours; so that is our
                     limit as to time."
                  "Very well, uncle, we will consider it so, though really I can't see any
                     evidence that Peter spoke even one hour, much less two. But now
                     how many administrators were there?"
                  "This is a question," said uncle Jones, 'about which there is some difference of opinion. There were
                     certainly the twelve Apostles, and many think also the seventy others whom
                     Jesus sent out two by two—who must have been present, as Luke says 'they were
                     all with one accord in one place.' If so, then there were eighty-two authorized
                     administrators. But let us, first, to obviate all difficulties, suppose there
                     were only the twelve, who would each have just two hundred and fifty persons to
                     immerse. So on this supposition, the question is narrowed down to this—can one
                     man immerse two hundred and fifty persons in six hours? I have felt some little
                     curiosity on this subject, and when I have witnessed immersions, have taken out
                     my watch, and observed the time. It has usually required about fifteen minutes
                     to immerse twenty persons; provided the candidates march in two by two, to the
                     place where the administrator is standing. This allowance of time permits the
                     work to be done without any appearance of haste, and with the coolest
                     deliberation.
                  "I have been told by several Baptist ministers, whose veracity I have no reason
                     to doubt, that they have immersed large numbers at the rate of two in every
                     minute, or sixty in half an hour. At this rate the twelve would have finished
                     the work of this occasion in a little over two hours—two hours and ten minutes.
                     If they only worked half so fast, and baptized but one a minute, they had time
                     to get through, and more than an hour and a half to spare. They could each have
                     stopped every half hour, and rested ten minutes, and then have gotten through
                     in time."
                  "So, uncle, it is as I suspected, there is no difficulty as to time, even
                     though only the twelve were engaged in the work; but if the seventy assisted,
                     then how long would it take?"
                  "In that case, there would have been less than forty persons sons for each
                     administrator, and of course it could have been done in less than half an
                     hour."
                  "But, uncle, is it certain that any one besides the twelve were authorized to
                     baptize?"
                  "Surely, Theo., others must have been, for it is evident that Aquilla, Acts 18:
                     2, and Apollos, Acts 18: 24, and Paul himself, Acts 9: 18, were baptized by
                        others than the twelve. And Peter, when he had preached the
                     Word to the household of Cornelius, did not baptize them himself, but directed
                     it to be done by some one else—Acts 10: 14. But whether this baptism was
                     performed by the twelve, or by the twelve assisted by the seventy, does not now
                     concern us, as we find there was no want of time in either case. And so you
                     have found nothing in this case to change your opinion concerning the meaning
                     of the word baptize. Now have you any other difficulties in this way?"
                  "Not that I know of now, uncle. The case seems to me to be perfectly plain. But
                     perhaps you can suggest some other source of information which I have not yet
                     explored."
                  "Indeed, my dear niece, I am myself in great perplexity upon this very
                     question. I have been some time engaged in its investigation; much longer than
                     you have, and have been compelled to come to about the same conclusions with
                     yourself—though this is the first time I have ever mentioned it."
                  "Oh, uncle, is it possible? Oh if I had only known this four days ago."
                  "Oh, yes. If you had known it, I suppose you would have been quoting uncle
                     Jones as high authority for your heretical opinions. But I beg you will not
                     mention this, even to your mother, until I shall have finally decided the case.
                     But tell me now, Theo., what do you intend to do?"
                  "There is only one thing, uncle, that I can do. I must obey my
                     Saviour—I must be baptized. There is only one reflection that still casts a shade of doubt
                     across my mind, and that is this: if it was immersion that Christ commanded,
                     and the Apostles and first Christians practiced, how has it so universally been
                     set aside, and sprinkling substituted in its place?"
                  "A very important point is that, my dear niece, and I hope you will come to no
                     final conclusion till you have investigated thoroughly the whole subject in all
                     its bearings. And be assured, if I can in any way assist you, I will be most
                     happy to do so. But your friend, Mr. Courtney, is much more familiar with these
                     subjects than I am. Suppose I mention your difficulty to him, and request him
                     to call tomorrow evening. Perhaps I may come with him."
               
               
                  THE FIFTH NIGHT'S STUDY.
                  WHICH CONTAINS A VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION ON A VERY IMPORTANT
                     QUESTION.
                  NEW CHARACTERS AND CURIOUS ARGUMENTS.
                  THE SACRED OR APPROPRIATED USE OF THE WORD BAPTIZE, AS
                     DISTINGUISHED FROM THE COMMON.
                  
                  FIFTH NIGHTS STUDY.
                  UNCLE Jones was Professor of Languages in the College to which we have once or
                     twice before referred. A frank, free spoken man, with a clear head and warm
                     heart, in which affection for his amiable, talented, and beautiful niece, held
                     no small space. Like most of the members of his denomination, having received
                     his so-called baptism without his own knowledge or consent, he had never, until
                     very recently, felt that he had any personal interest whatever in this
                     subject.
                  He had been informed that he was baptized while yet an infant in his mother's
                     arms, and whether it was properly or improperly done, had been no concern of
                        his. It had been the duty of his parents and their pastor to
                     attend to that, and he had never inquired whether they did it illy or well.
                  A few days since, however, his attention had been directed to the subject by a
                     somewhat singular occurrence. Mr. Courtney, the teacher, was spending a leisure
                     hour at Prof. Jones's room, at a time when no recitation claimed the attention
                     of either, and they were earnestly discussing some item of the morning's news,
                     when two of the college students looked in, and seeing a visitor, were about to
                     withdraw, but the Professor, with his characteristic kindness, called them
                     back, and inquired in what way he could serve them.
                  After a moment's hesitation, the younger, (whose name was Pearson,) replied:
                     "Oh, it is of no consequence, Professor Jones. Chum and I had a little dispute
                     which we agreed to refer to you for
                     decision, but as you are engaged we will call some other time."
                  "No, no," said the Professor, "come in and tell me now. I am quite at liberty.
                     Perhaps Mr. Courtney will assist us if there is any thing important to
                     determine upon."
                  "Oh, no," said Smith, (the other student,) "it is of no great importance. We
                     only wish to ask you what is the Greek word for to dip."
                  "It is embapto, bapto, or baptizo, young gentlemen. Why did you not refer to
                     your English and Greek Lexicon? That would have enabled you to answer the
                     question for yourselves."
                  "We did refer to that," said Pearson, "but Smith was not satisfied with the
                     Lexicon. He thought there must be some mistake. Now," he continued, "will you
                     be kind enough to tell us what was the word which, among the Greeks, commonly
                     signified to pour?"
                  "Certainly. Cheo signifies to
                        pour."
                  "Had the Greeks any word which commonly meant to sprinkle?"
                  "Yes, raino meant to sprinkle."
                  "Had they any word which meant to wet?"
                  "Certainly, brecho signified to wet. But tell
                     me, young gentlemen, what is the object of these questions? You know the
                     meaning of these Greek words as well as I do."
                  "Pardon me, Professor, but let me ask one question more. Did not the Greeks
                     have a word which signified to wash?"
                  "Yes, they had several. Louo was used to
                     signify a general washing, as by bathing, and nipto a partial one, as of the hands alone. The Greek language
                     was perhaps even more copious in words of this sort than the English. I had a
                     word to express almost every manner of using water."
                  "Excuse me, Professor Jones, but I want to ask one question more. Will you
                     please to tell as whether bapto and baptizo are not as properly, and as commonly
                     rendered by dip as cheo is by
                        pour, or raino by
                        sprinkle, or louo by
                        wash?"
                  "Certainly they are, except when bapto has
                     its secondary meaning, to dye, to color, to stain. But now, young gentlemen,
                     you must permit me to turn questioner. I desire to know for what purpose you
                     come with such a string of questions to me?"
                  "We hope you will not be offended, sir; but Smith and I," said Pearson, "went
                     last Sabbath afternoon to witness the immersion; and have since had a little
                     discussion on the meaning of the word baptize and its cognates, as used in the
                     Scriptures in reference to the ordinance.
                  "We found the words in the Lexicon just as we would any other words, and by
                     this means were, as I thought, obliged to translate them by dipping or
                     immersion.
                  "But Smith contended that there must be some error in this, and that baptismos must signify a sprinkling or a pouring,
                     as well as a dipping; and since we could find no authority for this in the
                     Grammars or Lexicons of the language, he insisted on coming to you about
                     it."
                  "Certainly, sir, there must be some mistake about these words in the Lexicons,
                     for my father was a Presbyterian minister, and I know he was a good Greek
                     scholar, and yet he not only baptized by sprinkling, but insisted that there
                     was no such thing as immersion ever spoken of for baptism. The President of
                     this College and all the Faculty are Presbyterians, and they all approve of
                     sprinkling as baptism—which they certainly could not do if the
                     very word baptism in the Greek signifies immersion. I cannot understand it,
                     sir, if Jesus Christ meant to say sprinkle, why did he not use the word
                        raino? If he meant to say pour, why did
                        he not use the word cheo or ecchco?
                     If he meant to say wet, (that is, to apply water in any form) why did he not
                     use the word brecho? As it seems to be
                     certain from the practice of the best and most learned clergymen of the world,
                     that he did not and could not have meant dip or immerse, why did he use a word
                     which commonly, if not always, meant to immerse? And which, as a matter of
                     course, every one who read or spoke the Greek would understand to mean immerse?
                     I wish, Professor Jones, you would be kind enough to explain this to us, sir,
                     for Pearson has annoyed me about it till I have almost lost my patience."
                  The Professor himself was somewhat annoyed by these questions, and the more so
                     because they had been asked in the presence of Mr. Courtney, whom he knew to be
                     Baptist, and a thorough classical scholar. He was, however, too prudent to
                     permit the students to discover his embarrassment, and only replied, "We often
                     find it much easier to ask questions, young gentlemen, than it is to answer
                     them—but in the present case, you have only to recollect that words often
                     undergo a change of meaning in the lapse of time, or by transfer to other
                     places, and your difficulties will all vanish We may grant that dipping or
                     immersion is the idea which was originally connected with these words—and so it
                     is still in the classic Greek; hence this is what you find in the Lexicons of
                     the language; but the Greek of the New Testament was not the pure classic
                     Greek, but a sort of Jew Greek, if I may so speak, which had come into use in
                     Palestine, and may have been different from the language as originally spoken
                     and written; and as the writers of the New Testament were treating of a
                        new system of religion, they would be very likely to use words
                     in a new sense. And though it cannot be denied that the idea of submersion is
                     almost always in these words as they occur in the classical writers, yet it
                     does not of necessity follow that it must be in them as constantly as when they
                     are used by the Evangelists."
                  "Thank you, sir," said Smith. "That is very satisfactory." And the young men
                     took their leave."
                  When they were gone, Professor Jones observing the peculiar expression of Mr.
                     Courtney's countenance, was led to continue the subject. "You did not seem,"
                     said he, "to be as well satisfied as the boys were with my explanation."
                  "If you will pardon me for saying so, Professor, I do not see how you could be
                     satisfied with it yourself."
                  "And why not, pray?"
                  "Because you have too much good sense to take it for granted that a thing is
                     true only because it possibly may be true. You intimated, if you did not
                     plainly assert to the young men, that these words, bapto, baptizo, and their co-relatives, signify to sprinkle and
                     pour in the Greek New Testament, though you can't deny that they never have
                     those meanings in any other Greek book, and that the sole and entire authority
                     for this assertion is the fact that some other words have changed their
                     meaning, and therefore it was possible that these might have done so also. I
                     grant that they might have changed, but there is not even the shadow of any
                     evidence to show that they have really done so. Some men have applied to the
                     Legislature and had their names changed; and so you and I might have done, but
                     this is certainly no proof that our names have been changed. If you build an
                     argument, or base an explanation on this change, it is not enough to suppose it
                     to be possible that such a change might occur; you must prove it
                     to be certain that such a change did occur."
                  "But you will grant," replied Professor Jones, "that it was at least possible
                     that as Christ was introducing a new order of things in religion, new words, or
                     rather old words with new meanings,
                     should be employed in describing this new ordinance."
                  "So far from granting that it was probable, I will prove that it was morally
                     impossible—though if it had been even probable, it would not justify your
                     conclusions.
                  "What would you think of the common sense of that member of Congress who should
                     treat the Constitution of the United States in the same way that you treat the
                     Constitution of the Christian church, and earnestly and soberly declare that
                     such words as war and peace, taxes and treaties, are not to be understood among
                     us in their common and ordinary acceptation, as they are used by other writers,
                     and as we find them defined in the dictionaries—but that war means want, peace
                     means plenty, taxes means tables, and treaties means troubles—you would expect
                     his colleagues to call him a fool. Nor would you think more highly of his
                     wisdom, if he should reply, and defend himself by saying, that it is true these
                     were common English words, the meaning of which had been fixed and known for
                     many ages; yet America was a new country, and the Constitution was designed to
                     usher in a new order of things, and nothing was more natural than that its
                     framers should use words in some new and unnatural sense!! And yet this is
                     precisely the manner of reasoning adopted by grave and reverend DOCTORS OF
                     DIVINITY, when they attempt to expound the Constitution which Christ gave his
                     church. There is not a single word in the whole Greek language, the meaning of
                     which is more definitely fixed and more perfectly known than that of baptizo, and those derived from it. In any other
                     book but the New Testament, no scholar ever hesitates about its signification.
                     When Homer speaks of a smith baptizing a hatchet or huge pole axe in cold water
                     to harden it, we have no difficulty in knowing what he means. We see the smith
                     harden steel in the same manner now by plunging it in the water.
                  "When Herodotus says of the Egyptians, that if they touched a swine, they went
                     into the river, and baptized themselves with their clothes on, no scholar
                     doubts they plunged into the water.
                  "When Diodorus Siculus says of a ship that it was baptized in the sea, no
                     scholar doubts that he means to say the ship was sunk—merged in the sea.
                  "When Plutarch says of the Roman general that he baptized his hand in blood, no
                     one doubts that he dipped his hand in the blood. And yet you know that in
                     these, and many similar places, the very same word is used which is employed in
                     the New Testament to denote the ordinance. You may take the whole range of
                     Greek literature, up to the very time when the Gospels were written, and you
                     cannot find one solitary instance in which these words are used to signify
                     either sprinkling or pouring, nor any one in which they have not in them the
                     idea of an immersion—literal or figurative."
                  "Yes, Mr. Courtney, but that was classic Greek. The Hebraistic Greek, spoken
                     and written among the Jews, might have been different."
                  "So it might, Professor Jones, but as regards this word, it was not different,
                     nevertheless. If there was any such thing as Jew Greek, you would find it in
                     the translation of their own Scripture, made by seventy learned men of their
                     own nation, and hence called by them the Septuagint. With this translation the
                     Jews, in our Saviour's time, were more familiar than with the original Hebrew.
                     It was this that Jesus quoted in his discourses. It was this that Matthew, and
                     the other writers of the New Testament, refer to, and quote as the Law and the
                     Prophets. This was the Greek which the Jews understood better than any other.
                     If there was, therefore, any such
                     thing as Hebraistic or Jew Greek, it was in this book. Now, sir, you know very
                     well that the idea of dipping, expressed by the Hebrew word
                        'tabal' is in this Jew Greek uniformly
                     rendered by 'bapto' or 'baptizo'—and these words are never used in any
                     other than their common classical signification.
                  "And further still, Josephus, who was a Jew, lived among the Jews, and wrote
                     the history of the Jews, lived and wrote just about the same time that the
                     authors of the New Testament did, and if they wrote in the 'Jew Greek,' he did
                     so also. He wrote for the same people, at the same time, and in the same
                     language, and uses the same word again and again, but no one ever suspected
                     that he meant sprinkling or pouring, or that be used it in any
                     other than its common, classical sense. He invariably uses the words to signify
                     sinking, submerging, or dipping. And besides all this, you will please to
                     remember that the greater part of the New Testament was written, not for the
                     Jews, but for the Greeks, to read, and, consequently, if the
                     writers did not use Greek words, in their ordinary Greek sense, they would not
                     be understood—but would, in fact, convey an absolute falsehood. Mark was
                     written at Rheme, for the Italians and strangers who read the Greek language
                     there. Luke addressed his Gospel and the Acts to an individual in the Greek
                     nation, for Theophilus is a Greek name. John was written in the very territory
                     of Greece itself. It is evident, therefore, that even if there had been a
                     peculiar Jewish use of the word, the writers of the Gospels could
                     not have employed it unless they had explained, at the same time, that they did
                     not use it in its common signification. If I say that I was immersed in the
                     Cumberland river, people who understand English will think I was plunged
                     beneath the surface of the water—or else that I state what was not true;
                     because this is the common every day meaning of the word immerse in the
                     language to which it belongs. So when these writers say Christ was baptized in
                     the river Jordan, everybody that read Greek would understand that he was
                     submerged in the river, for this was the common every day meaning of the word
                     baptize in the language to which it belonged."
                  "I must acknowledge, Mr. Courtney," said the Professor, "there is a great deal
                     of force in what you say; and I really do not, at this moment, see how I can
                     set aside your reasoning. I had no idea that so strong an argument could
                     possibly be made in behalf of immersion. But is it not true, sir, that there
                     are many places in the New Testament where the word cannot
                        possibly mean immersion—or where it is at least much more
                        probable that it means something else?"
                  "I have no doubt, Professor, that there are a number of places where it would
                     seem much more probable to you that it has some other meaning, if
                     it were not that the usage of the language has fixed its meaning to be
                     immersion. It might seem probable to us that Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a
                     war-horse, but the meaning of the words employed in describing his entry
                     compels us to believe that he rode on an ass's colt. So, also, it might seem
                     probable that the Pharisees only sprinkled the couches on which
                     they reclined at their meals, but the word employed shows that
                     they really immersed them, however improbable it might seem to one who was not
                     aware of the extreme care which the superstitious Pharisees employed, lest some
                     part of their furniture should escape the contact of the water, and so remain
                     in its impurity.
                  "So, also, when he says that 'The Pharisees and all the Jews eat not when they
                     come from market, except they first wash (immerse) themselves.' It
                     might seem more probable that they only sprinkled themselves, or
                     crossed their foreheads heads with
                     holy water, or poured some drops upon the top of their heads: but the words
                     employed declare expressly that they 'immersed.' I will not refuse
                     to believe God's Word, because he tells me of a circumstance that seems to me
                        improbable. The Scriptures are full of improbable things, but I
                     surely will not dare to change the meaning of the words used to relate them, in
                     order to get rid of the improbability.
                  "This would be worse than infidelity itself. I believe just what God says,
                     whether it were probable or improbable.
                  "But now if you tell me that these things were impossible, that is
                     quite a different matter. If any persons or things are said to be baptized,
                     that could not possibly have been immersed, then I must grant that
                     the Scripture either asserts what is not true, or that it uses words in a new
                     and unusual sense. Permit me to suggest to you, Professor, that it would not be
                     an unprofitable study to investigate this point. Take a Greek Concordance, and
                     turn to every passage where the word occurs; and if you find any impossibility
                     in admitting the classical and common meaning, I will be prepared to concede
                     something when we meet again."
                  "I thank you for the suggestion, Mr. Courtney. You have indeed thrown new light
                     upon this subject. I am just now somewhat bewildered by it. I will examine more
                     carefully, and tell you my conclusions."
                  It was on Monday that this conversation occurred, and Mr. Courtney was
                     returning home when he was called by Edwin into Mrs. Ernest's, to assist the
                     investigations of Theodosia and Mr. Percy. It was now near night on Thursday,
                     and he had yet heard nothing further from the Professor on the subject; but
                     just as he was leaving his school-room, a lad handed him the following
                     note:
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "DEAR COURTNEY:—I have been examining, as you suggested, into the
                                 Scripture usage of the word 'Baptizo' and its cognates. I am surprised and
                                 embarrassed by the results. Difficulties in the way of sprinkling
                                 increase at every step; yet there are also some difficulties in the
                                 way of immersion. Perhaps you can easily obviate them. I had last
                                 evening a very interesting conversation with my niece on this
                                 subject. She feels that she has been greatly assisted by your
                                 advice and suggestions. There is still, however, one point on which
                                 her mind remains in doubt. It is this. If Christ commanded
                                 immersion, and immersion was practiced by the first churches, how
                                 came it to be so universally discarded, and sprinkling substituted
                                 in its place? This question, I confess, presents a mystery to me
                                 also. Will you do me the kindness to meet me at Mrs. Ernest's
                                 to-night, and come prepared to enlighten our darkness on this
                                 point?
                              
                                 "Yours truly, J. M. JONES."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  This was a subject to which the teacher had recently given considerable
                     attention, and had collected a number of authorities among Pædobaptist writers,
                     showing, not only that immersion was at first the universal practice of all the
                     churches, but also the very time and place, when and where pouring first, and
                     sprinkling afterwards, were introduced instead of it.
                  He went home, therefore, and, after supper, selected such books as he thought
                     would be most satisfactory to his enquirers, and took them with him to the
                     widow's cottage.
                  He found uncle Jones already there, who was not long in beginning the
                     discussion.
                  "I see by the pile of books you brought," said he, "that you received my note,
                     and have come prepared to remove, if possible, all our historical difficulties.
                     Before we enter upon the history of
                     the ordinance will you permit me to mention some difficulties in the way of
                     understanding the word baptism to signify immersion, wherever it occurs in the
                     New Testament?"
                  "Certainly; for though I ventured to tell you, (when we talked on this subject
                     last Monday,) that you would not find any impossibilities, I did
                     not even intimate that you would find no difficulties. But what
                     are those which have troubled you?"
                  "It will perhaps save time if we take up the passages in order. I knew that
                        Bapto and Baptizo were derived from the same root, and, in classical usage,
                     had precisely the same signification, except that Bapto, while it signifies to dip, signifies also to dye or color,
                     which Baptizo never does.*
                        And I therefore found all the places where the word occurs.
                  
                     
                     *"What," says Professor Moses Stuart, page 298,—"What are the
                        classical meanings of bapto and baptizo? Both these words
                        mean to dip, to immerse, to plunge into any thing liquid. All
                        lexicographers and critics of any note are agreed in this." And again, on
                        page 288: "The original etymological root of Baptizo, Bapto, and also of the nouns and adjectives
                        kindred with them, appears plainly to be the Greek monosyllable BAP. The
                        leading and original meaning of which seems to have been dipping,
                        immersing, plunging, soaking, drenching, in some liquid; and as closely
                        associated with this, the idea of dying or coloring, since this was done
                        by dipping." And again: "The precise difference between Bapto and Baptizo
                        is, that while they both agree in one common and original
                        meaning, that of immersion or plunging, usage has employed Bapto to
                        express the idea of coloring, as well as the idea of dipping or plunging
                        while Baptizo is not employed in the additional sense of
                        coloring'
                  
                  "I will first mention those in which there is no direct allusion to the
                     ordinance, but where the word occurs, as it often does in the Old Testament, in
                     connection with other subjects.
                  "Theodosia, get your Testament, child, and read them as I mention them,
                     according to my memorandum. The first is Luke 16: 24—
                  "'Send Lazarus that he may (baptize) dip the tip of his finger in
                     water and cool my tongue.' This seems plain enough; and so does 2d John 13: 26,
                     'It is he to whom I shall give the sop when I have (baptized) dipped it; and
                     when he had (baptized) dipped it, he gave it to Judas." Nor did I find any
                     difficulty with the 3d Revelation 19: 13, 'And he was clothed in a vesture
                     (baptized) dipped in blood.' But here in the fourth case, or Mark 7; 4, I find
                     a difficulty. 'The (baptisms) washing of cups and pots and brazen vessels and
                        tables.' Now, so far as the cups and pots and vessels are
                     concerned, the matter is made entirely plain by turning to Leviticus 11: 32,
                     'Whether it be any vessel of wood or raiment, or skin or sack, whatsoever
                     vessel it be wherein any work is done, it must be put into the
                        water, and it shall be unclean until evening, and so it shall be
                     cleansed.' From this it is evident that the cups and other vessels were
                     immersed, or 'put into the water:' but the word translated table,
                     may mean also a couch or bed, and how the beds and tables could be immersed, I
                     do not so easily understand."
                  "And yet, uncle," said the young lady, "the same Scripture that speaks of the
                     immersion or baptism of the cups, speaks also of that of the tables. Whatever
                     was done to the cups, therefore, was done to the tables too."
                  "Yes, Theo., and that is what makes me doubt if there was any immersion about
                     it. The cups could have been dipped easily enough, but to dip beds and tables
                     is quite another business."
                  "But, uncle, if 'putting into the water' was immersion, must they not have been
                     immersed?"
                  "It would seem so, Theo., but I can't understand how it could be done."
                  "The difficulty will all vanish," said Mr. Courtney, "if you will remember that
                     the little stool to hold his plate,
                     which stood at the head of each guest as he reclined upon the floor, was called
                     a table, and the mat or cloth which he lay upon, was called a couch or bed; and
                     either of these could be immersed as readily as the cups. They had no massive
                     mahogany tables, or beds containing sixty pounds of feathers, as we have. The
                     poor invalid whom Jesus healed, did not probably evince any extraordinary
                     muscular power when he took up his bed and walked away with
                     it.
                  "But we have other testimony besides that of Mark on this subject. What if I
                     show you from the writings of a learned Hebrew, that the beds and tables not
                     only could be immersed, but that their immersion was habitually practiced by
                     the superstitious Pharisees!"
                  "That will indeed remove every shadow of doubt," said the Professor, but have
                     you indeed such testimony?"
                  "Certainly we have. There was a very learned Jew who wrote a very elaborate
                     commentary on the Jewish customs and traditions. Dr. Adam Clarke, the great
                     commentator, recognizes his authority, and calls him the 'great expounder of
                     the Jewish Law;' and, as he comes thus 'properly vouched for,' I trust his
                     evidence will not be disputed. This learned and eminent Rabbi, commonly called
                     Rabbi Maimonides, says, in his commentary: 'Every vessel of wood, as a table or
                     bed, receives defilement, and these were washed by covering in
                        water, and very nice and particular they were,' he adds, 'that they
                     might be covered all over.'
                  "If the article was very large and could not be dipped all at one time, it
                     could still, according to the teaching of this great expounder, be easily
                     immersed. For, says he, 'A bed that is wholly defiled, if he dip it part by
                     part, it is pure. If he dip it in the pool of water it is clean, even though
                     its feet are plunged in the thick clay.
                  "Perhaps" continued Mr. Courtney, addressing Theodosia sia, "your uncle may
                     find it easier to believe Maimonides than Mark, and if so, the tables are
                     disposed of."
                  "The Rabbi's explanation does not indeed remove all difficulties," said uncle
                     Jones, "but now look at the first part of the verse. 'The Pharisees and all the
                     Jews except they wash their hands, eat not; and when they come from the market,
                     except they (baptize) wash, they eat not; holding the tradition of the elders.'
                     Now I can hardly think it possible that the Jews, whenever they came from
                     market, dipped themselves all over in water, as the word (baptisonti) employed here, would intimate, if
                     immersion indeed be the meaning of the word. It seems as though something else
                     would be much more natural and likely to be done."
                  "Suppose it was more likely that they should do something else," replied Mr.
                     Courtney, "can you not believe, on the authority of the Word of God, that the
                     superstitious Jews would do very unlikely, improbable, and inconvenient things?
                     It cannot be denied that it was just as possible for them to
                     immerse themselves (baptisonti) when they
                     came from market, as it was to wash their hands (nipsonti) on ordinary occasions, or before meals; but it is very
                     easy to determine what it was which they actually did, since it was that which
                     was required by the 'tradition of the elders.' — What, then, was this tradition
                     of the elders? Maimonides shall enlighten us here again. 'If the Pharisees,'
                     says he, 'touched but the garments of the common people, they were defiled all
                     over as if they had touched a profluous person, and needed
                        immersion, and were obliged to do it; and hence when they
                     walked the streets they walked on the side of the way, that they might not be
                     defiled by touching the common people. In a laver (they say) which holds forty
                     seas of water, every defiled man dips himself.'
                  "It was, therefore, we see a veritable immersion, which was required by the 'tradition of the elders,'
                     as preserved in their nation and recorded by one of their most learned Rabbis;
                     and though Doctors of Divinity find it very hard to believe the plain assertion
                     of the Spirit of God, speaking by Mark, and fancy there must be some mistake or
                     misunderstanding when he says the Pharisees immersed themselves, yet I have
                     never heard that any of them hesitated to receive the uninspired testimony of
                     the Jewish Rabbi, or proposed to give to his words new and unheard
                     of meanings to obviate the necessity of admitting that immersion was practiced
                     by the superstitious Jews."
                  "I am very much obliged to you," said the Professor, for laying the sin of my
                     unbelief at the door of the Doctors of Divinity; and, to tell the truth, they
                     are in some degree responsible for it, for I am doubtful if I should have seen
                     these difficulties so plainly had I not looked at them through the Theological
                     microscope of Dr. Miller, of Princeton, New Jersey. You have disposed of them
                     so easily and so satisfactorily, that I am almost ashamed to ask you for your
                     opinion about the divers washings in Hebrews 9 : 10. These washings, you know,
                     are in the original called Baptismois or baptisms—were they not some of the
                     many sprinklings enjoined upon the Jews by the Levitical law?"
                  "Surely, my dear sir, if they had been, Paul would have called them
                     sprinklings. He understood the use of the proper word for
                     sprinkle, for he uses it in this same connection where he speaks
                     of 'the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean.' The baptisms
                     were evidently something else, and another and altogether different word is
                     employed to designate them—one word refers to the sprinklings
                     required by the law, the other to the immersions which it
                     commanded."
                  "But, Mr. Courtney, I have in some way received the impression that the law
                     nowhere commands any immersions. It commands sprinklings and
                     ablutions, washings and purifications, but never in any case immersions—so the
                     allusion must be to some other cleansings than to immersions."
                  "Permit me to say, Professor, that you could not have received that impression
                     from a careful study of the law itself—you are probably indebted for it to a
                     Doctor of Divinity. Take your Bible, and turn to the law, and you will read of
                     immersions or dippings in blood—dippings in blood and running
                     water—dippings in oil—dippings in the water of purification—and in the practice
                     of the Jews, many, if not most of the washings mentioned in the
                     law, were performed by immersion, though this was not specifically
                     required by the command. The ten lavers that Solomon made, were for washing the
                     sacrifices, and these were washed by dipping them in the water.
                     The great Sea which he made, was for the priests to bathe in, 2d
                     Chron. 4: 6. And this washing was an immersion. On how many occasions do you
                     read in the 15th of Leviticus, that one 'must wash his clothes, and
                        bathe himself in water?' Are clothes washed without
                        immersion? The vessels of wood, skin, &c., were required to
                        'be put into the water'—was not this an immersion? And if you
                     doubt that the washing or bathing of their persons was immersion, we will learn
                     from Maimonides what it was that they actually did in obedience to this
                     law:
                  "'In their law,' says this learned Rabbi, 'whenever washing of the body or the
                     clothes is mentioned, it means nothing else than the washing the
                        whole body; for if any wash himself all over except the very
                     tip of his little finger, he is still in his uncleanness.'
                  "That this was what the Jews understood by washing, is further evident from the
                     case of Naaman. The prophet told him to go and wash seven times in
                     Jordan; and it was regarded garded
                     as strict and literal obedience when he went and 'dipped himself
                     seven times.'"
                  "I see, Mr. Courtney, that it is just as easy to find the 'divers immersions'
                     as the 'sprinklings,' and I do not see why I should have been so easily imposed
                     upon. I find I must be careful how I receive the assertions even of our Doctors
                     of Divinity."
                  "Yes, uncle," said Theodosia, "I have determined that I will find every thing
                     in the Bible for myself. It is the only way in which I
                        can be certain it is there."
                  "We have now," said Mr. Courtney, "examined every text in the New Testament
                     where the word is translated, and not merely transferred in our version. In
                     several of these places we find it is rendered 'dip,' as it is in the fourteen
                     places mentioned by Dr. Barnes, where it occurs in the Old Testament. In all
                     the other places it is rendered wash, and we have ascertained, in
                     every case, that the washing was by 'dipping.'"
                  "But, Mr. Courtney, did you not ascertain this from Rabbi Maimonides, and not
                     from the Scriptures themselves? I want my faith to stand alone upon the Word of
                     God."
                  "No, Miss Ernest, we learned it from the word of God itself. I quoted the
                     Jewish Rabbi to satisfy your uncle—because (if he will pardon me for saying
                     so,) he seemed to feel that some human testimony was needful to sustain the (to
                     him) strange assertion of the Word of God, that the superstitious Pharisees
                     immersed their tables or couches, and themselves, but we had abundant proof
                     without the Rabbi's testimony."
                  "What was it, Mr. Courtney?—please call it to my mind again. The Bible argument
                     is all that I care to remember."
                  "You are right, Miss Ernest—it is all you need to remember—you
                     know we have on former occasions determined the meaning of the word baptism, by
                     a variety of methods We found it to be immersion or dipping. Now, your uncle
                     admitted this, so far as regards all other books but the New
                        Testament. Here he conceived it might have a new
                     signification. I conceded that it might, but denied that it did, for the fact
                     that a thing may possibly, or even probably, be true, is no
                        evidence that it is true. Then, to show that it must
                     have a new meaning, he referred to three places where, in our version, it is
                     rendered 'washing.' In Mark 7: 4, he said it seemed unreasonable to think that
                     the Pharisees immersed their tables and beds, (for the word 'klinon,' rendered tables, may mean
                     couches as well;) and therefore he thought he ought to give the word some other
                     meaning."
                  "To this I might have merely replied, the word of God says the 'kleina' were
                     immersed, and therefore it was done. I will not take the liberty to
                        change God's word because it states improbabilities. But we
                     were very accommodating, and reminded him that whatever was done to the tables,
                     or 'kleina,' was the same thing that was done to the 'cups' and
                     other vessels, and then turned to Leviticus and showed that they
                     were 'put into the water,' and of course the 'kleina' were 'put into the water'
                     also. This, I am sure, was proof enough, without going to the Rabbi, to see
                        how it was done; and this was all Scripture proof. We went to
                     the Rabbi only to 'make assurance doubly sure.' Then your uncle thought it more
                     reasonable to believe that the Pharisees did something else instead of
                        dipping themselves (as Mark says) when they came from the
                     market."
                  "I might have answered as before—God says they dipped, and I will
                     not dare to doubt it, though it be improbable."
                  "But as the text says, they did it 'holding the tradition of the elders.' I
                     referred to the Jewish Rabbi merely to learn what the 'tradition of the elders' required on this point, and we
                     found it was just what the word expressed."
                  "In the third place, your uncle had conceived that the baptismois or washings spoken of in Hebrews 9: 10, could not be
                     immersions, because some Doctor of Divinity had told him there were no
                     immersions; and we went back to the Old Testament and found immersions in
                     abundance—even without those rites which are called 'washings,' but even these
                     were immersions also, as I proved by the case of Naaman, and referred to the
                     Rabbi as confirmatory evidence."
                  "Very satisfactory, I declare," said the Professor, laughing. "You see, Theo.,
                     Mr. Courtney fully appreciates the difficulties in the way of convincing your
                     uncle.
                  "But let us see what he has to say about these other places which I have
                     marked, and in which the word is used without translation, and refers directly
                     to the ordinance itself. The first is Matthew 3: 5, 6, which reads the baptism
                     of the multitudes by John."
                  "In regard to that," said Mr. Courtney, "it will not be worth while to consume
                     our time to-night—I will refer you to Miss Theodosia, who has examined it
                     already. I will only say, that if you prefer 'washing' as your
                     translation of the word, there could be no quicker way for John to
                        wash them than by dipping them in the water."
                  "The next place I have marked," said uncle Jones, "is the 11th verse of the
                     same chapter, 'I indeed baptize you with water, but He that cometh after me
                     shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.'"
                  "I trust you find no difficulty there," said Mr. Courtney.
                  "No," replied the Professor, "except that it presents a strong argument in
                     favor of immersion. The original certainly reads, (if we translate as we would
                     in any other book) I immerse you in water, and He shall immerse you in the Holy
                     Ghost and in fire.
                  "The next is the 16th verse of the same chapter: 'And Jesus when he was
                     baptized went up straightway out of the water.' I find a strong argument for
                     immersion in this also; for if they did not immerse, I see no reason for going
                     into the water—or if we read that he went up from, instead of out
                     of, the water, I still see no reason for even going to it. We do not go to the
                     river to sprinkle now—I can't think they did then.
                  "The next place I have marked refers to the 'much water' of Ænon near Salim;
                     and I think no one can deny that John selected that place for the convenience
                     of baptizing; and so far as it has any bearing on the case at all, it favors
                     immersion. No other place presents any difficulty not already obviated, till we
                     come to the baptism of the three thousand. Here seemed to be some doubtful
                     circumstances, till I talked the subject over with my niece last night, but all
                     is now quite plain; but there are some other instances recorded in the Acts,
                     where immersion does not seem to have been so probable as sprinkling or
                     pouring."
                  "Please don't speak any more about probabilities, Professor
                     Jones," exclaimed Mr. Courtney. "You admit that 'baptize,' the
                     word used to describe this ordinance, means to immerse, as its common primary
                     signification in every other book but this, and that the people who read the
                     Greek language, would understand this to be its meaning in this, unless
                        some intimation was given, that it must not be so
                     understood, or unless this meaning was morally impossible. And now you say it
                     seems more probable that sprinkling sometimes occurred. Suppose it were more
                     probable, does not Luke, by using this word baptize, declare that
                     it was not sprinkling or pouring, but clearly and plainly a dipping? Will you dare to give the word a
                     meaning that it never had before, and has not now in any Greek book in the
                     world, merely because you think it more probable that something else was done,
                     instead of what Luke says was done? Show me a case where immersion was
                     impossible, and it will have some weight."
                  "No, no, Mr. Courtney, the New Testament meaning of the word is the very point
                     in dispute. I shall not allow you to beg the question on the very position
                     about which we are at issue."
                  "I did not intend, nor do I desire, to do any such thing. It is no begging of
                     the question to object to your mode of settling it. This word was used hundreds
                     of years before Luke wrote this book. Its meaning was as well fixed and defined
                     as that of any word in the Greek language. Luke was writing to those who read,
                     and spoke, and understood this language (and this word among the rest) in its
                     ordinary sense, according to the familiar every-day usage of the people who
                     employed it.
                  "We agree, and no critic or scholar of any note has ever denied that the common
                     familiar meaning of this word was to immerse, submerge, to dip. This we have
                     proved. But now we want to know in what sense Luke employs it. I answer, that
                     the presumption is, that he employs it just as every other writer does; for if
                     he does not, nobody will understand what he means. He must use words in the
                     sense that other people use them, or other people will not know what he
                     means—but as he wishes to be understood, and writes under the inspiration of
                     infinite wisdom, he will use words thus. If this word, therefore, commonly and
                     familiarly meant to immerse, then it was immersion that he meant when he used
                     the word. To this you reply that in some cases it seems more
                        probable that something else was done, and not the act which this
                     word describes, and you will therefore make it mean just what you think is
                        most likely to have taken place. I object to this mode of
                     deciding the meaning of a New Testament word. If we decide according to this
                     rule, I can show you that Lazarus was never raised from the dead; for it is to
                     me much more likely that he was only asleep, or in a sort of
                        trance—and when Jesus called him with a loud voice, it only
                     awakened him. You tell me, however, that the Scripture plainly declares again
                     and again, that he was dead, and that Christ raised
                     him from the dead. But I have only to assure you that, though the
                     word rendered dead does mean dead, destitute of life—in every other book, and
                     in almost every other place in this book—yet, in this particular place it is
                     much more probable that it means asleep, or in a trance; and,
                     therefore, dead cannot mean destitute of life. If I am at liberty to trifle in
                     this way with any words of the Sacred Record, it ceases to mean any thing but
                     what I, or you, or any other man, may fancy it ought to mean. Every man may
                     make it mean just what he pleases. But pardon me for talking so long—I did not
                     intend it when I began. Go on with your references, and I will show you that
                     there is not even a probability that it was any thing else but
                     immersion that was performed in any single case."
                  "I was," said uncle Jones, "just about to mention the case of Paul, who was
                     baptized 'standing up,' and, of course, it could not be by immersion, Acts 9:
                     'And Ananias went his way and entered into the house, and putting his hand upon
                     him, said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, who appeared unto thee in the
                     way as thou camest, hath sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be
                     filled with the Holy Ghost. And immediately there fell from his eyes, as it had
                     been scales, and he received sight forthwith, and arose and was
                        baptized.' Now the Greek word anastos' here rendered
                        arose, might very properly be rendered standing up and if so,
                     he must have been baptized standing."
                  "That if so, Professor, is a very convenient phrase. Let us see
                     how it will work in other places. We read in the Old Testament that 'David
                     "arose" and fled for fear of Saul.'—The same word occurs here. It may mean
                     'standing up,' and, if so, then David fled standing.
                     So, also, in this passage, 'Saul rose up out of the cave and
                     went.' It may mean 'standing;' and, if so, then Saul
                     went standing out of the cave. And in this, 'Saul
                        arose and got him from Gilgal.' It may mean 'standing'—and,
                        if so, then Saul went up from Gilgal 'standing.'"
                  "Yes," said Theodosia, "and when Ananias and Saphira died that fearful death,
                     the young men were standing still all the while they were winding
                     up the body, carrying him away, and burying him—for it reads, 'The young men
                     "arose," wound him up, carried him out, and buried him.' (Acts 5 : 6.) Is it
                     not this same word that is used in the original?"
                  "The very same, Miss Ernest—and so it is where the Prodigal Son says I will
                     arise and go to my father—yet he does not mean to say that he will go 'standing
                     up.' If you will be kind enough to get Barnes' Notes, you will find a very true
                     and apposite explanation of this word. 'He arose and went to his
                     father.' 'The word arose,' says Barnes, 'does not imply that he
                     had been sitting. It does not refer to any change of position, but
                     expresses the act of setting out, or beginning to do
                     any thing. It was a common expression among the Hebrews to denote
                        entering upon a piece of business.' Now, if Luke had said, He
                        sat still and was baptized, it might have made some
                     difficulty—but if he rose up, or prepared himself, he would do this equally,
                     whether he was sprinkled or immersed. Immersion is quite as probable bable, so
                     far as this word is concerned, as sprinkling, or any thing else."
                  "I must acknowledge that you are right," said uncle Jones, "and you have
                     convinced me so often that I am almost ashamed to mention another difficulty
                     which has been suggested—and that is, that there is nothing said about a change
                     of garment, or of their going out of the house; and then Saul was so feeble
                     that it would seem almost cruel to make him walk half a mile to the river,
                     before he even partook of any food. I judge, therefore, that the rite must have
                     been performed in the house; and if so, it could not be
                     immersion."
                  "There is your 'if so' again. But suppose it was done in the
                     house, are you sure that there was not a bathing-tub, or a tank, or some other
                     means of immersion in the house? There is surely no evidence that there was
                     not. How do you know that it was half a mile to the river? How do you know that
                     there was not a fountain in the yard? Most rich men's houses in the East are
                     provided with them. You simply read that he 'was baptized,' and every Greek
                     reader would understand this to mean that he was immersed. If you should come
                     down next Sunday to the Baptist Church, and apply for membership, and be
                     received and baptized—I would, as clerk of the church, record the facts—I would
                     write that you came, made credible profession of faith in Christ, gave
                     satisfactory evidence of genuine conversion, was received and
                        baptized. I need not record that you put on suitable
                     clothing—that you went to the river, or to the pool, or to the baptizing.
                     Everybody would know that you were immersed, if I simply said you were
                     'baptized.'"
                  "Well, well, I see I have been making 'mountains out of mole hills,' but really
                     the Doctors of Divinity, as you so kindly suggested awhile ago, have much of
                     the blame to bear, I am almost
                     ashamed to go on with my catalogue of difficulties, lest I provoke both you and
                     Theodosia to laugh at me for my simplicity."
                  "Far from it, my dear sir. It is not long since I stood just where you are
                     standing now. I know from sad experience with how much difficulty the light of
                     truth makes its way through the mists and fogs by which one's early education
                     has surrounded him; and how slowly it dispels the clouds and darkness of
                     long-established prejudices. It is rare indeed to find any one educated as you
                     were, and accustomed as you have been from childhood, to think that whoever
                     might be wrong, the Presbyterians must be right, yet exhibiting
                     the candor to acknowledge error, and the conscience to repudiate it so soon as
                     it shall be clearly seen. I hope you will not refrain from expressing even the
                     shadow of a doubt, if it keeps your mind from seeing clearly the way of
                     Christian duty as required in God's Word. What was the next case on your
                     memorandum?"
                  "It was that of Cornelius and his friends. Peter says, who shall 'forbid
                     water?' And it seemed to me more natural for him to use this expression, if the
                     water was to be brought to sprinkle them, than if they were to be
                     taken to the water to be dipped in it."
                  "But," replied Mr. Courtney, "Peter does not say the water was to be
                        brought. He only says, who will forbid water, (that is to be used in
                     the baptizing of these people.) It was simply equivalent to saying, who will
                     forbid their baptism? But the water might have been brought to
                        immerse them. What would hinder it? I was present once when a
                     Baptist minister said to the sexton of the church, 'Let water be brought for
                     the baptism of six persons this evening,'—would you deny that those six persons
                     were to be immersed? In recording the event, I might have said,
                     the water was brought, and they were baptized—for they were actually immersed
                     in a tank prepared for the purpose under the floor of the church. Now, if one
                     of the deacons had exclaimed, I forbid the water to be brought for the baptism
                     of these candidates, you must (had you been present and reasoned as you do upon
                     this passage,) have concluded that it was sprinkling, and not immersion at all,
                     which was spoken of."
                  "I am satisfied, Mr. Courtney, and do not see anything in my next case, (which
                     was that of Lydia and her household,) that has not already been disposed of. I
                     was going to object that there was nothing said about change of apparel and
                     going to or coming from the water,—but I acknowledge that when I read in a
                     Baptist paper that forty converts were baptized one Sabbath morning, I do not
                     doubt they were immersed, and yet I never see a word said about the clothing
                     they wore, and often nothing about the place where the rite was performed. So I
                     will pass to the Jailor's baptism, Acts 16: 33. The only difficulty here is,
                     that as he was baptized in the jail, it is very improbable that it
                     was by immersion, since it is not likely there was any convenience for an
                     immersion in an Eastern prison."
                  "Suppose, Professor Jones, that you should read in a newspaper that 'The poor
                     wretch who was last week sentenced to death for the murder of old Mr. Gripall,
                     had made a profession of religion, and had been baptized by Elder J. R. Graves,
                     the editor of the Tennessee Baptist,' would you imagine that Mr. Graves had
                        sprinkled him? Not for one moment; you could easily believe
                     that the water was brought, and the immersion was done in the murderer's cell,
                     even though not a word was said about the bringing it. As the jailor was master
                     of the prison, could he not have water brought, had it been needful?
                  "But the truth is, the baptism was not done in the jail. Read the passage carefully. He sprang into the
                     prison, and he brought the Apostles out of it, (30th verse). Some say he only
                     brought them out of the inner prison. I say he
                     brought them out of that, and into his own house, for (32d verse) they spoke
                     the word of the Lord to all that were in his house. He took them into his
                     family apartments, and there they preached the Word.
                  "And then (verse 33d) he took them somewhere else, where he washed their
                     stripes and was himself baptized; and then (34th verse) he brought them back
                     into his house, and set meat before them. You see, therefore, that it was not
                     done in the prison, though if it had been, it would have been no proof that it
                     was not immersion."
                  "I wonder," said Mr. Jones, "that I had never seen the case in this light
                     before. Now, since I have observed it carefully, it is all very plain; and I
                     have found no other instance where the word occurs in its literal
                     sense, and which presents any difficulties which have not been already
                     considered.
                  "There is, indeed, the case of the Eunuch, who was baptized by Philip, but the
                     narrative, in all the details of it, absolutely requires immersion to preserve
                     the consistency and probability of the story. They went down into the water,
                     and not the one, but both of them went into the water. Then Philip immersed
                     him, and then they came up out of the water. I wonder that any Greek scholar
                     should ever have doubted that they went into and came out of the water; for, if
                     this is not what is said, it is because the Greek language could not express
                     it. In any other book, no scholar would hesitate a moment thus to translate the
                     passage. What is here said to be done, I must concede is precisely what
                     Baptists are accustomed to do. And, but for one thing, I am convinced that
                        immersion is the only baptism."
                  'And what is that, pray?"
                  'Simply that I find baptism spoken of figuratively or
                        metaphorically in such a way as to lead me to suspect it must
                     be something else. Indeed, in Acts 2: 17, it is almost expressly said to be a
                     pouring."
                  "No, Professor, baptism is not here said to be pouring, nor is
                     pouring said to be baptism, though Doctors of Divinity have ventured such
                     assertions.
                  "Christ did tell the disciples that they would be immersed in the
                     Holy Ghost—and Peter did speak of the Holy Spirit as being poured out—but
                     neither of them said that this pouring was the immersion. It might as well have
                     been any after of the wonderful things that happened that
                     day, which could in any respect be compared to an
                     immersion.
                  "But before we go further, let me say one word as to the value of figurative
                     usage in determining the meaning of this or any other word.
                  "Common sense teaches us that the figurative and fanciful must yield to the
                     real and actual. When, therefore, we have settled the meaning of a word by its
                     real, literal, everyday usage, we cannot unsettle it by a figure of speech—a
                     chance allusion, or comparison. The fanciful must be governed by the actual.
                     This is self-evident. Now, we have seen and settled that the literal meaning of
                     this word is to immerse. And henceforth whenever and wherever we
                     find it figuratively employed, the allusion must be in some way or
                     other to immersion or some circumstance attending immersion. On this alone will
                     its beauty and appropriateness as a figure depend.
                  "Now, remembering this, let us examine the case in hand. The allusion cannot be
                     to 'the pouring, which itself is but a figure—for no literal and actual pouring
                     of the third person of the Trinity could occur. The allusion was
                     not to the manner of the Spirit's
                     coming, but to the copiousness abundance, and overwhelming nature of his
                     influences; filling, overflowing, surrounding, and, as it were, swallowing up
                     their souls. The Greeks often used the word baptized in this way; as baptized
                     in debt, baptized in affliction, baptized in wine, (that is, overcome of wine,)
                     baptized in iniquity, or as we would express it, sunk in iniquity.
                     We use the word immerse in the same way, when we say of one that he is immersed
                     in dissipation; immersed in business: immersed in politics, and the like; we
                     simply mean by such expressions that the dissipation, business, or politics,
                     controls and occupies all the powers and capacities of the man. We do not mean
                     to say that they were poured on him, or sprinkled on
                     him, but only that they exert an overwhelming influence over him. And just in
                     this sense He told the disciples they should be immersed in the Holy Ghost"
                  "I thank you, Mr. Courtney, for that lucid exposition. I can hardly understand
                     how the matter came to be so mystified in my mind as it has been till now. I
                     will not trouble you with but one other case, and that is where the Israelites
                     are said (1 Cor. 10: 2) to have been 'all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and
                     in the sea.' If this was an immersion, you must admit that it was a very dry
                     one, for the Scripture says expressly they went through on dry ground."
                  "Certainly, I will admit that it was a dry immersion, for it was a
                        figurative, and not a real one. The baptism of the Holy Spirit,
                     which we were just speaking of, was a dry immersion. The baptism in sufferings,
                     which Jesus spoke of so touchingly to James and John, was a dry immersion. The
                     figure in either case was not in the wetting, but in the overwhelming abundance
                     of the Spirit in one, and of sorrow in the other. The allusion in this case is
                     not so much to the act, as to one of the attendant
                     circumstances. They did indeed go down into the sea, as one goes down into the
                     water to be baptized. The water stood on each side of them and the cloud
                     covered them—so that they might very appropriately and beautifully be said, in
                     a figure, to be immersed in the cloud and the sea. But the chief
                     allusion is to another and altogether different circumstance. As the Christian
                     by going down into the baptismal water professes his belief in Christ, and
                     takes upon himself a solemn obligation of obedience to the laws of Christ. So
                     the Jews, Paul says, by going down into the sea, and walking beneath the cloud,
                     professed their faith in Moses, and took upon them obligations of obedience to
                     him. They were thus 'baptized into Moses.' The main allusion is not to the act,
                     but to the obligation of the ordinance. Would the figure be any more beautiful,
                     or any more appropriate, if we should say that they were all sprinkled into
                     Moses, or were all poured into Moses?
                  "Professor Stuart, on this passage, says: 'The suggestion has sometimes been
                     made that the Israelites were sprinkled by the cloud and by the
                     sea, and that this was the baptism which Paul meant, but the cloud
                     was not a rain cloud, nor do we find any intimation that the
                     waters of the Red Sea sprinkled the children of Israel at that time.'"
                  "It seems to me," said Theodosia, "that the idea of rain is absolutely
                     precluded—for if it had rained upon them to any extent, the ground would have
                     been wet, but it says expressly they went through on dry
                        ground."
                  "That would seem to set the matter at rest, Theo., if it were not that the
                     Psalmist, evidently speaking of this very occasion, (Psa. 77: 17, 18,) says
                     expressly 'The clouds poured out water, the skies sent out a sound, thine
                     arrows also went abroad; the voice of thy thunder was in the heaven ven, the lightnings lightened the
                     world, the earth trembled and shook.'"
                  "But the Psalmist does not say, uncle, that these terrible manifestations of
                     Almighty power were directed against the Jews—they went over dry
                     shod. To them all was light and peace. But the cloud went and
                     stood behind them, and troubled their enemies, the Egyptians. The
                     thunder, and the lightning, and the great storm of rain were upon
                        them, while the Israelites were passing on dry ground."
                  "Well, Theodosia, I give it up. I have no longer any ground to stand upon; and
                     I may as well admit at once, that immersion is the only act which is
                        anywhere in the Bible called a Baptism. I have, I think, now examined
                     every place that could throw any light upon the subject; and really I can't
                     find even a probability of any other meaning of the word in any
                     case, while in many this meaning is established by most overwhelming
                     proof."
                  "No, Professor, there is one place you seem to have overlooked, which is
                     exceedingly significant; that is Romans 6th chapter, where we are said to be
                        buried with Christ in our baptism. Here the allusion is most
                     evidently not to any attending circumstance, but to the act itself. We are
                     buried in the water like one who is dead and raised out of it again like one
                     resurrected. So, we are to consider ourselves as having died to sin, and as
                     having been brought to life again by Christ; but not to the same life of sin
                     which we led before, but to 'newness of life'—or a new life—a life
                     of holiness and obedience. That the allusion here is to the act of immersion is
                     so evident that none but the most determined and unreasonable cavilers pretend
                     to deny it. I do not know of any single commentator, whose opinions are
                     entitled to any respect, who has ventured to differ in regard to this point
                     from Luther and Calvin, and Doddridge and McKnight, and Chalmers—who all agree
                     that the allusion is to the ancient form of baptism by immersion, or, as
                     McKnight expresses it, to the ordinance in which Christ submitted to be
                     baptized—that is, to be buried under the water, and taken out again by John,"
                     &c. (See notes on this place.)
                  "I see," said uncle Jones. "The Scriptures do not even leave 'a loop to hang a
                     doubt upon.' The common and every-day use of the word requires immersion—the
                     scriptural, and especially the New Testament usage of the word, requires
                     immersion—the places where the baptisms were performed required immersion, for
                     why else would they go into the water?—and even the figures and metaphors drawn
                     from the ordinance demand immersion. What shall we say then? Must we not be
                     immersed?"
                  "I can only answer for myself, uncle. If it was immersion which Jesus Christ my
                     Saviour submitted to in Jordan, and which he commanded all his disciples to
                     teach and to practice, I cannot hesitate about whether I will obey my Saviour—I
                     shall be immersed the first convenient opportunity."
                  "I cannot yet speak so confidently," rejoined her uncle. "It may be, something
                     will yet turn up to show the matter in some other light. I must take more time
                     to consider, and this reminds me that we have not yet examined the history of
                     the ordinance to see whether it is true in fact that sprinkling has been
                     substituted for immersion, or whether, after all, it was not immersion that was
                     substituted for sprinkling. I am under the impression that these Baptists are
                     the same sect that sprung up about the time of Luther and the
                     Reformation—sometimes called Anabaptists, but more frequently the Mad Men of
                     Munster. I grant I have not investigated the subject very carefully, but I am
                     certain I have somewhere seen or heard their origin in Europe traced back to
                     that occasion, and in this country I have been told they owe their beginning to Roger Williams, who was not
                     properly baptized himself, and consequently could not give valid baptism to any
                     one else. Am I not right in these conjectures Mr. Courtney?"
                  Mr. Courtney did not reply until after he had taken out his watch and observed
                     the time of night. "It is too late," said he, "to answer that question and
                     others which will be suggested by it, to-night. Suppose we postpone the further
                     consideration of the subject till another time."
                  "Very well," said Theodosia, who felt that she had sufficient food for one
                     day's reflection in what had already passed. "Come round, both of you,
                     to-morrow night. Come early and take supper with us; and meantime, Mr.
                     Courtney, you may leave this great armfull of old books. May be. I will indulge
                     my womanly curiosity by reading their titles. I don't believe I shall have much
                     relish for their contents, unless they should be vastly more attractive than
                     their external appearance indicates. Why, some of them look as though they
                     might be a hundred and one years old."
                  "Old documents are sometimes very valuable," said he, "especially in such a
                     discussion as we are to have to-morrow night. You will be more interested in
                     them than you imagine.
               
               
                  THE SIXTH NIGHT'S STUDY.
                  IN WHICH THE QUESTION, HOW CHRIST'S ORDINANCE WAS CHANGED, AND
                     POURING FIRST, AND THEN SPRINKLING, SUBSTITUTED IN PLACE OF IMMERSION, IS FULLY
                     EXAMINED, AND TRUTHFULLY ANSWERED, BY THE SPRINKLERS THEMSELVES.
                  
                  SIXTH NIGHT'S STUDY.
                  THE interest which so learned and excellent a Presbyterian as uncle Jones had
                     exhibited in the study of Baptism, together with affection for her lovely
                     daughter, had so far removed Mrs. Ernest's objections to this investigation,
                     that she had resolved herself to be present, and take some quiet part in the
                     conversation, upon the introduction of sprinkling. Uncle Jones she knew was a
                     sincere and pious man. He was also a man of good sense, sound judgment, and of
                     very extensive information. And (more than all to her) he was a Ruling
                        Elder in the Presbyterian Church. If, therefore, uncle Jones had
                     ventured to doubt about his baptism, she began to
                     think her daughter could not have committed any very deadly sin in
                     doubting about hers. And, as uncle Jones had spoken very highly of the logical 
                        accumen
                        acumen
                      and historical information of Mr. Courtney, she could not see why she
                     should not treat him with such courtesy as was due to an intelligent gentleman,
                     even though he was a poor Baptist school-master. As for his prejudices, which
                     had led him to speak so disrespectfully of the Doctors of Divinity and eminent
                     ministers of "our church"—he had probably received them in his childhood, for
                     she had no doubt he had been reared among the ignorant and bigoted Baptists,
                     who never knew any better, and from whom nothing better could be expected.
                  When Mr. Courtney came in, therefore, she was the first to welcome him, and
                     express her pleasure that he had come so early. She exerted herself to
                     entertain him till Theodosia came
                     in, and then went to prepare a nice dish which had just come into her mind for
                     supper. It was not long till the Professor came also; but not a word was said
                     about the object of their meeting till after the table was removed—when Mr.
                     Courtney introduced it by saying:
                  "If I did not misunderstand you, Professor Jones, you expressed some doubt last
                     evening whether immersion was not first introduced as baptism by the Mad Men of
                     Munster during the Reformation of Luther; and whether the Baptists of the
                     United States did not receive baptism from Roger Williams, who was himself not
                     properly baptized, and therefore could not legally baptize others."
                  "This is my impression, sir. I do not know exactly how I received it—perhaps I
                     got something of it from reading D'Aubigne's History of the Reformation—perhaps
                     I received it by hearing something of the kind from the pulpit. I am certain
                     that I have seen or heard it somewhere, and that I thought at the time I had
                     good authority for believing it—otherwise, I should not have given it a place
                     in my memory.'
                  "I have," replied Mr. Courtney, "seen and heard such statements many times from
                     various sources. They are often recorded in Presbyterian and Methodist
                     newspapers. They form a part of every controversy on the subject of baptism;
                     and you may hear them almost as often as you hear a sermon or listen to a
                     discussion on this subject. It was consequently very easy for you to receive
                     and retain such impressions"
                  "And yet I suppose you will assure me that I am altogether mistaken, and have
                     been grossly deceived."
                  "No, Professor Jones, I will not assure you. I do not like that
                     mode of discussion. I will prove to you (if you will receive the
                     testimony of the most reliable historians, or that of the most
                     eminent of your own writers on this subject) I will prove to you
                     beyond all possibility of doubt that those who make such statements are either
                     most grossly ignorant or most perversely false."
                  "I hope, Mr. Courtney, you don't mean to say that our ministers
                     preach falsehood, or that our religious editors make statements
                     that are not true?" said Mrs. Ernest, who already felt her blood begin to
                     boil.
                  "No, no, sister," said uncle Jones, who knew her mood. "Mr. Courtney only means
                     to say that our ministers and editors are mistaken, and that he
                     can prove that they have made statements without having first carefully
                     examined all the evidence."
                  "Pardon me, madam," said Mr. Courtney, "I did not intend to use any language
                     which would give offence to any one present, and most especially to you. I was
                     myself for many years a Presbyterian. I know the ministers of that order too
                     well to doubt that, as a body, they are in knowledge and piety equal to any in
                     the world. There are among them many who are now my warmest personal
                     friends—men whom I love as Christian brethren—men whom I admire as great and
                     valiant soldiers of the cross—men who love Jesus, and are devoting their lives
                     to his work, and are doing great good in the world. And yet there are among
                     them men who, upon this subject, rashly venture to make assertions which most
                     clearly and directly contradict all historical testimony, and which, if there
                     is any truth in history, must be admitted to be false."
                  "How can that be possible?" asked Theodosia. How can a good man
                        dare to say what is not strictly true?"
                  "I do not doubt, Miss Ernest, that most of them really believe
                     what they assert. They are themselves deceived. They have been trained and
                     educated in error. They have trusted to the assertions of others, who had an
                     interest in deceiving them. They get impressions, just as your uncle did, from
                     books, or papers, or lectures, or sermons, in which such statements are made. They take it for
                     granted they are true—and so repeat them to others, and extend and perpetuate
                     the falsehood, which would at once be evident, if they would go behind these
                     statements, and examine the historical records for themselves.
                  "It is, in part, for this reason, that I do not ask you to take my
                        word for any fact to which I may request your attention. Nor will I
                     ask you to receive the testimony of any Baptist historian: you
                     shall have the record to read for yourselves, and that record made in
                        every instance by an opposer of our poor and despised denomination. I
                     will prove to you, first, that the Baptists in Europe did not originate at the
                     time of the Reformation, but had existed from the very foundation of
                     Christianity; and then I will show you that the Baptists in the United States
                     do not owe their origin to Roger Williams any more than they do to Lord
                     Baltimore or Cotton Mather. And that the validity of their ordinance stands on
                     much safer ground, in point of regular succession from the Apostles, than that
                     of any of the Pædobaptist sects."
                  "That is right, Mr. Courtney," said uncle Jones—"let us have one thing at a
                     time. Bring up your witnesses."
                  "Well, I have them ready;—but first let us understand distinctly the point on
                     which we are at issue. You understand that the Baptist denomination sprang up
                     as a new thing about the time of the Lutheran Reformation, and owes its origin
                     to those who were then called 'Anabaptists, or the Mad Men of Munster?'"
                  "Yes, that was my impression."
                  "Very well. Now I will show you that this is so far from being true, that there
                     has been from the very earliest ages of Christianity, up to the
                     present time, a body of professing Christians who have always held, as we do
                     now, that baptism is not valid unless it be preceded by instruction and
                        faith in Christ; and, consequently, that the baptism of
                        infants is no baptism at all.
                  "I grant that this body of Christian people has not always been
                        called Baptists; but as they possessed the distinguishing
                     characteristics of the Baptists, it cannot be denied that they
                        were Baptists."
                  "No," said uncle Jones, "if they were professing Christians, and gave evidence
                     of the new birth, baptized only by immersion, and refused to baptize infants,
                     or recognise such baptism as valid, they were doubtless Baptists, by whatever
                     name they chanced to be called."
                  "Then we are ready to proceed with the case. The first witness I will call is
                     the celebrated ecclesiastical historian, John Lawrence Mosheim, Chancellor of
                     the University of Gottingen. He was, of course, no Baptist, or he
                     could not have held such a position. His history was originally written in
                     Latin, but has been translated into English by Dr. McLaine, of England, and Dr.
                     Murdock, in America. This learned and reliable historian says: 'The sacrament
                     of baptism was administered in this [the first] century, without the public
                     assemblies, in places appointed and prepared for that purpose, and was
                     performed by an immersion of the whole body in the baptismal
                     font.'
                  "Of the second century he says: 'The persons that were to be baptized, after
                     they had repeated the creed, confessed and renounced their sins, and
                     particularly the devil and his pompous allurements, were immersed under
                        water, and received into Christ's kingdom.' No sprinkling, and no
                     infants, you see, thus far. They were such as could profess their faith, and
                     they were 'immersed under the water.' McLaine's Mosheim, vol. 1,
                     p. 46—69.
                  "As a witness of somewhat similar character. I will now introduce the Pædobaptist Neander, whose 'Church
                     History and his 'Planting and Training of the Christian Church, have given his
                     name a world-wide celebrity.
                  "This eminent and reliable historian, in a letter to Mr. Judd says, expressly,
                     'The practice of immersion was beyond doubt prevalent in the whole
                        church. The only exception was made with the sick—hence
                     called baptisma clinicorum.'
                  "And in 'The Planting and Training of the Christian Church,' he says: 'The
                     usual form of submersion at baptism practiced by the Jews, was transferred to
                     the Gentile Christians. Indeed this form was most suitable to signify that
                     which Christ intended to render an object of contemplation by such a symbol,
                     viz., the immersion of the whole man in the spirit of a new life.
                  "So also says Coleman, another noted Pædobaptist author, the friend and
                     exponent of Neander, who is regarded as high authority by the opponents of the
                     Baptists, and who takes frequent occasion to express his aversion to their
                     faith and practice—yet a regard for the obvious truth compels him to say, page
                     372, 'Ancient Christianity Exemplified:' 'The term baptism is derived from the
                     Greek word Bapto, from which term is formed
                        Baptizo, with its derivatives Baptismos and Baptisma—baptism. The primary signification of the original is to
                     dip, to plunge, immerse. The obvious import of the noun is immersion.'
                  "Yet, in another place, he affects to regard immersion as a
                     departure from the apostolic usage:
                  "'We cannot resist the conclusion,' he says, 'that this mode of baptism was the
                     first departure from the teaching and example of the Apostles on this subject.'
                        If it was a departure from their teachings, it was the
                        earliest—for baptism by immersion, unquestionably, was
                        very early the common mode of baptism.
                  "Again, page 396, he says: 'In the Primitive Church, immediately subsequent to
                     the age of the Apostles, this [immersion] was undeniably the common mode of
                     baptism. (The utmost that can be said of sprinkling in that early period is,
                     that it was in case of necessity permitted as an exception to a
                     general rule.) This fact is so well established that it were needless to adduce
                     authorities in proof of it. * * * * It is a great mistake to suppose that
                     baptism by immersion was discontinued when infant baptism became generally
                     prevalent. The practice of immersion continued even to the thirteenth or
                     fourteenth century. Indeed it has never been formally abandoned,
                     but is still the mode of administering infant baptism in the Greek Church, and
                     in several of the Eastern Churches.'
                  "Here, also, is another Pædobaptist historian, Dr. Philip Schaff, professor in
                     a Pædobaptist Theological Seminary at Mercersburg, Pennsylvania. In his
                     'History of the Apostolic Church,' page 568, he says: 'Immersion, and not
                     sprinkling, was unquestionably the original normal form [of baptism.] This is
                     shown by the very meaning of the Greek words Baptizo,
                        Baptisma, and Baptismos—used to
                     designate the rite. Then again, by the analogy of the baptism of John, which
                     was performed in the Jordan, ['en'] Matt. 3:
                     6, compare with 16;—also eis ton Jordanan,
                        [into the Jordan,] Mark 1: 9;—furthermore, by the New Testament
                        comparisons of baptism with the passage through the Red Sea, 1
                     Cor. 10: 2; with the flood, 1 Peter 2: 21; with a
                        bath, Eph. 5: 36; Titus 3: 5; with a burial and
                        resurrection, Rom. 6: 4; Col. 2: 12; and, finally, by the general
                     usage of Ecclesiastical antiquity, which was always immersion, as
                     it is to this day in the Oriental, and also in the Græco Russian Churches,
                     pouring and springling being substituted stituted only in cases of urgent necessity, such
                     as sickness and approaching death.'"
                  "Are you sure, Mr. Courtney, that these learned historians were
                     not Baptists?"
                  "Most certainly I am. Their church connections are as well known almost as
                     their histories. But even if they had been Baptists, I do not see
                     how that would invalidate their testimony. I hope you do not think that
                     Baptists cannot tell the truth as well as other people?"
                  "Oh, no, Mr. Courtney, forgive me—I did not mean that; but it seems to me so
                        very strange that good men can say such things in their
                     writings, and yet act as though they did not believe a single word of what they
                     say. But perhaps the first historians of the church, from whom
                     these men have borrowed their statements, were Baptists."
                  "Yes, Miss Ernest, the first historians and earliest writers on the customs and
                     practices of the Apostolic Churches were Baptists. And it is to
                     them we are really indebted for all our knowledge of the earliest
                     ages. Matthew, and Mark, and Luke, and John, were Baptists—or else they might
                     never have told us about those baptisms in the river. Baptists tell about such
                     things now. Paul was a Baptist, or he would never have compared baptism to a
                     burial and resurrection. Peter was a Baptist, or he would never have compared
                     it to the flood. All those New Testament saints were Baptists, as we have seen
                     in our examination of the meaning of the word baptize. The very
                     word made them Baptists. They could not be any thing else; and, after their
                     day, the Fathers, (as they are called,) that is, the earliest
                     writers among the Christians, whose works have come down to us, were all
                     Baptists. It was near three hundred years before there were any professed
                     Christians who were not Baptists."
                  "On what authority do you venture such an assertion?' asked uncle Jones.
                  "I might say," replied the schoolmaster, "that I make it on the authority of
                     your own most eminent and most reliable historians. I have it over the
                     signatures of Roman Catholic, Episcopalian, Lutheran, Dutch Reformed, and
                     Presbyterian writers, who, while they have been in full connection with those
                     very establishments, all of which have (when they could) been the most virulent
                     and cruel persecutors of the Baptists, and some of which are
                        even now subjecting our brethren in Europe to fines and
                     imprisonment and confiscation of property, because they will not conform to the
                     corrupt and corrupting superstitions which have been substituted by Popish
                     authority for the ordinances of Christ—have nevertheless openly, plainly, and
                     repeatedly declared, as historians, that the Apostolic churches were in their
                     membership—ordinances, organization, and government, just such as the Baptist
                     churches are now—I say I might give this authority, but I will refer you to the
                     same source from which they, as historians, derived their information. I say
                     the Christian Fathers, for the first three centuries, were Baptists, because
                     these Fathers say so themselves.
                  "Justin Martyr, who is counted among the earliest of the Fathers,
                     writing to the Emperor, and giving him an account of the churches in his day,
                     about one hundred and fifty years after Christ, says: 'I shall now lay before
                     you the manner of dedicating ourselves to God through Christ upon our
                     conversion; for, should I omit this, I might not seem to deal sincerely in this
                     account of our religion. As many as are persuaded and believe that those things
                     which are taught by us are true, and do promise to live according to them, are
                     directed first to pray, and ask God with fasting, the forgiveness of their
                     sins; and we also pray and fast together with them. Then we bring them to a place where
                        there is water, and they are regenerated in the same way that we are
                     regenerated, for they are washed in the name of the Father,' &c.
                  "Tertullian, who lived somewhat later, says: 'When we are ready
                     to enter into the water, (and even before) we make our protestations before the
                     minister and in the church that we renounce the devil and all his pomps and
                     vanities—afterwards, we are plunged in the water.'
                  "And again, 'Those who are desirous to dip themselves holily in this water,
                     must prepare themselves for it by fasting, by watchings, by prayer, and by
                     sincere repentance for sin.'
                  "But it is needless to multiply authorities. It is the united testimony of
                        all the Fathers who speak of the subject at all, that baptism
                     was in these early ages performed only by immersion, except of necessity in the
                     near prospect of death; and those who, under such circumstances, received
                     pouring as a substitute were never said to have been
                        baptized, but to have been poured upon as a
                        substitute for baptism.
                  "How any man, who has any character to lose, can in the face of all this
                     testimony, venture the assertion that sprinkling was practiced in the early
                     churches, and that immersion is a modern invention, introduced by the Mad Men
                     of Munster, is more than I can comprehend," said Mr. Courtney. "Merle
                     D'Aubigne, the Historian of the Reformation, the very man to whom the Munster
                     Men are indebted for most of their present notoriety—D'Aubigne does not venture
                     any such assertion. On one point, he says, 'It seems necessary to guard against
                     misapprehension—some persons imagine that the Anabaptists of the time of the
                     Reformation, and the Baptists of our day are the same. But they are as
                     different us possible. * * It is but justice to observe that the Baptists of
                     Holland, England, and the United States, (says Fessenden, as quoted by
                     D'Aubigne,) are essentially distinct from those seditious and fanatical
                     individuals 
                        above-ment tioned
                        above-mentioned
                     , as they profess an equal aversion to the principles of the rebellion
                     of the one and the enthusiasm of the other.' Pref. to His. of Ref., p. 10. But
                     I find I am summing up on the case before I have introduced all the evidence. I
                     have referred to historians—I wish now to call your attention to the testimony
                     of several of the most eminent and learned theological
                     authors—writing not as historians, but as theological disputants.
                  "I will first introduce Professor Moses Stuart, who was a citizen of our own
                     country, and an eminent professor in one of your own theological
                     seminaries.
                  "Here is his book. It was written in answer to the question addressed to him by
                     missionaries in a foreign land, inquiring in what way they should translate the
                     Greek words which in our version read baptize and
                        baptism. It was evidently written with great care, and not
                     without much previous study of the subject.
                  "After referring to a number of eminent and reliable historians in regard to
                     the practice of the early church he thus concludes: 'But enough—it is a thing
                     made out, says Augustine, viz:—the ancient practice of immersion. So, indeed,
                     all the writers who have thoroughly investigated this subject conclude.
                  "'I know of no one usage of ancient times,' continues Mr. Stuart, 'which seems
                     to be more clearly and more certainly made out. I cannot see how it is
                        possible for any candid man who examines the subject to deny
                     this.'
                  "'In what manner then,' he asks (p. 362,) 'did the churches of Christ from a
                     very early period (to say the least)
                     understand the word baptizo in the New
                     Testament? Plainly they construed it as meaning immersion.'
                  "'We are left in no doubt,' he says again, 'about the generally received usage
                     of the Christian church down to a period several centuries after the apostolic
                     age.'
                  "Can any testimony be more explicit, or more satisfactory than this?
                  "But even Dr. Miller himself, the great champion of Presbyterianism, on this
                     subject declares, 'That it is not denied that for the first few centuries after
                     Christ, the most common mode of administering baptism was by immersion.'"
                  "Oh, that is enough, Mr. Courtney," said the young lady. "After such
                     declarations by the most eminent historians, and our own theological
                     professors, I am sure neither uncle Jones nor any one else can entertain a
                     shadow of a doubt. We will admit that the practice of the first church was
                     immersion. I was satisfied of that from the Scripture itself, since this was
                     the meaning of the word, and consequently it was immersion that Christ
                     commanded. What I desire to know is, how the change was brought
                     about, and sprinkling introduced."
                  "All in good time, Miss Ernest, we will come to that presently. Have a little
                     patience. These theological discussions are very tricky affairs. I want to set
                     this point so far beyond all doubt or disputation that no one will dare again
                     to intimate that the Baptists originated in the time of Martin Luther.
                  "Here is what Martin Luther says about it himself. No Protestant will doubt
                     that he is a competent witness. 'The word baptize is a Greek word.
                     It may be rendered immersion, as when we plunge something in water that
                        it may be entirely covered with water—and though that custom is
                        now abolished among the generality, (for even children are not
                     entirely immersed, but only have a little water poured on them,) nevertheless
                     they ought to be completely immersed, and immediately drawn out, for the
                     etymology of the word requires it.'
                  'Here also is what John Calvin, the very father and founder of the Presbyterian
                     denomination, says: 'From these words, (John 3 : 23,) it may be inferred that
                     baptism was administered by John and Christ by plunging the whole body under
                     the water. Here we perceive how baptism was administered among the
                        ancients, for they immersed the whole body in water.'
                  'Here is also Dr. Whitby, a very learned and eminent divine of the Church of
                     England: 'Immersion,' says he, 'was religiously observed by all Christians for
                     THIRTEEN CENTURIES, and was approved by the Church of England. And,' he
                     continues, 'since the change of it into sprinkling was made without any
                     allowance from the AUTHOR of the institution, or any license from any Council
                     of the Church [of England,] being that which the Romanist still urgeth to
                     justify his refusal of the cup to the laity: it were to be wished that this
                     custom [immersion] might be again of general use.'
                  "This musty-looking old volume is 'The History of the Bible, by Thomas
                     Stackhouse, Vicar of Beenham, in England,' a celebrated Episcopal clergyman. He
                     says: 'We no where read in Scripture of any one's being baptized but by
                     immersion—and several authors have proved from the acts of councils and ancient
                     rituals, that this manner of immersion continued as much as possible to be used
                     for thirteen hundred years after Christ.'
                  "The celebrated Prelate, Bishop Taylor, of the English Church, Vice-Chancellor
                     of the University of Dublin, says in his famous work called 'Ductor
                     Dubitantium:' 'The custom of the ancient churches was not sprinkling, but
                        immersion sion, in pursuance of
                     the meaning of the word baptize in the commandment, and the example of our
                     blessed Saviour.'
                  "Here also is what that earnest-hearted man, Richard Baxter, (the author of the
                     'Call to the Unconverted' and the 'Saints' Rest,') says: 'It is commonly
                     confessed by us to the Anabaptists, as our commentators declare, that in the
                     Apostles' times the baptized were dipped over head in water.'"
                  "Oh, please, Mr. Courtney, don't read us any more such testimony. Any one who
                     would not be convinced by what you have given us, would not believe if you
                     should give us ten times more. Do pray go on, and show how, and where, and by
                     what authority Christ's ordinance was changed."
                  "No, no, Mr. Courtney—I want to hear all the proof you have. Never mind
                     Theodosia—girls always are impatient," said the mother. "I wish Mr. Johnson was
                     here, so we could know what he thinks about these statements, though as for
                     that, I suppose brother Jones knows nearly as much about it as a preacher."
                  "Excuse me, Miss Theodosia—I will not detain you much longer on this point; I
                     have only a few other witnesses whose testimony I will urge at this
                        time, though there is scarcely a historian of the early days of
                     Christianity, who does not furnish us with proof. Not many years since, the
                     King of Holland appointed two very learned and able men, one a Professor of
                     Theology in the University of Groningen, and the other, Chaplain to the King,
                     to examine into the origin and history of the Dutch Baptists. They wrote out
                     the result of their investigations, and published the work at Breda in 1819. In
                     this volume, prepared by these two learned members of the Dutch Reformed
                     Church, Dr. Ypeig and Dr. J. J. Durmont, the authors, after tracing up the
                     history of the Baptists, make use of the following remarkable language:
                  "'We have now seen that the Baptists, who were formerly called Anabaptists,
                     and, in later times, Menonites, were the original Waldenses, and who have long,
                     in the history of the church, received the honor of that origin. ON THIS
                     ACCOUNT, THE BAPTISTS MAY BE CONSIDERED AS THE ONLY CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY WHICH
                     HAS STOOD SINCE THE DAYS OF THE APOSTLES, AND AS A CHRISTIAN SOCIETY WHICH HAS
                     PRESERVED PURE THE DOCTRINE OF THE GOSPEL THROUGH ALL AGES. The perfectly
                     correct external and internal economy of the Baptist denomination tends to
                     confirm the truth disputed by the Romish Church, that the Reformation brought
                     about in the sixteenth century was in the highest degree necessary; and at the
                     same time GOES TO REFUTE THE ERRONEOUS NOTION OF THE CATHOLICS THAT THEIR
                     COMMUNION IS THE MOST ANCIENT.'
                  "Such was the impression which this truthful document made upon the Court, that
                     the Government of Holland offered to the Baptist churches the support of the
                     State, which was politely but firmly declined, 'as inconsistent with their
                     principles.'
                  "The celebrated Bishop Bossuet says: 'We are able to make it appear by the acts
                     of councils and by ancient rituals, that for more than thirteen hundred years,
                     baptism was administered by immersion throughout the whole church as far as
                     possible.'
                  "Now, if you have any further doubt, I will bring up these very acts of
                     councils, and authentic copies of these same ancient rituals. They are still on
                     record, and it is not difficult to avail ourselves of their explicit
                     testimony."
                  "Oh, no, Mr. Courtney: these historians, and preachers, and bishops, were none
                     of them Baptists. We all know that, and if the facts had not compelled them,
                     they would, of course, never have made assertions so injurious to their own cause, and so directly opposed to
                     their own practice. If they say that baptism was done by immersion for thirteen
                     hundred years, of course it must have been so. If Mosheim and Neander, Bossuet
                     and Taylor, Coleman and Whitby, Stackhouse and Baxter, all sprinklers
                     themselves, and ad opposed to the Baptists, make such statements, and even Drs.
                     Miller and Stuart, our own most eminent writers on the subject, admit their
                     truth, why need we spend any more time?"
                  "But what then becomes of your uncle's opinion, that the Baptists originated
                     about the year 1530, with the Mad Men of Munster?"
                  "Oh, I have given up that opinion, (which indeed was not more than an
                     impression,) some half an hour ago. The testimony is irresistible. Immersion
                     was most unquestionably the practice of the early churches; but I am now, like
                     Theodosia, exceedingly anxious to know how it came to be universally displaced,
                     and sprinkling universally adopted in its place."
                  "You are mistaken, Professor Jones, if you imagine that this change is by any
                     means a universal one. It was made by the authority of the Pope,
                     and is confined to the Roman Catholic church and its descendants. The Eastern
                     churches—comprising a vast number of professing Christians—have never adopted
                     sprinkling, but continue to practice immersion to the present day; and as
                     Professor Stuart truly states, call the Western churches 'sprinkled
                     christians,' by way of derision. If you have any doubt of this, I will prove it
                     to you by the testimony of your own writers of most unquestionable
                     authority."
                  "Oh, no, Mr. Courtney, I do not doubt it. You have convinced me so often, that
                     I am now willing to take your word for anything you please to assert."
                  "I thank you, Professor; but still I do not like to deal in assertions. In
                     regard to this point, however, the proof will come in by the way—together with
                     that on the time and manner of the change."
                  "Do, then, Mr. Courtney, go on with that," said the young lady. "You don't know
                     how provoking it is to be kept so long in suspense."
                  "Well, here is the testimony. I will leave the story to be told by some of the
                     most celebrated members of the sprinkling churches. You will, of course, not
                     doubt their truthfulness. Here is the Edinburgh Encyclopædia, edited by the
                     learned and celebrated Sir David Brewster. Let us read what he says on the
                     subject. In the Article on Baptism:
                  "'The first law for sprinkling was obtained in the following manner: Pope
                     Stephen II, being driven from Rome by Astolphus, King of Lombards, in 753, fled
                     to Pepin, who a short time before had usurped the crown of France. While he
                     remained there, the Monks of Cressy, in Brittany, consulted him whether in case
                     of necessity, baptism performed by pouring water on the head of the infant,
                     would be lawful.—Stephen replied that it would. But though the truth of this
                     fact should be allowed, which, however, some Catholics deny, yet pouring or
                     sprinkling was admitted only in cases of necessity. It was not
                     till the year 1311 that the Legislature, in a council held at Ravenna, declared
                     immersion or sprinkling to be indifferent. In this country (Scotland), however,
                     sprinkling was never practiced in ordinary cases, till after the Reformation;
                     and in England even in the reign of Edward VI. immersion was commonly observed.
                     But during the persecution of Mary, many persons, most of whom were Scotchmen,
                     fled from England to Geneva, and there greedily imbibed the opinions of that
                     church. In 1556, a book was published at that place containing the form of
                     prayers and ministration of sacraments, approved by the famous and Godly
                     learned man, John Calvin, in which the administrator is enjoined to take water in his hand and lay it on
                     the child's forehead.—These Scottish exiles who had renounced the authority of
                     the Pope, implicitly acknowledged the authority of Calvin; and returning to
                     their own country with John Knox at their head, in 1559 established sprinkling
                     in Scotland. From Scotland this practice made its way into England in the reign
                     of Elizabeth, but was not authorized by the established church.'"
                  "Do let me look at that book a moment," said the Professor. "It is very strange
                     that I should have been told, as I am sure I have been by some of the learned
                     clergy of our church, that sprinkling was what was practiced from the earliest
                     ages, and that immersion was attempted to be introduced in its place by the
                     Anabaptists of Germany about the year 1350—when in fact immersion had been
                     always the practice, and it was sprinkling that was substituted by John Calvin,
                     the founder of our church. Can it be possible that Doctors of Divinity
                        will impose such falsehoods on their people in order to sustain the practice
                        of the church? I cannot understand it."
                  "Perhaps you want more testimony before you can believe it," said Mr. Courtney;
                     "and here is ample confirmatory proof in the plain and explicit declarations of
                     the famous Dr. Wall."
                  "Please tell me," said Theodosia, "who was Dr. Wall? I have often heard of him,
                     and I know that he wrote one or more books on baptism, but whether on our side
                     or yours, I have never been informed."
                  "Dr. Wall," said Mr. Courtney, "was a minister of the Episcopal, or English
                     Church, and after the publication of his work, the satisfaction it gave was so
                     great, that in a general convocation of the Episcopal clergy, held February
                     9th, 1706, it was ordered 'that the thanks of this house be given to Mr. Wall,
                     Vicar of Shoreham, in Kent, for the learned and excellent book he has lately
                     written concerning infant baptism.'"
                  "Then he must have written against the Baptists, if his work was approved by
                     the clergy of the Episcopal church."
                  "Of course, he did, and his book is considered to this day the ablest defence
                     of infant baptism which has ever been written."
                  "Well, what does he say about the introduction of sprinkling? Does he agree
                     with the Encyclopædia, which you have read? Where is the passage which speaks
                     of it?—Please read it for us."
                  "'France seems to have been the first country in the world where baptism by
                     affusion, was used ordinarily to persons in health, and in the
                        public way of administering it. It being allowed to
                        weak children (in the reign of Queen Elizabeth) to be baptized
                     by aspersion, many fond ladies and gentlemen first, and then by degrees the
                     common people would obtain the favor of the priest to have their children
                        pass for weak children too tender to endure dipping in the
                     water. As for sprinkling, properly so called, it was at 1645 just
                        then beginning, and used by very few. It must have begun in the
                     disorderly times after forty-one. They (the Assembly of Divines in
                     Westminster,) reformed the font into a basin.—This learned Assembly could not
                     remember that fonts to baptize in had been always used by the primitive
                        Christians long before the beginning of Popery, and ever since
                     churches were built; but that sprinkling, for the purpose of
                     baptizing, was really introduced (in France first, and then in other
                        Popish countries) in times of Popery, and that,
                     accordingly, in all those countries in which the usurped power of the
                        Pope is, or has formerly been owned, HAVE LEFT OFF DIPPING OF
                     CHILDREN IN THE FONTS, but that all other countries in the world which had
                     never regarded his authority, do still
                     
                     use it; and that basins (to sprinkle out of) except in case of
                     necessity, were never used by Papists, or any other Christians whosoever, till
                     by themselves.'—Hist. of John the Baptist, part 2d, chap. 9.
                  "This," said Mr. Courtney, "is Dr. Wall's account of the first introduction of
                     sprinkling; and you see that it confirms the truth of what I told you, that it
                     was introduced by Popery, and is confined to the countries where Popery
                     prevails, or has prevailed. The Protestant sects borrowed it from the
                     Catholics. Now look at page 403 of this other volume, by the same author, and
                     read the passage I have marked.
                  "'The way that is ordinarily used, we cannot deny to have been a
                        novelty, brought into this Church (the English) by those that bad
                     learned it at Germany, or at Geneva. And they, not contented to follow the
                     example of pouring a quantity of water, (which had there been introduced
                     instead of immersion,) but improved it (if I may so abuse that word,) from
                     pouring to sprinkling, that it might have as little resemblance to the
                        ancient way of baptizing as possible.'—Def. of Hist. of John
                        Baptist, p. 403.
                  "If you consult the Edinburgh Encyclopædia, the British Encyclopædia, and the
                     Encyclopædia Americana, article Baptism, you will find a complete history of
                     the whole subject, the truthfulness of which you will feel no disposition to
                     question. You will there learn that in England the Westminster Assembly of
                     Divines had a warm discussion whether immersion or sprinkling should be
                     adopted. But by the earnest efforts of Dr. Lightfoot, who had great interest in
                     the Assembly, sprinkling was adopted by a majority of one. The
                     vote stood, 24 for immersion, and 25 for sprinkling.—This was 1643 years after
                     Christ. The next year an act of Parliament was passed, requiring the parents of
                     all children born in the Realm to have them sprinkled; and in 1648 some four
                     years afterwards, an Ecclesiastical Council, held at Cambridge, Massachusetts
                     adopted sprinkling in the place of immersion; and, in May of the same year, the
                     Legislature of that State passed a law, making it a penal offence for any one
                     to say that infant sprinkling was not good and valid baptism."
                  "That is surely sufficient," said uncle Jones, "to satisfy any candid mind, but
                     yet I can hardly believe it, for very astonishment."
                  "What is there so surprising," replied Mr. Courtney, "in the fact that men
                     should change Christ's ordinances? They did the same thing before our Saviour's
                     time; and he had more than once occasion to reprove them, because they taught
                     'for ordinances the commandments of men,' and 'made the word of God of none
                     effect through their traditions.'"
                  "It is not," replied the Professor, "so much the fact which
                     fills me with astonishment, as the care which is evidently taken by ministers
                     of religion in our church to conceal the fact, and make on our
                     minds the impression that sprinkling, instead of being merely allowed by
                        the Pope, was actually commanded by Jesus Christ, and was commonly
                     practiced by the church till the Baptists undertook to introduce immersion.
                     But, if I do not forget, some of our writers have contended that there was
                     sufficient testimony in the writings of the early Fathers to show that
                     sprinkling was really employed at a very early day. Is it not possible that Sir
                     David Brewster, and Dr. Wall, and Professor Stuart, and all those other great
                     names, including Martin Luther and John Calvin themselves, may have been
                     mistaken, and that sprinkling was, after all, the practice of the early church?
                     Did not Cyprian, one of the ancient Fathers, expressly declare that sprinkling
                     was practiced in his day, and was considered sidered valid baptism? I am sure I have received
                     such an impression from some source."
                  "You probably received it from some Doctor of Divinity—they are accustomed to
                     make such impressions, but Cyprian says no such thing. The case to which you
                     allude presents the very first instance on record in the whole range of
                     ecclesiastical history in which it was thought possible to substitute any other
                     act for the act of immersion. The facts have been preserved by Eusebius, one of
                     the Fathers, and the historian of the early churches."
                  "It appears that a certain man, named Novatian, was taken sick, and was
                     apparently nigh unto death. In this condition he became, as many others have
                     done, greatly alarmed about his condition; and, professing faith in Christ,
                     desired to be baptized. But he was too weak to be taken out of bed and put into
                     the water. The water was, therefore, poured around him in his bed. He
                     afterwards recovered, and devoting himself to the ministry, applied for
                     priestly orders, and the question arose, whether one thus 'poured upon' in his
                     bed could be accounted a Christian? Now, it is evident, if pouring or
                     sprinkling had been a common mode of administering the ordinance, this question
                     would never have been asked.
                  "Cyprian was written to upon this subject, and he replied giving it as his
                     opinion that the grace usually conferred in baptism, might be received by such
                     a pouring. In other words, that, though this was not baptism, for it is not
                     called baptism, but perichism, ('perichutheis,') from peri, around, and cheo, to pour—yet he considered it a valid
                        substitute for baptism. This was some time in the third century
                     after Christ. That such substitution was not common, and had received no
                     general sanction from the church, is evident from the well known fact that the
                     Monks of Cressy in 754 wrote to the Pope, Stephen II, inquiring, 'If it be
                     lawful in case of necessity, occasioned by sickness, to baptize an infant by
                     pouring water on its head from a cup, or the hands?' To which the Pope replied:
                     'Such a baptism, performed in such a case of necessity, shall be
                     accounted valid.' 'This,' says Basnage, 'is accounted the first law against
                     immersion. The Pontiff, however, did not dispense with immersion except in case
                     of extreme necessity. This law, therefore, did not change the mode of dipping
                     in the public baptisms; and it was not till five hundred and fifty-seven years,
                     that the legislature in a council at Ravenna, in 1311, declared immersion and
                     pouring indifferent.'"
                  "Pardon me, Mr. Courtney, if I seem querulous; but did not ORIGEN, another of
                     the Fathers, speak of baptism as a pouring, when relating the history of the
                     flooding of the wood, and the sacrifice by the prophet Elisha in his contest
                     with the prophets of Baal? Does he not call this wetting a
                     baptism?"
                  "He does indeed, Professor. He calls it a baptism in the same way that the
                     writer of the book of Daniel calls the wetting of Nebuchadnezzar a
                     baptism. He was baptized in the dews of heaven. The word in the
                     Hebrew is tabal, which no one ever doubted
                     signified to dip or to immerse. He was dipped in the dews of heaven—a most
                     beautiful, though hyperbolical, figure of speech, expressing the idea that he
                     was as wet as though he had been dipped. The allusion in both
                     cases is to the wetting, not to the act by which the wetting was
                     occasioned."
                  "I am glad," said uncle Jones, "that you mentioned that passage in Daniel, for
                     I confess it has been a stumbling-stone to me; yet you set aside all my other
                     Scriptural difficulties so easily, that I was almost ashamed to mention it. I
                     was going to tell you that baptize must signify something besides immersion, because it was
                        impossible that the deposed monarch could be actually immersed
                     in dew."
                  "If you had told me so, I would have proved to you,' said Mr. Courtney, "that
                        dip does not mean to dip, or to submerge, because
                     Milton, a standard English writer, represents one as saying that he is dipped
                     all over in the perspiration of his own body: 
                        'A cold shuddering dew dips me all over.'
                     
                  
                  "If Daniel had been translated as he should have been, 'His body was
                        dipped in the dews of heaven,' everybody would have recognized
                     the force and beauty of the figure, as we do in Milton. It would have been like
                     that expression which represents the good land of Canaan as
                        'flowing' with milk and honey; or, like that which represents
                     God as pouring out blessings till there should not be room to
                     receive them. Such hyperbolical figures are extremely beautiful and are common
                     in all languages.
                  "Nebuchadnezzar is said to be dipped in dew, and Origen says the wood and the
                     sacrifice were immersed in water, to express the completeness of the soaking or
                     drenching which they received."
                  "Yes," said Theodosia, "Edwin made use of the word ducking last
                     evening in the same way. You recollect, Mr. Courtney, the lad who pulled the
                     bucket of water over on his head in school yesterday, so
                     much to the amusement of all the boys. Well, Edwin, in relating the
                     circumstance, said that the little fellow got a good 'ducking.'
                     By which he meant, of course, that he was as wet as though he had
                        dived in the water like a duck. It would have been
                     equally proper to have said that he got a good 'dipping,' and yet neither
                     ducking or dipping means to pour upon—they are diving and plunging still."
                  "Well, well, Theodosia," said the mother, "that is what I should call stepping
                     from the sublime to the ridiculous. Please go on, Mr. Courtney, and don't mind
                     her nonsense."
                  "Indeed, Mrs. Ernest, I feel obliged to your daughter for so appropriate an
                     illustration of the great principle of interpretation, which must guide us in
                     deciding upon the meaning of such passages. She has shown us that not only in
                     Scriptural usage, and in the poets, but even in common talk among the very
                     children, one mode of wetting is sometimes figuratively employed
                     to designate another mode—and that a person or thing that is as thoroughly
                        wet as though it had been dipped, may be
                     appropriately and beautifully said to be dipped.
                  "But now to return to the subject of our conversation. I have proved to you, by
                     the united testimony of Mosheim, Neander, and Moses Stuart—of Luther, and
                     Calvin, and Whitby, and Taylor, and Baxter—by Drs. Ypeig and Durmont, Coleman
                     and Bossuet, to whose testimony I might have added that of many others of the
                     highest authority, both among the ancients and the moderns, that immersion was
                     the practice of the early churches, and continued to be the only practice
                        except in cases of supposed necessity, for MORE
                     THAN THREE HUNDRED YEARS. I have showed you further, how 'pouring' was first
                     practiced irregularly, and without authority from the Bible, or the Pope, in
                     some rare cases of extreme sickness, till the Monks of Cressy obtained the
                     sanction of the Pope, (not of Christ,) for its use in these extreme cases
                        of sickness, more than seven hundred years after Christ, and how
                     immersion and pouring were at length declared to be indifferent by the Pope and
                     his council (not by the Scriptures) at Ravenna, in 1311.
                  "I have showed you also how John Calvin and the Westminster Assembly of Divines
                     were the means of bringing sprinkling into the English and Presbyterian
                     Churches of Scotland and
                     England—whence it came over to America with the Colonists.
                  "I have showed you also that as this change was made by the Pope and the Papal
                     Church, so it is confined to those countries which are, or have been, under
                     Roman Catholic rule, and that the Eastern Churches, which never acknowledged
                     the dominion of the Pope, have continued to practice immersion even to the
                     present day. I have showed you all this, not by the testimony of
                        Baptist witnesses, but by that of members of sprinkling
                     churches—by Lutherans, Episcopalians, and Presbyterians, and these not men of
                     doubtful character and unknown to fame, but of world-wide celebrity, both in
                     regard to their religious and their intellectual character. He who, after this,
                     will not believe that immersion was the baptism of the early churches, would
                     not believe though Paul himself should return from the dead to testify."
                  "But, Mr. Courtney," said Mrs. Ernest, "what if it was? Must we be immersed,
                     because the old Fathers were immersed? I thought you Baptists were opposed to
                     old traditions."
                  "We are opposed, Mrs. Ernest," said he very solemnly. "We are opposed to the
                     substitution of the traditions of men for the teachings of the Word of
                        God. We have ascertained from the Word itself that it was immersion
                     which was commanded by Jesus Christ. It was thus the early Christians
                     understood it. It was this which, for many hundred years, they practiced—but at
                     length the man-made ordinance of sprinkling and pouring was introduced by the
                     authority of the Pope and his councils. You have adopted this—your
                     church almost universally practices it—you have no other authority for it, as I
                     have proved by your own writers, but that of the Pope. Is it not true,
                     therefore, that you are in your church 'teaching for doctrines the commandments
                     of men?'
                  "I did not refer to the usage of the early churches as the
                        authority for immersion. If I could not find it in the Bible, I
                     would not receive it, though it had been practiced from the time of Noah.
                     Tradition is no authority in matters of religion. I may use it to confirm the
                     teaching of the actual commandment, but where there is no express precept or
                     example recorded in God's Word, I owe no obedience in matters of religion."
                  "But why, then, did you go into this long investigation of the practice of the
                     church?"
                  "I did it, madam, for the satisfaction of Professor Jones and your daughter,
                     who seemed to have a sort of silent conviction that the simple fact that
                     sprinkling was so generally practiced, was in some way or other
                     sufficient evidence that it must have been commanded in the Scriptures—I,
                     therefore, traced immersion back to Jesus Christ, and showed where he commanded
                     it. I have now traced pouring back to Pope Stephen II., and showed
                     where he allowed it in cases of necessity, and to the Popish council at
                     Ravenna, and showed where they allowed it in other cases; and I have traced
                        sprinkling, properly so-called, back to John Calvin, and showed
                     where he commanded it in his Book of Prayers and Sacraments, published at
                     Geneva. I have, therefore, founded immersion on the rock of God's
                     Word, and at the same time convinced you all, I trust, that pouring and
                     sprinkling rest only on the sand of human invention—not having
                     even a credible tradition to rest upon."
                  Uncle Jones listened with some uneasiness to this long speech. He felt its
                     force, and recognized its truthfulness, but he was doubtful of the effect it
                     might have upon his sister. In fact, he was afraid of an explosion.
                  
                  Affection for her daughter had, however, been working wonders in the mother's
                     mind within the last two days. She found that Theodosia would
                     examine, and she desired that she would do it quickly. She found
                     she was likely to be convinced, and she began to excuse her by
                     considering the weight and invincibility of the arguments. Now, she saw that
                     she was convinced, and every additional reason for such conviction
                     was a comfort to her maternal pride, as it was new proof that her daughter was
                     not such a simpleton as to believe without the most convincing evidence.
                  She had not the most distant idea of being convinced herself. She
                     did not hear or weigh the testimony herself—she heard and thought only for
                     Theodosia—and since her daughter would become a Baptist, she was
                     gratified that it was nothing less than the most unanswerable
                        arguments that compelled her to do so.
                  So far, therefore, from looking angry, she seemed rather pleased with this
                     conclusion of the school-master's arguments; and she herself suggested that he
                     should enter upon the other branch of it, by reminding him that he had promised
                     to show that the American Baptists did not originate with Roger Williams any
                     more than the European Baptists did with the Mad Men of Munster.
                  "That is one of the easiest things in the world to do," replied Mr. Courtney.
                     "Even granting that Roger Williams established the first Baptist
                     church which was ever known in this country, yet it would not follow that all
                     the Baptists. or any of the Baptist churches received their
                     baptism from him; for there have been, every year since his day, more or less
                     regularly immersed Baptists, and regularly ordained Baptist ministers coming to
                     this country, and even though he had founded the church at Providence, and that
                     in an irregular manner, before any other Baptist church was founded ed—that
                     would not invalidate the regularity of any other of the thousands and thousands
                     of Baptist churches, unless it could be made to appear that they were all
                     colonies from that. I need not, therefore, spend any time upon this point Of
                     all the thousands of Baptist churches in America, there are none whose pastors
                     and members have had any manner of dependence on the church founded by Roger
                     Williams They have many of them received baptism from the Dutch
                     Baptists, of whom Drs. Ypeig and Durmont testify that they belong to a body of
                     Christians who can trace their origin down to the very times of the Apostles.
                     Many of them received it from the Welch Baptists, who can trace
                     their descent back to the sixth or seventh century. Many of them received it
                     from the English Baptists, who have been the victims of proscription and
                     persecution from a very early day. But none of them received
                     baptism from Roger Williams, or the church said to have been established by him
                     at Providence. The truth is, the society established by Roger Williams,
                     Holliman, and others, soon died out. It never planted any other church. It
                     cannot be proved that any Baptist who received baptism in that body and by
                     their authority, was ever concerned in baptizing any founder of other
                     churches."
                  "I have often heard of Roger Williams," said Theodosia, "as the founder of the
                     Baptists in this country. Please tell me what was his relation to them."
                  "Roger Williams adopted at one time Baptist sentiments, at least, in some
                     particulars," replied Mr. Courtney. "He desired to be immersed. There was no
                     Baptist minister at hand. He consequently immersed one of his followers, who,
                     in time, immersed him; and then he considered himself competent to immerse
                     others. The little company, thus irregularly baptized, called itself a Baptist
                     church; but, in about four months,
                     Roger Williams himself changed his opinions and withdrew from the society. The
                     so-called church soon died out, and the present Baptist Church of Providence
                     was founded on an independent basis, separate and distinct from that. It seems
                     probable, however, from recent historical researches, that the
                        oldest Baptist Church in the United States is that at Newport,
                     in Rhode Island, founded by John Clark, against the regularity of whose baptism
                     there has, so far as I know, been nothing alleged. Though, as to that, even if
                        this, and all the other churches of Rhode Island, had been, and
                     were still, irregular up to the present time, it would not affect the standing
                     of the great body of the churches in the United States, since very few of them
                     derived their baptism directly or indirectly from Rhode Island—and not a
                        single one of them from Roger Williams."
               
               
                  THE SEVENTH NIGHT'S STUDY.
                  IN WHICH IT IS CLEARLY PROVED BY THE SCRIPTURES THEMSELVES, AND
                     BY THE TESTIMONY OF THE MOST LEARNED AND EMINENT PÆDOBAPTIST MINISTERS, THAT
                     INFANT BAPTISM WAS NOT COMMANDED BY CHRIST OR THE APOSTLES: INFANT BAPTISM WAS
                     NOT PRACTICED OR SANCTIONED BY CHRIST OR HIS APOSTLES.
                  
                  SEVENTH NIGHT'S STUDY.
                  THE attentive reader may have observed that Mr. Percy has not favored us with
                     his presence for the last three nights. Though he seemed so greatly interested
                     in the subject, yet with the third night's study he apparently abandoned
                     it,—Since that time he had not visited Mrs. Ernest's cottage, or held any
                     communion with its inmates. He did not know what progress Theodosia had made in
                     her investigations, nor what assistance she had received from uncle Jones or
                     others. The remark made by Mr. Courtney, as they were about to separate on that
                     occasion, "that he would find it much easier to satisfy his mind that
                     sprinkling and pouring were not baptism, than he would to abandon his church
                     connections and be baptized according to the commandment of Jesus Christ," had
                     opened his eyes. He had, till that moment, looked upon the subject merely as
                     one of curious speculation. It was till then a mere question of fact, to be
                     decided by testimony. As such, its investigation greatly interested him. It was
                     congenial to his logical and discriminating cast of mind, and he had been
                     studying it as he would a case of law. But he now saw that it was a
                        practical matter. If he decided that he had not been baptized,
                     consistency would require that he should at once apply for baptism. This would
                     break off his connection with a large, and wealthy, and influential body, and
                     tie him down to a little company of obscure and ignorant laborers and
                     mechanics—for of such was the newly-organized Baptist Church of which we have
                     been speaking chiefly composed. This was something he could not think of.
                        His natural pride had never been
                     humbled by the grace of God, and he was not at all prepared to resign a
                     position at once honorable and profitable, for one of comparative
                     insignificance and contempt. He thought of these things as he was going home
                     that night, and at once resolved that he would have no more to do with the
                     subject.
                  In this resolution he had been confirmed by a visit next morning from Col.
                     White, one of the members of the Session, who was a wealthy speculator in
                     lands, and one of his best patrons. After some conversation about matters of
                     business, Col. White carelessly remarked: "They have it rumored, 'Squire Percy,
                     that you are on the eve of leaving our church and becoming a Baptist."
                  "Let me assure you, Colonel, that there is not the slightest foundation for
                     such a report. I have, indeed, spent a few hours in the investigation of the
                     mode of baptism, but it was for the mere purpose of fortifying my mind with the
                     best arguments in favor of our position on that subject. I found, indeed, that
                     the immersionists have much firmer ground to stand upon than I imagined—but I
                     have never for a moment entertained the idea of leaving the Presbyterian
                     Church."
                  "I am glad to hear it, Mr. Percy, for I prefer, and so do several of our best
                     firms, to employ you to attend to our business, and we had all about concluded
                     that we could never trust our interests in the hands of one so fickle-minded,
                     as such a change would prove a man to be; and, besides this, since the death of
                     Deacon Smith, there has been a vacancy in the Church Session, which we have
                     been desirous to fill with some talented and efficient young man,
                     since the rest of us are now beginning to be somewhat advanced in years. We
                     were talking of you, and the only objection seemed to be, that you were yet
                     unmarried. I took the liberty to say that I thought that
                     difficulty would be removed in the course of another month, as I understood the
                     wedding-day was fixed. It is no secret, you know. But, then, rumor says also,
                     that Miss Theodosia is going over to the Baptists. And, that her mother, with
                     all her authority, has not been able to dissuade her from the investigation of
                     the subject, though she sees very plainly where it will lead her."
                  "It is very true," said the young man, "that she has been engaged in the study
                     of this subject, but I do not know to what conclusion she may come. For my own
                     part, I have concluded to have nothing more to do with it."
                  "It is a delicate matter, Mr. Percy, and perhaps I ought not to mention it, and
                     nothing but my regard for your future happiness, and the honor of our church,
                     could induce me to do it—but would it not be wise in you to use your influence
                     (which I know must be very great,) to induce her to pause before she takes a
                     step which will cause your house always, after your marriage, to be divided
                     against itself? I know I have no right to advise, but I take the liberty of a
                     friend to you, and a friend to your father before you, to merely suggest such a
                     thought. Perhaps, on reflection, you may think it advisable, either to see her
                     immediately, or write a little line, stating your own determination and
                     whatever else you may think most likely to operate upon her mind, so as to
                     prevent such a terrible event as it would be to you and all of us, should she
                     so far disgrace her name and dishonor her profession, as to leave the communion
                     in which she was born, and by which she has been nourished and taught—in which
                     her grand-parents lived and died, and of which she is herself the ornament and
                     pride, and throw herself away with all her loveliness and intelligence, by
                     uniting her fate to that ignorant and obscure sect, with a mechanic for a
                     preacher, who have started up here like a mushroom in a single night, and will
                     probably pass away again in a day."
                  
                  Mr. Percy was about to reply, when the Colonel anticipated him, by rising and
                     grasping the young man's hand very warmly in both of his—' Pardon me," he said,
                     "I ought not to have spoken thus. Forget that I have said it. But don't forget
                     my case in the Supreme Court. I have entrust-it entirely to you. I want you to
                     have all the honor which will accrue from a decision in your favor. Good
                     morning.—You will need all your time to make preparation for next week's
                     Circuit Court—you start on Saturday, I believe?"
                  "Yes, sir."
                  "Well, good luck to you," and the Colonel was gone.
                  Mr. Percy walked his office with a restless, undecided air, for some time, and
                     then set himself resolutely to work in the preparation of some cases for the
                     approaching court. But he could not banish the subject from his mind. He
                     sometimes thought he would go at once, and have another conversation with his
                     betrothed upon the subject; but when he remembered her earnest and
                     conscientious truthfulness of soul, he feared to lower himself in her
                     estimation by presenting to her any but the real reasons for his abandonment of
                     the investigation, and these he hardly dared to own even to himself. This was
                     on Wednesday morning. He learned on Thursday that uncle Jones had been
                     conversing with Theodosia on the subject; and, on Friday, that both he and Mr.
                     Courtney had been at the cottage, and Mrs. Tattle had told young Dr. Woodall,
                     who was his intimate friend and confidant, that, on the coming Sabbath, Miss
                     Ernest was to be baptized.
                  Early on Saturday morning, he was obliged to start to a distant county-site to
                     attend a session of the Circuit Court. Before his return, (if this story were
                     true,) the die would be cast. If he would prevent it at all, he must do it now.
                     He determined to write what he felt he could not speak. The letter read
                     thus:
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "DEAREST:—I must leave town to-morrow, and shall be gone a week. I
                                 have been so pressed by business, that I have not been able to call
                                 in again, as I intended when I saw you last. I cannot come
                                 to-night, but I cannot leave without expressing to you once more my
                                 earnest love. You know, dearest Theodosia, that the happiness of my
                                 life is bound up in yours. I have no wish or hope in the future but
                                 those of which you form a part; and, if what I am about to say
                                 should be unpleasant to you, I beg you will remember that it is
                                 dictated by the tenderest and most ardent affection. It is because
                                 I value your happiness even more than my own, that I venture to say
                                 what I am about to utter. I have learned from rumor that you have
                                 already determined to abandon our church, and unite with that
                                 contemptible sect of Baptists. I do not know if this be true or
                                 not. I hope and pray the rumor may prove false. I will not say
                                 these Baptists are not right about the mode of baptism. It may be
                                 they are. But whether one mode or another be correct, baptism is
                                 not essential to salvation. It is a mere outward form, and I
                                 cannot, for the sake of a mere external and non-essential ceremony,
                                 abjure the church of my fathers. I fondly hope that she, whom I
                                 love more than all else in life, will agree with me in this. I
                                 cannot bear the thought that one so beautiful, so lovely, so
                                 accomplished, so fitted to shine and lead in the
                                 highest circle of our society—one, too, who has the unbounded
                                 confidence and affection of her brothers and sisters in the
                                 church—should bring such dishonor upon her father's name, such
                                 sorrow to her mother's heart, and such regret to his, who rejoices
                                 in the hope that he will be the companion of her life and the
                                 husband of her love, as
                                 to prove recreant to her Christian faith— forsake the church of the
                                 mother who offered her to God in infancy—of the teachers who
                                 instructed her childhood—of the pastor who prayed with her in the
                                 time of her conviction, and rejoiced over her at the time of her
                                 conversion; and may I not add of him who, trusting in the solemn
                                 promise of our betrothal, expects to spend his life in promoting
                                 her happiness? How can you, my dearest love—how can you disregard
                                 such considerations as these? I know that you are conscientious in
                                 every step you take, and I beg you to reflect whether these things
                                 should not have some influence with you. I know that you mean to do
                                 right, and I entreat that you will consider if such a course will
                                 not be wrong. I know I have no right to dictate, but, oh! I do
                                 beseech you, if you have any love for me, that you will not so
                                 mortify and distress, not me alone, but all who love you, as to
                                 unite your fate with those boorish, uneducated, and bigoted people,
                                 called Baptists.
                              
                                 "Your distressed, but still most affectionate,
                                 "G. W. PERCY."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  This note he hardly trusted himself to read, so he sealed it up, and dispatched
                     a messenger to carry it to Mrs. Ernest's. Its immediate effect on Theodosia we
                     have already seen. When she had reached her own room, she threw her head upon
                     her mother's bosom, and, sighing as if a heartstring broke, with every
                     deep-fetched sob that came, gave free expression to her uncontrollable
                     distress.
                  It was long before the mother became sufficiently composed to read the letter,
                     and learn what it was that had occasioned such a terrible heart-sorrow to her
                     loving and sensitive child. Terrible she knew it must be, for never in her life
                     had she seen Theodosia exhibit such unutterable distress The young lady herself
                     did not know precisely what the letter ter contained. She had loved Mr. Percy
                     with all the fervor of a first and only love. The day was fixed only a few
                     weeks in the future for their wedding. The preparations for it were even then
                     begun. To be what Mr. Percy would approve, was to her the highest point of
                     earthly ambition. She prized her peerless beauty, not for its own sake, but
                     because Mr. Percy praised it. She valued her accomplishments, chiefly because
                     Mr. Percy thought them desirable. With all her independence of thought and
                     originality of mind, she had learned to think that she was wrong, if Mr. Percy
                     did not think her right.
                  In this investigation he had gone with her step by step, so long as he had
                     taken any part in it. She had, till now, not the very slightest suspicion that
                     he would not act out his convictions, as well as herself—much less
                     did she imagine that he would so fearfully disapprove of her obedience to what
                     she now was fully satisfied was the plain and unmistakable command of her
                     Redeemer.
                  The first influence of this communication was like that of a heavy blow upon
                     the head. It staggered, and then stunned the mind. She only felt that some
                     great and terrible calamity had fallen on her heart and crushed it. She could
                     not recall the language of the letter, but only a general impression of its
                     contents. But there was, here and there, a word which was burnt into her very
                     brain. With all its protestations of affection, she felt (for love is jealous
                     in such things,) that if she became a Baptist, she forfeited his love.
                  To her mother she could speak words no other's ear might hear—and when her sobs
                     had somewhat ceased, and she had been persuaded to lie down, and try to be
                     composed, she drew her mother's face to hers, and while their tears mingled
                     together upon her check, she whispered, "I did not think
                     he could have cast me off for seeking to know and do my duty."
                  "My precious child, he has not cast you off—he says again and again, that he
                     loves you dearly, and hopes to spend his life in rendering you happy."
                  "But, mother, does he not say he cannot bear to think of my becoming a
                        Baptist? Does he not call them, whom how I do believe are the true
                     church of Jesus Christ—does he not call them that contemptible
                        sect? Does he not say that because he has no right to
                        dictate, he entreats me not to mortify him,
                     not to distress him, by becoming one of that little company of
                     boorish, uneducated, and bigoted people? No, no, mother, I see it all. If I
                     become a Baptist, I must resign his love—I must give up all the most cherished
                     hopes of my life. After such an expression of his dislike to these poor and
                     humble disciples of Jesus, I would not dare, if I were one of them, to become
                     his wife. I must choose between him and my Saviour—I see it all—but I can't
                     choose now. Oh! my mother, pray for me—pray for me! You will not
                     cast me off, my mother: you will love me still. Will you not, my
                     mother? You can love, even though I do mortify and distress you,
                     can't you, mother?"
                  "Yes, yes, darling—don't look at me so wildly. I will love you always—I will
                     love you dearly. And so will Mr. Percy, even though you do mortify and distress
                     him. He can't help loving you, my sweet child. No one, who knows you, can do
                     any thing but love you."
                  "No, mother, he can't love as I must be loved, were I the wife of
                     his bosom. But I dare not think of that now. I must pray—I must ask wisdom—I
                     must get strength from heaven. Leave me now, mother, but don't forget to pray
                     for me."
                  The mother went away—and, kneeling down, poured out her heart in a sincere and
                     fervent prayer, that God would indeed give comfort to her poor child's loving
                     and smitten spirit. While she, the dear, sweet child, lay still upon her bed,
                     and only prayed with those groanings that cannot be uttered, for strength
                        to bear, as well as energy to do—her mind grew calmer
                     and clearer, and when her mother came, an half hour after, to bid her
                     good-night, she was in a deep sleep, with something almost like a smile upon
                     her face. This may seem strange to one who does not know that one effect of
                     sudden, deep, and terrible sorrow is quickly to exhaust the nervous energies
                     and predispose to heavy slumber. There is, therefore, a most affecting beauty
                     in the language of the Evangelist, when he says of the disciples, whom Jesus
                     had left only a little time, while he went to pray, that He returned to them,
                     and found them sleeping for sorrow. No other language could so
                     perfectly express the deep, intense, and soul-exhausting agony of
                        mind which they had felt on learning that their beloved Lord was soon
                     to perish by the hands of his enemies, and that one of their number should be
                     the wretch who would betray him into their hands.
                  So Theodosia might now be said to be sleeping for sorrow. She did not wake till
                     after her ordinary time of rising in the morning. When she first became
                     conscious, there was a feeling of weight upon her eye-lids which prevented her
                     from opening them—and as she lay there, motionless, the events of the past
                     evening began to come back, like the dimly remembered imagery of some fearful
                     dream. At first, she was only conscious that something terrible had befallen
                     her, and it required some little effort to remember what it was. Then came to
                     view the letter, just as it looked when her mother handed it to her as she sat
                     in the parlor. She could see every mark of every letter of the superscription.
                     Then the open letter was before her—and she read some of the lines as they had marked themselves with
                     terrible distinctness on her brain, others she could not see, but
                     only a dim impression of their sense came up in her remembrance. When, as she
                     ran thus in her mind over the letter, she came to where it read, "I know I have
                     no right to dictate, but oh! I do beseech you, if you have any love for me;
                     that you will not so mortify and distress, not me alone," &c., the tears
                     flowed freely, and she was able to open her eyes.
                  Her mother had, at that moment, come in, and was bending over her.
                  "My poor child," said she, as she saw the tears start even before she seemed to
                     be awake—"how do you feel this morning?"
                  "Is it morning, mother? I have been asleep—I have had a terrible dream, or was
                     it all reality? Do, mother, tell me, did you bring me a letter last night from
                     Mr. Percy?"
                  "Yes, my child, you are not quite awake. It was no dream; but the reality is
                     not so terrible as you imagine Let me give you this cup of coffee, and you will
                     feel refreshed."
                  Theodosia sat up in bed and sipped the coffee—and shortly afterwards got up,
                     and went and sat beside her mother and engaged in some worsted work, which she
                     had begun the day before. When her mother went out, she followed her and stood
                     beside her till she returned; so she continued all through the day,
                     accompanying her as constantly and almost as noiselessly as her shadow. She did
                     not speak—she did not weep—she sometimes tried to smile, but it
                     was pitiful to see the effort made to divert her mother's mind, and make her
                     think she was not so very bad. In this condition we must leave her
                     for the present, and go to the dwelling of Professor Jones, where Mr Courtney
                     and the Rev. Mr. Johnson are waiting to engage in the discussion of the subject
                     of Infant Baptism, which discussion, if it should prove to be less entertaining
                     than this little narrative of what transpired at Mrs. Ernest's, will, we trust,
                     be more instructive.
                  "If I understood you correctly, Mr. Courtney," said Professor Jones, (when they
                     were all assembled,) "you asserted that there was in the Scriptures not the
                     slightest authority for the baptism of infants, and that baptism received in
                     infancy is not valid baptism."
                  "You are nearly correct," said Mr. Courtney, smiling.—"I did not
                        assert that there was no such authority, for it is not my habit
                     to deal in mere assertions. I said that I would prove
                     that this was so."
                  "But how will you set about proving such a negative?"
                  "By offering the only testimony which the nature of the case admits. Our
                     authority to baptize any one, infant or adult, is derived only
                     from the commandments or example of Christ or his
                     apostles. All they said and all they did which is of any authority to us, is
                     recorded in the Word of God.—Now if I can't find, and you can't show me,
                        any single place where an infant was commanded to be
                     baptized—or any single place where one is said to have been
                     baptized, then I think I may venture to say that there is no authority
                        there for infant baptism."
                  "I think so too; but I am certain we can show you a number of such places. Can
                     we not, Mr. Johnson?"
                  "Certainly we can. It has always been my understanding that the baptism of the
                     infant children of believers is explicitly commanded by both Christ and the
                     apostles; and what was required by their precepts they enforced by their
                     example. They both commanded, and they practiced it."
                  "Very good. Here then is the point on which we are at issue. If the
                        places are in the Book, you can show them. I will not be
                     unreasonable. I do not ask even for two witnesses nesses: I only require one. Show me
                        one solitary instance of either precept or example, and I will
                     give up the case."
                  "I have been accustomed to think," said the Professor, "that the commission
                     itself, as recorded in Matt. 28: 19, and in Mark 16: 15, 16, contained all the
                     authority which was given to the Christian Church to administer the ordinance
                     of baptism; and I had supposed that the authority to baptize infants was to be
                     found in what Christ said on that occasion—'Go ye into all the world, and
                     preach the Gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be
                     saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned.'"
                  "That," said Mr. Johnson, "is what Mark says. Get a Testament and see how it
                     reads in Matthew. I think it is somewhat different. Here it is—'Go ye therefore
                     and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the
                     Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I
                     have commanded you: and lo! I am with you always, even unto the end of the
                     world.'"
                  "Very good," said Mr. Courtney. "You have the law all now before you. Is there
                     in it a single allusion, even the faintest, to infants? Did Christ say, as you
                     Presbyterians do, Go baptize believers and their infant children, or believers
                     only? Matthew says teach them and then baptize them.
                     So they must be such as can be taught. But can a little babe mewling and puking
                     in its mother's arms,' be taught the doctrines of salvation by Jesus Christ?
                     Mark says—'He that believeth and is baptized,' so that he speaks
                     of none baptized but those who had first believed. Can little
                     infants who do not yet so much as know their right hand from their left,
                     exercise faith in the Saviour of souls? You will not, I am sure,
                     venture to say they can, though there have been some Doctors of
                        Divinity who were silly enough to make such assertions. And Matthew,
                     in fact, says just the same that Mark does; for 'the word rendered
                        teach here is not the one that is usually so translated in the
                     New Testament. This word properly means disciple, or make
                        disciples of all nations.'—(Barnes' Notes, In.
                        loc.) So also says that eminent and good man, Dr. Doddridge, author
                     of the 'Rise and Progress of Religion.'—'Here it is to be observed
                        first, certain things are enjoined, viz., to
                        disciple—to baptize—to teach. Secondly, these things are
                     enjoined in a certain order, viz., the order in which they stand
                     in the divine commission.' (Dod. Lec.) So says also that other
                     great and good man, the pious Baxter, author of 'The Saints' Rest':
                  "'Go disciple me all nations—and as for those,' he continues, 'who
                     say they are discipled by baptizing and not before
                     baptizing, they speak not the sense of the text, nor that which is true or
                     rational, if they mean it absolutely as so spoken, else why should one be
                     baptized more than another?' 'This text is not like some occasional historical
                     mention of baptism, but it is the very commission of Christ to his
                     apostles for preaching and baptizing, and purposely expresseth their several
                     works in their several orders. Their first task is by teaching
                        to make disciples, who are by Mark called
                        believers. The second work is to baptize
                     them—whereunto is annexed the promise of salvation. The third is
                     to teach them all other things which are afterwards to be learned in the school
                     of Christ. To contemn this order is to renounce all rules of
                        order, for where can we expect to find it, if not here?' 'I profess,'
                     he goes on to say, my conscience is fully satisfied from this text that it is
                     one sort of faith, even saving faith, that must go before baptism;
                     and the profession whereof the minister must expect.'—Dis. on the Right
                        to Salvation, pp. 91-150
                  "Dr. Hibbard, a Methodist, in his Commentary on Matt. 28 19-20, says—'It is
                     well known that our English version
                     sion does not give a satisfactory view of this passage. The word rendered teach
                     in the 19th verse is altogether a different word in the original from that
                     rendered teach in the 20th. It should read, Go disciple, that is
                     make converts to Christianity of all nations,' &c.
                  "Neither of you, gentlemen, nor any other Greek scholar will dispute that
                        matheteusate, in the first part of this
                     commission, means make disciples, as certainly as didaskontes means teaching in the last part of it. Nor can you,
                     or any man of common sense, pretend that any are commanded to be baptized, but
                     those who have first been made disciples.—Now what is the New Testament meaning
                     of a disciple? Jesus Christ himself shall answer: Luke 14: 26, 27, 33. If any
                     man come to me and hate not his father, and mother and wife, and children, and
                     brethren, and sisters, yea and his own life also, he cannot be my
                        disciple. And whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me
                        cannot be my disciple. So likewise, whosoever he be of you,
                     that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.' Do
                     little infants who do not even know the name of Christ, and scarcely know their
                     own, so love Christ that the love they have to all others is like hatred
                     compared to that they feel for him?—Can little infants forsake all for Christ,
                     and do they daily take their cross and follow him? Then they are his disciples,
                     and are commanded to be baptized. But no sensible man who is not a Doctor
                        of Divinity would ever think of such absurdity. You do not
                        pretend to baptize infants on any such grounds. You do not ask in
                     them for any evidence of penitence, or piety, or faith, or love, or any thing
                     else that goes to make a disciple of Christ."
                  "No," replied Mr. Johnson, "we baptize them on the faith of their
                        parents."
                  "But this commission says nothing about baptizing thechildren of
                        believing parents. By it the ministers of Christ are commanded
                     to baptize disciples, (according to Matthew,) and
                        believers, (according to Mark); but in regard to the
                        children of these disciples and believers, they are both as
                     silent as the grave."
                  "It was not necessary," said Mr. Johnson, "to put the authority for the baptism
                     of infants in the commission, since the matter is fully provided
                     for else where. I grant that it is not in this passage, but it
                     does not follow that it is not in the Bible."
                  "Oh! no—certainly not," said Mr. Courtney. "I am easy to be satisfied; show it
                     to me in any other place, and it will do quite as well."
                  "But, I do not feel disposed," said Professor Jones, "to give up this passage
                     so easily. Does not the term 'all nations' include infants as well
                     as adults?"
                  "Certainly, but they were not to baptize all nations, for this
                     would include all unbelievers and their children, as
                     well as believers and their children. They were to Go
                     to all nations, (not to the Jews alone, as they had been used to
                     think); and among all nations they were to make disciples, as many as they
                     could—and those disciples who believed they were to baptize."
                  "But, Mr. Courtney, let me put in another plea for the infants. I am very
                     anxious to get them into this commission, for I have always thought they were
                     surely there. It is evident they are not included in the expression 'all
                     nations,' since it is true, as you say, it will include all infidels,
                     idolators, profligates and murderers, as well as the infant children of
                     unbelievers—but are they not included in the word disciples? May they not, in
                     view of their innocence, and purity, and evident fitness for heaven, be
                     properly called the disciples of Jesus? Did not Jesus himself compare his
                        disciples to them, and say that none
                     could enter heaven who did not become like one of them? I will therefore put it
                     on this ground: None but disciples are to be baptized, but infants are already
                     by nature disciples—and therefore infants are to be baptized."
                  "But," said Mr. Courtney, "the disciples who were to be baptized were
                        not disciples by nature. They were to be
                        made disciples. They were to be believing
                     disciples, and capable of learning, for they were to be taught.
                     Now as infants are not made disciples by hearing the Word—as they
                     are incapable of faith or of instruction in the things that Christ
                     commanded, they cannot be included in the term disciples."
                  "Yes, but infants have the natural capacity to believe and to be
                        taught, which will in time be fully developed."
                  "Very true; and so when these capacities are fully developed, and
                     they actually have believed, they will have become disciples. You
                     know very well that children do not ordinarily grow up the disciples of Jesus,
                     but the servants of sin, and all of them need conversion after they come to the
                     development of their faculties, before they can be disciples. They are in
                     infancy in some respects like to disciples, but they are
                        not disciples, but 'are by nature the children of
                     wrath even as others,'—and as soon as they are old enough, they show it very
                     plainly."
                  "Well, I fear we must give up the commission. But tell me this, if infants are
                     not fit subjects for baptism, how can they be fit for heaven?"
                  "Those only are fit subjects for baptism, whom Christ commanded to be
                        baptized. The Gospel has nothing to do with infants. There is in it
                     no command addressed to them, nor is any act, either of mind or body, required
                     of them in order to their salvation. They are no more required to believe
                     
                     
                      than they are to be baptized. They are
                     saved without either You are required to do both. To
                        you, God says believe and be baptized. You profess
                     to have believed, but you have never made the slightest effort to
                     be baptized. What was done to you in infancy, without your knowledge or assent,
                     was no act of yours. You are still living in open disobedience to
                     this law. Jesus Christ did not command your parents to have
                        you baptized—putting the responsibility on them, but he commanded
                        you to be baptized for yourself; and that not
                        before you believed, but afterwards: 'He that
                     believeth, and [then] is baptized, shall be saved.'"
                  "It seems to me, Mr. Courtney," said the pastor, "that you are rather early in
                     your application of the subject. We have granted indeed that the authority for
                     infant baptism is not in the commission, by which we are directed to baptize
                     adult believers, but it may be found elsewhere. A recent writer on this
                     subject, the Rev. Dr. Summers, has very expressively said: 'That the New
                     Testament ABOUNDS with the proofs of infant baptism.'"
                  "Then, sir, it will be very easy to find at least one text which
                     teaches it."
                  "Certainly it will, not only one, but many."
                  "But I only ask for one; and if you have several, give me that
                     first which you most rely upon."
                  "Well, sir, you have the Testament in your hand, please turn to Matthew 19 :
                     13, 14 : 'Then were brought unto him little children, that he should put his
                     hands upon them, and pray. And the disciples rebuked them. But Jesus said,
                     suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the
                     kingdom of heaven.' Do you not see some authority for infant baptism in
                     that?"
                  "Indeed, sir, I cannot—can you?"
                  "Yes, truly. It is to my mind perfectly satisfactory. And I do not see how it can fail to convince any
                     candid man who reads it."
                  "Your mind, Mr. Johnson, must be easily satisfied then, for I can't see
                        one word about baptism in it."
                  "Oh! I do not say that baptism is expressly named in it; but, sir,
                     the inference is irresistible, that these children were brought
                        to be baptized, and that the people were
                        accustomed to bring their children for that purpose, and that
                     Jesus commanded his disciples never to forbid it, as you,
                     Baptists, have done, but to suffer the little children to come to him, and make
                     a part of his visible church."
                  "Is it possible! Pardon me, Mr. Johnson, if I say, that to my mind there can be
                     no inference about the object or purpose for which these children
                     were brought, because it is expressly and very definitely stated in the
                        text. They brought them, that he should lay his hands on them,
                        and pray. This was all they came for, and this was all he did. He did
                     not baptize them. He did not command them to be baptized. He merely (verse
                     15th) 'laid his hands on them, and departed.' But there is an
                     irresistible inference that I draw from this text, and that is, that the
                        disciples had never been accustomed to infant baptism. If they had
                     been in the habit of baptizing children, they could never have
                     objected to their coming to be blessed by Jesus. They would have
                     regarded it as a thing of course. But if they had, like the Baptist churches,
                     received only adults, and them only on repentance and profession
                     of faith, it was not at all strange that they should reprove those who brought
                     the little children, who could not believe. And there was a beautiful propriety
                     in the lesson which Jesus taught them, viz., that though children were
                        not to be baptized, and were not members of his
                        church, yet they were to be objects of intense interest
                     and deep solicitude to his people. Though they were not to be baptized,
                        they were to
                     be prayed for. Parents, therefore, ought to bring their little
                     children to church by faith and prayer, for that he
                     has commanded, but not by baptism, for that he has forbidden, by
                     requiring those who are baptized, first to believe."
                  "But you cannot deny, Mr. Courtney, that by the kingdom of heaven, in this
                     passage, is meant the visible church, and that Jesus expressly
                     mentions children as members of it?"
                  "Indeed, Mr. Johnson, he mentions no such thing. It does not matter at all,
                     whether the kingdom of heaven means the church visible or invisible. He does
                        not say that children are members of it, but that its
                        members are like children. He does not say his church is
                     composed of children, but of such as are like
                     children. For in the corresponding passage in Luke and Mark, he goes right on,
                     and explains by saying, 'Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a
                     little child, shall in no case enter therein.' Mr. Barnes, in his Notes on this
                     text says: 'Of such as these—that is, of persons with such tempers as these, is
                     the church to be composed. He does not say of those infants, but
                     of such as resembled them, or were like them in
                     temper, was the kingdom of heaven made up. It was proper, therefore, that he
                     should pray for them.'—Notes, in loc. Olshausen, of
                     whose Commentary, Kitto, a brother Pædobaptist of his and yours, declares that
                     it is, on the New Testament, the best now in existence. Olshausen says on this
                     text: 'For entering into the kingdom of God, there is enjoined that child-like
                     feeling which enables us most easily to discern the gifts which have been
                     bestowed upon each, and, consequently, puts us in circumstances to fulfill our
                     calling.' He goes on to say: 'Of that reference to infant baptism, which it is
                     so common to seek for in this passage, there is clearly not the slightest
                        trace to be found.' And Bishop Taylor, another eminent Pædobaptist, says, in substance, that 'to rely
                     upon this text, as proof of infant baptism, proves nothing so much as the want
                     of a better argument.'"
                  "I think, Mr. Johnson," said Professor Jones, "that we had better, for the
                     present, at least, let this passage stand aside. It certainly gives no
                        direct testimony in our favor, and even the inferential is
                     somewhat doubtful. We can afford to let it go, as you know we have many others,
                     about the meaning of which there can be no question. Let us take this, for
                     instance, Acts 11: 38, 39: 'Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the
                     name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins. And ye shall receive the gift
                     of the Holy Ghost, for the promise is unto you and to your
                        children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our
                     God shall call.' Here, most undoubtedly, the parents and children are both
                     included, and that so expressly and plainly as to leave no room for even the
                     shadow of a doubt."
                  "That is, indeed," replied Mr. Johnson, "one of the strongest passages, if it
                     be not the very strongest that we have."
                  "And yet," said Mr. Courtney, "it has not, in fact, the very slightest
                        value in favor of your faith or practice; but, on the contrary,
                     furnishes at least a very strong inference against them, for if
                     infant baptism was either recognized or practiced, it is incredible that Peter
                     should not have said 'be baptized,' not only 'every one of you,' but you and
                     your children. All that is said of baptism, is only to those who are commanded
                     to repent. Those who are commanded to be baptized, are first
                     commanded to repent; and none are to be baptized, but those who
                        have repented—not the penitents and their
                     children."
                  "True," Mr. Courtney, "but you forget the last part of the text: 'the promise
                     is to you and your children.'"
                  "The promise of what? Mr. Johnson. What promise is Peter speaking of? Evidently
                     that in the Prophet Joel: 'It shall come to pass in the last days I will pour
                     out my Spirit,' &c. On the faith of this promise, Peter says: 'Repent and
                     be baptized, every one of you, and you shall receive the Holy Ghost. For this
                     promise (that is, of the Holy Ghost) is unto you and to your children, and to
                     all that are afar off,' &c. It was no promise of baptism, but the promise
                     of something that should follow their repentance and baptism. But
                     even if the promise did refer to baptism, the subjects of it were
                     not infants, for its application is expressly limited to those who
                     can be called into the repentance and faith of the Gospel: 'Even
                     as many as the Lord our God shall call,' (and no more.) Does God
                     call little unconscious infants? If not, then they not the persons spoken
                     of."
                  "What, then, do you think is the meaning of the word children?"
                  "Simply their descendants. In the next chapter, Peter says to these same
                     people, who were all grown men and women: 'Ye are the
                        children of the prophets.' And nothing is more common in the
                     Scriptures than to speak of the Jewish nation as children of
                     Israel. They were not a nation of babies, nevertheless.
                  "But even granting, for the sake of argument, that it was little
                     children—infants—that were spoken of, then, if they were to be
                        baptized without repentance and faith in Christ, so also are
                     all the aliens and idolators among the Gentiles, for they are included in the
                     term 'all that are afar off.' And there is the same authority to baptize these
                     as the children. They are equally included in the 'promise:' 'You and your
                     children, and all that are afar off.' Unless you will admit the
                     promise thus to embrace 'all the world, and the rest of mankind, you must limit
                     it, as Peter did, by confining it to
                     those 'of you,' and of 'your children,' and of the Gentiles, whom the
                        Lord our God shall call. If, therefore, this is the strongest, or one
                     of the strongest passages you have, your case is a desperate one indeed. The
                     text contains a command and a promise. It commands men first to
                        repent, and then to be baptized—just as Jesus commands them
                        first to believe, and then to be baptized. And, of
                     course, unless unconscious infants can repent and believe, they cannot be
                     baptized. Then it promises the 'Gift of the Holy Ghost' to those who
                        have thus repented and been baptized:
                     for Peter makes this the condition of their receiving it: 'Repent and be
                     baptized, and ye shall receive the gift.' And as they might
                     receive the gift of the Spirit on these terms, viz., baptism and
                     repentance, so might their descendants, and so might even the
                     idolatrous Gentiles, who were now afar off—even as many of them as
                     the Lord our God should call."
                  "That is indeed entirely satisfactory," said Professor Jones, "and I am only
                     surprised that I did not see it in that light before. But the truth is, because
                     I saw baptized, in one part of the passage, and children in
                     another part, I took it for granted (since it was one of the proof-texts quoted
                     in our confession of faith) that it was the children who were to
                     be baptized. I see now that it was only those who repented; and I am ready
                     candidly to acknowledge, that there is no authority for infant baptism in
                        this text, but there are surely many others."
                  "Oh, yes," said Mr. Courtney, "you know 'the New Testament abounds
                     with proof of infant baptism.' And if you will turn to 1st Cor. 7: 14, you will
                     find one which has been relied upon even more confidently than the one we have
                     just disposed of: 'For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and
                     the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband band; else were your children
                     unclean, but now are they holy.'"
                  "Well, I should like to see how you will set aside a passage so plain and
                     appropriate as that is," said Mr. Johnson.
                  "I simply say," rejoined Mr. Courtney, "that there is not one word
                     in it about baptism, either of infants or adults. It has not only no mention of
                     baptism, but not even the most distant allusion to it, direct or
                     indirect."
                  "Why, sir, does it not say that the children of but one believing parent are
                        holy, and if they are holy, are they not fit
                     subjects for baptism?"
                  "You know," replied Mr. Courtney, "that the words holy and
                        sanctified, among the Jews, were used in a physical or
                     ceremonial sense, as well as in a moral sense. If the apostle used them here in
                     a moral sense, he stated what was not true, for in
                     this sense the infidel husband, or the infidel wife, was not made
                        holy by the other's faith. The faith of the husband did not make a
                        saint of his wife, nor did the faith of the wife make a
                        saint of her idolatrous husband. They might have been, and
                     doubtless often were more sinful afterwards than before the other party was
                     converted. Nor does the faith of both parents combined render their
                        children holy, in this sense of the word: for you know, and every
                     other man knows, that the children of believers grow up in sin, and need
                        be converted, just as much as the children of unbelievers; and
                     without such conversion, will just as surely be lost as the children of the
                     vilest. Did David's faith take the incestuous Ammon and murderous Absalom to
                     heaven? You and your wives are both believers: are your children
                     in this sense, holier than other children? Do you not daily pray for God's
                     converting grace to make them holy? It is evident, therefore, that
                     the words sanctified and holy (which are equivalent terms) must here be
                     understood in their other sense. The
                     expression is indeed one of the
                     Hebraisms in which Paul abounds. Its real meaning is very clearly
                     stated by one of your best Presbyterian Commentators, Dr. McKnight—for more
                     than twenty years the Moderator of the Presbyterian General Assembly of
                     Scotland:
                  "'I think, therefore.' says he, 'with Elsner, that the words in this verse have
                     neither a federal nor a moral meaning, but are used in the idiom of the
                     Hebrews, who by sanctified understood what was fitted for a
                     particular use, and by unclean what was unfit for use, and
                     therefore was to be cast away. In that sense the Apostle, speaking of
                        meat, says, 1 Tim. 4: 5, It is sanctified (that
                     is, fitted for your use,) by the word of God and prayer. Ver. 4:
                        Every creature of God (fit for food) is good, and
                        nothing fit for food is to be cast away as unclean. The
                     terms of the verses, thus understood, have a rational meaning,
                     namely, that when infidels are married to Christians, if they have a strong
                     affection for their Christian spouses, they are thereby sanctified
                     to them—they are fitted to continue married to them; because their affection to
                     the Christian party will insure to that party the faithful performance of every
                     duty; and that if the marriages of Christians and infidels were dissolved, they
                     would cast away their children as unclean,—that is, by losing
                     their affection for them, they would expose them, after the barbarous custom of
                     the Greeks, or at least neglect their education; but by continuing their
                     marriages, their children are holy, they are preserved as sacred
                     pledges of their mutual love, and educated with care.'
                  "Hence he thus paraphrases the text:—'For the infidel husband is sanctified—is
                     fitted to remain married to the believing wife by his affection for her; and
                     the infidel wife is sanctified to the believing husband by her affection for
                     him; otherwise certainly your children would be by you neglected as unclean,
                     whereas indeed they are clean; they are the objects of your affection and
                     care.'"
                  "I do not know," said Mr. Johnson, "that we are bound to admit Dr. McKnight's
                     exposition of this passage, merely because he was a Presbyterian."
                  "Certainly not; but one would naturally suppose that if there were any infant
                     baptism in the passage, a learned and eminent Presbyterian Doctor of Divinity
                     would be the man to find it. Perhaps you can show it to be there
                     though he could not."
                  "I do not say, Mr. Courtney, that infant baptism is commanded in
                     this passage, but only that it is recognized.—These children were
                     not morally holy—that is self-evident. Yet they are called
                        ('agia') holy, by the same term which is
                     sometimes used to designate the saints, that is, the members of
                     the church. Therefore they must have been church members; and as none were
                     church members but those who had been baptized, it follows that
                     they must have been baptized. That is what I call a demonstration."
                  "And if it be so," replied Mr. Courtney, "then the infidel wife and the infidel
                     husband had also been baptized, and were members of the church, for they are
                     called (hagiarai) 'sanctified,' the same term
                     which in this same epistle, 1st chapter and 2d verse, is applied to the members
                     of the church: 'To them that are sanctified in Jesus Christ,
                     called to be saints,' &c. And again in the 6th chapter and
                     11th verse, 'But ye are washed, ye are sanctified; but ye are
                     justified in Christ,' &c. These sanctified ones called to be
                     saints, and these sanctified ones who were washed and justified in
                     Christ, were most undoubtedly members of the Corinthian Church. It was as such
                     that Paul addressed them; and as the same term (sanctified) is
                     applied to the infidel and idolatrous husband and wife who had a believing
                     companion, it follows of course that
                     infidel and idolatrous as they were, they must have been members
                     of the church, and as none are church members but those who have been baptized,
                     they must certainly have been baptized. That is what I call, not a
                     demonstration, but a palpable absurdity: yet it stands precisely
                     upon the same ground with your demonstration."
                  "We must give it up, Mr. Johnson," said the Professor, "at least so far as this
                     text is concerned, for if it proves any thing, it proves too much.
                     It will be better for us to give up the children than to take the unbelieving
                     and idolatrous adults. If we ground our practice of baptizing infants on
                        this passage, we must baptize the unbelieving wife
                     on the faith of her husband, and the unbelieving husband on the faith of his
                     wife, as well as their children on the faith of either. This we have never
                     done, and would not dare to do, so we must look for some other passage to
                     sustain our views."
                  "Not quite yet," said Mr. Courtney, smiling, "I have wrested this weapon out of
                     your hands, and I will now turn it against you.
                  "I will prove, by this very passage, that there was no such thing
                     as infant baptism known in the Corinthian church, or in the mind of Paul, when
                     he was writing to them, but that, on the contrary, the Corinthian, and, of
                     course, all the other churches of that day, were Baptist churches,
                     in which neither the children, nor the unbelieving companions of
                     believers, were baptized, or in any sense regarded as church members. If the
                     unbelieving husband or wife had been baptized, and made a member of the church,
                     the question to which the Apostle is evidently replying, could never have been
                     asked. The Jews, as we learn from Ezra 10:3, were not permitted to continue in
                     the marriage relation with their Gentile wives. Now the question had come up in
                     the Corinthian church, whether a Christian should not, under a
                     similar regulation, separate from an unbelieving and idolatrous companion. But
                     if such unbelieving consorts were by the other's faith entitled to church
                        membership, and had, consequently, been baptized, such a thing as
                     separation on this ground would never have been thought of. It is evident,
                     therefore, that the infidel husband or the infidel wife were not baptized, or
                     made church members. There is in the Scriptures not the slightest allusion to
                     any such church members made by the faith of others,
                     and not by their own. These persons were, therefore, in every sense, outsiders.
                     They had no more connection with the church than any other heathens had. But
                     the Apostle says to their Christian companions, You have no more reason to
                     discard them on this account than church members have to discard their
                        children, for they are also unbelievers, and without the pale of the
                     church. The unbelieving husband and the unbelieving wife, and your
                     children, not their children, stand in the same category. They are
                        all without the church—all unbaptized—and thus far, all equally
                     unfit associates. But as your children, though not in the church, are
                        holy to you, that is, fit to associate with, so is the
                     unbelieving husband or the unbelieving wife, although they are also out of the
                     church.
                  "That this is the sense in which the Apostle uses the terms sanctified, and
                     holy, and unclean, is evident from the fact, that this is the only
                     sense in which what he says of the parties can be true, and this
                     sense corresponds perfectly with the common Scripture usage of the words. Those
                     things and persons among the Jews were called unclean which a holy
                     person might not lawfully touch, use, or associate with. It seems from Gal. 2:
                     12, that they considered it very criminal to associate or eat with Gentiles.
                     Peter, it seems, had the opinion that only certain food was fit to
                     eat, and that all other was unclean. And he said: 'Lord,
                     nothing common mon or
                        unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth. And Paul, 2
                     Cor. 6: 17, says, quoting from Isaiah: 'Come out from among them, and be ye
                     separate, and touch not the unclean thing,' or, more properly, 'touch no
                     unclean person,' 'and I will receive you,' &c. Things unfit for holy
                     persons to use were, therefore, to them said to be unclean. Food
                     which such persons might not eat, was called unclean food. And persons which
                     they might not associate with, were called unclean persons. In this sense,
                     therefore, neither the unbelieving children, nor the unbelieving husband, nor
                     the unbelieving wife, were to be regarded as unclean. They were all equally
                     sanctified—fit for the companionship and affection of their believing parents
                     and consorts."
                  "That is all plain enough, Mr. Courtney, but I do not see what it has to do
                     with infant baptism."
                  "Simply this. The infidel consorts of believers were not church members—they
                     had not been baptized. When Paul was asked by the church, if the believing
                     husbands and wives must separate from such, he says no, it is as lawful for
                     them to live together as it is for you to live with your
                        children. But your children are holy [fit
                     associates] to you, and so their companions are sanctified [fit
                     associates] to them. Now there was no force or propriety in the
                     comparison, unless the children were in circumstances similar to the
                     unbelieving consorts—that is, they must all have been alike out of
                     the church, and all unbaptized; and if the children of believing
                     parents were unbaptized, it was a Baptist church; and if the church at Corinth
                     was a Baptist church, then all the churches planted by the Apostles were
                     Baptist churches."
                  "I do not feel inclined to grant all that," said Mr. Johnson, "but we have
                     wasted too much time on this text already; let us proceed. But I see it is of
                     no use to argue with you, for you are disposed to construe every passage so
                     differently from what we have been accustomed to consider their true meaning,
                     that the most conclusive texts have no weight with you whatever."
                  "But pardon me, Mr. Johnson, do I not construe them according to the natural
                     and necessary meaning of the language? I appeal to Professor Jones to say if I
                     have shown any disposition to present any other than the straightforward and
                     obvious sense of the passages which we have examined."
                  "I begin to think," rejoined the pastor, "that my brother Jones is himself more
                     than half a Baptist, which accounts for his being so easily convinced."
                  "Not at all, Mr. Johnson. I was very desirous to find infant baptism in the
                     Scriptures; I confidently believed it was there; I expected we could have
                     pointed to it without the slightest difficulty; but I acknowledge that I can't
                     see the slightest trace of it in these proof texts which our church has been so
                     accustomed to rely upon. But though we have no command to practice
                     it, we have authority which is quite equivalent, and that is the
                        practice of the Apostles."
                  "Certainly," said Mr. Johnson, "I did not expect to find any such absolute
                     command as could not be explained away. It is chiefly on the examples that we
                     rely."
                  "I hope, Mr. Johnson, you will do me the justice to acknowledge that I have not
                     explained away any command to baptize infants. I am sure I would not willingly
                     even attempt to explain away any command of Jesus Christ, or his Apostles, on
                     this or any other subject. I asked you to show me a command
                     to baptize infants, and you pointed to the
                        commission as a command to baptize those who are the
                        believing disciples of Jesus. You pointed, then, to an
                     incidental command, to let the children come to Christ, that he might lay his
                     hands on them and bless them. But as the children were not in the other
                     command, so the baptism was not in
                     this. It was not for baptism, but for quite another purpose that he bade them
                     to come. You pointed then to a command and promise given through Peter, but the
                     command was Repent and then be baptized, which, of
                     course, excluded infants. And the promise was not a promise of
                        baptism, but of the gift of the Holy Ghost to those whom
                        God should call to repentance, faith and baptism, which
                     excluded infants from the promise as well as the command. You then pointed to
                     the place which we have last examined, which certainly contains not even the
                     shadow of a command to baptize infants; and so far as it teaches anything upon
                     the subject, teaches that they were no more to be baptized on the faith of
                     their parents than unbelieving husbands are upon the faith of their wives. If
                     you have not found the commandment, because it is not there, I do not like to
                     discourage you, but I assure you, you cannot find the example for
                     the very same reason. This has been conceded, over and over again, by the most
                     learned and most zealous advocates of infant baptism. They rest it on different
                     grounds.
                  "Dr. Wall, the most eminent of them all, distinctly declares: 'Among all the
                     persons that are recorded as baptized by the Apostles, there is no express
                     mention of any infants.'
                  "Bishop Burnet says: 'There is no express precept or rule given in the New
                     Testament for the baptism of infants.'
                  "Richard Baxter says: 'I conclude that all the examples of baptism in the
                     Scripture do mention only the administration of it to the professors of saving
                     faith; and the precepts give no other direction.'
                  "Martin Luther, the great reformer, says: 'It cannot be proved that infant
                     baptism was instituted by Christ, or by the first Christians after the
                     Apostles.'
                  'Erasmus, another of the Reformers, says in his Notes on Rom. 6: 14: 'The
                     Apostle does not seem to treat of infants. It was not the custom
                     for infants to be baptized.'
                  "Olshausen, the famous Pædobaptist commentator, says: 'there is altogether
                     wanting any conclusive proof passage for the baptism of children in the age of
                     the Apostles, nor can the necessity of it be deduced from the nature of
                     baptism.'
                  "Limbroch, another distinguished Pædobaptist professor of theology, and the
                     author of a 'System of Divinity,' says: 'There is no express command for it in
                     the Scriptures. Nay, all those passages wherein baptism is commanded, do
                     immediately relate to adult persons, since they are ordered to be
                     instructed, and faith is a pre-requisite as a necessary qualification.' And
                     again: 'The necessity of infant baptism was never asserted by any council
                     before that of Carthage, held A. D. 418. We own that there is no precept nor
                     undoubted instance in Scripture, of infant baptism.'
                  "Dr. Hanna, editor of the North British Review, says: 'The baptismal service
                     [of the English church] is founded upon Scripture, but its application to
                     unconscious infants is destitute of any express Scriptural warrant. Scripture
                     knows nothing of the baptism of infants.'
                  "Dr. Knapp says: 'There is no decisive example of infant baptism in the
                     Scriptures.'
                  "Neander, the great Pædobaptist historian, says: 'It is certain
                     that Christ did not ordain infant baptism.'
                  "Even your Presbyterian Doctor Miller, of Princeton Theological Seminary, says:
                     'The fact is, that during the whole three score years after the ascension of
                     Christ, which is embraced in the New Testament history, we have no hint of the
                     baptism of infants born of Christian parents.'
                  "So says your able defender, Professor Moses Stuart. 'Commands, or plain and
                     certain examples relative to it in the New Testament, I do not find.'
                  
                  "So says also your other celebrated writer on this subject, Dr. Leonard Woods:
                     'The New Testament is silent respecting the subject of infant baptism.' 'It is
                     evident that infant baptism is not introduced as a subject of particular
                     discussion. It is neither explicitly enjoined or prohibited, and neither is the
                     practice of baptizing children, nor the absence of it, expressly
                     mentioned.'"
                  "I declare, Mr. Courtney," said the Professor, "this is very discouraging. If
                     such men as these, all of whom are on our side of this controversy, and all
                     members of churches, that are in the habit of baptizing infants, most, if not
                     all of whom, received their own baptism in infancy, many of whom were eminent
                     ministers, and in the habit themselves of baptizing infants, and some of the
                     most eminent of whom were authors, who, like Stuart, and Miller,
                     and Wood, wrote expressly upon this subject—if such men cannot find the
                     'command,' or the 'example,' it seems hardly worth while for us to
                     look for it."
                  "I do not know," said Mr. Johnson, "what they considered a plain command or an
                     undoubted example, but I conceive that these statements which Mr. Courtney has
                     quoted so glibly, were (to say the least) very 'unguarded
                        expressions,' which were by no means justified from the facts in the
                     case. I grant that there is no express command, but there are many
                     examples, which, if not plain enough to satisfy Baptists, are such
                     as will justify any candid enquirer after the truth."
                  "I only ask you, gentlemen," said Mr. Courtney, "to show me one
                     which you will YOURSELVES say is an undoubted case, after we have
                     examined the testimony. I only ask you to show me one which your
                     own theological writers and teachers will agree upon as an undoubted case—or
                     one which they will all agree upon as even a probable case. I do
                     not wish to dissuade you from the attempt but you could not find one
                        single, solitary instance if your very lives depended on the
                     effort."
                  "Certainly, Mr. Courtney," said the pastor, "you are speaking without due
                     reflection, for you must know perfectly well that such examples are as numerous
                     as the household baptisms recorded in the Acts or referred to in the
                     Epistles."
                  "Not at all," said Mr. Courtney. "I understand what I am saying, and I desire
                     to be distinctly understood to mean that as there is not (as we have already
                     seen) any command, so neither is there a solitary
                        example either among the 'households' or any where
                        else, in which baptism was administered either to an infant or to any
                     one else who did not first profess faith or repentance. From the first of
                     Matthew to the end of Revelations, you may examine every passage in which
                     baptism is mentioned or alluded to, and you not only will find no infant
                     plainly spoken of as baptized, but you will not find so much as an allusion to
                     any such a class as the 'Baptized children of the church.'"
                  "Surely," replied Professor Jones, "you must be mistaken in this. I am sure I
                     have always thought that there was no more doubt about the Scriptures teaching
                     infant baptism, than about their teaching the divinity of Jesus Christ. I am
                     certain it must be somewhere in the Scriptures."
                  "Many people are certain that things are in the Scriptures that neither they
                     nor any body else can find there," said Mr. Courtney. "Your Doctors of Divinity
                     have told you it was there, and you took it for granted that they told you the
                     truth. But if it is there, you can find it and show
                     it to me. And ever afterwards you will know how to give a reason
                     for the faith that is in you on this subject."
                  "But, Mr Courtney, we have not time to read over the whole Bible to-night, to see if there is not
                     some case mentioned; and if we do not, we may overlook some case."
                  "That is not necessary. Your Doctors of Divinity have done it for you; and if
                     they have found any case that had even the remotest squinting towards infant
                     baptism, they have paraded it before the world. Your pastor here is doubtless
                     perfectly familiar with every case that has the slightest bearing upon the
                     subject, and which presents even the shadow of a proof in favor of the practice
                     of your churches. But if you doubt his information, or if he is unwilling to
                     trust to his memory in the case, suppose you take a Concordance, and refer to
                        every place where baptism is mentioned. Here is Butterworth's
                     Concordance. It will doubtless mention every place where the words occur; and
                     we can thus test the matter at once."
                  "Certainly," said the pastor. "I greatly prefer that to a reliance upon my own
                     memory, for though I can without any hesitation refer you to several examples,
                     as in the case of Lydia and the Jailor, and Stephanus and Cornelius, yet as I
                     might forget some place, I would leave our defence less perfect than I
                     desire."
                  "We will then work by the Concordance, and will come to each of those cases in
                     their proper order," said the Professor.
                  "Very good," said the schoolmaster. "Now what is the first place?"
                  "It is," said the pastor, "Matthew 3: 7—'John saw many of the Pharisees and
                     Sadducees come to his baptism.' We must admit there were no infants there, but
                     then you know we do not consider John's baptism to be Christian baptism, which
                     was not practiced till after the death of Christ; and so it does not matter who
                     John baptized, or what class of persons were baptized before the ascension of
                     the Saviour, as it was only then that Christian baptism, properly
                     so called, began to be administered. I am willing to grant, therefore, that
                     there was no mention made of the baptism of any infant until after that
                     time."
                  "That will," said Mr. Courtney, "save us considerable trouble—but it will
                     deprive me of the advantage of at least one very convincing argument against
                     any inference for infant baptism. I think I could easily prove to you that not
                     only John's baptism, but Christ's baptism (I mean that which is called
                        his, though John says Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)
                     was just the same baptism which He commanded after his death—and
                     that since John required repentance and works meet for repentance as
                     preliminary to his baptism, and Christ is expressly said to have
                     first made disciples of those whom he baptized, (John
                     4: 1,) unconscious infants were of necessity excluded, and would be, as a
                     matter of course, considered as excluded until an express command
                     was given to include them. But we will pass it by, and the first case of
                     baptism that comes up after the commission, had, in your view, fully
                     established the Christian ordinance, was that on the day of Pentecost, Acts 2d
                     chapter. Suppose, Mr. Johnson, you just turn to the chapter, and see if you can
                     find any thing about infants there."
                  "Oh, no. We do not pretend," said the pastor, "that those three thousand were
                     any of them infants, or even children. There were evidently none among them who
                     could not understand the preaching of Peter and the rest, for they
                        gladly received his word (41st verse) before they were
                     baptized, and continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship
                     afterwards. They were all adults, and we must admit also that they were all
                     professed believers."
                  "Very well," said Mr. Courtney, "then we will go on to the next case—but I
                     cannot help remarking by the way that it is very extraordinary if they ever baptized
                     infants in those days—if they were considered as included in the
                     commission. I say it is very remarkable that all these three
                     thousand should have been old bachelors or old maids, or to say the least, all
                     unmarried, or if married, all childless. Yet such must have been the case, for
                     not a word is said about the duty of bringing their children for
                     baptism—nor among them all was there a single one who brought his little ones
                     that they might be baptized at the same time with his parent. I have been
                     present several times when a number of persons joined your
                     society, and there were always among them more or less who brought their
                     children with them. I do not suppose that you ever recorded in your church the
                     baptism of twenty adults, but that they brought some children with them yet you
                     pretend that the apostles practiced infant baptism as you do, and still admit
                     that here are three thousand adults and not a single child—but go on to your
                     next case."
                  "It is," said the pastor, who glanced at the Concordance, Acts 8: 12: "And when
                     they, (the people of Samaria,) believed Philip preaching the things concerning
                     the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized."
                  "It seems, then," said Mr. C, "that these were adults too; for they were able
                     to hear preaching, and exercise faith. They believed the preaching before they
                     were baptized, and none were baptized who did not first believe. But you did
                     not read all the verse: does it not go on to say, that they were baptized, both
                     the men, the women, and their children?"
                  "No," said Mr. Johnson, with a very perceptible degree of petulance in his
                     tone. "It only says, 'both men and women.'"
                  "So then here is another case, where a large company of men and women were
                     baptized, not one of whom were heads of families. It is very
                        remarkable, for if the apostles taught and practiced infant baptism,
                     Philip had doubtless instructed them that 'it was their duty and their
                        privilege' to bring their infant children into the kingdom with
                     themselves.—This is what you teach, and this is what your
                        converts do. If Philip taught as you do, his converts were a
                     'peculiar people' truly. But let us pass on to the next case, which was that of
                     Simon the Magician, in the next verse; but as you won't imagine any infant
                     baptism there, we may pass to the next."
                  "That was," said the pastor, "the case of the Ethiopian Eunuch (Acts 8: 13),
                     and the next that of Saul (Acts 9: 18), and the next that of Cornelius and his
                     friends, which I have sometimes considered as a case of household baptism; but
                     on examination I do not see that there is any mention of infants. (Acts 10:
                     47.)"
                  "Please read it, Mr. Johnson," said Professor Jones. "I have, I am sure, always
                     looked upon this as one of the proof passages."
                  "I had such an impression myself," said the pastor, "but I see it cannot be
                     relied upon. 'Can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized
                        who have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? And he
                     commanded them to be baptized.' Now it is true that Cornelius had a
                        family, and he had called together his kinsmen and near
                     friends; and it seems most likely that there would have been among
                     them some children, but still it does not seem absolutely certain. It is, I
                     should say, a probable case, but I do not present it as a certain
                     one."
                  "How can you, Mr. Johnson, I was ready to say, how
                        dare you as a minister of the Gospel of truth, even pretend
                     that there is any doubt about the case at all? Could little
                     infants, in their mothers' arms, 'receive the Holy Ghost,' and 'speak with
                     tongues,' and 'magnify God,' as these are said to have done in the 44th and 46th verses?
                     The persons, and the only persons who were commanded
                     to be baptized, were those who spake with tongues and magnified God. And it was
                     on this evidence, and only on this evidence, that 'God had granted repentance
                     unto the Gentiles,' that they were admitted to baptism at all. He who could see
                     a probable infant baptism in this, might see it just as well, it seems to me,
                     in the baptism of the three thousand who received the word with gladness, on
                     the day of Pentecost, or the five thousand who received it a few days after, or
                     in the case of the Samaritans who believed in the Gospel preached by Philip. If
                        they heard, repented, and believed, these did all
                     that and more, for they received the miraculous influences of the Holy Ghost
                        before their baptism, whereas the others received them
                        after it, when they received them at all. These did all that
                     those did, and moreover spake with tongues, and 'magnified God,' and yet
                        you talk about their being unconscious infants."
                  "Oh, well," said the pastor, "you have no need to become so eloquently
                     indignant. I said I was willing to pass by this case. I will admit that it is
                     not even a probable instance, if that will satisfy you. We shall
                     find certain ones enough, so we can afford to be liberal in this. You will not
                     be able, I trust, to dispose so easily of the next, which is the baptism of
                     Lydia, Acts 16 : 15—"And of 'her household,' which, as a matter of
                     course, would have some children in it."
                  "I do not see how Lydia's household should necessarily have children in it. I
                     am acquainted with several households in this town that have no infants in
                     them. You have none in yours. You have children, but none too young to repent
                     and believe, make credible profession of their faith, and lead a Christian life
                     and if you should all be convinced in the revival, which I believe God is now
                     beginning to send upon our little Baptist church, that you have never been
                     baptized and should all give us satisfactory evidence of true piety, we would
                     gladly do for you just what Paul did for Lydia. We would baptize you and
                        your household, but you would not insist that we had baptized any
                     unconscious babe."
                  "But, Mr. Courtney, you must admit the principle that the 'households were
                     baptized on the faith of its head.' Lydia believed, and she
                        and her household were baptized. Now, whether they were large
                     or small, they must have been baptized on their mother's faith."
                  "No, Mr. Johnson; it is that principle which I especially condemn and deny.
                     What I say is this—No one under the Gospel is to be baptized, or to be regarded
                     as in any sense a member of Christ's church, or to enjoy any of
                     the privileges of that church, who has not first repented and believed
                        for himself, and in his own proper person: and if you will
                        show me any case where any one, either old or
                     young, male or female, bond or free, adult or infant, was by the apostles
                     baptized, who had not first given evidence of his repentance, faith, and
                     conversion, then I admit you have gained your point. I grant that Simon Magus
                     was baptized while yet unconverted, but not before he professed to
                        be, and gave such evidence as was satisfactory at the time. For Luke
                     says Simon also believed and was baptized. Now Lydia was baptized
                     and her household was baptized; but there is no evidence that her household
                     were children. There is no proof even that she was married, or ever had been.
                     She may or may not have had a husband—she may or may not have had children; she
                     may have been a widow, or she may have been an old maid. The record says not a
                     word on these points. It only says that her name was Lydia—that she came from a
                     distant city, called Thyatira—that she was engaged in the business of selling purple, which we know, from
                     other sources, was a very respectable and profitable employment. We learn also
                     that she was keeping house, and living in such a comfortable way that she could
                     afford to give the Apostle and his companions a home at her house during their
                     stay. It appears also that she had a family, (oikos), but whether they were children or servants, or both, is
                     not declared; but one thing is certain, whether they were her
                     offspring or servants, they were grown men, for in the end of this
                     same chapter (verse 40) we read that as soon as Paul and Silas were liberated
                     they returned to the house of Lydia and saw the brethren and comforted
                        them. They were therefore men, who could be comforted,
                     and not little children. They were also believers, for otherwise
                     they would not be called brethren.
                  "Hence the celebrated commentator, Dr. Adam Clarke, very properly remarks:
                        'She attended unto the things.' 'She believed them and received
                     them as the doctrines of God, and in this faith she was joined by her whole
                     family, and in it they were all baptized.' And again—'The first members of the
                     church of Christ, at this place, were Lydia and her family, and the next in all
                     probability were the Jailor and his family.'
                  "So far, therefore from being certain or even probable that the household of
                     Lydia were infants, it is placed past all doubt by the Scripture itself, that
                     they were men and brethren, who believed and were baptized, for
                     though their faith is not specially mentioned, yet it is
                     necessarily implied by the calling of them brethren."
                  "But is it certain, Mr. Courtney, that these brethren were the
                     same who composed Lydia's family? Might they not have come in there merely to
                     meet the Apostle?"
                  "No, Mr. Johnson, Lydia and her family were the only converts
                     until the Apostle was arrested and thrown into prison son. While there, the
                     Jailor and his family were converted, and these two families were all the
                     followers of Christ—all the brethren that were in the place. But
                     those at the Jailor's house, Paul and Silas had just left, when they came to
                     Lydia's house, and saw and comforted the brethren there."
                  "I think, Mr. Johnson," said Professor Jones, "that we may as well let this
                     case go. We can afford to do it, as we have so many others. And it evidently,
                     so far from aiding us, testifies directly against us. The same difficulties
                     cannot exist in that of the Jailor and his family recorded in the same chapter.
                     I have always heard that referred to as a most undoubted example."
                  "Yes," said the pastor. "The Jailor was a man in the prime of life, as is
                     evident from the impulsive character of his behavior. He drew his sword, called
                     for a light, and he sprang in, which indicates that he was a man
                     of activity and energy. Now such a man would be almost certain, if he had a
                     family at all, to have among them some little children. I consider, therefore,
                     that this is an unquestionable case. The evidence amounts almost to an absolute
                     demonstration."
                  "It is a great pity," said Mr. Courtney, "to spoil such a beautiful and perfect
                     demonstration; and if we had time, I would spare it for a few minutes that we
                     might at our leisure admire its beauty and its ingenuity. But as we probably
                     have several other places to examine, we cannot afford to trifle over this. You
                     read in verse 33, that he was baptized, he and all his
                     straightway." Now you say that 'all his' must include one or more
                     infants. I only reply that if so, they were infants who could hear
                     the preaching of the gospel, and could believe it and
                        rejoice in God. For, verse 32, Paul preached to
                     him and all his. And, in verse 34, he rejoiced, believing in God
                        with all his house. Now, there is not in the record the
                     slightest intimation that there was a child on the premises. There was a family,
                     but whether of adults or children, servants or relations, is not said; but it
                        is said, that they all heard the Word, all
                        believed, and all rejoiced, just as certainly as
                     they were all baptized. There is the same testimony of the
                     hearing, believing, and rejoicing, as of the baptism. The Baptists will baptize
                     all the children in town, if they will come to them believing and rejoicing in
                     God—not, however, on their parents' faith, but on their own. Your next case is
                     in the 18th chapter, is it not?"
                  "Yes," said the pastor, (glancing at the Concordance which he still held in his
                     hand,) "and the 8th verse. 'And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue,
                     believed on the Lord, with all his house. And many of the Corinthians hearing,
                     believed and were baptized.'"
                  "Does it not say that their children were baptized with them on the faith of
                     their parents?"
                  "I read the whole text," replied the pastor, gruffly.
                  "Then you must consider it a very remarkable text," said Mr.
                     Courtney, "for it declares that among these many Corinthians,
                     there was not a man or woman who had an unconverted child; for if there had
                     been one, it would, if Paul had taught as you do, have been
                     brought up for baptism. These early Christians were strange people. There were
                     three thousand of them at one time, five thousand a few days after in
                     Jerusalem, a great multitude in Samaria, and many more here in
                        Corinth—all childless; for it is incredible that if they
                        had children, and had been instructed that 'it was their duty
                        and their privilege' to have them baptized, that some of
                     them would not have done it. Nay, all of them must have done it,
                     or have stood in open disobedience to the requirements of the
                     Gospel. We read of their believing, of their rejoicing, of their breaking of
                     bread, of their assembling for worship, of their ministering to the saints—but
                     never a word of their bringing their little children to be baptized. They
                     evidently did not obey this command, if any such command was given them. And
                     there is never an intimation of any reproof of such inexcusable
                     disobedience."
                  "I must say, Mr. Courtney" rejoined the pastor, "that you are the most
                     unreasonable man I ever tried to argue with. I have given you at least, two
                     plain and unquestionable instances in which the families were baptized
                        with the parents, and yet you say that out of these eight or ten
                     thousand converts, there is not one who had his children baptized.
                     To use an expression of your own, I do not see how you can dare
                     thus to trifle with the Word of God!"
                  "I know, Mr. Johnson, that you gave us cases where families were
                     baptized, and you can give us more; but you have not shown that these
                        families contained a single infant child, and that is the
                        point on which the whole argument turns — I reply to you in the
                     language of your own Pædobaptist historian, the celebrated and acute Neander:
                     'We cannot prove that the Apostles ordained infant baptism, from those places
                     where the baptism of a whole family is mentioned, as in Acts 16 : 33; 1 Cor. 1
                     : 16. We can draw no such conclusion, because the inquiry is still to be made
                        whether there were in these families any children of such an age that
                        they were not capable of any intelligent reception of Christianity, for this
                        is the only point on which the case turns.' Ch. Hist. p. 198.
                  "I might retort by saying that you are exceedingly unreasonable in your mode of
                     argumentation. You say that the Apostles baptized infants. I ask you to
                        prove it. You reply by saying he baptized
                     families. Now if there was never a family without
                        infants, your argument would be complete. But your own family has no
                     infants in it. It consists of two grown sons, a daughter nearly grown, and a servant. My family has no infants in
                        it—it consists of myself, my wife, and my nephew, who
                     assists me in my school. The family of our friend Mrs. Ernest has no infants in
                     it. It consists of her daughter, Miss Theodosia, of her son Edwin, and her old
                     servant, Aunt Chloe. All of whom are old enough to believe and rejoice in God,
                     as the Jailor's family did. Should they all determine to obey the commandment
                     of Jesus Christ and be baptized according to the Gospel order, you can say of
                     her, as Luke does of the jailor and of Lydia—She was baptized, and her
                     household. You see, therefore, that if you would make your argument worth a
                     straw, you must go one step further, and prove that there was an
                        infant in the families. It will not do to say that it is
                        probable there was one. It is just as probable that there is
                     one in yours, or mine, or Mrs. Ernest's, yet you know there is none. You must,
                     if you build an argument on the infant as being there, first prove that
                        it was there. If you can't do this, the judgment goes against you of
                     course. I need not prove that it was not there. The burden of proof rests on
                     you. If you go into court and claim property as the heir of a certain woman's
                        child, you must prove that there was such a child.
                     If you should prove no more than that the woman was married and
                     kept house, and had been heard to speak of her family the Court
                     would laugh at you. That she was married, kept house, and had a family, you
                     would be told, was not the slightest legal proof that she had a
                        child. And this is the point on which your whole claim rests. Peter
                     had a family, though so far as we are informed it consisted only of his wife
                     and his wife's mother. And so Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, had a
                     family: who they were, we do not know; whether children, grand-children,
                     nephews, or servants. His father and mother, and the father and mother of his
                     wife, his own brothers and sisters, or the brothers and sisters of his wife his
                     clerks or apprentices, if they had lodged in his house and eaten of his table,
                     would have been called—his family, his house; but whosoever they
                     were, they 'all believed on the Lord,' and so were not unconscious
                     infants."
                  "Have we not some other case, Mr. Johnson?" enquired the Professor.
                  "There is only one other," replied the pastor; "and that is that of the family
                     of Stephanus, mentioned by Paul, 1 Cor. 1: 16—'I baptized also the household of
                     Stephanus.'"
                  "And that need not detain us long," said Mr. Courtney, "for your own
                     Presbyterian Doctor of Divinity, McKnight, in his excellent Commentary, says,
                     'The family of Stephanus seem all to have been adults when they
                     were baptized; for they are said, chap. 16: 15, to have devoted
                        themselves to the ministry of the saints.'
                  "We have now examined all your 'examples,' and the infants are not
                     yet discovered. Lydia's family are called 'brethren.' The Jailor's family are
                     said 'to believe and rejoice in God.' That of Crispus 'believed in the Lord.'
                     And that of Stephanus 'addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints.' And,
                     Cor. 16: 16, the church is directed to 'submit itself unto such.' You have not
                     only failed to prove that there were any infants, but I have proved, (though by
                     the rules of debate, I was under no obligation to do so,) that they were all
                     adults, or at least old enough to hear, believe, obey, and rejoice in the
                     Gospel. I leave it now for you to say yourselves, whether there is in any of
                     these instances, a single certain example of the baptism of an
                     unconscious infant?—
                  Mr. Courtney paused, but neither of the others felt disposed to answer; after
                     waiting a moment, he continued—
                  "But I am not willing to pass so readily from these passages. You are
                     accustomed, Mr. Johnson, and so are all your ministers, to present these as
                     proof-texts for infant baptism. You
                     will probably go and do it again, though I pray that God may give you a better
                     mind. They stand as proof-texts in your 'Confession of Faith,' and yet, in
                     truth, neither they nor you have ever believed them to be such, or
                     else you are more inconsistent in your conduct than sensible men are often
                     found to be.—"
                  "Why, sir, what do you mean? Do you intend to insinuate, sir, that we
                     Presbyterian ministers teach as God's truth what we do not believe?"
                  "I mean to say, Mr. Johnson, that you teach for God's truth what you do not
                        practice—and you know a good man's practice ought
                     to correspond to his belief. You teach that the families of
                     believers are to be baptized on the faith of the head of the
                        family. Out of the thousands and thousands of people who are recorded
                     as having believed and been baptized, you find three or four instances in which
                     a whole family believed, and were baptized at the same time, and they are
                     mentioned as a certain man and his family. Now you say if these three or four
                        families were baptized, all families of believers
                     are entitled to baptism. This is what your argument amounts to, if it has any
                     force at all. Now, in every one of these instances the whole
                        family, every member of it, is said to have been baptized."
                  "Very well," said Mr. Johnson, "so much the better for our cause—so much the
                     more likely that it included the infants."
                  "It may be so much the better for your cause, but it is so much
                     the worse for your consistency. You teach that all
                     the family were included in these baptisms, but you do not baptize all
                        the family. Are not my wife and my nephew members of my family—but
                     you would not on my faith baptize either of them. Is not old Aunt Chloe a
                     member of Mrs. Ernest's family? yet you never have baptized her, or urged on
                     Mrs. Ernest the duty of bringing her servant as well as her
                     children. Are not children of ten or twelve, or fifteen or twenty years of age,
                     as much members of the family as the baby is? If these passages
                     prove that one member of the family may be baptized on the faith
                     of the head, they prove equally that every other member may be; and your only
                     consistent ground is that occupied by Mr. Barnes in his Notes on 1 Cor. 1:
                     16—'Household (oikon): the house, the family.
                     The word comprises the whole family, including adults, domestics, slaves, and
                     children.'**'It was the custom doubtless for the Apostles to baptize the
                        entire household, whatever might be the age, including domestics,
                        slaves, and children. The head of a family gave up the entire
                        household to God.' If you and Dr. Barnes believe this,
                     you ought to practice it. If Paul baptized all the
                     children, and all the domestics, and all the slaves, and all the other members
                     of the family, of whatever age, you ought to do it too. You are
                     unworthy to have charge of a Christian church, if you do not, at least,
                        attempt to do it. You ought to urge upon your members the 'duty
                     and privilege' of bringing their slaves where they have them—their
                     menservants and their maidens—their domestics, male or female, 'of
                        whatever age,' and all their children, whether infant or adult, to be
                     baptized upon the faith of the head of the family. Nor do I see how you could
                     well omit the wife, for although Dr. Barnes has not included her,
                     she certainly belongs to the family as much as the 'domestics.' If
                     they refuse to perform this duty, which was thus enjoined, as you believe, by
                     the Apostles, you can not do less than call them to account for their neglect.
                     If they will still prove obstinate, you must exclude them as disobedient to one
                     of the 'undoubted' ordinances of the church of Christ. They are
                        certainly under as much obligations to bring all
                     as to bring the infants."
                  
                  "Yes," said the pastor, "but where they have come to years of discretion, we
                     think it best to leave them to come themselves, as an act of personal
                     obedience."
                  "But you have no right to leave them, even if you do think best.
                     Lydia did not, according to your account of the matter, leave hers to come when
                     they pleased. The Jailor did not leave his, he brought them all
                        straightway. If the head of the family is to have his
                        household baptized, on the authority of these examples, he is
                     not at liberty to leave them to come of themselves. It is his bounden duty to
                     exert all his authority as husband, father and master, to bring his whole
                     family at once to the baptismal basin,—and it is your bounden duty, as a
                     minister of Christ, if you believe such things, to urge the subject upon their
                     attention. Call upon them for the immediate performance of their obligations,
                     and it is the duty of the church to deal with those who neglect or refuse. But
                     this you never have done. There are none of your ministers who do it; and I
                     venture to say that Mr. Barnes himself has never done it. You never will
                     do—you, none of you, dare to do it. Your own consciences would recoil from the
                     introduction in this way of infidels, and blasphemers, and irreligious men and
                     women into the church of Christ on the faith of their father or master. As you
                     would be afraid to do it yourselves, you do not believe in your hearts that the
                     Apostles did it. It is altogether inconsistent with every thing we know of
                     their character, and the nature of the churches they established—and it would
                     therefore be fair to infer that these families which were baptized were
                     families of believers, even if they had not been called brethren in the case of
                     Lydia's, or said to believe and rejoice in God in the Jailor's—to speak with
                     tongues and glorify God in those of Cornelius—to believe in the Lord Jesus in
                     that of Crispus, and to give themselves to the Christian ministry in that of
                     Stephanus."
                  "I did not expect, when we commenced," replied Mr. Johnson, "to be able to
                     convince you of your errors in regard to this subject. I have often observed
                     that the more one reasons with a Baptist, the more firmly he fixes him in his
                     baptistical notions. I have, therefore, had no desire for any such controversy
                     as this. It was only to satisfy my friend and brother, Professor Jones, that I
                     engaged in it at all—and I must now beg leave to decline any further argument
                     upon the subject."
                  "Pardon me, Mr. Johnson, if in the heat of debate I have made use of any
                     expression that has seemed improper, or in any degree disrespectful to you—I
                     did not intend to do so, and regret most sincerely if my feelings have led me
                     to overstep the bounds of gentlemanly discussion."
                  "Oh, I do not," resumed the pastor, "decline further disputation on that
                     ground; though I might, I think, fairly complain of some of your expressions. I
                     merely do not wish to continue a discussion which is not likely to result in
                     any good."
                  "Permit me to suggest," said Professor Jones, "that if we leave off here, we
                     acknowledge ourselves to be completely routed, for it is certain that we have
                     not yet been able to produce a single undoubted precept or example of infant
                     baptism from the Scriptures. But since such men as Woods, and Wall, and
                     Stewart, and Coleman, and Neander, concede this, and yet are the firm advocates
                     of the baptism of infants, there must be some other ground on
                     which it can be sustained."
                  "That is true, sir," replied the pastor. "And I have purposely reserved our
                     strongest argument for the last. But, I am sure it will have no influence on Mr. Courtney, nor any other
                     Baptist."
                  "But, Mr. Johnson, it may have some effect on me. And I hope you
                     will do us the favor to present it for my benefit."
                  "We will not have time to-night," replied the other, "and for the present at
                     least, I am tired of the subject. Perhaps you will hear something at church
                     to-morrow that will satisfy your mind." And with this intimation the Rev.
                     gentleman took his leave and the parties separated.
               
               
                  THE DAY AFTER THE SEVENTH NIGHT.
                  THEODOSIA IS BAPTIZED ACCORDING TO THE COMMANDMENT, AND THE
                        EXAMPLE OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.
                  
                  THE DAY AFTER THE SEVENTH NIGHT.
                  WE left Theodosia in that most distressful condition, in which duty, struggling
                     with inclination, distracts and rends the mind with agonizing efforts to decide
                     one way or the other.
                  With her, this was not a slight or momentary strife. It was the terrible agony
                     of one who struggles for his very life. Dearer to her than life was Mr. Percy's
                     love; it was her first love; it was her only love; it was a pure and holy love;
                     it had been sanctioned by her mother's fond approval; it had been sanctified by
                     their formal espousals; the day had been set for the consummation of their
                     happiness; she had fully given up her whole heart to it; it was the great
                     controlling, soul-absorbing passion of her being; all the hopes of life were
                     centered here. To tear such love from out the heart, was to rend the heart
                     itself. Yet she felt it must be done; and God gave her strength to do it. All
                     day long, as we said, she had crouched at her mother's side, or followed her
                     like her shadow. She seemed to feel that something terrible impended her, and
                     that she was safer in her mother's presence. Not one word was spoken by either
                     of them on the one subject which occupied the minds of both. Mrs. Ernest
                     observed, that as the day advanced, her daughter's face became more natural in
                     its expression. The lines of agony began to disappear. The eyes no longer
                     looked so strange and restless; nor did they turn to her, as in the morning,
                     with that beseeching gaze of agony, which almost broke her heart. But still, she noticed that her lips
                     often moved, though she uttered no word; and when she spoke to her about the
                     business of the household, it was some time before she answered and then
                     slowly, and often in such a way as to show that she had not fully comprehended
                     her meaning. Her mind was evidently far away.
                  About three o'clock she laid down her worsted, and taking up the Testament
                     which lay upon her work-table, turned to the fourteenth chapter of Luke, and
                     read: "If any man come to me and hate not his father and mother, and wife and
                     children, and brethren and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my
                     disciple; and whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me, cannot be my
                     disciple. For which of you intending to build a tower sitteth not down first
                     and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it, lest haply
                     after he hath laid the foundation and is not able to finish it, all that behold
                     it begin to mock him, saying, This man began to build, but was not able to
                     finish. Or what king going to make war against another king, sitteth not down
                     first, and consulteth whether he be able, with ten thousand, to meet him that
                     cometh against him with twenty thousand? or else, while yet the other is a
                     great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace. So
                     likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot
                     be my disciple."
                  "Mother," said she, looking up, and speaking as though her mother had known
                     what she was reading, "you will not make it necessary for me to forsake
                        you too?"
                  "Why, what do you mean, my daughter?"
                  "Jesus says here, that if I do not forsake all for him, I cannot be his
                     disciple."
                  'Yes, my child, but that has nothing to do with baptism It means that you must
                     give up all to be religious."
                  "To be religious, mother, is to obey Jesus Christ. 'If ye love
                     me,' he says, 'keep my commandments.' One of the plainest and most positive of
                     those commandments is, 'Believe and be baptized.'
                     Baptism is commanded as much as faith. It makes, indeed, a part of the
                        same command. I trust I have believed; but I have never
                        been baptized. Even if the sprinkling which I received in my
                     childhood had been baptism, it was no act of mine. I have not
                     obeyed: I—must—do—it!" She pronounced these last four words
                     slowly, with a slight pause between each of them, as though each cost her heart
                     a pang to speak it, and yet it must be said.
                  "Well, my child, if you must you must."
                  "But, mother, you will not forbid me? You will not make it needful to disobey
                     you as well as to —" But she could not finish the sentence, and left her mother
                     to guess her meaning.
                  "No, my dear child, I will not absolutely forbid you. You know
                     what I think about these things. Baptism is not essential to salvation, and I
                     had much rather you would remain where you are. I cannot bear to see you
                     sacrifice all your prospects in life for a mere whim, for I don't see but what
                     one baptism is just as good as another. And if you were not in such distress, I
                     would certainly oppose you, but I see it would 
                        no
                        do
                      no good; and though it will mortify and distress me, I will not
                     forbid you. And if you are determined to do it at all hazards, and it will
                     relieve you of a single pang, I give you my consent."
                  "Thank you, mother! You do not know what a load you have taken off my heart."
                     And she buried her face in her mother's lap, and wept aloud for several
                     minutes. Then she arose, wiped her eyes, and went into her own room, and closed
                     the door.
                  
                  Shall we invisibly follow her there; see her on her bended knees pour out her
                     soul to God; hear her cry for help with those inarticulate groanings which the
                     Apostle speaks of; see the resolve take form and substance in her heart; see
                     her arise with that same strange calmness which we observed after she had
                     prayed the day she came up from witnessing the baptism in the river; see her
                     open her little writing-desk, and select a sheet of paper; take her pen and
                     write, "My Dear Mr. Percy;" then pause, lay down her pen, cover her face with
                     her hands, pressing upon her eye-balls, as if to shut out some terrible vision,
                     while a strong convulsive shudder quivers through her frame? It is past; she
                     uncovers her face; looks up beseechingly to heaven; composes herself; takes up
                     the pen, and writes as follows:
                  "I received yours on Friday evening. To say that its contents gave me
                        very great pain, would but feebly express the truth. I was not
                     only distressed, but most grievously disappointed; for I had supposed you were
                     as sincere and earnest in your desire to know and do your whole duty in regard
                     to this subject, as I was myself. Your letter undeceived me. I do not complain
                     of it. I am thankful for your expressions of interest in my welfare, and of
                     affection for myself. I will not deny that I had no higher ambition, so far as
                     this world is concerned, than to secure your approbation. But I cannot,
                        even to please you, venture to disobey my Saviour. I intend to
                     be baptized to-morrow. I am aware, after what you have said, that by doing so,
                     I shall not only 'mortify and distress' you, but I shall renounce all claim to
                     your love. When you return, therefore, I shall be to you but as one dead. I
                     pray you so to consider me, it will be better for us both. And if you will
                     spare me further pain, I do entreat you never to solicit a renewal of our
                     engagement. It will not give you as much pain to read this as it does me to
                     write it; but I have weighed it well. I say every word deliberately, though
                     sorrowfully. I will not cease to pray for you. And will you not sometimes pray
                     for her who was your THEODOSIA?"
                  This letter she folded, enclosed, sealed, and directed to Mr. Percy's lodging
                     place, and called the old servant, Aunt Chloe, and directed her to take and
                     leave it there.
                  This done, she returned to her mother, with something almost like a smile of
                     joy upon her face. The peace of God was in her heart; and if she was not
                        happy, she was no longer wretched. With a low, but calm and
                     almost cheerful voice, she told her mother what she had done, and asked her to
                     make suitable preparation for her baptism. At night, she sent a line to uncle
                     Jones, requesting him, if he could, to be present, and another to Mr. Courtney,
                     announcing her intention to ask for baptism. She spent most of the time in her
                     own room, alone, until the hour of rest, and then slept sweetly till morning.
                     When she awoke, her first thought was expressed in the language of the
                     Psalmist—"I laid me down and slept; and I awoke again, for the Lord preserved
                     me." She felt now that she was, in a peculiar sense, in the care of God. She
                     had given all, and had obtained all. She had given up self and obtained Jesus
                     in all his fullness, and God in all his boundless power and love. Jesus was
                        her Saviour; God was her God. Yes, the mighty
                     Maker of the worlds, the omnipotent Ruler of the universe, was not only her
                        God, but her Father. She felt this morning that
                     she might ask what she would. And yet such was the overwhelming conviction in
                     her heart, that her loving Saviour and her kind Father knew so infinitely
                     better than herself what she most needed, and what would be really best,
                        that she could only pray: "'Thy
                     will be done. I leave it all with thee. Do what thou seest best. Give joy or
                     sorrow; give comfort or affliction; give life or death. Thou knowest best; thou
                     dost all things well. I trust myself; my soul and body; my happiness here and
                     hereafter; all I am—all I have; all I feared, all I hoped for; I give all up to
                     thee. Thou only art my portion now; and I am thine—all thine! I
                        delight to do thy will, oh, my Beloved! I have now no other
                     love but thee, my Saviour, my Father, my Friend.—Thou art my all—Jesus is mine,
                     and I am his. What can I want beside? Blessed Saviour, may I never leave thee!
                     May I never grieve thee any more! Lord, thou knowest all things. Thou knowest
                     that I love thee. Yes, I love thee, and I will keep all thy
                     commandments. Show me thy ways. Thou shalt guide me by thy counsels, and
                     afterwards receive me into thy glory. Yes, me—even me, poor, lost, rebellious
                     sinner that I am. Thou wilt love me freely. Thou wilt save me through thine own
                     infinite mercy. Mercy, all mercy! Not for works of righteousness which we have
                     done, but of his own mercy, he saves us. Jesus, I thank thee! Oh, make me love
                     thee more!"
                  With such incoherent ejaculations of trust, and praise, and prayer, she rose,
                     and prepared for church.
                  It was strange how the news had got abroad, yet it had spread like wild-fire
                     through the town, that Miss Theodosia Ernest would that morning apply for
                     baptism. At an early hour the school-house was crowded to its utmost capacity
                     and before the services commenced, even the windows and the doors, and every
                     place was occupied from which one could hope to catch a glimpse at what was
                     going on within, or hear a word of what was said.
                  The church bells began to ring. Mrs. Ernest had all the morning been distracted
                     between affection for her lovely child which prompted her to go to the
                     school-house, and pride which urged her to go and sit in her own pew as though
                     nothing had happened. Curiosity to see and hear what Theodosia would do and
                     say, and what sort of people these Baptists were, joined with affection in
                     pleading for the schoolhouse—and a sort of indefinite dread of what Mr.
                        Johnson might say came to the help of pride. And, it may be, there
                     was something like a mistaken sense of religious duty which spake on that side
                     also. However this may be, the first few strokes of the costly and
                     solemn-sounding bell which had been accustomed to call her to church seemed
                     suddenly to decide her.
                  "I want you to understand, Theodosia," said she, "that though I do not forbid,
                     yet I do not altogether approve of what you are about to do, and I cannot
                     sanction any such proceedings by my presence. I don't know what Mr. Johnson
                     would think of me, if I should forsake our own dear church to wander about
                     after these new comers."
                  This was a new disappointment to the sensitive child. She had greatly relied on
                     her mother's presence to sustain her in the untried scenes through which she
                     was about to pass. She had also hoped that uncle Jones would call and go with
                     her, but he had not come, and she was alone. Yet she was not
                        alone, for she looked up as her mother was speaking, and in her heart
                     said again, "Not my will, but thine be done!"—And the Spirit replied, "Fear
                     not, for I am with thee; and be not dismayed, for I am thy God!"
                     "When my father and my mother forsake me the Lord will take me up."
                  I do not say that she felt no natural misgivings, no modest shrinking from
                     going alone into a house filled with strangers, with the consciousness that
                     every eye was on her, and every heart full of curiosity to see how she would
                     look, what she would do, and what she would say; but she thought much less of
                     this than my reader would naturally suppose. The peace of God was in her heart, and it gave to
                     her mind and her manner a quiet yet determined calmness, and a collectedness of
                     thought and perfect self-possession which was surprising even to herself.
                  She set out therefore alone; for Edwin had not returned from
                     Sabbath-school. Two or three times the mother turned and looked after her as
                     she went, and wished she could consistently, and without
                     displeasing Mr. Johnson, have gone with the dear child.
                  Mr. Courtney had taken it for granted that uncle Jones or some of the family
                     would accompany her, and when he saw her coming by herself, he hastened to meet
                     her, and conducted her to a seat.
                  The preacher was not the same who had been there before, but a stranger who had
                     prudentially been sent to fill his place. He was a man about forty years of
                     age, rather below than above the ordinary size; his complexion dark, his hair
                     slightly silvered with grey, and the top of his head almost bald.—His eyes, and
                     indeed the whole expression of his face, were somewhat peculiar. He seemed to
                     have been long in feeble health, and his face was marked with lines of
                     suffering. Its habitual expression was one of sad and sorrowful
                        resignation. The casual observer saw in it no evidence of lofty
                     genius, or of even extraordinary talent—and yet he was an extraordinary man.
                     Though he had but slight acquaintance with the technicalities of logic, he was
                     a clear and powerful reasoner Though he knew little of the scholastic theories
                     of theology, he was wonderfully familiar with the teachings of Jesus and the
                     Apostles. Though he professed no acquaintance with the metaphysical subtleties
                     of mental philosophy, he knew full well how to convince the understanding and
                     move upon the hearts of his hearers. He was not familiar with the ancient
                     classics, yet his style was pure and strong, and not entirely void of elegance.
                     His tones and gestures were not formed by any rules of oratory, yet he was
                     sometimes very eloquent.—When he first rose, there was a slight rusticity in
                     his manner, and something in his dress which for a single moment struck
                     Theodosia unpleasantly—but there was, also, such an air of trusting meekness,
                     that this impression was removed almost as soon as made. His text was John 15 :
                     14—"Ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever I command you." And the main object
                     of his sermon was to show the vast difference which there is between the
                     so-called obedience which springs from hope, or grows up from fear, and the
                     willing and true obedience of the Gospel which is produced by
                        love. It was a deep, heart-searching discourse, and must have
                     left on every attentive hearer's mind the sad conviction that genuine Gospel
                     obedience is much more rare than is commonly imagined.—We cannot follow him
                     through all his argument; but we may not omit one portion of it. "The obedience
                     of love," said he, "makes no derision of Christ's commandments
                     with essential and non-essential. 'Ye are my friends if ye do
                        whatever I command you,' whether you think it
                     important or not. We know that we love him when we have respect unto
                        all his commandments. The obedience of hope says,
                     how much must I do to be permitted to enter heaven? The obedience
                     of fear asks, what may I omit to do, and yet escape from hell? The
                     obedience of love simply enquires, 'Lord, what wilt THOU have me
                     to do?' It does not ask, what must I do, but what can
                     I do to show my love to Jesus? It does not ask how far I can venture to
                        disobey, and keep my hope of heaven? How far off can. I follow Jesus,
                     and yet not be disowned of him? Oh, never, never! He who will obey Christ no
                     farther than he may fancy is essential to salvation, has never
                     obeyed him at all. Love of self, not love of Christ, is his controlling motive.
                     He is striving not to please his Saviour, but to secure his own personal
                        happiness. Love teaches a different way. Love delights
                     to do his will. Love delights to do all his will. Love never asks,
                     what is essential to salvation, but what did Jesus Christ
                        command? Love never asks, how little may I do, but
                     how much can I do? If he commands, that is reason
                     enough. He is no loving child who will obey his father only in
                     those things which he must do, or be disowned and disinherited. He is no
                        loving child who will do all he dare to grieve a doting parent
                     whom he believes will pardon all, and love him though he grieves him. He who
                     truly loves him will obey his slightest desires as well as his
                     most peremptory commands. He who truly loves will study to know
                        all his will, and in his very heart delight to do
                        it—not to avoid disinheritance—not to secure his estate—not to
                     enjoy his father's bounty, either present or prospective—but simply because the
                     father wishes, asks it, or commands it.
                  "And yet men call themselves obedient children of God, while they refuse to do
                     what he commands, because he does not add to the command a promise of heaven or
                     a threatening of hell. Oh, it is terrible to think how fearful will be their
                     disappointment! Obeying only to secure salvation is itself
                     sufficient proof that they have not obeyed unto salvation. Omitting all but
                     what they think essential to salvation is of itself sufficient proof that they
                     have omitted all that is essential to salvation. The faith of the
                     Gospel works by love, and love is obedient to all his
                     commandments, so far as it is able to know and to do them. When,
                     therefore, Christ Jesus gives a plain command as that to 'believe and be
                     baptized,' love will not be content merely to believe. It will do both. It will
                     do whatever Christ commands, and he who stops because there is no
                     penalty of hell-fire attached to the last, as there is to the first part of the
                     command, is no friend to Jesus. He does not obey from love to
                        Jesus but from love to self. And further, the
                     obedience of love takes the command as it is given. It obeys in the same
                        order that Christ requires. It not only does the very acts which he
                     commands, but does them in that very way that he requires them to
                     be done. If Christ commands first to believe and
                     then, when thus prepared, to be baptized, the obedience of
                        love will never venture to reverse Christ's order.
                     It will not seek to be first baptized and then believe. And as the command
                     requires personal obedience, it will never seek to substitute
                     obedience, rendered by another. Christ commands you
                     yourselves in your own right, and for yourselves to believe, and
                     then to be baptized. It may be you have not done either. Oh, what
                     a fearful state! Not to have even begun to obey! It may be you have believed,
                     but are fancying that an act done by your parents, and your pastor, without
                     your knowledge or consent, and which they called baptism, has
                     released you from the obligation to obey yourself. But do not mistake. The
                     religion of Christ is a personal religion. The obedience it
                     requires is an intelligent and personal obedience. You must be baptized for
                     yourself. It must be an act of your own. He that believeth and is baptized,
                     shall be saved. The one is to be your own act as much as the
                     other. But this command you have never even tried to obey. You
                     have never made the slightest effort. Oh, if you love Jesus, will
                     you not at least try to obey all his
                     commandments?
                  "One thought more. The obedience of love does what HE commands.
                     'Ye are my friends, if ye do whatever I command'—not what others
                     may put in the place of it—not what you may fancy would do as well. You are not
                     to 'teach for doctrines the commandments of men.' Jesus is the sole Law-Giver
                     of his church. His commandments, given in person son or by those who spake as they were moved by
                     his Holy Spirit, we must obey. If He was immersed in Jordan, then John's
                     baptism was immersion. If John's baptism was immersion, then the baptism
                     administered by Jesus and his disciples, was immersion, for John says, Jesus
                     went into a certain place, and there he tarried and baptized. And John also was
                     baptizing in Ænon at the same time. And the Pharisees heard how that Jesus made
                     and baptized more disciples than John. Whatever one did the other did. It was
                     the same thing, because it is called in the same connection by the
                     same name. And if Jesus and John immersed, it was immersion that he commanded.
                     Yet men have done away with what HE commanded, and substituted
                     sprinkling in its place. To believe and be sprinkled, therefore, is not to
                        do whatever He commands, but to teach and practice for his
                     commands the doctrines of men, and of those who do such things He says, 'In
                     vain do they worship me.' Don't call me bigoted for reminding you of this. They
                     are not my words, but the words of Jesus Christ. 
                        Is
                        It
                      is he who says it; and I believe that he
                        means just what he says. Popes and cardinals, bishops and
                     priests, have met in solemn conclave and changed the ordinance of
                     Jesus. They have substituted the sprinkling of infants for the
                     immersion of believers. This was ordained by Christ, and that by Anti-christ.
                     Yet this is what many professed believers, men who would be grieved if I should
                     intimate that they did not love the Saviour—who in his name and as
                        his ordinance practice these commandments of men.
                     The very time and place when and where these changes were thus made by popes
                     and councils is recorded by themselves. They claim to have
                        authority as the vicegerents of Christ on earth to make such
                     changes. But the obedience of love will never recognize their
                     rule. It obeys Jesus Christ. It does whatever HE commands. And
                     whenever professed religious teachers, whether Catholic or Protestant, teach
                     other commandments, as a substitute for his—it rejects them with disdain."
                  After the sermon, he came down from the little platform, which had been erected
                     for his convenience, and announced the church as ready to receive applications
                     for membership requesting if there were any present who desired to unite with
                     it, that they would come forward while the brethren sang a hymn, and take a
                     seat 
                        alloted
                        allotted
                      for that purpose.
                  The brethren immediately commenced singing the hymn— 
                        
                           'Tis religion that can give
                           Sweetest pleasures while we live.
                           'Tis religion can supply
                           Solid comfort when we die."
                        
                     
                  
                  Before they had completed the first couplet, Theodosia arose and walked to the
                     appointed seat. And when they had finished, the minister asked her to give to
                     the church some account of her religious experience, that they might be able to
                     judge of the nature of her faith and hope.
                  My reader, who is familiar with her strength of mind, firmness of purpose,
                     clearness of conception, and habitual command of the most appropriate language,
                     can form little conception of the surprise which was excited, as much by her
                     manner as her words. She did not wait to be questioned, and simply answer yes
                     or no, as is customary on such occasions, but modestly arose and turned her
                     face to the audience, and began to relate in a low but still in a perfectly
                     audible voice, her experience of grace before she made any profession of
                     religion. The house was still as death. Every eye was fixed, every ear
                     attentive to even the slightest modulation of her voice. After describing in
                     her modest and simple, yet most impressive style, her conviction and
                        conversion version, she paused a
                     moment as if to think of the propriety of saying what was yet upon her
                     mind.
                  "And why," inquired the minister, who was ignorant of her history, "did you not
                        then unite with the people of God?"
                  "At that time," she continued, "I had rarely been in any other but a
                     Presbyterian house of worship. I regarded Presbyterians as the true church of
                     Christ. Perhaps I would not be going too far if I should say, that I regarded
                     them as the only true church, or at least as the only church that
                     was not involved in some most important error of doctrine or practice. It was
                     my mother's church," and her voice faltered and eyes filled with tears as she
                     said it. "It was the church in which God's truth had been made effectual to my
                     conversion. I had no shadow of a doubt that it was the church, if
                     not the only church, and with them I did unite. Nor
                     until last Sabbath, did I ever have a doubt that I was right in doing so. Last
                     Sabbath, you will recollect, one of your number was baptized. I had the
                     curiosity to go to the river. As I saw her plunged beneath the water, the
                     thought impressed itself upon my mind, if that is baptism, I have never
                        been baptized; for whatever baptism may be, it must always be the
                     same—'One Lord, one faith, one baptism.' I went home and commenced a careful
                     and thorough investigation of the subject. I found that it was immersion and
                     not sprinkling that Jesus commanded. It was this which HE himself, as our
                     Example, submitted to in the river of Jordan. It was this which his disciples
                     practiced in his life. It was this which he commanded after his death. It was
                     this, therefore, which he required of me. I have not yet obeyed him, but I
                        desire 'to do whatever he commands me.' Mine is, I
                     humbly trust, the 'obedience of love.' I have come here to-day, and it is the
                     first time in my life that I have ever been in a Baptist church. I have come to
                     ask you to baptize me, if you think me worthy, according to the
                     commandment of the Lord Jesus."
                  "Why this is wonderful!" exclaimed the minister, as she resumed her seat.
                  "It is the Lord's doing," rejoined Mr. Courtney, "and it is wonderful in our
                     eyes."
                  "Brethren, what will we do in regard to this application?"
                  "I move," said one, "that she be baptized, and received into the fellowship of
                     the church."
                  This was, of course, unanimously determined on.
                  "When will you be baptized, my sister?" inquired the minister.
                  "As soon as it may suit your convenience, sir. I am ready now."
                  "Then after prayer we will at once proceed to the waters' side. Let us
                     pray."
                  They kneeled and offered up a short and fervent prayer, that God would own the
                     ordinance about to be administered in his name—bless her who was to be its
                     recipient—fill her with the comforts of the Gospel—make her a faithful and
                     useful Christian, and at death receive her into his heavenly kingdom.
                  When Satan finds that he cannot prevent the performance of a religious duty, he
                     often strives to render its performance as distressing as he can. Theodosia had
                     not yet left the house, before she began to be assailed by the most terrible
                     temptations. First came the magnificent church, with its soft light, its
                     cushioned pews, its richly carpeted aisles, its tasteful and costly pulpit, its
                     deep-toned organ, and its well-trained choir, which had all her life been the
                     accompaniments of her public devotions. And she could not but contrast their rich luxurious elegance
                     and comfort, with the rough platform the naked, dirty floor, the hard benches,
                     and harsh, unskillful voices which had surrounded her to-day. In that splendid
                     church she saw her mother weeping over her daughter's apostacy—her brother
                     showing no-interest in her fate—her uncle, whom she loved as a father, and upon
                     whose approbation she had confidently relied, yet he had not come near her,
                     though she had earnestly requested his presence—her pastor who had taught her
                     in childhood, and prayed over her at her conversion; and there was yet another
                     whom she now scarcely dared to think of. They were all there—all happy, all
                     united. She only was a poor outcast from all—yes, yes, from all she
                        loved. With her own rash hand she had cut the ties which bound her to
                     her kindred and her friends. She had left all the elegance so
                     congenial to her delicacy and refinement of taste. She had left all the
                     affection so necessary to the very life of her fond, clinging, loving heart,
                     and here she stood alone among these strangers whom
                     she felt instinctively, with one or two exceptions, had scarcely a sentiment or
                     taste in common with her own. Then, as she was walking to the river, they
                     passed the very spot where she and Mr. Percy stood on the previous
                     Sabbath; and in a single moment what visions of affluence and ease, of elegant
                        social enjoyment, of domestic joy—all the happiness of the
                     loved and loving wife extending down through many long and
                     blissful years—came vividly before her mind. She could see nothing else. She
                     forgot for a moment where she was, and why she came there. She walked on
                     unconsciously. Unconsciously she took the offered arm of the minister as he
                     came to conduct her into the river. The touch of the water recalled her to
                     herself.—She paused, and suddenly withdrew her arm, clasped her hands together,
                     and looked up to heaven, and so stood for some moments, lost in silent prayer.
                     Those who could see her face
                      observed the expression of distress
                     and terror, (which they attributed to a natural timidity at entering the
                     water,) suddenly gave place to one of joy and confidence as she again placed
                     her arm within the minister's and walked on—Jesus had heard her prayer: "Oh,
                     Lord, save me! give me strength to make all this sacrifice for Thee! Thou art
                     my Saviour. Thou hast commanded this. I do it in obedience to Thee. Oh, leave
                     me not! Help, Lord! I have no other helper—Thou art now my all."
                     And as she prayed, the visions of earthly bliss vanished from before her, and
                     she saw Jesus stretched upon the cross in dying agony, and he seemed to say, "I
                     bore all this for thee." And she thought of the words of the
                     Apostle—"He died for us." And as she walked along, she remembered what Jesus
                     said, "Blessed are ye when men shall hate you, and when they shall
                     separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and shall cast out
                     your name as evil for the Son of man's sake. Rejoice ye in that day, and leap
                     for joy, for your reward is great in heaven." "And every one that hath forsaken
                     houses or brethren or sisters, or father or mother, or wife or children, or
                     lands for my name's sake, shall receive an hundred-fold, and shall inherit
                     everlasting life."
                  So fully was her mind occupied with this delightful thought, that she felt no
                     further anxiety, and not the slightest fear. And as she was lifted from the
                     liquid grave, she could not help exclaiming in an audible voice, "Jesus,
                        I thank thee!' And then, as they turned towards the shore, such a
                     gleam of heavenly peace and holy joy illumined her beautiful face, that several
                     of the brethren and sisters who stood upon the bank, simultaneously exclaimed,
                     "Blessed be the name of the Lord!"
                  "Yes," she exclaimed, "blessed be His holy name!"—And suddenly she stopped, and
                     with a voice which was naturally ly
                     sweet and powerful, and had been carefully cultivated, and now was rendered
                     deeper and more expressive by intensity of feeling, she commenced singing: 
                        
                           "Jesus, I my cross have taken,
                           All to leave and follow thee;
                           Friendless, poor, despised, forsaken,
                           Thou from hence my all shalt be.
                           And whilst thou shalt smile upon me,
                           God of wisdom, love, and might,
                           Foes may hate, and friends disown me,
                           Show thy face, and all is bright.
                           Man may trouble and distress me,
                           'Twill but drive me to thy breast;
                           Life with trials hard may press me,
                           Heaven will bring me sweeter rest.
                           Oh, 'tis not in grief to harm me,
                           While thy love is left to me!
                           Oh, 'twere not in joy to charm me,
                           Were that joy unmixed with thee!"
                        
                     
                  
                  The effect upon the audience was electrical. Tears streamed from every face;
                     many sobbed and wept aloud. Among these was a voice which instantly fixed her
                     attention. She looked up among the assembly, and was surprised to see that it
                     had increased since she started into the water to a great multitude. The
                     congregations from several other churches had hurried to the river as soon as
                     they were dismissed from their several places of meeting. Foremost among the
                     crowd stood uncle Jones with her mother on one side, and Edwin on the other. It
                     was her that she heard; for when she saw her daughter standing thus alone, and
                     heard her sing, "Friendless, poor, despised, forsaken," she lifted up her voice
                     and wept. Nor did she weep alone. Strong men, who were not professors of
                     religion, and who were thought to care for none of these things, stood and
                     gazed at that sweet face, all radiant with the love of Jesus, as though it had
                     been the face of
                      an angel; and as they looked, the big tears chased each other down
                     their unconscious cheeks. The brethren and sisters of the church wept; old men
                     and mothers in Israel wept. Young men and maidens wept. But Theodosia heard
                     none, saw none but her mother. As she came to the water's edge, that mother
                     rushed down to meet her, and clasped her closely to her heart. The brothers and
                     sisters of the church who were approaching to give her the hand of fellowship,
                     stood respectfully aside.
                  "Oh, mother, do you—can you forgive me?"
                  "Don't talk so, my child; I have never blamed you. You have done your duty; you
                     have done right. You have obeyed your Saviour—He will bless you. I wish I had
                     the courage to follow your example."
                  "God bless you for those words, my mother! Oh! how full of joy my heart is. He
                     maketh my cup run over. Surely goodness and mercy hath followed me all the days
                     of my life. Uncle, dear uncle, it is blessed to obey. Can't you
                     give up all for Christ?
                  "Mr. Courtney, I thank you for your teachings. Now I know I am
                     baptized. I have now done just what Jesus commanded. I have left all and
                     followed him; and blessed be his name, I have already that peace which passeth
                     understanding." And as the brethren and sisters came crowding round to welcome
                     her into the communion of the church on earth, she sang again with that sweet,
                     soul-thrilling voice, to which the intensity of her feelings and utter
                     self-abandonment gave ten-fold power:— 
                        
                           "Children of the living God,
                           Take the stranger to your heart—
                           Let me dwell in your abode,
                           Never more from you to part
                        
                        
                        
                           Can you love me? Will you help me?
                           Help me on my way to God—
                           Can you love me? Will you help me?
                           Help me keep his precious word."
                        
                      While singing, she continued to give her hand to one after another as they
                     came up; and as she finished the strain, a sister standing by sang— 
                        
                           "Yes, come, thou blessed of the Lord,
                           No stranger art thou now—
                           We welcome thee with warm accord,
                           Our friend and sister thou.—
                        
                        
                           "The hand of fellowship, the heart
                           Of love we offer thee;
                           Leaving the world, thou dost but part
                           With lies and vanity.
                        
                        
                           "In weal or woe, in joy or care,
                           Thy portion shall be ours;
                           Christians their mutual burdens bear,
                           They lend their mutual powers.'
                        
                      The minister pronounced the benediction, and they led her up the bank, and
                     then each went his way rejoicing.
                  Uncle Jones went home and dined with Mrs. Ernest.—When Theodosia had changed
                     her dress, and returned to the parlor, he went up and took her hand as she came
                     in, saying, 'My dear Theo., why did you not tell me you were going to be
                     baptized to-day? I would have gladly gone with you to your meeting."
                  "Then you did not mean to east me off?" said she, her eyes filling with tears.
                     "I thought you too had forsaken me. I sent you a line last night, entreating
                     you to be present—but you did not come!"
                  'I did not get it, nor did I know, till after church, that you intended any
                     such thing to-day. I missed you from your accustomed seat, and enquired of your
                     mother as soon as the meeting was dismissed, and learned that you had gone to
                     be baptized. We hurried to the river, and fortunately were just in time to see
                     you go into the water."
                  "Oh, uncle! I am so glad. I thought that you, and mother, and all
                     who loved me, so disapproved of what I was about to do, that you would none of
                     you be present. God is already giving me back my friends."
                  
                  There was preaching again at three o'clock,—and as the school-house could not
                     hold half the people, it was thought best to adjourn to the court-house. At
                     night the court-house was filled to overflowing, and the preacher requested
                     those who were concerned about their souls' salvation, and desired the prayers
                     of the people of God, to take a seat in front of the congregation. More than a
                     dozen came forward at once, among whom were several who had been a long time
                     professors of religion, and some were members of the Baptist church. On
                     inquiry, these professors stated that they had been trying to get to
                        heaven, and with this object in view had endeavored to lead in some
                     degree religious lives. They had gone to church, partaken of the Supper,
                     sometimes prayed, or tried to pray—but took no pleasure in
                     religion; and from what they heard in the morning, were convinced that whatever
                     obedience they had shown was the obedience of fear, or hope, and not of
                        love.—For if they could have got to heaven without religion, they
                        would have willingly dispensed with it. They had abstained from open
                     sin, because they knew that those who lived in open sin would surely be
                        lost. They had endeavored to perform certain duties, because they
                     considered the attempt (at least) to do such duties to be essential to
                        salvation. What they did not think thus essential, had little weight
                     upon their conscience. Now they saw that they had been fearfully deceived, and
                     desired to seek for the obedience of
                     love,—not the obedience which seeks to merit heaven, and continually looks for
                     its reward—but that which receives all mercies as the free gift of
                     God in Christ, and yet longs, and strives, and prays to do all his
                        commandments, because it thus and only thus can exercise, exhibit and
                     gratify the love of God that fills the heart.
                  The minister did not try to give them back their hopes, and make them think
                     that they had no occasion for alarm. He knew full well that Christ will say to
                        many, "Depart from me, I never knew you," who here on earth
                        called him Lord, Lord, and professed to be his disciples. He
                     greatly feared that there were thousands and thousands who had a respectable
                     standing in the church of Christ, who never asked with the converted Paul,
                     "Lord, what wilt THOU have me to do?" But only with the yet
                     unconverted Jailor, "What must I do to be saved?" This last he
                     knew was most important, but it was not enough. It was a needful
                     and common preparation for religion, but it was not
                        religion. It might lead to seek for faith, but it
                     is not the result of saving faith, for THAT works by
                     LOVE—and through LOVE purifies the heart—and through LOVE brings forth good
                     works in the life. He was convinced, moreover, that it was infinitely better
                     for many of God's true children to suffer temporary anxiety and alarm, than for
                     one false professor to be confirmed in his delusive hope.
                  It was determined at the close of this meeting, to appoint one for Monday
                     night, and probably continue to have preaching every night during the week.
                     Whether they did so, and what was the result, we will learn hereafter. It is
                     time for us now to return to our study, which at the close of the Seventh Night
                     (the attentive reader will perhaps remember) was about the Scriptural
                     authority, or rather about the utter want of all Scriptural
                     authority for infant baptism.
               
               
                  THE EIGHTH NIGHT'S STUDY.
                  NEW CHARACTERS AND NEW ARGUMENTS.
                  INFANT BAPTISM IS VIRTUALLY FORBIDDEN IN THE WORD OF GOD.
                  THE COVENANT OF CIRCUMCISION FURNISHES NO GROUND OF DEFENCE FOR
                     INFANT BAPTISM.
                  
                  EIGHTH NIGHT'S STUDY.
                  THE Reverend Mr. Johnson had, early in the preceding week, commenced the
                     preparation of a discourse, which was intended, at once and forever, to put an
                     end to any further defection among his flock. He was a fine declaimer, and was,
                     in the pulpit, accustomed at times to deal in the bitterest denunciation of
                     those who differed from his party, in their religious opinions and practices.
                     He had more power of sarcasm than of reason, and hence, found it easier to
                     denounce the opinions of others than to defend his own. His discourse upon the
                     Sabbath through which we have just passed, was that which we saw him preparing
                     at the commencement of our Third Night's Study. It was designed to be a
                     scornful, bitter, and withering denunciation of all those weak-minded and
                     credulous, or fanatical, persons who, in this day of light, and surrounded by
                     such advantages as were possessed by his congregation, could be by
                     any means induced to wander away from the sacred pale of
                        Presbyterianism.—We will not trouble
                     the reader with even a synopsis of this remarkable sermon. It had been prepared
                     with evident labor and care, and it was delivered with great energy and
                     feeling. Under other circumstances, it might have produced the effect that its
                     author intended, which was to deter any other persons from any investigation of
                     the subject of baptism, or indeed any other religious subject, except for the
                     purpose of confirming their faith in the doctrines in which they had been instructed from their childhood.
                     To have fully answered his purpose, he should have preached it at least a week
                     sooner. Now, it was universally understood to be expressly aimed at certain
                     individuals, whom it was well known had been investigating the subject of
                     baptism, and might possibly be considering the propriety, or
                     rather the conscientious necessity, of a change of church
                     relationship. Many a glance was turned, during its delivery, to the seats
                     occupied by uncle Jones and Mrs. Ernest. The latter felt that it was an
                     uncalled-for abuse of her absent child, whom she knew had been impelled to the
                     course she had taken, by the sternest and most distressing conviction of
                     indispensable duty; and though she wept as she listened, her tears were tears
                     of mortification and anger. That sermon did more to destroy her faith in Pastor
                     Johnson, and her affection for her church, than all the anti-Presbyterian
                     arguments she had ever heard. So also it did more to fix the attention of the
                     congregation upon the work which was going on among the Baptists, than anything
                     which they could have done or said. Many were willing to go and
                     learn at the Baptist meetings what those terrible and seducing doctrines were
                     which could so excite the ire of their venerable shepherd.
                  After preaching, he gave notice that a meeting of the Session would be held at
                     three o'clock at the parsonage, to attend to some business of importance, and
                     gave a special invitation to the resident ministers (by whom he
                     meant the President of the college, and those of the professors who were also
                     preachers) to meet with them.
                  Neither uncle Jones nor Mrs. Ernest said anything of this ominous announcement
                     to Theodosia, for both had some indistinct conception that the business to be
                     done related to her case.
                  Uncle Jones, as one of the ruling elders, and a member of the Session, felt it
                     his duty to be present. He was a little after the time, however; and when he
                     arrived, he found that they had already entered upon the discussion of the
                     business on hand. There was an awkward pause in the conversation when he came
                     in, until the pastor remarked that the matter which they were considering might
                     be an unpleasant one to him; and if so, there would be a quorum present should
                     he think best to retire.
                  "If your business relates in any way to my niece," said the Professor, "I
                     prefer to witness all you have to say or de."
                  "We were indeed speaking of her," said the pastor; "and though it gives me pain
                     to say it, I have felt it my duty, also, to make some mention of your own case,
                     as of one aiding and abetting error in another, if not yourself entertaining
                     opinions which are inconsistent with your obligations as a ruling elder in the
                     church."
                  There was a slight flush passed over the manly face of Professor Jones, as the
                     pastor, with evident reluctance, thus gave him to understand that
                        one object of the meeting was to inflict the discipline of the
                     church upon his recreant niece, and another to take steps to depose him from
                     the eldership; but he answered very calmly:
                  "Don't let my coming in interrupt your order of business. You will take up one
                     case at a time I will be present when you take action on that of Miss Ernest.
                     When you are ready to consider mine, I will retire."
                  "We understand," said the pastor, "that Miss Ernest, while her name was still
                     standing as a member upon our record, has gone to a Baptist society, solicited
                     immersion, and has actually been immersed by a Baptist preacher.—By this act,
                     she has undoubtedly severed all connection with our church and must of necessity be
                     excluded from our communion. The only question is, whether we are
                     bound to make the usual citation to appear, and answer to the charge."
                  "There can be no doubt," replied Professor Jones, "that we are bound, according
                     to our rules, to give the ten days' notice of citation, with a copy of the
                     charges preferred against the accused. But in this case, I will take it upon
                     myself to answer for my niece, that she would prefer the quickest and the
                     simplest mode of excision. She has no wish for farther connection with us. She
                     regards herself as already separated from our communion, and will probably make
                     no answer or defence to any charges not affecting her moral or Christian
                     character, which you may think fit to bring against her."
                  After some consultation, it was decided that it would not be proper to dispense
                     with any of the stipulated formalities of the rules of discipline; and
                     consequently, all that could at this time be done, was to take order that a
                     copy of the charges preferred against her, the names of the witnesses by whom
                     they were to be established, and a citation to appear and answer ten days
                     thereafter, should be issued, and served upon Miss Theodosia Ernest. A
                     committee, consisting of the pastor and clerk, was appointed to carry these
                     measures into execution.
                  "You are now done with Miss Ernest's case for the present," said Professor
                     Jones, "and I will retire, that you may feel perfect freedom in speaking about
                     mine."
                  "Oh, no," said the President of the College, the Rev. T. J. McNought, D.D.,
                     L.L.D., who was present on the invitation of the pastor. "We were merely
                     speaking of what it might be necessary to do in a case such as our
                     brother Johnson conceived yours would eventually become, should
                     you continue to progress in the direction in which he imagines you have
                     started."
                  "Brethren," replied the Professor, "let s not misunderstand each other. You
                     know me well. I am a plain, blunt man. I will have no concealment on this
                     subject. My niece has carefully studied the Word of God, which our standards
                     declare 'IS THE ONLY RULE OF FAITH AND PRACTICE.' I assisted her in the
                     investigation. We both came to the conclusion, as I think every right-minded
                     man must do, that the baptism commanded and spoken of in the New Testament, is
                     neither sprinkling nor pouring, but dipping, or, as it is commonly called,
                     immersion. This I now firmly believe. This I am ready to prove from the Holy
                     Word to you or any one else who feels inclined to inquire into the matter. I
                     will prove it by the very meaning of the word baptize. I will
                     prove it by a reference to the places selected for baptism. But
                     the going down into the water, and the coming up out of the water, said to have
                     preceded and followed baptism, I will prove by the nature of the
                        allusions to baptism, as a bath, as a
                        planting, and a burial. I will prove by the testimony of the
                     Fathers, that it was for centuries the only baptism, and by the
                     testimony of our own ablest writers—such as Wall and Stuart,
                     Neander and Colman—that it continued to be the common baptism for
                     more than thirteen hundred years, even in the Roman Catholic church, and the
                     churches derived from her, and still continues the only baptism in
                     the Eastern churches. I will show you the very time and place when and where
                     the change was made by authority of the Pope and his council. I
                     will show you when and how the new practice was introduced into England and
                     into this country. I will show you this, not in Baptist books. These facts do
                     not rest on Baptist testimony, but on that of our own historians
                     and divines. You
                     
                     know, President McNought, that what I say is true; and Mr. Johnson
                     knows it too, or might know it, if he would look at the evidence in his
                     possession. Now, if to believe these things on such testimony makes one a
                     heretic, I wish you distinctly to understand that I am decidedly heretical.
                     Though I assure you, on my honor as a man and a Christian, that I am ready and
                     willing to see and to acknowledge my error, if any one of you can
                     point it out. On the subject of infant baptism, I am not fully convinced. I am
                     satisfied, as any one can easily be who will make a critical examination of the
                     Scriptures, with this object in view, that there is neither express
                        commandment nor example to justify the baptism of any but
                        believers, to be found in the Word of God. Pastor Johnson and myself
                     have together searched diligently to find either the precept or the example,
                     and he, as well as I, was compelled to grant that it is not there.
                     But Woods and Stuart, and others of our most eminent divines, while they have
                     granted this, still contend for infant baptism.—There must, therefore, be
                        some other Scriptural ground on which it rests. I will be
                     thankful to any one among you who can point it out."
                  There was a moment's pause. The Session were not prepared for such a confession
                     of his faith, and no one knew what to reply.
                  "I will now retire," continued he. "You have the case before you, and can adopt
                     such measures as you may think best."
                  After he had gone, "I told you," said the pastor, 'that he had become a Baptist
                     in all but the name. I don't believe his niece would ever have left us, but for
                     his encouragement and that of her mother."
                  "They must have felt," said Col. White, (the lay member whom we have had
                     occasion to mention once before,) "they must have felt to-day, if they have any
                     feeling left. I would not have been in their places for the best farm in the
                     county. It made my very ears tingle to hear how you belabored them. But it
                     don't seem to have done him the slightest good. I doubt if there is but one
                     argument that can be brought to bear upon him, and that is the same that so
                     easily convinced my young friend, Esq. Percy."
                  "What is that?" inquired President McNought.
                  "It is the argumentum ad pocketum. I have
                     heard from doctors that the pocket nerve was the most sensitive nerve in the
                     whole body. Convince a man that his bread and meat depends upon a correct
                     belief, and he is very apt to believe correctly. This may not be always true of
                     a woman, but I have never known this argument, when prudently and
                     skillfully presented, to fail of convincing a man. You may appoint
                     a committee to confer with brother Jones, and endeavor to convince him of his
                     errors. It is, perhaps, essential that you should; for this will give him a
                     pleasant and honorable opportunity of recalling his heretical expressions, or
                     at least, of explaining them away. But before you do this, let me intimate to
                     him that the Board of Trustees (of whom you know I have the honor to be the
                     President) will greatly dislike to dispense with his valuable
                     services in the college—but that it is a Presbyterian college; and however much
                     they may esteem him as a man, and value him as a teacher, yet we can retain no
                     one whose orthodoxy is openly doubtful. Believe me, brethren, you will then
                     find him much more pliable, and ready to be convinced that he is wrong."
                  "You may try it," said the pastor, "but I don't believe you will succeed. I
                     know him better than you do. He has always been one of the most
                        conscientious men I ever knew. He will act as he
                        believes."
                  
                  "No doubt of it," rejoined the speculating elder. "He will act as he believes;
                     but he will believe that it is wrong to make any change in his
                     church relations, or to meddle any farther with the subject of baptism, unless
                     it is in the defence of our opinions. Professor Jones is a poor man. It is not
                     generally known, but it is true, that he has for several years greatly assisted
                     in the support of Mrs. Ernest and her children. He has thus lived fully up to
                     his income. He has now a growing family. He expects to provide for them out of
                     his yearly salary. It is all he can do. Take away this; turn him out of the
                     house he now occupies, rent free; let him feel that he stands suddenly not only
                     destitute, but without employment and friendship—and he is something more or
                     less than man, if he can look upon his helpless wife and children and refuse to
                     hear to reason."
                  The Session appointed the pastor and the Rev. T. J. McNought, D.D., LL.D., as a
                     committee to see and labor with their brother Jones, and endeavor to convince
                     him of his errors, especially in regard to infant baptism, as on this point he
                     seemed likely to be most accessible, and then adjourned to meet again at the
                     call of the pastor.
                  Col. White considered himself a committee of one to make matters
                     easy for the committee of two. Early in the day, on Monday, he called at the
                     house of Professor Jones, at an hour when he knew he was absent, for he felt
                     the necessity of all the assistance he could obtain, and relied upon Mrs. Jones
                     and the children as his most efficient allies.
                  "Is the Professor in this morning, Mrs. Jones?"
                  "Not just now, sir. He has a recitation at this time. He will be in in half an
                     hour. Take a seat, Colonel."
                  "No, I thank you, madam. I called to see Professor Jones about some important
                     business. I will meet him at the college. There is a matter afloat, which I
                     fear is going greatly to injure him in his future prospects; and I merely
                     called, as a friend, to suggest some plan by which the ruin— —for ruin I fear
                     it will be—may be averted."
                  "Why, Col. White, what can you mean?" asked the lady, in just that
                     tone of distress and alarm which he desired to hear.
                  "Oh," said he, taking a chair, and sitting down where he could look right into
                     her face, "it may be nothing after all. Indeed, I don't really believe it will
                     amount to anything; but still, there is, I fear, some danger that
                     he will lose his situation in the college. There is a rumor abroad, you know,
                     that he is about to become a Baptist—or, at least, that he has a little
                     tendency that way; and there are some of the trustees who are
                     disposed to be very particular about such things—too much so, as I
                     may say. Now, for myself, I am disposed to be liberal and I shall do what I
                     can—in fact, I may say I have done what I could—to influence their action. You
                     know I have always been in favor of Professor Jones. I know him to be a worthy
                     man, and a very superior instructor; and I know he has the confidence—the
                     implicit confidence, as I may say—of the whole community And what if he
                        does entertain some heterodox opinions about a matter not
                     essential to salvation! says I. Why, he is a good man, and that is enough for
                     me. But you know, Mrs. Jones, people don't all think alike; and I am dubious
                     about what the trustees may take a fancy to do. But I can't stay," continued
                     he, rising, and going towards the door. "I could not do less, as a neighbor,
                     than just to call and tell you my fears. I will try to meet Professor Jones
                     himself, and consult with him about what is to be done."
                  He sallied out, and about the time that Professor Jones was starting for home,
                     placed himself in the way as he came from the college building.
                  "I am sorry," said he, "brother Jones, that our pastor used such expressions as he did yesterday. I
                     don't wonder that you became excited; I could not have borne it half as well as
                     you did. But I am afraid you dropped some expressions that will injure you with
                     the trustees. Some of them have been talking with me this morning. They say
                     that you as good as declared yourself a Baptist, and they don't see what
                     further use a Presbyterian college has for your services. But I said, wait a
                     while. Jones is a man of impulse. His feelings were touched yesterday, and he
                     said more than he intended. He is as much a Presbyterian as I am. He will be
                     all right in a week. I took the liberty to say thus much for you. I have always
                     been your friend, and I mean to stand by you, through thick and thin, so long
                     as I can be of any service to you. I don't advise you to conceal or falsify
                     your opinions. I know you are incapable of doing that; but I
                     merely suggest, since so much depends upon it—your own living, as I may
                     say—that you will be a little more careful and prudent in their expression.
                     Think what you please; but you are not obliged always to tell all
                     you think. You understand? I felt bound to give you this little hint. There may
                     be more in it than you are aware of."
                  Such thoughts as these had already intruded into the Professor's mind. His wife
                     had several times suggested something of the kind. Till now, however, the
                     danger had seemed distant and undefined. It was indeed a dark cloud, but it
                     hung low on the far-off horizon; now, it lowered above his very head, and
                     covered all the heavens with its blackness.—Nothing but utter ruin stared him
                     in the face. He walked along home, almost blinded by the rush of fearful
                     thoughts. He sat down in silence to his dinner. His wife seemed even sadder and
                     more distressed than he was. Scarcely had he begun to eat when she
                     inquired—
                  "Have you seen Col. White this morning? he was here looking for you. I
                        told you how it would be, when you first begun to meddle with
                     this subject of baptism; but you could not be satisfied. And we are now to lose
                     our pleasant home and all our means of support, and be turned out destitute
                     upon the world, just because you would not listen to your wife, and let well
                     enough alone."
                  "Oh, not so bad as that I hope, my dear."
                  "Well, I don't know how anything could be worse. Col. White says the trustees
                     are going to declare your professorship vacant, or something like it, because
                     you have turned Baptist. And of course we must leave this house, which you know
                     belongs to the college, though we have fitted it up for ourselves just as
                     though it belonged to us. And you know you have never saved a dollar of your
                     salary, though I am sure I never spent the half of it. I never could tell what
                     became of it; and how we are going to live, I should like very much to know. If
                     you depend on those ignorant and stingy Baptists for a support,
                     anybody can see we must come to starvation. They could not do much if they
                     would, and they would not do anything if they could. I'm sure I hate the day
                     they came here, to disturb the peace and quiet of our town. They have brought
                     nothing but trouble to me."
                  "But, my dear wife, things may not turn out so badly after all. I did indeed
                     see Col. White, and he told me as a friend, that some of the trustees are a
                     little piqued at my entertaining opinions on this subject different from their
                     own; but with his influence exerted in my favor, I hardly think I shall lose my
                     situation, at least till I can make other arrangements."
                  "His influence! Why, he is the very soul and body of the whole business. You
                     don't know that man as I do. He can't impose on me with his soft words. I could
                     see the evil intention in his eye while he was talking about it to me. As soon as he saw how much it
                     distressed me, I could see it did his very heart good. He is the very man that
                     is working your ruin. And all I wish is that you had not yourself placed in his
                     hand the club to beat your brains out with. If I were you, I would go to the
                     trustees myself, and set the matter right."
                  "What can I say to them, my dear?"
                  "Say?—why tell them, that though it is true that you have given a little time
                     to the investigation of this subject, you are as good a Presbyterian as any of
                     them, and have no more thought of leaving the Presbyterian church, than
                     President McNought himself. I know you love our church. I have
                     often heard you say so. It was good enough for your father and mother to live
                     in and die in. It was good enough for Timothy Dwight and Jonathan Edwards to
                     live and die in. It is good enough for Pastor Johnson, President McNought, your
                     brother professors, and all the most intelligent, and influential, and
                        wealthy portion of the town, and I can't see why it is
                        not good enough for you."
                  "If I was only sure it is the Church of Jesus Christ, that would be all I could
                     ask," he replied; "but I must consider further of this matter."
                  "Yes, I see how it will be; you will consider and consider till the mischief is
                     done and we are turned out of house and home. But I know it's of no use to talk
                     to you. You will just go on your own way. I only wish you may never be as sorry
                     as I am that you ever saw a Baptist."
                  Night came, and with it came the committee appointed by the Session—the
                     reverend pastor and the reverend Doctor. They had previously consulted and
                     arranged their plan of argument. Mr. Johnson knew it would not be worth while
                     to go again over the same ground through which they had already traveled. They
                     had in vain searched the Scriptures to find a single precept or
                     example to justify the baptism of infants. They concluded therefore they must
                     make it out by inference.
                  "I understand," said President McNought, "that you insist on some express
                        precept or example for infant baptism, before you will
                     receive it as a scriptural practice?"
                  "Oh, no," said Professor Jones; "I am by no means particular about the
                        character of the proof. I only ask for Scripture evidence that
                     it was either required or practiced. You may find that evidence in any form you
                        can. You can't find the precept or
                        example, that is certain. We have tried it. If you have any
                        other testimony, let us hear it."
                  "The truth is," said the D.D., "there was no necessity for the precept or
                     example. The case was so plain, that the early disciples could not help
                     understanding their duty, so there was no need of commanding
                     it.
                  "Children had always made a part of the Jewish
                     church, and unless there was something said to the contrary, they would of
                     course be regarded as making a part of the Christian church. If,
                     therefore, you cannot prove that they were absolutely excluded
                     from the Christian church, it is most conclusively evident that they were
                     received into it, though there should be no record of the fact."
                  "To that," said the Professor, "I might reply by saying that the baptism of
                     infants, if required at all, is a positive institution of our religion,
                     something essentially binding upon the Christian churches. And it
                     is difficult for me to conceive how you can make out a positive
                        obligation to perform a certain Christian duty in a church capacity,
                     from the mere fact that not one word is said about it. Your
                     argument amounts to this. The Jews circumcised their male infants
                     at eight days old, because God had again and again positively and plainly
                        commanded them to do so; therefore Christians should baptize all their infant
                     children, both male and female, because the Lord has given
                        no commandment in the subject, and further because we cannot
                     find the slightest allusion to any of the first Christians as having done or
                     refused to do it, nor any intimation that any person was ever expected to do
                     it. Such logic may be very conclusive to you, but I can never be convinced by
                     it.
                  "But I think I may safely venture to take the very ground proposed by you, and
                     prove that infants (according to your own language) were
                        absolutely excluded, both by the commandments of the Saviour and the
                     example of the early Christians. While looking in vain for any precept or
                     example to justify the baptism of infants, we found enough both of precept and
                     example to satisfy my mind, since I have come to reflect about it, that
                        infant baptism is absolutely and clearly
                     forbidden.
                  "It is forbidden in the commission itself. The command to baptize
                        believers is a command not to baptize any but
                     believers. The command to make disciples first and then baptize
                     them, is a command not to baptize any who are not first made
                     disciples. If I tell my servant to go and wash all the old sheep in my flock,
                     it is equivalent to a prohibition to wash the little lambs. If I tell him to
                     cut down all the dead trees in a grove, it is equivalent to a
                     prohibition to cut any green and living ones,—and if he should disobey me and
                     cut the green ones also, I would not consider it a valid excuse, that I had
                        last year, on another plantation, expressly
                     ordered him to girdle both green and dry. So the command to
                     baptize believers excludes all others; and as infants cannot
                     believe, it excludes them from the very necessity of the case. Nor would I like
                     to offer, for the violation of this command, such an excuse as this: Oh, Lord,
                     I know that Thou didst ordain only the baptism of
                        disciples and believers—but as Thou didst, under a
                        former dispensation, expressly command children to be
                        circumcised, I thought Thou wouldst prefer to have them
                     baptized under this, although Thou didst omit to tell us so. Would he not
                     reply, What right had you to make ordinances for me? If I commanded the
                        Jews to circumcise their children, it was their duty to do it;
                     and when I command Christians to baptize believers
                     and disciples, it is their duty to do that. 'Ye are
                     my friends if ye do whatsoever I command you.' 'But in vain do you
                     worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.'
                  "And as a prohibition may be fairly inferred from the command, so
                     it may also from the examples. Among all the multitudes who came
                     to John and were baptized of him in Jordan, there was not a single
                        infant. John required repentance and faith in the coming Messiah, as
                     an indispensable prerequisite. He taught them that the Fathers'
                     faith would not avail in this new dispensation. 'Think not to say unto
                     yourselves, we have Abraham for our father; but bring forth for yourselves
                     fruits suitable to repentance.'
                  "Those who were baptized by Jesus and his disciples, were also adult believers,
                     for the Pharisees heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John.
                     He made disciples before he baptized them. Of the three thousand
                     mentioned as added to the church upon the day of Pentecost, there was not
                        one infant, nor did they bring an infant with them. Of the five
                     thousand, a few days after, there was not one who was not an adult believer.
                     They were men and women. Of the great multitude who believed and were baptized
                     in Samaria when Philip preached, there was not a single little child. The
                     Evangelist expressly classes them all under two heads, both men and women.' And
                     nowhere, in a single case, is there even an intimation that there was a child
                     baptized, nor is any one even reproved for the neglect to have it done.— Now if this does not
                     absolutely exclude them by example I do not see what force
                     there is in example. I reply to your argument, therefore, first, by proving
                     that even if infants had not been expressly excluded,
                     there would not be the slightest warrant for their baptism; and, second, by
                     showing that they were absolutely excluded, both by Christ's
                     command and the practice of the early Christians."
                  "Then," said Mr. Johnson, "you are unwilling to believe that 'baptism has come
                     in the room of circumcision,' as I have been accustomed to inform my people
                     every time an infant has been baptized in my church for twenty years."
                  "Oh, no, Mr. Johnson—not at all. I am very willing to believe it—I
                     may almost say I am very desirous to believe it. All I ask is that you will
                     give me the slightest Scripture proof of it. You are too good a
                     Protestant to ask me to take your word for it, or even the often
                     repeated assertions of all the clergy in the land. Give me
                        one text of Scripture to prove it, and I am as ready and
                     willing to believe as even yourself can wish."
                  "You know," replied Mr. Johnson, "that we teach 'that baptism is instituted by
                     Christ—that it is a seal of the righteousness of faith, and that the seed of
                     the faithful have no less a right to this ordinance under the Gospel than the
                     seed of Abraham to circumcision under the Old Testament.'"
                  "Oh, yes—I know you teach this. I have heard and read it a hundred
                     times: and I have no doubt most of our people think you have Scripture to show
                     for it. It is not enough, however, for me to know that you teach
                     it; I want that you should show me where the Lord Jesus teaches
                     it, or where he authorizes you to teach it. Where is it
                        said or even intimated 'that the seed of the
                     faithful have no less a right to this ordinance under the Gospel than the seed
                     of Abraham to circumcision under the Old Testament?' If it is in the Bible you
                     can show it. If I read correctly, the seed of Abraham had a right, or rather
                     were in duty bound to circumcise their male children at eight days old,
                        because God expressly commanded it—to give the children of
                     believers the same right to baptism would therefore require an
                        express commandment that they should be baptized. But you know
                     full well there is no such command. I have heard a great deal of,
                     to me, unintelligible jargon about 'federal holiness,' and 'covenant holiness,'
                     and the 'covenant of circumcision,' and the 'Abrahamic covenant,' &c.
                     &c. There may be a great deal of sense and Scripture in it, but I can't
                     understand it. I want a plain Scriptural statement of the facts. You say that
                     baptism came in the room of circumcision. Show where the Word says so. Show me
                     any thing like it."
                  "If you will take the Confession of Faith," replied the Doctor of Divinity,
                     "and turn to the 147th page, you will see the texts upon which this doctrine
                     rests."
                  "Well, here is a copy. Let us find them. This is coming to the point. If any
                     text is mentioned or referred to which gives to the infant
                        children of believers the same claim to baptism that the descendants
                     of Abraham had to circumcision, or even intimates that baptism has come in the
                     room of circumcision, I am satisfied. This is all I want."
                  The book was handed to the pastor, who found the page 147, and read as follows:
                     Gen. 17: 7, 9, with Gal. 3: 9. 'And I will establish my covenant between me and
                     thee, and thy seed after thee, in their generations, for an everlasting
                     covenant; to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. And God said unto
                     Abraham, thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee,
                     in their generations."
                  "Stop a minute," said the Professor, "Let me turn to the place in the Bible. We
                     will understand it better to read it in its connection. Here it is—Gen. 17:
                     7-9. Why did they leave out the 8th
                     verse: 'And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein
                     thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and
                     I will be their God'? This makes it all very plain. God agreed with Abraham
                     that he would give his seed the land of Canaan for a possession
                     forever; and as a condition on the other part he required (see 10th verse) that
                     every man-child should be circumcised. I can understand all that—but what has
                     it to do with baptism or Christianity? No more than the carrying of the bones
                     of Joseph out of Egypt."
                  "Oh, yes it has, Professor Jones, for we read in Gal. 3: 9 —"
                  "Stop a minute till I find the place. Now—but let me read it; I will begin at
                     the sixth verse: 'Even as Abraham believed God, and it was counted
                     unto him for righteousness. Know ye therefore, that they which are of
                        faith, the same are the children of Abraham. And the Scripture,
                     foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith,
                     preached before the Gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee, shall all nations be
                     blessed.' And now comes your proof-text:—'So then they which be of
                        faith, are blessed with faithful [believing] Abraham.' Now, I
                     think I can understand this; but for the life of me, I can't see one word about
                     baptism in it, or of circumcision either. There is no more allusion to either,
                     than there is to the lifting up of the brazen serpent in the wilderness, or the
                     giving of the law on Sinai, or the falling down of the walls of Jericho.
                     Abraham believed God. So Christians believe Abraham
                     was blessed for his faith. It was counted to him for
                     righteousness. So we who believe are also blessed with believing
                     Abraham; and that is all. There is surely no infant baptism here. What is the
                     next?"
                  "It is Romans 4: 11, 12: 'And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of
                     the righteousness of the faith which he had being uncircumcised: that he might
                     be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised,'
                     &c."
                  "I have it here," said the Professor, as he found the chapter, "and to
                     understand the sense, I see it will be necessary to begin at the first of the
                     chapter. Paul is proving that justification is by faith, and not
                     by works. So he says even Abraham believed, (third
                     verse,) and it was counted [or reckoned] unto him for righteousness; and in the
                     tenth verse, he asks, how was it reckoned? before he was
                     circumcised or after? It was before. He had the faith, and he received the sign
                     of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness of faith. And the
                     Apostle goes on to argue, that if faith was counted to him for
                     righteousness, while he was yet uncircumcised, so it will be counted for
                     righteousness to all who believe in Christ, even though they
                     should not be circumcised. But what has all this to do with baptism? The
                     subject is never mentioned or alluded to. The sentiment is the same which is
                     expressed in Galations—Abraham believed, and believing, he was blessed. So
                     Christians, believing as he did, will like him be blessed; and thus all
                     believers may be counted as his children in faith. The only
                     allusion to circumcision here, is made to show that it had nothing
                     at all to do with the blessedness of faith. To baptism there is no allusion at
                     all. If you will satisfy me that baptism has come in the room of circumcision,
                     so that the law of circumcision was transferred to baptism, you must give me
                     something better than this; and if there were anything better, the Confession
                     of Faith would have quoted or referred to it. I take it for granted, therefore,
                     that these are the strongest proof-texts you can present. And if they prove any
                     thing at all, that has any bearing whatever upon the point at issue, it is that
                        all the members of a Christian church must, of necessity, be
                     professed believers. The seed of Abraham enjoyed certain blessings (the possession of Canaan) in
                     virtue of circumcision; but the righteousness of faith pertained
                     to Abraham, as he was uncircumcised, and now belongs to those who
                     are his children, not by circumcision, or by anything that came in
                     the room of it, but by the same faith which he exercised. Those
                     who believe, and only those, are to be partakers of
                     the blessing. Christianity is a personal, individual, and not a
                        hereditary religion. In the New Dispensation,
                        every man stands on his own foundation, and is
                     responsible for himself to God."
                  "I do not see," replied the President, "why you should think it necessary to
                     have any Scripture to prove a familiar and notorious fact. It is
                     well known that circumcision was the initiatory ordinance of the
                     Jewish church, and we all agree that baptism is the initiatory
                     ordinance into the Christian church. Of course, there it takes the place of the
                     other. It bears the same relation to the Christian, that the other did to the
                     Jewish church. It is the door of entrance. Now, the church of God
                     is, and has been in every age, substantially the same, although
                     existing under different names; and consequently, the character of the persons
                     admitted to membership, must have been the same. These persons among the Jews
                     were admitted by circumcision, and among Christians by baptism. They were the
                     infant children of church members among them; and so, of course, they must be
                     among us. We don't need any express text to prove this, for it is
                     self-evident from the general tenor of the whole Word."
                  "Your argument," replied Professor Jones, "is simply this: Infants were members
                     of the Jewish church; and, as the church of God is always substantially the
                     same, they must be members of the Christian church. The door of
                     entrance is changed, but there is no change in the character of the persons who
                     are to enter it."
                  "Yes, that is precisely what I mean. Whatever other changes were made, there
                     was no change in the membership."
                  "Then," said the Professor, "you mean precisely what is certainly not true.
                     Jesus Christ, when he commanded the new door to be opened,
                     commanded also that different persons should enter
                     it. To the Jews he said, bring in your male children and servants at eight days
                     old. To Christians he says, bring all who believe in the blessed
                     Gospel which I send you to preach. If he made the one change, he just as
                     clearly made the other. Believers—as Mr. Johnson and I have seen in our
                     examination of the word—he plainly commands to be baptized; but he commands
                        no others, and no others ever were baptized in all the history
                     which the New Testament records. Neither is it true, that Christianity is
                        substantially the same as Judaism. It was one of the most
                     earnest labors of Paul to explain and enforce the difference. This difference
                     was substantial; it was fundamental; it was constitutional. The other was a
                     religion of works; this is one of faith. That was one of outward
                     forms; this of inward affections. That consisted of the whole Jewish nation,
                     both the evil and good; this is confined to the truly converted. That was a
                     national establishment, and this an assembly of true believers, from which all
                     are to be excluded but the pious in heart and the holy in life. This
                     substantial and fundamental change, we, as Presbyterians, recognize in fact,
                     though we deny it in theory. We say that infants are church
                     members, but we do not, in this country, treat them as such; we do
                     not address them as such; we do not, in fact, consider them as
                     such. You, in your preaching, are continually urging the baptized children who
                     have come to years of discretion,
                     'to come out from the world;' and when they are converted, you
                     urge them to join the church. It is true, that by the Confession
                     of Faith, (p. 504,) you are required to inform them, 'that it is their duty and
                     their privilege to come to the Lord's Supper,' whether they give evidence of
                     conversion or not, provided only that they are intelligent and moral; but you
                        never do it: and half our members would not believe that we
                     have any such rule. In other countries, however, this is done. Our theory is
                     carried out into practice, and the church is filled with unconverted men and
                     women. This is the legitimate result of infant church-membership."
                  "I am very sorry," rejoined the pastor, "to hear you talk in this way. I fear
                     you are preparing great trouble for us, and are about to bring down terrible
                     sorrow upon your own head and that of your family. I had hoped, for the honor
                     of our beloved church, that you would have thought better of these things. We
                     have, however, done our duty. The Session deputed us to reason the case with
                     you, and endeavor to convince you of your errors; but we find that you
                        will not be convinced. Let us hope, however, that you will
                     consider further, and carefully weigh the unanswerable arguments which we have
                     presented; and let them have their full influence upon your mind. There may be
                     more dependent on it than you are aware of. I suppose it is not worth while to
                     spend more time upon the subject; so we will bid you good night."
                  Professor Jones understood very well the ominous import of this parting
                     address. He knew that his home, his employment, his all depended on the will of
                     a few men, some of whom would take pleasure in rendering his condition as
                     wretched as possible, so soon as they had no further hope of binding him to
                     themselves. And he knew, on the other hand, that those to whom he would go, had
                     neither influence to aid him, or profitable employment to furnish him the means
                     of support. As soon as the reverend committee had retired, he fell upon his
                     knees, and offered up to God his thanks, that thus far he had not been tempted
                     to deny his truth, or falsify the solemn convictions of his conscience; and
                     then, in view of what he now began to feel would be inevitable, he prayed for
                     strength to obey all the Master's will, and trust God for the consequences:
                  "Oh, my God! I see before me nothing but trouble and sorrow. Want and
                     affliction stare me in the face. Lord, give me strength to welcome them, or at
                     least, firmly to endure them. Thou canst bring good out of evil. I commit my
                     destiny into thy hands. I have trusted my immortal soul to thee;
                     why may I not trust my body and my family? Thou hast promised to save the one
                     and to provide for the others. Help my unbelief! I must go out like Abraham,
                     not knowing whither I go. I look to thee, my Father in heaven, to open the way
                     before me."
                  As he was rising from his knees, the remark of Theodosia, is she came from the
                     water with her face so full of heavenly joy, came back to his mind with
                     ten-fold force and beauty—'Uncle, dear uncle! it is blessed to
                        obey! Can't you give up all for Christ?"
                  "Yes, yes," he unconsciously exclaimed, "I will—I do give up all. I will follow
                     where duty leads, let the consequence be what it may. I will resign my
                     professorship to-morrow. God will provide in some way for my wife and
                     children."
                  The conversation which we have recorded took place in his private study. On
                     returning to his family room, he was delighted to find there his sister, Mrs.
                     Ernest, and her daughter, and also Mr. Courtney, who had called to have a
                        little conversation with
                     Theodosia, and finding they were about to start out, had accompanied them on
                     their visit.
                  Mrs. Jones had been so anxious about the result of the conference with the
                     committee, that she could not enjoy the society of her visitors, nor even exert
                     herself successfully for their entertainment. She was, therefore, greatly
                     relieved when her husband came in and took that task upon himself.
                  "I wish I had known that you and Theo. were here," said he, "I would have
                     turned the reverend committee who have just left me, over to you."
                  "I do not understand what you mean," said Mr. Courtney.
                  "Only this. My brethren in the Church Session have learned that I do not any
                     longer believe that sprinkling is baptism, or that any but believers are to be
                     baptized. And they have deputized Dr. McNought and Pastor Johnson to endeavor
                     to bring me back into a belief of their human traditions. Their main argument
                     at this time was on the baptism of infants as founded on the usage of the Jews.
                     Baptism, they said, has come in the room of circumcision; and as infants were
                     circumcised, so infants must be baptized. What answer would you have made?"
                  "I would have said: Gentlemen, you do not yourselves believe that
                     baptism came in the room of circumcision in any such sense that the same order
                     of persons who were circumcised are to be baptized; or, if you
                        believe it, you do not act out your faith. The law
                     of circumcision included only males, but you baptize both males and females.
                     The child, when it was possible, was to be circumcised at eight
                     days old, but you baptize at any other time. The servants and the slaves,
                     whether old or young, whether born in their house or bought with their money,
                     were to be circumcised, but you never baptize them—but only the children. They
                     were to be circumcised by the parents and not by the priest; but you require
                     baptism to be done by the minister. If the law of circumcision is transferred
                     to baptism in one particular, (without any New Testament
                     authority) it is equally transferred in all the others.
                  "Then I would have said further: Baptism could not come in the
                     room of circumcision, because circumcision is still in force. No
                     room was ever made for the second by taking away the first. The truth is simply
                     this: God made a covenant or agreement with Abraham, when he was ninety-nine
                     years old, in which he promised to his seed the land of Canaan. The token or
                     memento of this contract was the circumcision of every male. This was the
                     condition of their entering Canaan. This is now the condition of
                     their restoration to it. The promise still stands. The Jews are still a
                     separate people. This is their mark. By this they are yet to claim
                     their inheritance. This is its object, and this the sum of its value. The
                     covenant has not been revoked. It is still in force, and its seal or token
                     still remains.
                  "God made with Abraham another covenant some twenty-four years
                     earlier, in which he promised him, among other things, 'that in his seed should
                     all the nations of the earth be blessed.'—Gen. 12: 3. This is what Paul refers
                     to when he says, Gal. 3: 8, 'the Gospel was preached unto Abraham,
                     and Abraham believed it.' He trusted in the Christ to come, and so was, in a
                     certain sense, a member of Christ's church. So was Noah—so was Enoch—so were
                     all who like Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto them for
                     righteousness. They were not introduced into it by
                     circumcision—nor was Abraham himself, for it was twenty-four years
                     after he heard and believed the Gospel, before he was circumcised. He was a
                     member of Christ's mystical body, and an heir of the heavenly
                     Canaan, without the seal of circumcision. By it he and his seed
                     became the heirs of the
                        earthly Canaan. This was its object, and no more. The blessings
                     of the Gospel are to us, as to him, the result of personal faith.
                     Thus, they who are of faith, are blessed with [believing] faithful Abraham, and
                     thus far, and no further, this first-made covenant with Abraham extends to us.
                     If we believe as he believed, we shall be blessed as he was blessed. This is
                     all that any one can make out of all that is said of the relationship of the
                     Patriarch and believers.
                  "I should have said to them further: Gentlemen, you call the
                     Jewish nation the church of God, and tell us, that the Christian
                     church is the same under a different dispensation. But Christ calls that nation
                        the world in opposition to his church. The disciples to whom
                     Christ spake, John 15:19, were men in good and regular standing in the Jewish
                     nation, which you call the church. Yet Christ says, I have chosen you out
                        of the world, and therefore the world, that is, the Jewish nation,
                     hateth you. Paul was not only a member, but an eminent member of
                     this Jewish body; but he says, that he was a persecutor of the
                     CHURCH OF GOD. Nicodemus was a 'master in Israel;' but Christ told him he could
                     not come into his church, till he had been born again. The Jews
                     needed conversion as much as any, before they could make any portion of the
                        church of God. This church God set up for the
                        first time when John began to preach. For the first time he
                     organized a visible assembly of penitent, believing, holy persons. There were
                     good men, pious, devoted men and women among the Jews; but they were not
                     gathered into a church. The Jewish nation had some religious
                     privileges; but it was not in the Gospel sense a church.—And when
                     Christ established his church, he made the terms of membership such as were
                     intended to preserve its purity, and separation from all national polities.
                     People were not to be born into it, but to enter it by faith and
                        baptism.— 'He that believeth and is baptized.' But by the
                     introduction of infant baptism, the object of this arrangement is entirely
                     defeated."
                  "I have often thought," said Theodosia, "since my attention has been directed
                     to the subject, what disastrous consequences must follow if the theory of
                     Pædobaptism were fully carried out, and infants actually recognized and treated
                     as members of the visible church."
                  "If you would fully realize what the consequences would be, you have only to go
                     to those States of Europe where this is actually done. You will see men who
                     blasphemed their Maker on the way to church, go and partake of the Holy Supper.
                     You will see them leave the church where they have so partaken, and openly
                     resort to the ball-room, the horse race, the drinking saloon, the gambling
                     house, the cockpit, and even to the very lowest and vilest haunts of
                     dissipation. They are members of the church. They were made such at eight days
                     old. When they could say the catechism they were confirmed, and informed,
                     according to the directions of the Presbyterian Confession of Faith, that 'it
                     is their duty and their privilege to come to the Lord's table.' To be baptized
                     in infancy and confirmed in childhood, are all that is needful to church
                     membership. That faith required by the Gospel, they laugh at They
                     call those who profess to know any thing about it in their own experience,
                     deluded enthusiasts. They know no more of religion than its external
                     ceremonies. They have the form of godliness, but deny the power. Such was the
                     Presbyterian church to which Dr. Carson preached in the North of Ireland. 'In
                     the general disregard of religion,' says his biographer, 'the people of his
                     charge were not behind their neighbors. Horse races, cock fights, and other
                     forms of sinful diversion were frequent, and were numerously attended even by
                     professing Christians. The soul of
                     this pious servant of God was deeply grieved.—He knew well the heaven-born
                     excellence of Christianity, and clearly understood what should be the fruits of
                     the Spirit, but he beheld around him only the works of the devil. He rode into
                     the throng that crowded the race-course, and saw there the members of his own
                     church flying in every direction to escape his sight.' ** 'His church was
                     composed of worldly people, whom neither force nor persuasion could bring into
                     subjection to the laws of Christ.' In Germany and some other European States,
                        every body is in the church. Every body is recognized as a
                     church member. Thieves, gamblers, drunkards and prostitutes are members of the
                     church. There is no such thing as the world. The church has swallowed it up. It
                     has taken all the infidelity, all the atheism, all the blasphemy, all the vice,
                     and all the depravity of the world into its own bosom. This is the natural and
                     necessary result of receiving all the infants as church members.
                     The church has ceased to be the body of Christ, and has become a loath-some
                     mass of 
                        hypocricy
                        hypocrisy
                      and vice. There may be in it some few good and pious believers in
                     Jesus. There are in it many upright, and honorable, and moral citizens; but
                     these, as church members, are not at all to be distinguished from
                     the basest profligates that issue forth from the reeking stews of infamy. They
                     have all alike been baptized in infancy and confirmed in childhood, without
                        any profession of conversion to God—most of them denying the
                     necessity of any such change, and all sit down alike to the same table of the
                     Lord."
                  "Surely, Mr. Courtney, you do not mean to speak thus of the
                        Protestant churches of Europe! I know it is true in regard to
                     the Catholics; but since the Reformation, it cannot be true of any others."
                  "Yes, Mrs. Jones, I mean to say this of the Protestant churches, wherever they
                     have become national churches, and by the process of infant
                     baptism have absorbed the whole population. It is necessarily true
                     of any church which receives its members in this way. It would be
                     true in this country, if you Presbyterians, and the Episcopalians,
                     and Lutherans, and Methodists, could by any means accomplish what you all so
                     earnestly are laboring to attain—viz.: to induce all the people to
                     have their children baptized."
                  "Oh, no, Mr. Courtney. You must have conceived a terribly mistaken idea of what
                     we are all aiming at. We desire, I trust, as much as the Baptists themselves,
                     to keep our churches pure, and are as strict in our terms of
                     membership and as rigid in our discipline as you are. We want our
                     churches to consist, as they now do, of Godly people, and would not for a day
                     permit such as you have mentioned to remain in our communion."
                  "I know it, Mrs. Jones; but in order to do this you are obliged continually to
                     repudiate your own acts, and deny in practice what you teach in theory. I was
                     speaking of what the result must be, provided you could induce all the people
                     to have their infants baptized, and should then recognize these baptized ones
                     as church members in fact, as you do in theory.
                  "Listen one minute, and I will satisfy you that what I say is strictly true.
                     You teach, that as circumcision was the door of entrance into the Jewish
                     church, so baptism is the door of entrance into the church of Christ. If so,
                     all who are baptized are church members. Now, you Presbyterians
                     say all the children of believing parents must be baptized. In
                     your churches, you baptize all the children of those parents who have been
                     baptized. The Episcopalians baptize any child for whom proper
                     sponsors will stand. The Methodists will baptize all the children,
                     with or without believing parents. Now if you could succeed (as by sermons,
                     books, tracts, and newspapers you are all striving to do) in convincing all the people that you
                     are right, and prevail upon them to bring all their children, and
                     have them thus initiated into the church of Christ—I ask you of whom, in
                        the next generation, would the church consist? It would be composed
                     of these infants, then grown to manhood. If that generation be like the
                     present, or the past, it will consist mostly of unregenerate men and women. A
                     few will be converted—many will be moral—most will be wicked, and many will be
                     most vile. They will all, however, have entered into the church of Jesus Christ
                     by the door of baptism, and will every one be members of Christ's visible
                     kingdom."
                  "Oh, no, Mr. Courtney, we would exclude the wicked and unworthy, by process of
                     discipline."
                  "Who would exercise discipline, Mrs. Jones? This would be a body of
                        unregenerate men. They would have no love to Christ or to his
                     cause. The power of discipline is in their own hands. If they exclude all that
                     do not give evidence of piety, they will exclude themselves. They will do no
                     such thing. They may exclude the openly and scandalously
                        vicious, for the reputation of their denomination, while there are
                     several sects striving for the supremacy; but if (as in those countries I spoke
                     of,) any one sect could swallow up the rest, and by connection
                     with the State become the national religion, then a man would hold
                     his right to the Lord's Supper, and all the privileges of the church, by about
                     the same tenure that he held his right to vote or to exercise any other
                     privilege of citizenship."
                  "But if this is so, Mr. Courtney, why don't we see at least some illustrations
                     of the principle among us now? Why are not our churches now filled
                     with unconverted men and women?"
                  "Simply because you don't act out your principles. Your churches
                        are filled with unbelievers, but you refuse to recognize nize
                     them. You daily repudiate your own acts, and continually falsify your own
                     theory. You baptize infants, and you say you do it to
                        introduce them into the church of Christ. But you don't believe
                        it. You never treat them as church members. You give them none of the
                     privileges of church members. You don't count them in the list of your church
                     members. They do not regard themselves as church members. They do not claim or
                     enjoy any of the privileges of membership. They do not exercise the discipline
                     of the church on others, nor are they considered subjects for its discipline.
                     They are practically as separate from the church as the children of an infidel
                     or a Hottentot. It is thus, and only thus, that you retain any
                     degree of purity in your actual membership. Your church consists, in
                        fact, of believers, and not, as your book says, of 'believers and
                        their children.' You thus obviate one of the evils of infant
                     baptism, by a virtual repudiation of the act and regarding it in practice as a
                     nullity. Mrs. Ernest does not look upon her son Edwin as a member of the
                     church. She did not consider you a member, Miss Theodosia, till about a year
                     ago, when you professed your faith in Christ, and as they all expressed it,
                        'joined the church.' How could you be said to join
                     it, if up to that time you had not been considered as separate
                     from it? The baptized children are urged, like others, to come out from
                        the world, and to unite with the people of God, when
                     they have believed in Christ and those who have thus believed, and
                     made for themselves a public profession of their faith, you count as members;
                     and to them and them alone you give the privileges of members. And this simple
                     fact, that you are obliged to treat the baptized infants, when
                     they grow up, as though they had not been baptized at all, in order to preserve
                     the spirituality and purity of the church, is of itself sufficient proof that
                        your celebrated historian,
                     Neander, tells the truth when he says. 'It is certain that Christ did not
                     ordain infant baptism.'"
                  "Well, Mr. Courtney," replied Professor Jones, is there any other argument you
                     would have urged upon the attention of my reverend visitors, had you been
                     present?
                  "Yes, sir. I would have said further: Gentlemen, if you found infant baptism on
                     Jewish circumcision; if you declare, that the Christian and the Jewish church
                     are the same, but only under different dispensations; and that because infants
                     were circumcised in the old, infants must be baptized in the new, how can you
                     get rid of the necessity for a national church? The Jewish church
                     was a national church: it united Church and State. The Christian is the same,
                     and it must consequently be a national establishment too. We must
                     unite the Church and State. For this, every Christian should strive. Of this
                     union, where it exists, no Christian should complain; for there is certainly as
                     much Scriptural authority for it as there is for infant baptism. And further,
                     gentlemen, you must receive and recognize not merely three orders of the
                     ministry, like the Episcopalians; not merely deacons, priests, and bishops, but
                     also a grand and supreme ruler of them all, similar to the Pope. The Jewish
                     polity had its common priests, its chief priests—who controlled certain numbers
                     of the others—and its High Priest, who was above them all. So to
                     correspond, there should be the Presbyters, the Bishops, and the Archbishops,
                     if not the Pope. This has quite as much, and the same sort of Scriptural
                     authority as infant baptism. To this, they would have replied, by saying, that
                     the constitution of the Christian church is to be found in the New
                        Testament, and that we learn what its officers were, by seeing what
                     ones were ordered or recognized by Christ and the apostles; and they neither
                     commanded nor recognized but one order of ministers. This is good
                     logic; I do not object to it. But I ask if the membership of the
                     Christian church is not designated in the New Testament even more clearly than
                     its officers? If baptism is the door of entrance, show me a single
                     instance where any one is permitted, much less commanded, to enter in upon the
                     faith of any but himself. Show me any instance in which an infant was received,
                     or ordered to be received; any in which one was recognized as a church member,
                     or even where there was the slightest allusion to him as such. They cannot find
                     one; and so, upon their own principles, must take the whole 
                        paraphrenalia
                        paraphernalia
                      of Episcopacy, and Church and State, or give up infant baptism."
                  "But, Mr. Courtney, as you say that among us Presbyterians in this country,
                     infant baptism is a mere nullity, as we don't count the baptized
                     as church members, or give up the discipline of the church into their hands; as
                     they have in fact, no more to do with the church than other people, and cannot,
                     therefore, injure its standing or diminish its spirituality, what harm
                        can it do to baptize infants?"
                  "What harm! Alas! madam, I am incompetent to tell the thousandth part of the
                     harm that it has done, is doing, and will continue to do so long as it is
                     practiced. Pardon me, if I decline attempting to answer your question."
                  "Well, then, if you can't tell what harm it does, why do you talk so much
                     against it?"
                  "I can't tell! Oh, yes, but I can tell. I can tell so much, that
                     you would not have the patience to hear. I can tell such things of it, that you
                     would almost think it impolite to mention. And that is, in truth the reason why
                     I felt disposed to decline a proper reply to your question. If I should speak
                     of this act, which you perform as a religious duty,
                     as I think it deserves, I should characterize it as a heinous sin,
                     an act of daring rebellion against God; and this you would think scarcely becoming in me as your
                     guest. If I should tell you all the harm I know of infant baptism, instead of
                     convincing, I should probably make you angry.—You have been so long accustomed
                     to look upon it as something sacred and holy, that you could hardly avoid
                     feeling indignant at hearing what I, after careful and prayerful study of the
                     subject, have come to think of it."
                  "I don't see how you could say much worse things about it than you have
                     already; but I assure you that I will keep my temper, let you say what you may.
                     So you may consider yourself as having full license to say to me in my own
                     house, anything that you would feel at liberty to say to me or any one anywhere
                     else."
                  "Yes," rejoined Mrs. Ernest, "do go on and tell us all you think about it. I
                     have some curiosity to understand just what you Baptists do think of us
                     Presbyterians. I know you have a very mean opinion of us, but I would like to
                     know just how mean it is."
                  "Go on, Courtney; you have the ladies' curiosity excited now, and you will be
                     obliged to gratify it. If you don't tell what you think, they will
                     imagine it is something very horrible indeed. For myself, I am satisfied now,
                     that it is a thing not commanded, and therefore I would not
                     practice it; but I don't see what great harm there is in it. It is
                     a simple ceremony, and if not required, a very useless one; but I
                     don't see who is hurt by it. We are, however, all of us prepared
                     now to hear hard things from the Baptists. We don't look for anything
                     else."
                  "I should be very sorry to believe that Baptists were accustomed to say hard
                     things of their opponents, whatever they may feel it their duty to
                     say to them. Mrs. Ernest thinks I have a very mean opinion of
                     Presbyterians. She is utterly mistaken. Many of the best and most
                     earnest-hearted hearted children of God whom I have ever known, are
                     Presbyterians. I not only esteem them highly, I love them dearly. I love them
                     not only as individuals, but as Christians. I count them my brethren and my
                     sisters in the Lord; but at the same time, I think they have been educated in
                     error, and are in some things most grossly deceived.—They are to that extent
                     wrong in their faith, and wrong in their practice. The more I love them, the
                     more I would rejoice to set them right. I hate error and wrong in them as in
                     others. I oppose it; I reason against it; I denounce it in them as well as in
                     others. It is not their persons, but their opinions that I war
                     against. In most cases, I do not even esteem them less for holding these
                     erroneous opinions; for I know they are sincere and conscientious. They have
                     been deceived by those who have instructed them. They have never had the truth
                     laid fairly before their minds.—Early education, denominational attachments,
                     and prejudices have enveloped their intellects in such a cloud, that it is hard
                     for the clear light of Scripture truth to find its way into their hearts. I was
                     as honest and sincere when I believed that sprinkling was baptism, and that
                     infants were to be baptized, as I am now. So was Miss Theodosia. Nor were we
                     suddenly convinced that we were wrong. The light shone in little by little.
                     What was at first a doubt, became a certainty by patient investigation. It is
                     not long since I said as you do—Infant baptism is not commanded. It is not
                     authorized by the Word of God, but still it is only a useless ceremony. Let
                     those who will, engage in it. No good is done; but yet it does no harm. Since
                     that time I have studied the subject more carefully. The more I looked at it,
                     the more fearful it appeared. And I am now fully convinced, that he who
                     baptizes an infant in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost is
                        guilty of a most enormous
                     
                     sin in the sight of God! And this is not less true because
                        good men have done it, and are doing it still. Good men have
                     often been ignorantly guilty of most enormous crimes. That excellent and holy
                     man of God, Rev. John Newton, was for years after his conversion engaged in the
                     slave trade, It was then considered a reputable and righteous
                     business.—Many good men of the past generation were engaged in the manufacture
                     and sale of intoxicating drinks. It was then considered a legitimate and
                     Christian calling. No good man will engage in it now. Their ignorance was their
                     excuse. God forgave them as he did Paul, for persecuting his people—because he
                     did it ignorantly, and verily thought he was doing God service. His
                     conscientious sincerity did not, however, make the act a righteous one. The
                     deed was still one of terrible wickedness and daring impiety. So I say of those
                     who practice infant baptism; so I would say to them if I could.
                     They may be good men. Some of them are good men—earnest,
                     warm-hearted, devoted Christians; but they are ignorantly sinning against
                        God. It may not be becoming in me to reprove men older,
                     and better, and more useful than myself; but surely I may entreat them, as my
                     brethren and fathers, to do 'no more so wickedly.'"
                  "But what is there so wicked about it, Mr. Courtney?"
                  "Much, every way. In the first place, if you will excuse me for talking so
                     plainly, infant baptism, as practiced by Presbyterians in this country,
                        is a continually repeated falsehood!
                  
                  "You say that 'baptism is a sacrament of the New Testament,
                     ordained by Jesus Christ, not only for the solemn admission of the
                     party baptized into the visible church, but also to be unto him a sign and seal
                     of the covenant of grace, of his ingrafting into Christ, of
                        regeneration, of emission
                     of sins, and of his giving up unto God, through Jesus Christ, to
                     walk in newness of life.'"—Con. of Faith, p. 44.
                  "Now, this is either true or false. If it is true, then the person
                     baptized is admitted into the visible church of Christ. You say it
                     is true, and that you do thus admit him; but, at the same time, if
                     I point you to one of these members thus received in infancy, staggering from
                     the grog-shop, and ask you if he is a member, you tell me, No. You
                     would be ashamed to think that such a wretch had any connection with your
                     church. Is his father a member? Yes, one of the best men in the church. Did he
                     have his children baptized? Yes, I suppose he did. Has this man ever been
                     excluded? No, you reply, he never joined the church. He grew up a
                     wild and reckless boy, and has always been a vicious, dissipated man. He was
                     never in the church; nobody ever thought of such a thing. There is an amiable
                     young lady, moral, irreproachable in her character; but she makes no
                     pretensions to religion—she is perfectly indifferent to it. Is
                        she a member of your church? Oh, no; our members are all
                     spiritual-minded Christians. She has never even expressed a conviction of sin,
                     or even the slightest desire to join the church. Why do you ask if she is a
                     member?—Simply because I remember when she was baptized. Does not
                     baptism admit persons into the visible church? Yes; but we never
                        consider them as members till they make a profession of
                     religion, and join the church again. Then your baptism is a solemn falsehood,
                     for it does not admit into the church at all.
                  "But now, if you take the other horn of the dilemma, and say we do
                     admit them, then I reply, you are guilty of introducing into the Church of
                     Christ wicked and unregenerate men and women. If you recognize them as members,
                     and treat them as members, you at once destroy the distinction between the church and the world. The church no
                     longer is Christ's kingdom. It is no more a body of His people. It
                     consists in part, at least, of the wicked and profligate
                        descendants of his people.
                  2. But you say, further, that Baptism is to the baptized 'a sign and a seal of
                     his ingrafting into Christ'—'of his regeneration'—and of remission of his
                     sins,' &c. Now this is true or it is false. You say it is
                     true. A mother brings her babe to have it sprinkled. It is a beautiful child,
                     and she verily thinks she is doing God service; and is herself a lovely object
                     as she stands there with the infant in her arms.—But now I ask you, Is that
                     child 'regenerated'? Is he a 'branch ingrafted into Christ'? Are all his 'sins
                     forgiven'? In other words, Is he a believer in Jesus Christ? You
                     say no; it is absurd to think of such a thing. Then I reply, your
                     baptism is a falsehood; for it is designed to signify and seal
                     these things, which in this subject do not and cannot exist. To a
                        believer in Christ, baptism has all this significancy; but to
                     an unconscious babe it can have none at all. There is not, in fact, in your
                     minds the slightest suspicion that the child is born again, and ingrafted into
                     Christ; and yet you say to the world, that this ordinance is designed to
                     signify and seal the fact that such is actually the case.
                  "Is it no harm thus in the house of God, as a religious act, and in the
                        very name of Jesus, to proclaim such practical falsehoods to the
                        world?"
                  "I declare, I had never thought of it in this light before. Have you any other
                     charge to make against it?"
                  "Yes; I say in the next place that, The baptism of an infant is an act of
                        high-handed rebellion against the Son of God."
                  Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Ernest both lifted up their hands in utter astonishment.
                     The former looked at him as though she expected to see him drop down dead,
                     after making what seemed to her such an impious announcement.
                  "That is a most astounding statement," said the Professor. "But I know you
                     would not make it, unless you thought you had the evidence to sustain it."
                  "What!" said Mrs. Jones, "The evidence to prove that it is
                     wicked!—positively wicked! to baptize a child; an act
                     of rebellion!—high-handed rebellion! Well, I will try to be quiet, just to see
                     what the man can say. Go on, Mr. Courtney; we are all
                     attention."
                  "Yes," resumed Mr. C., "I have said it; and I will prove that it is not only
                        rebellion, but rebellion attended with such circumstances as
                     mark it with a character of peculiar malignancy. Not only a sin, but a
                        terrible sin; most flagrant in itself, and most terrific in its
                     consequences to the church and to the world."
                  "Really," said Mrs. Jones, "I am curious to know how you will make it out."
                  "You know," said Mr. C., "that you Presbyterians are accustomed to count some
                     requirements of Christ as essential, and some as non-essential—or, at least,
                     less essential than others. Now when Christ came into the world,
                        one great object, if not the great object of his
                     mission, was to establish his visible church. He set it up
                     himself. He instructed his disciples carefully in the nature of its laws, and
                     especially those organic or constitutional laws which lay at the very
                     foundation of the whole superstructure. To these laws especially
                     he must have attached great importance. Willful disobedience to these
                     fundamental rules, which regulated and fixed the very nature of
                     the visible kingdom he established, must have been regarded by him as a
                     rebellion of no common order. Now the most important of these
                     fundamental rules was that which fixed the terms of membership in his kingdom. This lay at the
                     foundation of the whole business. The character, the influence, the prosperity
                     of his new kingdom, must depend upon the character of the persons of whom it
                     was composed. Now the Jewish kingdom, though it had in it much of good, and was
                     a beautiful type of better things to come, yet it had included more of the evil
                     than the good. In it the wicked dwelt in the land, and the righteous were among
                     them. But now Christ was organizing not a temporal, but a
                        spiritual kingdom.—His dominion was to be one of interior
                     rule—by the power of love. The subjects of this kingdom were to be
                        converted men and women, who loved God and lived to his glory.
                     No one could belong to it, as he told Nicodemus, who had not been born
                        again. This was his church. It was designed to be a permanent and
                     living illustration of the power and the purity of his religion. The members of
                     this church were to be his living epistles, known and read of all, describing
                     the nature and results of his religion in their hearts and lives.—No fact is
                     more clearly evident than this. The church is not only commanded to be
                     holy—exhorted to be holy—but it is said to be holy, and addressed as though it
                     was thus holy. It is always and every where regarded as a body of professedly
                     converted men and women. As many as were baptized into Christ had put on
                     Christ. They were those who trusted in Christ. They walked by faith. They
                     lived, but not they, it was Christ that lived in them. They had been sinners,
                     but were called to be saints, and now had an inheritance among them that were
                     sanctified. They were a peculiar people, zealous of good works. Not of the
                     world, not like the world, for Christ had chosen them out of the world. Such
                     was the church as he established it, and such he intended it should continue to
                     the end of time. Now to secure to it this character, he determined that none
                     should be admitted into it but those who repented of sin, and believed on him
                     with saving faith. The door of entrance into this church was by the ordinance
                     of baptism. Consequently, when any one repented and believed, and gave evidence
                     that he was born again, he was to be baptized, and henceforth counted among his
                     people. The very nature of the church, and the object of its establishment,
                     required that no others should ever be admitted. How then, I ask,
                     can he look without abhorrence and indignation upon that act in
                     which a minister of this church—claiming to act by his authority—subverts the
                     very foundation of his church, changes its nature, and defeats the very object
                     of its establishment, by introducing into it, knowingly and willfully, persons
                     who are confessedly not penitents, not believers, not regenerate, but the
                     children of wrath even as others.
                  "If baptism converted them—if by the act itself they were regenerated, there
                     would be some excuse for this course; but no one of you will
                     pretend to believe that it has any such influence. You know that a
                     baptized child grows up a sinner just as his unbaptized brother
                     does. Doctors of Divinity talk about such things; but no man or
                     woman of common sense believes that the sprinkling of a little water on a
                     baby's face changes its heart, and makes it a new creature in Christ Jesus. If
                     it is introduced by this act into Christ's visible church, it comes in a sinner
                     as it is born—it comes in an unconverted, impenitent, and unbelieving
                     sinner—just such a sinner as Christ forbade his ministers ever to
                     introduce.—And now what is the consequence? Let us look at the history of the
                     church. It is enough to make one who loves Jesus and his cause weep tears of
                     blood to see what have been the results of this rebellious departure from the
                     instructions of the Master. For the first two or three hundred years, the
                     church remained what Christ intended. It was a body of professed believers. All history accords to its
                     members a character of singular uprightness and purity. It was a light. shining
                     in darkness. But when infants, instead of converts, began to be introduced, its
                     whole character was changed.—Its spirituality was gone. Its very ministers were
                     worldly men, contending for wealth and place and power. In the course of a few
                     generations, it had, like the national churches of Europe of the present day,
                     swallowed up the world. All the villany and depravity of the land was in the
                     church, or in that establishment that called itself the church of
                     Jesus Christ. No Pagan, not even the tiger-hearted Nero himself, was so cruel
                     in his persecution of the Christians, as this body of baptized infants became
                     when it grew up to manhood, and was invested with the power to kill. Nothing
                     which the most infernal hatred could suggest, and the most diabolical ingenuity
                     could invent, was thought too hard for these baptized ones to inflict upon
                     those who professed faith in Christ, yet would not conform to their newly
                     introduced rites and ceremonies. The most bitter and relentless persecution was
                     directed especially against those who denied infant baptism. This has continued
                     through every age. It has not been confined to the Roman Catholics. It has been
                     practiced by all the so-called churches that received infant
                        members (your own included) whenever and wherever they have been able
                     to obtain the power. The world has been deluged with the blood of the saints,
                     shed by these members of the church, whom men professing to be his
                        ministers, have in his name, though against his authority, introduced
                     in their infancy.—Now I say, the act which thus subverts the very nature of the
                     church of Christ, and leads to such terrific consequences, is no common
                        sin. Such perversion of the very fundamental law of his church is no
                     common rebellion. It is a great and terrible crime. It has led to great and
                     terrible results, even in the present world Its consequences even here have
                     been so terrific that our very hearts shudder; but to think of them what they
                     may be in the eternal world, we cannot conceive.
                  "But I will go further. I said 'the baptism of an infant was a
                     sin—an act of high-handed rebellion against God.' I have
                     proved it. I will now say even more than this. Infant baptism is
                        impious—it is an act of sacrilege."
                  "Be careful, Mr. Courtney, be careful!" exclaimed Mrs. Jones. "This is a solemn
                     subject. You should not thoughtlessly make use of words which convey such
                     horrible impressions."
                  "I am careful, Mrs. Jones. I have chosen these words deliberately,
                     because they are the only words that will fully express my meaning. I mean to
                     say, that it is impious for a professed minister of Jesus Christ
                     to stand up in the presence of the world, and in HIS name, and by HIS
                     authority, perform, as a solemn and sacred ordinance of HIS religion, an act
                     which HE NEVER COMMANDED OR AUTHORIZED! I regard it as a fixed fact, that there
                     is no such commandment or authority. We have been searching for it carefully;
                     we cannot find it. It is not in the book. And now the question comes up—'Even
                     if it be not commanded, what harm is there in it?' This is the
                     question we are endeavoring to answer. I say, If God has not commanded it
                        or authorized it, then to perform it as an ordinance of HIS
                        religion, in HIS name, and by HIS professed
                        authority, is an act of impious sacrilege! It can be nothing less. I
                     know your preachers do not so intend it; I know that they would
                     shudder at the very thought. They verily believe they have the
                     authority. They do it ignorantly, as Paul persecuted the church.
                     But though their ignorance may, in a degree, excuse their conduct, it does not
                     change the nature of the act. And for one who has studied the subject, who
                        has looked for the authority and
                     failed to find it as we have, for such a one thus, in the
                     name of God, to do what God has not required, must require a degree of
                     temerity, which I trust few of the professed ministers of Christ possess."
                  "I declare, Mr. Courtney, it fills me with a sort of horror to hear you talk. I
                     am almost sorry I insisted on your saying anything about this subject. I don't
                     and can't believe that what you say is true. And yet I shall never be able
                     again to see an infant baptized without a feeling of terror."
                  "But why can't you believe that I tell the truth?—Have I not proved every
                     position by the Word of God?"
                  "Oh, as to that, anybody can prove almost anything they please by the
                     Scriptures. Unitarians, and Universalists, and Methodists, and Episcopalians,
                     and all sorts of people, find plenty of proof in the Bible for all they
                     teach."
                  "Then how are God's people to know what he requires of them?"
                  "Well, I don't see as we can know with any certainty. I have been
                     raised a Presbyterian, and taught that they were right; and I believe I had as
                     soon risk my soul on their faith as any other. I don't see as I need to give
                     myself much trouble about it."
                  "You do not deny, Mrs. Jones, that you ought to obey God rather than man, and
                     that the Scriptures are a perfect and infallible rule of faith and
                     practice?"
                  "Oh, no, I grant that; but the difficulty is, that I can't understand just what
                     they teach. If I could know what they require, I must believe and do it. But
                     Mr. Johnson tells me one thing, and you tell me another, and the Methodist
                     tells me another; and between you all, I don't know really what I must believe
                     or do."
                  "I will tell you, then. God will hold you responsible for
                        your own faith and practice. You are not, therefore, to rely on
                     me, or the Methodists, or on Mr. Johnson, but you are to go to the Bible for
                        yourself. If there is any command to baptize infants there, you
                     can find it, and you can read and understand it as well as a Doctor of
                     Divinity. Do not take for granted, that what they say or what I say is true,
                     but search the Scriptures for yourself. Make use of all the helps
                     you can, but don't let any one convince you that any doctrine is taught, or any
                     practice required, by the Word, till you can see it in the Word
                     You will not find the teachings of the Scriptures to be either doubtful or
                     contradictory when you go to them, and are willing to
                     believe and practice just what they teach. Doctors of Divinity may contradict
                     each other and themselves, but God's Word is not a book of doubtful oracles. It
                     speaks plainly; it speaks decidedly; and it speaks always the same thing. Try
                     it yourself with reference to this subject. Your pastor tells you that he has
                     authority in the New Testament to baptize infants. Ask him to show it to
                        you. If it is there, he can find it. You can see it as well as he
                     can. He will, perhaps, refer you to the commission, Go baptize, &c.; but
                     you will say, this is only a commission to baptize believers. It
                     does not say a word about believers and their children but only
                     about believers. He will then remind you, that Jesus said, Suffer the little
                     ones to come unto me, &c. You will reply, they did not come to be
                        baptized, but to be prayed for: 'And He laid his
                     hands on them and departed.' This is good authority to pray for
                     children, and to devote them to God by faith, and seek his blessing on them,
                     but none for baptizing them. He will then remind you, that Peter says, 'the
                     promise is to you and to your children.' You will reply, this is a promise of
                     the 'gift of the Holy Ghost,' not of baptism; and, moreover, it is limited to
                     those 'whom the Lord our God shall call;' and God does not call unconscious babes. He will then tell you, that
                     'the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband, &c.: else
                     were your children unclean, but now are they holy.' To this, your good sense
                     would reply, that there is here not a word about baptism; and if the
                        child is to be baptized because it is holy, so ought the
                     infidel husband and the infidel wife, for they are also sanctified or holy. He
                     will then seek to find some example. He will tell you, that there
                     were a number of families baptized, and it is almost
                     certain there must have been infant children in some of them. You
                     turn to each place, and find that they who were baptized, are the same who are
                     said to have heard the Word, believed in God, rejoiced in God, spake with
                     tongues, glorified God, ministered to the saints, and, in the case of Lydia's
                     family, are called brethren. Finding neither precept nor example
                     in the New Testament, he will turn to the Old, and tell you about the covenant
                     with Abraham, the seal of which was circumcision, and was applied
                     to the children. Now, he will say, this covenant includes Christians too; for
                     Paul says, All that believe are the children of believing Abraham. And if his
                     children by nature were circumcised, his children by faith must be
                     baptized. To this you will reply, true, his children by faith are
                     to be baptized, but who are they? Paul says they are believers,
                     not the infant offspring of believers. You will say, further, the Jewish
                     infants were circumcised because God expressly commanded it to be
                     done. But God never commanded Christians to baptize their infants. On the
                     contrary, He directed only the penitent, the believing, the regenerate, to be
                     baptized, which expressly excludes infants; and not a single infant ever was
                     baptized during the period of which we have the history in the Scriptures. He
                     has nothing more to offer. This is the substance and the sum of what he
                        calls Scriptural authority. Dare you now, with this light in your
                     mind, consider the baptism of an infant an ordinance of God? I say, then, try
                     it for yourself. Search the Scriptures, as the Bereans did, and see if these
                     things are so. I do not ask you to take my word for one solitary
                     fact or circumstance. Go to the Book. Go not to cavil, but to learn. Go not to
                     twist an argument out of it, but to ascertain your duty. Study it; pray over
                     it. Don't rest till your mind is satisfied. If you can't
                        find infant baptism in the Word, you may take it for granted it
                        is not there, even though all the Doctors of Divinity in Christendom
                     assert the contrary. If you do find it, bring the Book, and show
                     it to us benighted Baptists, and we will practice it; for we do earnestly
                     desire, if we know our own hearts, to 'do whatever Christ commands us.' If you
                     find it, it will be your duty to bring it to our notice; for in
                     that case we are in most woful error. If you are right, we are most
                        fearfully wrong. If God has commanded us to baptize our
                     infants, we are living in open and avowed rebellion.
                     But we desire to obey; and if you will show us our error, so far
                     from growing angry, we will thank you for the care that you show
                     for our good."
                  "There is much in what you have said, replied Professor Jones, "that strikes me
                     with amazement. I cannot deny, that infant baptism is in opposition to the Word
                     of God; but yet, I have never conceived of it as the terrible thing you have
                     represented it. I see, however, that it must be even so. If it does not
                     introduce people into the church, it is a falsehood on its very face; for this
                     is what it pretends to do. If it does introduce them, then it evidently
                     subverts the very foundation of the church, as a body of believers. And if God
                     has not commanded or authorized it, it must, indeed, be impious to do it in his
                     name, as though he had. I cannot deny this; but you made
                     some statements concerning the
                     results of its introduction, which I do not feel disposed to receive solely on
                     your assertion."
                  "My dear sir, I don't desire you to receive anything on my
                     assertion. What I do not prove, I beg you will consider as though
                     I did not say. I don't intend to make any assertion, that I cannot sustain by
                     the very best of testimony."
                  "You said, that infant baptism was not introduced in the time of the first
                     Christians, nor until several hundred years after Christ. And that all
                     churches, both Protestant and Catholic, who had embraced it, had persecuted the
                     saints whenever and wherever they possessed the power. All this is quite at
                     variance with what I have always regarded as the truth. I do not deny that it
                     is so, but I cannot believe it without the evidence."
                  Mr. Courtney glanced at the clock, as he replied:
                  "It is now near bed-time. We will not have time to-night; but at any time you
                     may suggest, I will convince you that I did not speak without reason. I will
                     prove to you, by the testimony of the ancient Fathers, by the testimony of
                        your own most eminent historians and divines, that what I said
                     is strictly and entirely true. I will show you, that infant baptism was
                     introduced in the same way, and by the same sort of authority, that pouring and
                     sprinkling were—only that it began at a somewhat earlier day. I will show you,
                     too, what were the consequences to the true believers, who refused to sanction
                     the innovation—how they were driven out to dwell in caves and dens of the
                     earth—how they were tortured and tormented—hunted like wild beasts; and that
                     not a few hundreds, or thousands, but millions, have gained a martyr's
                     crown—slain for the testimony of Jesus; not by Pagans; not by infidels; not by
                     the people of the world; but by the members of the (so-called)
                     churches of Jesus Christ, made members in their infancy by this
                        blessed' ordinance of infant baptism.—Where shall we meet?"
                  "Oh, come back here," said Mrs. Jones. "I begin to feel a sort of fearful
                     interest in your strange teachings, something—if you will pardon the
                     comparison—like I would expect to feel in the dying speech of some outlawed
                     wretch, denouncing, on the very scaffold, all that good men hold dear and
                     sacred. I do not mean any disrespect, but I cannot think of anything else which
                     will so well describe my emotions. I shudder while you talk, to think that you
                     should dare to speak of one of the most beautiful and holy rites of our
                     religion as of a deadly sin; and yet I want to hear all that you have to say.
                     Sister Ernest and Theodosia will come over with you again to morrow night."
                  "So be it, then. We will meet here to-morrow night."
               
               
                  
                  THE NINTH NIGHT'S STUDY
                  OF THE TIME AND MANNER IN WHICH THE BAPTISM OF INFANTS WAS
                     SUBSTITUTED BY MEN FOR THE BAPTISM OF BELIEVERS, WHICH CHRIST COMMANDED.
                  
                  NINTH NIGHT'S STUDY.
                  THERE was no one of the company that assembled at the Professor's house on
                     Tuesday evening, to continue this discussion, who looked so anxiously for the
                     time of meeting, as did Mrs. Jones. The idea that an act which she had always
                     regarded as one of the most beautiful and holy of all the rites pertaining to
                     our holy religion, was really no part of that religion, but in fact directly
                     opposed to it, and forbidden by it, had haunted her mind continually ever since
                     the last night's conversation. She had awakened her husband at midnight, to
                     tell him that she should ever after be afraid to see an infant child
                     baptized—and all the day she had been anxiously looking at the arguments of Mr.
                     Courtney, as she called them up one after another in her memory, but could see
                     no fallacy in the reasoning, though it lead to what she considered such fearful
                     conclusions. One reflection, however, gave her some comfort. Infant baptism
                        could not be a sin, otherwise good men could not have practiced
                        it. She was sure therefore that there must be some defect in his
                     reasoning, though she could not see it.
                  And when they had come together, she began the conversation by asking Mr.
                     Courtney, if he had not said that he regarded Presbyterian and other
                     Pædobaptist ministers as good and pious men?
                  "Certainly; I said that I knew some such. Men of God, whom I love as my
                     brethren in the Gospel. And I know personally of no one among them, whom I
                     would be willing to condemn as being a worse man than myself."
                  
                  "But how can you say that, Mr. Courtney, when you know that they all practice
                     infant baptism, and teach others to do so, which you say is not only a sin, but
                     a most grievous sin: not only sin, but impious sacrilege? It seems to me you
                     are the most inconsistent man I ever heard talk."
                  "Will you permit me, madam, to answer your question by asking several others?
                     Were Luther, and Calvin, and the Reformers good and holy men?"
                  "Of course they were, Mr. Courtney. No one has ever doubted that."
                  "Was Archbishop Cranmer, who suffered martyrdom for his religion, under Mary,
                     Queen of Scots, a good and holy man?"
                  "Certainly; he must have been."
                  "Were our Puritan Fathers, who settled New England, good and holy men,
                     deserving our reverential and affectionate remembrance for their Christian
                     principle which led them to sacrifice all for a conscience void of
                     offence?"
                  "Most assuredly they were; but what has that to do with my question?"
                  "You will see, madam, when I have asked one more. Is it not a great and fearful
                     sin to persecute and take the lives of men for their religious faith?"
                  "Of course it is; and no good man will do it."
                  "And yet, madam, our Pilgrim Fathers persecuted the Quakers and the Baptists,
                     and condemned them to banishment and death. Cranmer, before he was burnt, had
                     been very officious and energetic in bringing Baptists to the stake. (See
                     Neal's History of the Puritans.) Calvin procured the condemnation of Servetus
                     for his religion, and Luther urged the princes of his country to persecute
                     those who could not conform to his opinions. You see, therefore, that good and
                     pious men may be led by their very piety, (under mistaken notions of duty,) to
                     do things which are most fearfully wrong and sinful. Paul verily
                        thought he was doing God service when he killed the followers of
                     Jesus; but his mistake did not make the action right. It was still a most awful
                     sin.—He did it ignorantly, and God forgave him. So he will forgive your
                     Pædobaptist brethren who in their ignorance imagine they are obeying him in
                     baptizing little children into his church. But the act is sinful, terribly
                     sinful, nevertheless. You are to take God's Word, not the example
                     of those whom you consider holy men, as your standard of right."
                  "If I did not misunderstand you," said uncle Jones, "you told us last night,
                     that infant baptism was utterly unknown in the time of the first Christians.
                     Now this is altogether at variance with what our ministers have always taught
                     us to believe. I am sure that they have labored sedulously to make the
                     impression on our minds, that from the very times of the Apostles till about
                     six hundred years ago, no one had ever questioned that infants should be
                     baptized. I am sure that I have been told again and again, from the pulpit and
                     in private conversation, that it was the united testimony of all
                     the Fathers, that infant baptism was received from the Apostles, and that we
                     not only have no account of the time and manner of its introduction, but no
                     history of any period of the church when it was not universally received and
                     practiced.
                  "Very likely," replied Mr. Courtney, "Doctors of Divinity often deal in just
                     such sweeping assertions The same men who assure you that the New Testament
                        abounds with proof of infant baptism, though no man living or
                     dead, has ever been able to show for it a single precept or example, can well
                     afford to make just such statements about history. And I say to them in this,
                     as in the other case, If there be any record of infant baptism in the first
                     ages of the church, you can
                     show it, and I can see it. Your mere assertions are
                     not worth a straw—bring in your proof."
                  "But have they no such proof?" asked Mrs. Jones.—"Surely the ministers of our
                     church are as good and as truthful as those of any church, and would not make
                     such assertions without good and sufficient authority."
                  "I will answer your question, madam, by referring you to the writings of some
                     of the most eminent ecclesiastical historians who were Pædobaptists, like
                     yourselves, but who would not stoop to falsify history to promote the interests
                     of a creed. Let me ask your attention, and yours especially, Professor Jones,
                     to the testimony of a very remarkable class of these witnesses. Soon after the
                     Reformation, a project was set on foot by the Pædobaptist Protestants of
                     Germany, to collect and embody in a permanent form all the known and reliable
                     facts in the history of the early Christian churches. A great number of the
                     most learned and eminent men of Europe engaged in the work. They had access to
                     all the stores of ancient learning, and were fully competent to explore and
                     appropriate them. Lutheran princes and powerful nobles were patrons of the
                     work, and neither money nor labor was spared to make it a faithful picture of
                     the ancient churches. It proposed to give the history of each century by
                     itself; and as it was published at Magdeburg, its authors are commonly called
                     the 'Magdeburg Centuriators.' It was executed with great care, and
                     has ever since its publication been regarded as one of the most faithful and
                     accurate records of early church history. Now, I want you to remember that
                     there was not a single Baptist among these men; and then observe their
                     language, which is as follows: 'They [the Apostles 'baptized only
                     the adult or aged, whether Jews or Gentiles, 'whereof we have instances in Acts
                     2, 8, 10, 16 and 19th 'chapters. As to the baptism of infants we
                     have no example ple. As to the manner of baptizing, it was by
                        dipping or 'plunging into the water, in the name
                     of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, according to the allusions contained in the
                     '6th of Romans and the 2d of Colossians.' They speak of the first century, and
                     of the second century they say: 'It 'does not appear from any approved authors
                     that there was 'any change or variation from the former century in regard 'to
                     baptism.'
                  "The learned and acute Erasmus, writing about the same time, says, in his Notes
                     on the 6th of Romans, 'It is nowhere expressed in the apostolic writings that
                     they baptized children.'
                  "John Calvin, the founder of your Presbyterian church, says, 'It is no where
                     expressed by the Evangelists that any one infant was baptized.'
                  "Ludovicus Vives, a name of high historical authority, says, 'None of old was
                     wont to be baptized but in grown age, and who desired it, and understood what
                     it was.'
                  "Dr. Taylor, of the Church of England, says, 'It is against the perpetual
                     analogy of Christ's doctrine to baptize infants; for besides that, Christ never
                     gave any precept to baptize them, nor ever himself or his Apostles (that did
                     appear) did baptize any of them. All that he or his Apostles said concerning
                     it, requires the previous dispositions of baptism, of which infants are not
                        capable.'—Liber. Proph., p. 289.
                  "Dr. Mosheim, who is universally known and regarded as high Pædobaptist
                     authority, says, in his Ecclesiastical History of the first century: 'No
                     persons were admitted to baptism but such as had been previously instructed
                     into the principal points of Christianity, and had also given
                        satisfactory proof of pious dispositions and upright intentions.' Of
                     the second century he says: 'The sacrament of baptism was, during this century,
                     administered publicly twice a year at the festivals of Easter and Whitsuntide. The persons to be baptized, after
                     they had repeated the creed, confessed and renounced their sins, particularly
                     the devil and his pompous allurements, were immersed under water, and received
                     into Christ's kingdom by a solemn invocation.' Of course they were not
                     unconscious infants.
                  "Neander, another of your own historians, who has a world-wide reputation, says
                     expressly: 'Baptism was administered at first only to adults, as men were
                     accustomed to conceive of baptism and faith as strictly connected. We have all
                     reason for not deriving infant baptism from Apostolic institution, and the
                     recognition of it (which followed somewhat later) as an Apostolical
                        tradition, serves to confirm this hypothesis.'
                  "Coleman, another of your own writers, and a citizen of our own country, says:
                     'Though the necessity of infant baptism was asserted
                     in Africa and Egypt in the beginning of the third century, it was
                     even to the end of the fourth by no means generally observed,
                     least of all in the Eastern church, and it finally became a general
                     ecclesiastical institution in the age of Augustine,' which you know was at the
                     beginning of the fifth century.
                  "Now tell me what sort of consciences your ministers must have when they
                     assert, in the face of such testimony as this, from their own most
                        eminent historians, that infants were always considered right
                     subjects for baptism! But this is not all. We have positive proof that
                     Constantine and Gregory, and a great multitude of eminent men whose history is
                     recorded, and who are known to have been born of Christian parents and reared
                     in Christian communities, were yet not baptized till they had made their
                     profession of faith in mature years,—while there is not on record a single,
                     solitary instance of the baptism of a child till the year of our
                     Lord three hundred and seventy, and that was the son of the Emperor Vallens,
                     which was thought to be dying, and was baptized by the command of his majesty,
                     who swore he would not be contradicted: and moreover, this was not a little
                     infant, but a boy of six years old.—See Robinson's Hist.
                  "Now, if in the face of this testimony they say that infant baptism was
                     practiced, let them show the proof. Let them bring a single case. Let them
                     prove their own most eminent ecclesiastical historians to be false
                     witnesses—and we will attach all due importance to their statements."
                  "But, surely, Mr. Courtney," replied Mrs. Ernest, "our ministers cannot be
                     acquainted with these testimonies."
                  "It is their own fault then," said he. "These books are in their libraries—they
                     quote them on other subjects—and if they do not know what they teach on this,
                     it is because they willfully close their eyes to the light in order that they
                     may remain in ignorance."
                  "You say," rejoined Theodosia, "that these writers, who make such concessions,
                     are Pædobaptists. They were members of churches which baptize infants by
                     sprinkling. They were themselves baptized by sprinkling in their infancy; and
                     yet they state, in most express terms, that it was not so commanded by
                     Christ—it was not so ordained by the Apostles—and nothing of the sort was
                     practiced by the first Christians, nor for several hundred years. How, then,
                     could they conscientiously remain even for a day in their church connection? I
                     cannot understand what sort of consciences such men have."
                  "Nor can I, Miss Ernest, but I will let them speak for themselves. The learned
                     Curcelleus is one of them, and he says: 'Infant baptism was not known in the
                     world the first two centuries after Christ. In the third and fourth it was
                     approved by few, but at length in the fifth it began to obtain in divers places; and therefore,' he
                     continues we Pædobaptists observe this rite indeed as an ancient
                        custom, but not as an apostolic institution. The custom of baptizing
                     infants did not begin before the third century after Christ, and there appears
                     not the least foot-step of it for the first two centuries.' Or if you prefer a
                     more recent exposition of their reasons, take Kitto's Cyclopædia of Biblical
                     Literature, a standard Pædobaptist theological work, and turn to page 287, vol.
                     2."
                  "I have the book on the table here," said uncle Jones.—"Here, Theo., find the
                     place and read. Here it is."
                  "'Infant baptism was established neither by Christ nor his Apostles. In all
                     places where we find the necessity of baptism notified, either in a dogmatic or
                     historical point of view, it is evident that it was only meant for those who
                     were capable of comprehending the word preached, and of being converted to
                     Christ by an act of their own will.'
                  "'A pretty sure testimony of its non-existence in the days of the Apostles, may
                     be inferred from 1 Cor. 7; 14, since Paul would certainly have referred to the
                     baptism of infants for their holiness; but even in later days, several teachers
                     of the Church, such as Tertullian (De Bapt.) and others, reject this custom.
                     Indeed his church in general (that of North Africa) adhered longer than others
                     to the primitive regulations. Even when the baptism of infants was already
                        theoretically derived from the Apostles, its
                        practice was, nevertheless, for a long time confined to a
                     mature age.'
                  "Did you not say that the author of this work was a Pædobaptist, Mr.
                     Courtney?"
                  "Certainly I did. It was prepared by a number of very learned and eminent
                     Pædobaptist divines, and is regarded by Pædobaptists as a standard theological
                     work."
                  Well, I must say that Pædobaptist theological writers are strange people,"
                     replied Theodosia, "but I will read on—'In support of a contrary opinion the
                     advocates [of infant baptism] in former ages (now hardly any) used to appeal to
                     Matt. 19: 14, Suffer little children, &c.; but their strongest argument in
                     its favor is the regulation of baptizing all the members of a household or
                     family, 1 Cor. 16: 17; Acts 8: 8; 16: 33; but in none of these instances has it
                     been proved that there were little children among them. And even supposing that
                     there were, there was no necessity for excluding them from baptism in plain
                     words, since such exclusion was understood as a matter of course.'"
                  "Surely, Mr. Courtney, the man is a Baptist!"
                  "Oh, no," said Mr. Courtney; "read on. You will come to his strong reasons
                     presently." She read on:
                  "'Many circumstances conspired early to introduce infant baptism. The confusion
                     between the outward and inward conditions of baptism, and the magical effect
                     that was attributed to it; confusion of thought about the visible and the
                     invisible church; condemning all those who did not belong to the former; the
                     doctrine of the natural corruption of man so closely connected with the
                     preceding; and finally the desire of distinguishing Christian children from the
                     Jewish and heathen, and of commending them more effectually to the care of the
                     Christian community—all these circumstances and many more, have contributed to
                     the introduction of infant baptism at a very early period.'"
                  "Now we will come to his reasons. He has told us that it is not in
                     the Scriptures; that it was not ordained by Christ; that it was not known to
                     the Apostles; that it was the offspring of that error which attributed a
                        magical influence to baptism, and to the mistaken idea that no
                     one could be saved without it—together with numerous other circumstances stances; and now read on, if you
                     please, and learn the reasons why he, notwithstanding all this, is a
                     Pædobaptist.'"
                  "'But on the other hand, the baptism of children is not at all at
                        variance with the principles of the Christian religion, after what
                     has been observed on the separation of regeneration and baptism; for since it
                     cannot be determined when the former begins (the real test of its existence
                     being only in the holiness continued to the end of a man's life), the
                        fittest point of baptism is evidently the beginning of life.'
                     'Nevertheless, the profession of faith is still needed to complete it.
                     Confirmation, or some equivalent observance, is therefore a very important
                     consummation. The fides infantium [faith of
                     infants] is an absurd assumption of which the Scriptures know nothing.' 'On the
                     other hand, the baptized child is strongly recommended to the community and to
                     the Spirit of God dwelling therein, becoming the careful object of the
                     education and holy influence of the church: 1 Cor. 7: 14. Nature and
                        experience therefore teach us to retain the baptism of infants now
                     that it is introduced.'"
                  "Oh, yes," said Mrs. Jones, "I always feel a much greater interest in children
                     that have been baptized. It is such a blessed privilege to bring our little
                     ones to God, and dedicate them to him in the presence of all his people."
                  "For my part," replied Mr. Courtney, "I greatly prefer Christ and his apostles,
                     to 'nature and experience,' as my teachers in religion. It is, indeed, a
                     blessed privilege to be allowed to dedicate our children to God; and for doing
                     this, we have full authority in the Word of God. We are to dedicate them by
                     faith and prayer, and bring them up for Him. But let me say to you, in the
                     language of Dr. Dwight, one of the most eminent ministers of your own church,
                     'Nothing is a privilege, in the religious sense, but what God has made such;
                     and he has made nothing such, except in his own way and on his own terms.
                     Baptism is a privilege when administered and received in the manner appointed
                     by Him, but in no other. When this ordinance is received in any
                     other manner, it is plainly no obedience to any command of his, and therefore
                     has no promise—and, let me add, no encouragement to hope for a
                        blessing.'"—Dwight's Sermons, vol. iv. p. 343.
                  "I am almost afraid," said uncle Jones, "that you will think me captious; but I
                     cannot yet feel quite satisfied about this matter. You have, indeed, shown very
                     clearly, that many very eminent historians and standard writers, who, it is
                     well known to all the world, were Pædobaptists, have conceded—and, indeed, have
                     in some sense proved—that infant baptism did not originate till
                     the third century, or later.—But yet, it seems to me, that I have seen
                     quotations from the early Fathers themselves, which proved that baptism of
                     infants had been practiced from the very first. Has there not been recently
                     discovered some ancient manuscript, which throws light upon this subject? I am
                     sure I have heard some rumor of such a thing."
                  "You are not at all mistaken," replied Mr. Courtney.—"A manuscript of
                     Hippolytus was found, in 1842, in an Armenian convent on Mount Athes, in
                     Turkey, by Minoides Minas, a Greek scholar of celebrity, who was employed at
                     the time by M. Villeman to search for ancient books and manuscripts. This work
                     has been carefully examined by many eminent critics and scholars, and there is
                     now no doubt that it is genuine. Mr. Bunsen, a very noted Pædobaptist scholar,
                     has made it the basis of a book on the early churches, in the preparation of
                     which, he consulted also the ancient canons and constitutions."
                  "But pray tell us who was Hippolytus?"
                  "He was the pastor or bishop of the church at Pontus, near the mouth of the Tiber, in Italy, and had
                     been a pupil of Iræneus. He lived in the early part of the third century, and
                     probably wrote the work in question about 225 or 230 years after Christ."
                  "Well, what is his testimony about baptism?"
                  "He says: 'We in our days never defended the baptism of children, which in my
                     day had only begun to be practiced in some regions, unless it were
                     as an exception and innovation. The baptism of infants we did not
                     know.' And Mr. Bunsen, his translator and editor, adds (vol. iii. p.
                     180):—'Pædobaptism, in the more modern sense—meaning thereby baptism of
                     new-born infants, with the vicarious promises of parents or other sponsors—was
                     utterly unknown to the early church, not only down to the end of the second
                     century, but indeed to the middle of the third.'"
                  "But," asked Mrs. Jones, "is there nothing at all in the early Fathers in favor
                     of infant baptism?"
                  "Not one word, madam, for the first two centuries—not even an
                     allusion to it. It had not yet been invented. They had never heard of
                        it, nor, so far as we can judge from their writings, had they so much
                     as thought of it.
                  "CLEMENS, who is counted among the first, and is said to have been a companion
                     of Paul, says: 'They are right subjects of baptism who have passed through an
                     examination and instruction.'
                  "IGNATIUS, of the same age, who is said to have been a disciple of John, and to
                     have seen and talked with Peter and Paul, says: 'Baptism ought to be
                     accompanied with faith, love, and patience, after preaching.' The other writers
                     of this century were Clement of Rome, Polycarp, Hermes, and Barnabas (?); but
                     it is admitted by those who have searched for it most diligently, that
                        not one word about infant baptism is to be found in any of
                     their works. So also in the second century, Dr. F. A. Cox, as quoted by
                     Orchard, says: 'Justin Martyr, Athenagoras, Theophilus of Antioch, Tatian,
                     Minucian, Felix, Iræneus, and Clement of Alexandria, constitute the Christian
                     writers of this second century; who, so far from directly speaking
                     of infant baptism, never once utter a syllable upon the
                     subject.'
                  "CLEMENT says, indeed: 'The baptized ought to be children in malice, but not in
                     understanding: even such children who, as the children of God, have put off the
                     old man with the garments of wickedness, and have put on the new man.' These
                     are the only children he speaks of as having a right to baptism."
                  "You mentioned Iræneus," said uncle Jones. "If I do not forget, I have heard
                     him quoted as authority for infant baptism."
                  "I have no doubt of it. Those Doctors of Divinity who consider baptism and
                     regeneration as all the same thing, have discovered in his writings the
                     following sentence: 'Christ passed through all ages of man, that he might save
                     all by himself; all, I say, who are by him regenerated to
                     God—infants, and little ones, and children, and youths, and persons advanced in
                     years.' Now, this is the only allusion which it is pretended that
                     Iræneus makes to infant baptism; and some have had the temerity,
                     not to say the dishonesty—since they themselves consider baptism and
                     regeneration as the same thing, and because Iræneus, in some other
                     place, uses regenerate in the sense of baptize—to strike out
                        regenerated here and put in baptized, and then
                     refer to Iræneus as having recognized infant baptism."
                  "I am sure," said Theodosia, "that the cause must be a very weak
                     one which requires such support, and they must be very weak advocates of any
                     cause, who could stoop to employ such arguments in its favor."
                  
                  "So also it is claimed by some, that Justin Martyr recognized the baptism of
                     infants when he says to some aged Christians, that they had been the followers
                     of Christ from their childhood; or, as these men read from their
                        infancy.—But it is well known, that in those days all
                        minors—that is, all under twenty-five years of age, for that
                     was considered the limit of manhood—were often called children, and even
                     infants; and we read of some instances of persons becoming bishops while they
                     were infants—that is, before they came of age—and of many persons
                     being led to martyrdom while they were infants, and making earnest
                     profession of the faith which they felt in their hearts, and sealed with their
                     blood. The Baptists will baptize as many such infants as desire to enter into
                     the church of Jesus Christ. But you will not accuse us, on that account, of
                     practicing the baptism of unconscious babes;*
                      and these mentioned by Justin Martyr, are not said to have been
                        baptized in infancy, but to have followed Christ from their
                     infancy. It is not till the beginning of the third century, that we find the
                     very first certain allusion to the baptism of children; and these were not
                     babes, but little boys and girls old enough to ask for baptism,
                     though yet too young to understand its import.
                  
                     
                     *For an immense amount of testimony on this point, see Robinson's History
                        of Baptism.
                  
                  "By this time, salvation and baptism had begun to be regarded as inseparable,
                     and loving parents began to inquire anxiously, what will become of our children
                     if they die unbaptized? To this, the answer commonly given was, that they must
                     be lost. Why not, then, baptize, and so secure their salvation? It seems that a
                     certain wealthy lady, named Quintilla, who was probably a mother, and felt this
                     very natural anxiety about her little ones, had come to the conclusion, that if
                     they asked for baptism, they ought to have it, whether they gave
                     evidence of conversion or not; and she wrote a letter to Tertullian, the bishop
                     of the church at Carthage, to get his sanction to this novel doctrine. The
                     answer of Tertullian to this letter has been preserved, and contains the
                        first undoubted allusion to the baptism of children, which is
                     recorded in the annals of church history."
                  "If infant baptism had been a universal custom, as is pretended by some," said
                     Theodosia, "there never could have been any occasion for Quintilla to write to
                     Tertullian on the subject, for children would have been baptized, as a matter
                     of course, whether they asked for it or not."
                  "Very true; and Tertullian would have replied to her, that it had always been
                     the practice of the church to baptize the little darlings, and she need not
                     even wait for them to ask for it; but he did no such thing. 'Those who
                     administer baptism,' he says, 'know very well that it is not to be rashly
                     given.' The good lady evidently thought that it was enough if the children
                     could ask for it, and had quoted the Scripture, 'Give to him that
                     asketh.' To this, Tertullian says: What! give to him that asketh! Every one
                     hath a right to it as to a thing of alms! Nay! say, rather, give not that which
                     is holy to the dogs; cast not your pearls before swine; lay hands suddenly on
                     no man; be not partaker of other men's sins.' It would seem that she had
                     referred to the cases of the Eunuch and of Paul, as having received the
                     ordinance as soon as they asked for it. And to this, Tertullian replies: 'If
                     Philip baptized the Eunuch on the spot, let us remember that it was done under
                     the immediate direction of the Lord The Eunuch was a believer of
                     the Scripture; the instruction given by Philip was seasonable; the one
                     preached, the other perceived the Lord Jesus, and believed on him. Water was at
                     hand, and the apostle, having finished the affair, was caught away. But you
                     say, Paul was baptized instantly.
                     True, because Judas, at whose house he was, instantly knew that he was a vessel
                     of mercy. The condescension of God may confer his favors as he pleases, but
                        our wishes may mislead ourselves and others.
                  "This lady seems to have referred, as you do, to the words of Jesus, 'Suffer
                     little children,' &c. And to this Tertullian says, as Baptists do now, 'The
                     Lord does indeed say forbid them not to come unto me; and let them come while
                     they are growing up; let them come and learn, and let them be
                        instructed when they come; and when they understand
                        Christianity, let them profess themselves Christians.'
                  "In another of his works, Tertullian says, 'Adults are the only proper subjects
                     of baptism, because fasting, confession of sins, prayer, profession, renouncing
                     the devil and his works, are required of the baptized.'
                  "It is evident, therefore, that at this time, the beginning of the third
                     century, the baptism of children had just begun to be spoken of.
                  "Now, strange as it may seem to you, your Doctors of Divinity are accustomed to
                     base the strongest of all then historical arguments on this letter of
                     Tertullian to Quintilla.'
                  "How is that possible?"
                  "They say, Infant baptism must have existed, or Tertullian would
                     not have opposed it. If it existed then, it must have existed from
                     the first, because we have no history of its introduction, and no
                     account of any previous opposition to it. And it is incredible that it could
                     have been introduced without opposition."
                  "And what answer," said Mrs. Jones, "can you make to such reasoning as
                     that?"
                  "We simply say that it did not exist before. That this is the
                        first proposal to introduce it, and that it was
                     opposed."
                  "Very satisfactory, I declare! But what evidence have you that this
                        was the first?"
                  "The best evidence that is possible: It is the first on record. If
                     the advocates of infant baptism say there was any previous one,
                     let them produce it. But we might put our defence on different
                     ground. We might admit that infant baptism was at the beginning of the third
                     century a generally received and recognized custom of the
                     churches, and yet it would not follow by any means, that it was received
                     from the Apostles or had any Divine authority.
                  "You do not believe that the Episcopal and Catholic rite of confirmation is of
                     Divine authority, and yet it can be traced back as far as infant baptism. You
                     do not believe that there is any Divine authority for signing the baptized with
                     the sign of the cross, yet Tertullian distinctly recognizes this
                     as an existing custom in his day. So he does the giving of the newly baptized a
                     mixture of milk and honey, and anointing them with holy oil. The doctrine of
                     baptismal regeneration and of purgatory both date back to or before this early
                     day, as do the observance of some of the feast days and fast days, and a vast
                     amount of the most absurd and silly mummery of the Romish church.
                  "The first we read of these fooleries, they were already in the churches; they
                     had, so far as we know, never been opposed, they were there long before we find
                     any trace of infant baptism there, and yet who of you will dare to say, on
                     these grounds, that Christ and his apostles ordained that candidates for
                     baptism should be divested of their clothing—should have salt put in their
                     hands—should be daubed with the priest's spittle—clothed in white on coming out
                     of the water—signed with the sign of the cross—anointed with chrism—walk from
                     the water with a lighted taper in their hands, &c., &c.
                  "The truth is, the simplicity of the gospel was corrupted even in the Apostles' days; and it was not the least 
                        onorous
                        onerous
                      of their labors to prevent and correct unauthorized additions to and
                     modifications of their teachings. The simple fact, there fore, that we
                        find any doctrine or any practice in the churches at an early day, is no
                        evidence at all that it was received either from Christ or his
                        apostles. The Scriptures are our only guide. This you as
                     Protestants admit, and by this you are precluded from all recourse to 'the
                        traditions of the first Christians, in regard to infant
                     baptism, or anything else concerning the doctrines and ordinances of our
                     religion. So that it is nothing to you nor to me if infant baptism
                        had existed before Tertullian's time. We have shown, however,
                     that so far from being a general practice before that time, it then was for the
                     first time proposed, and it required all the third and most of the fourth to
                     secure it any considerable foothold in the churches, and that it did not become
                        established as an ecclesiastical institution till the time of
                     Augustine, in the early part of the fifth century.
                  "It is true, as you may read in almost every writer on baptism, that
                        Cyprian, who was the successor of Tertullian in the church at
                     Carthage, received a letter from one Fridus, of whom nothing more is known than
                     that he wrote such a letter, asking how soon after birth it might
                     be proper to baptize. This was about forty years after Tertullian wrote to
                     Quintilla on the subject. Cyprian, it seems, did not feel quite able to decide
                     this momentous question, and called a council of sixty-seven of his brother
                     bishops of North Africa, who gave it as their opinion that the 'Grace of God
                     should not be withheld from any son of man, and that a child might be kissed
                     with the kiss of charity as a brother, so soon as it is born.'
                     This was in the year A. D. 257. It was this same Cyprian who gave it as his
                     opinion that water poured about a person in bed (if he were sick and could not
                     be immersed) would answer in the place of baptism."
                  "What was the effect of this decree of the African Council?"
                  "It seems to have had none. It is likely that it relieved the doubts of Fridus;
                     and infants were probably baptized in Africa to some limited extent, but we
                     have no record of any such baptisms. One hundred years after this, Dr. Wall,
                     the Pædobaptist historian, says complaints were common that mothers could not
                     be prevailed on to put their children into the water at baptism. More than one
                     hundred and twenty years after this, Gregory, the Bishop of Constantinople,
                     gave his opinion on the baptism of infants or babes.—These are his words: 'But
                     some say, what is your opinion of infants who are not capable of judging either
                     of the grace of baptism or of the damage sustained by the want of it? Shall we
                     baptize them too? By all means, if there be any apparent danger;
                     for it were better they were sanctified without knowing it, than that they
                     should die without being sealed and initiated. As for others, I
                     give my opinion, that when they are three years of age or thereabouts, (for
                     then they are able to hear and answer some of the mystical words; and although
                     they do not fully understand, they may receive impressions,) they may be
                        sanctified both soul and body by the great mystery of
                     initiation.'
                  "But neither the decree of Cyprian's sixty-seven bishops, nor the opinion of
                     Gregory himself seem to have convinced the common people; for in the next
                     generation—at the beginning of the fifth century—the priests and bishops who
                     had espoused the new practice, which they doubtless found profitable to their
                     own purses, if not to the souls of the little water-made Christians, found it
                     needful to meet in solemn council and pass another decree, declaring that
                     'Infants ought to be baptized for
                     the remission of sins, and that all who denied this doctrine should be
                     accursed.'
                  "Previous to this, great multitudes of believers, grieved and disgusted with
                     the corruptions and innovations which had crept into the so-called Catholic
                     church, had withdrawn and formed separate societies of their own. From the
                     arguments and the decrees which were designed to bring these
                        heretics back into the bosom of Mother Church, it appears that
                     they were in some particulars, very much like our Baptist churches.
                  "The Catholic bishop Augustin represents them as asking 'What good the
                     sacrament of Christ's baptism could do unconscious infants'?
                  "And to this question, he replies, 'That in regard to that matter it is piously
                     and truly believed that the faith of those by whom the child is presented,
                     profits the child.' But as this reasoning did not prove sufficiently
                     convincing, another council was called, which decreed, 'That it was their will
                     that whosoever denies that little children by baptism are freed from perdition
                     and eternally saved, that they be accursed.'—And this decision being affirmed
                     and sanctioned by the Pope, in 417, we may from that time consider
                     infant baptism and baptismal salvation as established doctrines of that body
                     which historians are accustomed to call the Church. But the decree, with its
                     appended curse, proved insufficient to convince the stubborn-hearted Baptists.
                     They refused to baptize their children, and they disowned the baptism of the
                     Catholics by refusing to receive them into their communities till they had been
                     baptized by themselves. This the Catholics called rebaptism, or Ana-baptism;
                     hence the name of Anabaptists, which has been applied to us almost to the
                     present day. For these great crimes, the Catholics turned against them the
                     strong arm of the secular power. They procured a decree of the Emperor, that
                     not only those who re-baptized, but those who received the ordinance at their
                     hands should be put to death. 'By this law,' says Gibbon, 'three hundred
                     bishops, and several thousand of the inferior clergy, were torn from their
                     churches, stripped of their ecclesiastical possessions, and banished to the
                     Islands.' From this day down to the present, in every country where
                     Pædobaptists have had the power, our brethren have been the
                     subjects of bitter and unrelenting persecution. We can trace them through the
                     pages of history by the light of the fires that consumed them, and by the
                     rivers of blood which they have shed in testimony of their faith. Millions and
                     millions of these slaughtered saints are standing now with those who were
                     beheaded for the testimony of Jesus; slain not by their pagan foes, but by
                     their so-called Christian brethren!—by people whom your writers call 'the
                     Church,' and whose history you record as the history of the Church!!!
                  "When this work of death commenced, they reproached Augustine (whom historians
                     call a saint) with the death of their pastors, and told him that
                     God would require at his hand the blood of these martyrs at the day of
                     judgment.—'Martyrs!' he replied—'I know nothing about your martyrs. Martyrs
                     indeed! Martyrs to the devil! There are no martyrs out of the church.' We have
                     not time to trace their history through the coming ages—under the different
                     names which have been given them, as Donatists, Novatianists, Cathari or
                     Puritans, Paulicians, Henricans, Petrobrusians, Mennonites, Allegences,
                     Waldenses, &c.; but let me suggest if you desire to pursue the subject
                     further, that you read Orchard's History of the Foreign Baptists, which
                     contains in a small space an immense amount of information concerning these
                     persecuted and afflicted disciples of Jesus."
                  "I do not think," said Professor Jones, "that we need to spend further time
                     upon this point now. I confess for my own part, I am more than convinced. I only wonder that these facts are not
                     more generally known."
                  "They are public property," replied Mr. Courtney, "and have long been known to
                     Baptists; but your Pædobaptist friends will not read them or listen to them.
                     And when we absolutely force them upon their attention, they take it for
                     granted there must be some mistake about it, or else they would have heard them
                     from their own ministers. But I agree with you that we have spent time enough
                     in our present conversation; and as there is preaching at the courthouse
                     to-night, suppose we adjourn to meet again to-morrow."
                  "I hope you will meet here," said Mrs. Jones, "for I have yet one very serious
                     charge to offer against the Baptists."
                  "Permit me, madam, to enquire what it is, that I may be better prepared to meet
                     it."
                  "It is your close communion. I am almost willing to admit that
                     immersion is the only baptism, and that infants are not in the Scriptures
                     required to be baptized—though even about these points there must be some
                     mistake on your part, for our ministers are certainly as learned and as pious
                     as yours, and yet they have always represented the facts as very different from
                     the pictures you have drawn."
                  "But you forget, Mrs. Jones, that it is by the testimony of your own
                        historians and your own ministers that I have
                     established these facts. I have scarcely quoted a single Baptist authority. The
                     men who say that there is no precept or example of infant baptism in the
                     Scriptures, are among the most learned and eminent of your own
                     writers. The men who say that the very meaning of the word baptize is to
                     immerse, and that it was immersion only which was for ages practiced by the
                     church, are such men as McKnight and Chalmers, among the most eminent of
                        your own Doctors of Divinity. The men who say that it is
                        certain that infant baptism was not ordained by Christ or the
                     Apostles, and was not introduced until after the second century, are such men
                     as Neander, Coleman and Kitto, among the most learned and eminent of your
                        own ecclesiastical historians and Biblical critics. Such
                     men would not say such things unless the truth compelled them."
                  "That is very strange, Mr. Courtney; but I can't deny that it is true: and I
                     may be convinced that you are right in these things; but I am sure I never can
                     be reconciled to your practice of restricted communion."
                  "Don't be so certain of that, madam. I have no doubt I shall be able to show
                     you to-morrow that you Presbyterians are just as much restricted in your
                        terms of communion as we are. The only difference between us is on
                     the question, What is baptism? But it is now time to go to the meeting."
                  They found the house already filled, and the services had commenced when they
                     arrived. They had not been there long, when those who stood near the door saw a
                     horseman ride up and dismount. It was Mr. Percy. My reader will remember that,
                     after writing that letter to Theodosia, he had gone to another county to attend
                     the Circuit Court. He reached the place on Sabbath morning, just before
                     church-time, and attended the Presbyterian meeting. At any other time he would
                     probably have made the fatigue of his journey an excuse for remaining at his
                     hotel; but he was very unhappy that morning, and hoped in church to find some
                     remission of the feverish anxiety which preyed upon his mind. He could not feel
                     satisfied that he had done right in leaving off the investigation of the
                     subject of baptism himself, or in endeavoring to prevent Theodosia from acting
                     out her conscientious convictions of duty. He had wished a hundred times as he
                     rode along, that he had never written that unfortunate letter. Yet he never
                     suspected for a moment the influence it was destined tined to have upon his own matrimonial
                     prospects. That Miss Ernest loved him most devotedly he was well assured; nor
                     did the thought ever enter his mind, that either this or any other event was
                     likely to break off their engagement, or even postpone their marriage. But when
                     he remembered the earnestness of heart with which she regarded every question
                     pertaining to religion, he felt that he must have occasioned great distress to
                     her; and he bitterly reproached himself that he had permitted his selfishness
                     so far to triumph over his affection.
                  He had at first congratulated himself that he had made to her such an appeal as
                     she could not disregard, and consequently had secured the object
                     which he had in view; but on reflection, he began to feel that he should esteem
                     her more highly and love her more tenderly, if it should prove true that her
                     religious principles were so strong and her sense of duty so predominant, that
                     she would not listen even to the voice of love itself dissuading
                     her from the path of right.
                  He began to hope that she would disregard his entreaties and do her duty. He
                     wished he could return in time to tell her, that he would not for the world put
                     any restraint upon her conscience. He comforted himself by the thought that if
                     his letter had any effect, it would only be to postpone her decision until his
                     return, when he determined to take all difficulties out of her way.
                  When he took his seat in the church, his heart and his mind were in another
                     place. Could he but know what had been her decision—where she was sitting
                     then—what she was doing! He rose when the congregation stood up to pray—he sat
                     down when the preacher said amen, as did the others, but he heard no sentence
                     of the prayer. They sang an old familiar hymn to an air which he had learned in
                     childhood; he joined in the singing, but when it was done he could not have
                     told what was the tune or the words. When the preacher announced his text, he
                     started as from a dream, and as he repeated it, "To him who knoweth to do good
                     and doeth it not, to him it is sin"—the Spirit at once applied it to his heart.
                     He felt that this was precisely the case with himself. He had examined the
                     meaning of Christ's commandment. He was satisfied that he had not obeyed it. He
                     knew that it was his duty to do what Christ commanded, but he had deliberately
                     and willfully refused to do it; and what was worse, he had exerted all the
                     influence which he possessed to induce Miss Ernest to do the same.
                  The main thoughts of the sermon were, First, that men are always inclined to
                     find excuses for their wickedness.
                  Second, there is no excuse more frequently offered, or more implicitly relied
                     upon, than ignorance.
                  Third, that although ignorance, when involuntary and unavoidable,
                     may be plead in mitigation of one's guilt, as Jesus taught us when he said that
                     he who knew not his master's will and did it not, should be beaten with
                        few stripes—yet those who might learn their duty were
                        doubly guilty. Their ignorance itself was sin; and those who
                     knew and acknowledged their duty, and yet neglected or refused to do it, had
                     not even the shadow of an excuse. Whatever doubt there might exist in any other
                     case, their sinfulness was certain, and their guilt was fearful.
                  As the preacher dwelt upon this last thought, an expression of agony quivered
                     in the muscles of Mr. Percy's face, and the tears started in his eyes. He
                     rested his head on the pew before him, and covered his face to avoid the
                     observation of those about him; and as soon as the congregation was dismissed,
                     hastened to his room at the hotel, and passed the rest of the day in most
                     distressful reflections on his past conduct and present condition. Not this one
                     sin alone, but hundreds of others,
                     nay, more than he could count, came rushing back upon his memory. A
                        life-time of sin—sin against light, sin against love, sin against
                     deep and plain convictions of duty; sins of his early boyhood, sins of his
                     heyday youth, sins of mature manhood, all crowded round him and seemed to call
                     down Heaven's vengeance on his head. He tried to pray, like the poor publican,
                     God be merciful to me a sinner. But his prayer seemed to be
                     reflected back by the ceiling of the room. It had no messenger to bear it up to
                     the throne. He felt that he was lost. His sin had found him out,
                     and he had no Saviour. His hopes were all gone. He knew not what to do. Night
                     came, and he sat there on the side of the bed, without a light, feeling that
                     the darkness of the night was light in comparison with the darkness in his
                     heart.
                  His agony of mind was so great that he could not think. He could only feel. He
                     would kneel down to pray, but he had no words to utter. He could only groan in
                     his spirit. He would rise up again, and sit upon the side of the bed. Thus the
                     night wore away. At last he threw himself upon the bed, and from mere
                     exhaustion fell asleep. When he awoke in the morning, his head was throbbing
                     with pain, and his eyes were red and swollen. He excused himself from
                     breakfast, and had a cup of coffee sent to his room. He felt that he could not
                     attend to the business of the court, and sent for a lawyer of his acquaintance,
                     made over to him a minute of his cases, with instructions to have them
                     postponed if possible, and if not to appear for him. He then tried to consider
                     what he ought to do in regard to his own condition as a sinner before God. It
                     was not so much the fear of punishment that distressed him as an
                        overwhelming sense of guilt! 'Oh!" he exclaimed again and
                     again, "what a sinner! What a sinner I have been! What a sinner I am! Can there
                     be mercy for a wretch like me! God have mercy on me a sinner!"
                  After some hours he ordered his horse and started for home. He passed another
                     night of horror on the way—excusing himself for his speedy return, by saying
                     what was very true, "that he did not feel well."
                  The second day, as he rode along, he found his heart going out more frequently
                     in prayer, not so much for pardon as for deliverance
                     from sin. He loathed himself for his vileness and longed to be delivered from
                     the power of sin. And he began to think of Jesus more and more as a Saviour
                     from sin rather than from hell, until at length he
                     found that he was looking to Jesus to save him from
                        his sins. "Yes," said he, "He came to save sinners—not the
                     righteous, but sinners. And his name was called Jesus, because he saves his
                     people from their sins. Will he not save me? But I am not one of
                     his people. I am an outcast. I have betrayed him in the house of his friends.
                     Can he, will he save me?" And the Spirit said, "Come unto me all
                     ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest. And
                        whosoever cometh I will in nowise cast out." "Surely, he
                     replied, "that includes my case. Blessed Jesus, save me. Save or I
                     perish. Save, I cannot save myself. Save, I give myself into thy hands. Yes, I
                     take thee for my Saviour. Thou wilt save me. Thou dost save me. Oh, precious,
                     precious Saviour! Thou art indeed the Lord of my heart. Show me what thou wilt
                     have me to do. I have nothing but sin, but thou hast all needful righteousness
                     to plead for me. Be my intercessor. Be my Redeemer. Yes, thou wilt forgive—thou
                     hast already pardoned. I trust my soul to thee, and I believe that thou art
                     able and willing to keep it to the day of redemption."
                  His distress was gone. He had found hope—he had found peace—he had found joy. He rode on home with a
                     glad heart. What now had become of all his lofty aspirations for worldly fame
                     and wealth. What did he care now for position in society, for professional
                     reputation, for all indeed that but three days ago enlisted his desires. He
                     counted them as less than vanity and nothing. One only question now filled all
                     his heart, and that was "Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?" He
                     could understand now what Theodosia had meant when she talked so much about
                     obedience to the Master's will. It was with these feelings he rode into the
                     town, ignorant of all that had transpired since he left—knowing nothing of the
                     effect which his letter had produced on Theodosia; nothing of her baptism,
                     nothing of the meeting which was in progress. He saw the light in the court
                     house, and heard the singing—dismounted and approached the door—and learned
                     that it was a Baptist meeting. Without further question he went in and sat
                     down.
                  The sermon was on the importance of Christians professing Christ before the
                     world. And at its close, the announcement was made that the church was ready to
                     receive applications for membership—and candidates for admission were requested
                     to take a designated seat while the brethren sang a hymn. They had scarcely
                     commenced the second stanza when Professor Jones and Mr. Percy came from
                     opposite sides of the room. Neither had been conscious that the other was in
                     the house. Both their hearts were full, and who will wonder that when they met
                     they rushed into each others' arms and wept upon each others' necks!
                  Need I tell how Theodosia drew her heavy veil down over her face, and how her
                     heart beat audibly while she listened for the words that should explain this
                     mystery?
                  She was not kept long in suspense. Mr. Percy was the first to relate his
                     experience of grace. He dated his conversion sion only a few hours back. "This
                     very day," said he, "for the first time I have been enabled to realize the
                     pardon of my sins. I fancied some years ago, that I had been converted, but am
                     now convinced that I was self-deceived." He then began at his early convictions
                     of sin, and related the history of his connection with the Presbyterians—his
                     recent examination of the subject of baptism. Though fully convinced that
                     immersion was the only baptism, he had felt that it would be ruinous to his
                     worldly prospects to change his church connections; and he told how it was that
                     his sin had found him out in a distant town—what agony of mind he had endured
                     for the past two days, and how it pleased God to speak peace to his soul as he
                     was coming home. That he had seen the light in the court-house, and learning
                     that it was a Baptist meeting, had come in with the determination to ask for
                     baptism.
                  I need not detain the reader by any account of the experience of grace which
                     was related by Professor Jones. Nor need I attempt to describe the emotions of
                     Theodosia, her mother, or Mrs. Jones, while this scene was passing. I will
                     simply say that uncle Jones and Mr. Percy, with some half-a-dozen others, were
                     received, and Sabbath morning set as the time for their baptism.
               
               
                  
                  THE TENTH NIGHT'S STUDY.
                  WHICH IS MAINLY DEVOTED TO THE SUBJECT OF "CLOSE COMMUNION," AND
                     WHICH BRINGS US TO THE END.
                  
                  TENTH NIGHT'S STUDY.
                  IN accordance with the request expressed by Mrs. Jones, as her visitors were
                     about to leave on the previous night, our company of inquirers met at her house
                     to hear her complaint about close communion. This subject had now assumed a new
                     and touching interest to her. It had associated itself with her domestic
                     affections. She felt that henceforth, in a very important sense, she must be
                     separated from her husband; and though from the moment that she saw he had
                        decided upon being baptized, she had, from courtesy and
                     affection, refrained from any further argument to him—yet her
                     heart was full of reasons, which she longed for an opportunity to pour out upon
                     some one else, showing that, in this particular, at least, the Baptists were
                     the most bigoted, selfish, conceited, and uncharitable people that ever
                     deserved the name of Christians. Mrs. Ernest, though she had entertained the
                     same opinion until her daughter and her brother had become associated with the
                     people she had formerly so much condemned, yet was now almost ready to admit
                     that they might be right in this, as well as other things. In truth, she was
                     like a great multitude of both sexes in all our religious bodies, who never
                     have any opinion of their own upon any disputed point of faith or practice. She
                     had always had full faith in the learning and the piety of her brother Jones
                     and her pastor Johnson. What they said was true, she never thought
                     of doubting. They were to her infallible as the priest to a Catholic. What had
                     she to do with these knotty questions? Had not her pastor spent his life in
                     studying them? and was it not in
                     part for this that he was paid, to do the people's thinking for them, and tell
                     them what was the true faith and practice of a Gospel church?
                  But now, when her brother doubted the pastor's word, and even
                     Theodosia had gotten the better of him in the argument, her confidence was
                     gone; her mind was all unsettled; she knew not where to look for truth; she
                     must have time to choose anew her spiritual guide; and, in doing this, she was
                     likely to be influenced more by her feelings than her judgment.
                  Mr. Courtney found Mrs. Ernest and Theodosia waiting for him when he called, to
                     accompany them to the Professor's residence; and even Edwin had been diligently
                     studying his lessons, that he might gain time to go with them, and listen to
                     the discussion. On their arrival, they found that the Rev. Dr. McNought, the
                     President of the college, had called to take a friendly cup of tea; and, at the
                     urgent request of both the Professor and Mrs. Jones, he consented to remain and
                     take part in the conversation. Uncle Jones stepped out for a moment, and Mrs.
                     Jones introduced the subject, by saying:
                  "Don't you think it hard, doctor, that my husband has placed himself in a
                     position that will forever prevent us from communing together at the table of
                     the Lord? I declare it almost breaks my heart when I think of it."
                  "It does indeed seem hard, madam, but we all know that Professor Jones has only
                     acted in accordance with the requirements of his conscience. I do not think
                     that any one who knows him, can find any reason to blame him for anything but
                     too great haste in making his decision. If he had taken more time, and examined
                     the whole subject with proper care, he must have come to different
                     conclusions."
                  "No doctor, Mr. Jones did not act hastily. This is no new
                     subject to him. He has been laboring over it for months, and I feared how it
                     would end. He has examined it with the most careful attention, and decided with
                     cool and prayerful deliberation. He knows every inch of the ground over which
                     he has passed, and can give you a reason for every change of opinion
                        that he has made. He is not a man lightly to change his
                     faith on any superficial investigation; and that is what so much troubles me. I
                     know when his mind is once decided, and he has openly expressed his conviction,
                     he is immovable as the Rock of Gibraltar. I have no hope of ever winning him
                     back. His path and mine are henceforth separate: I am a Presbyterian, he is a
                     Baptist. He will abandon his professorship; he will engage in the work of the
                     ministry. I shall go and listen to his preaching; I shall be present when he
                     administers the Supper of the Lord, and neither I nor his sister here—who loves
                     him more than any one in the world except myself—neither of us can partake of
                     the elements at the table where our own brother and husband is presiding. He
                     will be bound to reject us from the company of those whom he will call the
                     saints of God, as though we were not Christians, and never expected to commune
                     together in heaven."
                  "As for me," said Mrs. Ernest, "if brother ever becomes the pastor of a church,
                     and thinks that I ought to be baptized, I shall let him baptize me. I suspect
                     he is as competent to judge of the meaning of the Scripture as Mr. Johnson, if
                     he only took the same pains to study into it. But I don't see why the Baptists
                     can't act like other Christians.—We always invite them to
                        our table—why should they not invite us to theirs? Don't we all
                     trust in the same Saviour; and are we not all seeking the same heaven? I wonder
                     if they expect there will be two tables up there, and they can sit down by
                     themselves in the very presence of Jesus, and send every one who has not been under the water
                     to another apartment? No, no! we will all commune together there, and we ought
                     all to commune together here. I don't blame brother or Theodosia for becoming
                     Baptists, for I know they were compelled to do it by a sense of duty; but I do
                     blame the Baptists for being so bigoted and uncharitable, and acting as though
                     they thought nobody was good enough for heaven but themselves; and I don't see
                     as they are so much better than other people, after all."
                  "You place the matter on the right ground," replied Dr. McNought. "Every man
                     ought to be fully persuaded in his own mind, and then ought to be at liberty to
                     act out his own convictions of duty. We demand this for ourselves, we ought to
                     concede it to others. If any one feels that he cannot obey Christ without being
                     immersed, let him be immersed; but let him not say, that because
                        his conscience requires immersion, that therefore every
                        person's must. I profess to love the Lord Jesus, and I desire
                     sincerely and honestly, if I know my own heart, to obey all his commandments.
                     But while Professor Jones has become fully convinced, that the Lord commanded
                     us to be immersed after we believe, I am as fully convinced that he commanded
                     us to be sprinkled while we were yet unconscious babes. My conscience,
                     therefore, is satisfied; and if I should be immersed, I should commit a
                     grievous sin, for I would be doing that in professed obedience to Christ which
                     Christ has never commanded.—Now, Baptists have no right to ask me to violate my
                     conscience, nor (I say it with all due respect to you, Mr. Courtney) have they
                     any right to exclude me from the table of the Lord for not doing what I regard
                     as a sin."
                  "You set the subject in a very strong light," replied Mr. Courtney, "and I am
                     glad you do so. I wish to meet this difficulty fairly and candidly. I seek no
                     evasion, and am willing to submit our faith and our practice in this and every
                     other particular, to the sternest and strictest Scriptural tests. If we are
                     wrong, no people in the world should sooner hasten to get right than we, who
                     have no law but the Scripture, and no leader but Christ. And now, let us look
                     at your argument. You say that a church has no Scriptural right to exclude from
                     her communion any person who professes to love the Lord Jesus, and desires to
                     obey all his commandments, whether he regards those commandments in the same
                     light which the church does or not. A great many professed Christians seem to
                     see the subject in the same light. They say it is the Lord's
                     table; and because it is his, and not ours, the church in which the table is
                     set, has no right to exclude from it any who profess to love the Lord, and who
                     desire to approach it."
                  "Certainly," said Mrs. Jones; "I do not see how any body of Christians could
                     ever have felt disposed to arrogate to themselves the authority to determine
                     who shall and who shall not approach the table of the Lord, or upon what
                     authority they can possibly rest so presumptuous a claim."
                  "Doubtless, then," mildly replied Mr. Courtney, "you will think it is a great
                     exhibition of personal self-confidence, or of Baptist assumption on my part,
                     when I assure you that I can prove, not only to my own satisfaction, but also
                     to yours and Dr. McNought's—
                  "I. That every church of Christ has the exclusive right within itself to decide
                     who shall be participants in its communion.
                  "II. That all Pædobaptists, including Presbyterians, are accustomed to
                     recognize and exercise this right, on the same general principles that Baptists
                     do; and,
                  "III. That no church can refuse or neglect to exercise that
                     
                     right without being guilty of open rebellion against the positive
                        requirements of the law of Christ."
                  "I don't know," replied she, "what you may be able to do about the first and
                     the last of your three propositions; but I am sure you can't make me believe
                     that Presbyterians and Methodists either believe in or practice close communion
                     like the Baptists. You and my husband have proved so many strange things from
                     the Scriptures since he has been engaged in this investigation, that I won't
                     deny that you can prove any thing you say you can, which depends upon
                        them. But the faith and practice of our church, I am sure, I
                     know as much about as you do. And I know we have never set any such
                     restrictions around our table, as you habitually set around yours. We have
                     always regarded it as the Lord's table, and we constantly invite to our
                     communion all who profess to love the name of Jesus."
                  "You almost tempt me, madam, to prove my second proposition first, and show you
                     at once that you Presbyterians are as close in your communion as we are, and
                     that the only difference between us is that you are more open in your
                     baptism."
                  "I wish you would, and I think then I could better attend to your proof on the
                     other points."
                  "Very well—since you desire it, we will take this up first, and then return to
                     the other. If I did not misunderstand you, it is your opinion that all who
                     profess to love the Lord Jesus, should be invited to his table, and that the
                     practice of your people is in accordance with this rule."
                  "Certainly, it is the Lord's table and not ours. And we do not undertake to
                     decide on the fitness of those who approach it. Let every one judge for
                     himself. 'To his own master he standeth or falleth;' whoever thinks he has the
                     love of Jesus in his heart, let him come.'"
                  Then of course you invite the Roman Catholic, whom you regard as a follower and
                     subject of Antichrist, the man of sin—the great enemy and persecutor of the
                     church of whom it was foretold that 'he should wear out the saints of the Most
                     High.' He will assure you that although he loves and reverences and worships
                     the Blessed Virgin Mother of God, he also loves her Son and the holy child
                     Jesus. And he will assure you, moreover, that his conscience absolutely demands
                     of him to be the very creature of the Pope, which he is known to be. If he
                     should renounce his faith and practice, he feels that he would be guilty of a
                     mortal sin. Of course, Doctor, you would not exclude him 'for not doing what he
                     would regard as sin.'
                  "Then there is the Unitarian. He claims that he love Christ and
                     delights in his service, although he denies his divinity and regards him only
                     as a creature. He is sincere and honest in his faith; of course you make
                        him welcome. He says he could not worship Christ without being
                     guilty of idolatry; and no idolator hath any part in the kingdom of heaven. You
                     surely will not reject him for not doing what he honestly believes
                     would place his soul in danger of destruction.
                  "And near him stands a Universalist. You invite him of course, for he says he
                     loves Christ better than any of us, and has more reason to love him. We can
                     only love him as the Saviour of those who believe and repent, but
                        he can love him as the Saviour of all the human race; and he
                     will assure you that he would regard it as so dishonorable to God to condemn a
                     soul to endless punishment for the few sins he might be able to commit in this
                     life, that he would feel himself fearfully guilty should he venture in his
                     heart to believe that he will do it. And I am sure, Doctor, you could not,
                     according to the rule you laid down awhile ago, exclude him for not believing what in his opinion, he could
                     not believe without sin.
                  "There are also many people in the world who come to your meetings, who have
                     never connected themselves with any religious society, who, nevertheless, make
                     great professions at times of their love to Jesus. They thank their God that
                     they are so much better than many members of your church. Not only will they
                     assure you that they love God better than you or I, but can boast they have
                        always loved him, and never have done much if any thing for
                     which they think He can complain of them. Upon what ground can you exclude
                     these: since, according to your rule, it is the Lord's table, and
                     every one is entitled to judge for himself of his fitness to approach it? How
                     dare you say that each and all of these shall not come and fill your table
                     every time the cloth is spread, mixing with yourselves as every way your
                     equals, and showing to the world that they are in all respects equally entitled
                     to this great and distinctive privilege of the church of Jesus Christ?"
                  "Oh, no, Mr. Courtney, I did not mean that. I don't want to commune with Roman
                     Catholics, or Unitarians, or Universalists, or non-professors; and
                     Presbyterians never have been accustomed to invite to our table any such
                     people. All I meant to say, was that we invite all those whom we have
                        reason to regard as converted men or women, and who have made an open
                        profession of their faith in Christ."
                  "Ah, madam, that is quite a different thing from inviting all who
                        profess to love the Lord of the table. It seems then after all, that
                        you, not they, are to be the judge of their
                     fitness. But will Dr. McNought agree to this new rule? He says, if I did not
                     misunderstand him, 'No church has any right or ought to have any inclination to
                     exclude any one from the table of the Lord who professes to love
                     the Lord Jesus, and to desire to obey all his commandments, and who is
                        sincere and honest in his conviction that his
                     faith and practice is correct, however widely it may differ from that of
                        the church, whose communion he seeks.'"
                  "Perhaps I expressed myself a little too loosely," replied the Doctor. "I did
                     not intend to say that the church is to have no discretion in the
                     matter; but only that she has no right to exclude any whom she recognizes
                        as genuine and evangelical Christians. Now, you Baptists do not
                     pretend to doubt (at least, you often say so) that Presbyterians and
                     Methodists, and members of other evangelical churches, are just as good
                     Christians as you are yourselves, and every way as worthy and well qualified
                     for the table of the Lord as you are, saving only that we have not been under
                     the water; and as we are prevented from going under the water by our
                     conscientious regard to what we understand to be the commandments of Christ,
                     you have no right and ought to have no disposition to exclude us on that
                     account."
                  "Never mind the Baptists just now, Doctor. We will come to them presently. We
                     are now investigating the practice of Presbyterians, and the principles on
                     which it rests—and we have progressed thus far. You do not, it
                     seems, leave it for every one to determine for himself in regard
                     to his fitness to commune. You do not invite all who may
                        think themselves worthy and well qualified, but those only whom
                        you have reason to think are converted or regenerated men—and
                     the testimony on which you regard them as such is the fact that they are
                     members in good standing in any of those churches which require evidence of
                     conversion as a prerequisite to membership."
                  "Precisely so, sir," replied the Doctor. "I could not have described our
                     practice more perfectly myself."
                  "But there is another thing which you Presbyterians require quire besides evidence of conversion, and which
                     you will no more dispense with than you will with that."
                  "And what is that, pray?" asked Mrs. Jones. "You seem to know more about us
                     than we do ourselves."
                  "You shall yourself answer your own question, madam. When one not previously a
                     member of any religious denomination is converted from his sins, repents and
                     believes, and gives good evidence that he has become a new creature in Christ
                     Jesus, do you at once, without any further preliminaries, invite him to your
                     communion table?"
                  "Certainly we do, as soon as he has made a public profession and united with
                     the church. We could not, of course, invite with one who was not a
                        member of any church."
                  "Very good; but in what manner does he become a member? Is he not received in
                     the ordinance of baptism?"
                  "Of course—if he has not been baptized in infancy he must be baptized. Baptism
                     is the door of entrance into the church, and no one can be a member who has not
                     been baptized."
                  "Perhaps, Doctor, you may be more familiar with the practice of your
                     denomination than Mrs. Jones. Do you agree with her that no one is recognized
                     as a full member till he has been baptized; or do you invite him at once to
                     your table as soon as you are satisfied that he is a converted man?"
                  "Our rules in regard to this matter," replied the Doctor 'are clearly laid down
                     on pages 504 and 505 of the Confession of Faith, 'ON THE ADMISSION OF PERSONS
                     TO SEALING ORDINANCES':
                  "'Children born within the pale of the visible church, and dedicated to God in
                     baptism, are under the inspection and government of the church, and are to be
                     taught to read and repeat the Catechism, the Apostles' Creed, and the Lord's
                     Prayer. They are to be taught to pray, to abhor sin, to fear God, and to obey
                     the Lord Jesus Christ; and when they come to years of discretion, if they be
                     free from scandal, appear sober and steady, and to have sufficient knowledge to
                     discern the Lord's body, they ought to be informed that it is their duty and
                     their privilege to come to the Lord's Supper.' 'When unbaptized persons apply
                     for admission into the church, they shall in ordinary cases, after giving
                     satisfaction with respect to their knowledge and piety, make a public
                     profession of their faith in the presence of the congregation; and thereupon be
                     baptized.'"
                  "And on page 456," replied Mr. Courtney, "you will find this rule—'All baptized
                     persons are members of the church, are under its care, and subject to its
                     government and discipline; and when they have arrived at years of discretion,
                        they are bound to perform all the duties of church
                     members.'
                  "It would seem, therefore, that although you are, according to your 'Confession
                     of Faith,' at liberty to dispense with any public profession of faith in the
                     case of those baptized in infancy, you are not to dispense with baptism. All
                     the baptized, whether converted or unconverted, are, when they come to years of
                     discretion, 'bound to perform all the duties of church members.' And if the
                     celebration of the Holy Supper is one of the duties of church members, they are
                     bound to commune; but no one whom you regard as
                        unbaptized, however pious he may be, can be permitted to
                     approach your table, any more than any one whom weregard as
                     unbaptized can come to ours. What then is the difference between your practice
                     and ours? In what respect is your communion more open than ours? Simply and
                     only in this: That you, according to page 456 of your Confession of Faith,
                     admit the unreligious and unconverted, who have never ever professed to be the
                     subjects of regenerating rating
                     grace, provided they were baptized in their infancy—while we admit none who
                     have not made for themselves a credible profession of their repentance and
                     faith. I will, however, do you the justice to say, that many of your churches
                     in this country so far repudiate your own rules, as not to invite or require
                     the baptized children to come to the table of the Lord, till they have given
                     evidence of conversion; and these bodies and ourselves therefore stand on
                     precisely the same ground—that is, we each require evidence of both conversion
                     and baptism before we admit or invite any to our communion."
                  "But yet," said Mrs. Ernest, "we can't stand upon the same ground, for
                        we always invite you, and you never
                     invite us."
                  "The reason is not, madam, that we do not act upon the same principle, but that
                     we differ in regard to what baptism is, and consequently as to who
                     have been baptized. You consider all baptized who have been sprinkled in
                     infancy, we regard those only as baptized who have been immersed on a
                     profession of their faith. But you no more extend your invitation to commune to
                     those whom you consider unbaptized than we do. Your
                        baptism reaches further than ours, but your invitation to
                     commune never reaches beyond your baptism. Do you not see,
                     therefore, that all our difference of opinion is simply about
                     baptism, and not about communion? Show us that the sprinkling of infants is
                     Scriptural baptism, and we can, and will at once extend our invitation to the
                     communion, so as to embrace you all. But until you can show us that, you surely
                     cannot ask us to invite those whom we regard as unbaptized, while
                     you cannot invite those whom you regard as unbaptized?
                  "Except in case of the children of your own church members, you require both
                     conversion and baptism as prerequisites sites to communion. And, for the most
                     part, in this country, though not in Europe, you repudiate your Confession so
                     far, as to require it even of them. You refuse to commune with Universalists,
                     and Unitarians, and Roman Catholics, because, although you think they have been
                     baptized, you do not believe they have experienced the regeneration of the
                     Gospel. You refuse to commune with a newly converted person, though satisfied
                     that he is really born again, till he has publicly professed his faith, and
                     been baptized. It was on this ground that Prof. Moses Stuart, one
                     of your ablest writers and most learned men, said that if a pious member of the
                     society of Quakers or Friends should so far forsake his principles, as to
                     desire to commune with him at the table of the Lord, he must refuse unless he
                     would be first baptized.
                  "Precisely so it is with us. We also require evidence, both of conversion and
                     of baptism. We ask for neither more nor less than you do. Are you not
                     satisfied? or shall we spend further time upon this point?"
                  "I did not," replied the Doctor, "need to be told that Presbyterians require
                     baptism as a prerequisite to communion. No one has ever
                     doubted it, so far as I have been informed. I am sure no one ever had any
                     reason to doubt it."
                  "On what ground, then, do you complain of us so bitterly, since we require
                     nothing more than you do?"
                  "We do not complain of you for requiring baptism as a necessary
                     and invariable prerequisite to communion, but for requiring
                        immersion, and thus setting up your judgment against that of
                     the whole Christian world. You will not only have baptism, but you must have
                        your own baptism—whereas, we receive that of all other
                     denominations, including yours. How then can you say that we stand on the same
                     ground?"
                  "I do not say that we stand on the same ground as regards
                     baptism. Here I know we differ as far as a few drops sprinkled
                     upon the forehead of an unconscious babe, differs from the plunging of a
                     believing Christian man or woman into a liquid grave. But in regard to
                     communion, we agree, at least, so far as this subject under discussion is
                     concerned. That is, we both require baptism as preparatory to a Scriptural
                     approach to the Lord's Table. This much you freely admit. You admit, also, that
                     no Presbyterian church is accustomed to invite or permit the approach of those
                     to your communion, whom you regard as unbaptized. You
                     will admit, moreover, that you have somewhere in what you call 'The
                     Presbyterian Church,' the power to exclude from your communion such as you may
                     deem unworthy. I need not, therefore, dwell any longer on this point. You
                     cannot deny that I have fully established my second proposition, which was, as
                     you will remember—That Pædobaptist churches, even Presbyterians, are
                        accustomed, as well as Baptists, to recognize and exercise the right to
                        determine for themselves whom it is proper and expedient to admit to their
                        communion. And I have proved, also, that you as well as we
                        refuse to admit any one who has not, in your opinion, been
                     baptized.
                  "So far we are perfectly agreed; but because you consider many persons as
                     baptized whom we regard as unbaptized, you can invite many whom we must refuse.
                     Here, then, is the gist of the whole dispute. Now, let me ask you one
                     question.—Does not the Presbyterian church claim and exercise the right to
                     decide for herself what baptism is, according to her understanding
                     of the Scriptures?"
                  "Certainly she does," replied the Doctor, "and you may find her decision, with
                     the proof-texts on which it rests, recorded on page 46 of the Confession of
                     Faith: 'Dipping of the person into the water is not necessary; but baptism is
                     rightly administered by pouring or sprinkling.'"
                  "Why then should you or any one complain if a Baptist church
                     should feel that she had equally the right to decide for herself according to
                     her understanding of the Scriptures, and should give her opinion and the
                     proof-texts on which it rests? And what if she should come to the conclusion,
                     that 'dipping the person in the water is necessary,' and that
                     baptism cannot be administered at all 'by pouring' or 'by sprinkling?' What
                     then? Must she act as though she did not believe it? Must she submit her
                     judgment to yours, and receive as baptism, on your recommendation, what she
                     solemnly believes and declares is no baptism? Yet this is what you so modestly
                     require her to do, when you deny to her the right to exclude from her communion
                     the sprinkled and the poured-on members of Pædobaptist societies. If sprinkling
                     and pouring are not baptism, then they have not been baptized; and if they have
                     not been baptized, then they are not Scripturally prepared for communion."
                  "But how is it made so certain," asked Mrs. Ernest, "that no one can be
                     permitted to commune who has not been baptized? I know it is the common
                     practice of the churches of all denominations, but I don't remember any express
                     declaration of Scripture on which it rests."
                  "It is not necessary, madam, to have any express precept, when we
                     have a plain and unmistakable example. But in regard to this point, we have
                     what is equivalent to both.
                  "We have the often repeated command—Repent and be baptized, believe and be
                     baptized—showing that baptism was at once to follow penitence and
                     faith, without any intervening act. Then we have the unvarying example, many
                     thousand times repeated, showing that this command was thus understood and thus
                     literally obeyed. They believed and were baptized. Baptism instantly followed the
                     profession of their faith, leaving no time for the observance of any other rite
                     between; and then we read Acts 2: 46, that after their baptism they continued
                     'in breaking of bread.'
                  "Moreover the sacrament of the Supper is a church ordinance. It
                     was ordained to be observed by the church, assembled together in a
                     church capacity. And of course no one could participate in it but church
                        members. And no one has ever been regarded as a church member till he
                     had been baptized. This was the door of entrance, the initiatory rite by which
                     one was received among and united to the people of God, and so became entitled
                     to the privileges of the visible kingdom of Christ. Hence the Apostle, in
                     writing to the ancient churches, frequently alluded to their baptism; always
                     addressing them as baptized persons, who had put on Christ in baptism; who had
                     been buried with him by baptism; who had been planted together with him by
                     baptism; who had been in a certain sense regenerated by baptism; and who were
                     in some sort saved by baptism. This is so evident that no sect or denomination
                     have ever considered the unbaptized as church members and communicants. The
                     open communion Baptists are, so far as I know, the first and the only
                     Christians who have advocated the giving of the communion to those whom they
                     regarded as unbaptized.
                  "That godly learned man and excellent commentator, Dr. Doddridge, author of
                     'The Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul,' and many other excellent
                     works, says—'It is certain that Christians in General have always been spoken
                     of as baptized persons by the most ancient Fathers, and it is also certain, so
                     far as our knowledge of primitive Christianity extends, that no unbaptized
                     person received the Lord's Supper.'—(Miscellaneous Works, p.
                     510.) Dr. Wall, the great champion of Pædobaptism, says expressly—'No church
                     ever gave the communion to any persons before they were baptized.' 'Among all
                     the absurdities that ever were held none ever maintained that any persons
                     should partake of the communion before they were baptized.' Lord Chancellor
                     King, of the Church of England, in his work on the church, says, page 196,
                     'Baptism was always precedent to the Lord's Supper, and none ever received the
                     Eucharist, till he had been baptized.' And those who might have any doubt about
                     this, he refers to the testimony of Justin Martyr, who describes the practice
                     of the primitive churches in his famous 'Apology,' addressed to the Roman
                     Emperor, about the year A. D. 138 or 139. You will find a translation of so
                     much of this memorable document as refers to this subject, in one of your own
                     historians, Rev. Lyman Coleman's Apostolical and Primitive Church, page 340.
                     'After baptizing the believer and making him one with us, we conduct him to the
                     brethren as they are called, where they are assembled fervently to offer up
                     their common supplication for themselves, for him who has been illuminated and
                     for all men everywhere, that we may live worthy of the truth which we have
                     learned, and be found to have kept the commandments, so that we may be saved
                     with an everlasting salvation. After prayer we salute one another with a kiss.
                     After this, bread and a cup of wine and water are brought to the president,
                     which he takes, and offers up praise, &c.'"
                  "Oh, that is enough, Mr. Courtney. I did not want to know what Justin Martyr,
                     or Lord King, or Dr. Wall, or anybody else said about it, but only what was in
                     the Scriptures. If I understand aright, you Baptists claim that your faith and
                     practice rests exclusively on them."
                  "That is very true, Mrs. Ernest, but I thought it might be satisfactory to you
                     to know that the same Scriptures which have led us to require baptism as an
                     essential prerequisite requisite to
                     communion, have been equally able to convince all our most learned and zealous
                     opponents, so that in whatever else we may be found to differ, we agree in
                     this. A sect of the Baptists themselves are, I believe, the first and only
                     people who have ever attempted to show from the Scriptures that the communion
                     of the church may be shared with the unbaptized; and they were led to do this
                     evidently from their desire to be free from the reproach of close communion.
                     They could not deny that immersion was the only baptism, and therefore they
                     could not but regard their sprinkled brethren as unbaptized, and they could
                     only commune with them by denying that baptism was an essential prerequisite to
                     the Eucharist. But not even Robert Hall, who was the leader, or at least, the
                     ablest champion of his sect, with all his vast learning and surpassing
                     eloquence, could persuade the Pædobaptists that they ought to
                     dispense with baptism in their communicants, though many of them
                     and some Baptists profess to have been convinced that Baptists
                     ought to dispense with it in regard to those who wish to approach their table.
                     But the great body of the Baptist churches still agree with their Pædobaptist
                     brethren in requiring baptism before communion, and we must continue to do so
                     till some one can find in the Scriptures some precept or example for reversing
                     the order so plainly established by Christ and the Apostles, which places
                     repentance and faith first, then baptism, and then the breaking of bread and
                     the other ordinances of the church of God.
                  "It is as evident as any thing can be, that if any Jew or Gentile had professed
                     his faith in Christ in the Apostles days, and yet had neglected or refused to
                     put on Christ in his holy ordinance of baptism, he would never have been
                     invited to the privileges of a church member."
                  "Of course he would not have been," replied the Doctor "for there was then no
                     room at all for doubt about the nature or the subjects of baptism. The Apostles
                     had the act visibly set before their eyes by Christ himself. And the people all
                     knew what was intended when they were commanded to be baptized. If any one
                     refused or neglected to obey it was prima
                        facie evidence that he was no Christian, and consequently an unfit
                     subject for communion. It showed that he either did not believe or was
                     disobedient at heart. The early churches, therefore, were bound to reject all
                     who would not be baptized. But now the case is very different. The mode of
                     baptism has now, in many minds, become a matter of great uncertainty. Some
                     think it is one thing and some another; and some think it any one of three
                     things. Now, since good Christians may thus, while they seek and intend to do
                     right, yet fall into the wrong, how can any church take it upon herself to
                     decide that one of these modes is right and all others are wrong, and so
                     exclude all who do not conform to her standard; for now a failure to conform is
                     not, as in the Apostles' days, an evidence of an unbelieving or a rebellious
                     spirit, but only of a mistaken apprehension of duty, into which the most
                     sincere and pious Christian is liable to fall."
                  "I acknowledge, Doctor, that this argument has a great deal of plausibility
                     about it. It is the best that can be offered in favor of open communion, and
                     has succeeded in imposing upon the minds of some eminent Baptists. But now, if
                     you will give me your candid attention for a few minutes, I will show you
                        that it is utterly destitute of any Scriptural foundation or logical
                        force."
                  "You speak very confidently, sir, and I will gladly give you the attention you
                     require; but if you can do what you say, I will concede that you are a master
                     in logic —for I conceive it perfectly unanswerable."
                  
                  "I know, Doctor, that it is the best and strongest argument which can be made
                     for open communion; and yet I am sure I can satisfy you that it ought not to
                     have the very slightest weight in the decision of this
                     controversy—because it has not even the shadow of a foundation in the Word of
                     God on which to rest. But before I enter upon it further, I will, with your
                     consent, go back and take up the first general proposition which I purposed to
                     establish when we entered upon this discussion, and that was, as you will
                     recollect, That every church of Christ has the exclusive right within
                        herself to decide who shall be partakers of her communion.—We have
                     seen already in what manner your church and others are accustomed to exercise
                     this right. It is simply the right to determine who shall be entitled to the
                     privileges of membership—a right which must of necessity belong to every such
                     organization in order to preserve its purity or perpetuity."
                  "I do not," said the Doctor, "feel disposed to dispute with you about this. If
                     a Baptist church is a church of Christ, I am willing to grant that within
                     certain limits it is to judge of the qualifications of its members and
                     communicants."
                  "What are the 'limits,' Doctor, to which you refer?"
                  "The requirements of the Scriptures. She is to require only such qualifications
                     as the Scriptures demand."
                  "But who is to judge of what the Scriptures demand, Doctor, the church or the
                     applicants for her communion?"
                  "She must of course judge for herself. The Scripture is given for her guidance.
                     She must examine for herself, and be governed by her understanding of its
                     instructions. Those who are not of her membership can have no right to dictate
                     to her in the matter of their own reception— that is self-evident."
                  "But now, Doctor, what if she should, upon a careful examination of the
                     Scriptures, come to the conclusion, as your church has done, that no one is
                     permitted to commune who has not been baptized?"
                  "Then as a matter of course she will do as we do—admit none who have not been
                     baptized."
                  "But suppose she should come to the additional conclusion that sprinkling and
                     pouring are not baptism, and that contrary to the decision of your
                     church, dipping of the person in the water is necessary to
                     constitute a Scriptural baptism,—what then?"
                  "Why, then I suppose she must admit none who have not been thus 'dipped,' for
                     she cannot recognize any others as baptized."
                  "Of course she must. That is self-evident. And now, Doctor, I trust you see the
                     fallacy of your boasted argument for open communion; for if every church is to
                     decide for herself who shall commune, subject only to the laws of
                     Christ, and if she is to be the interpreter and judge of these
                     laws, and should be led to determine that these laws demand that every
                     communicant shall have been immersed, what could she do for those
                     who had been only sprinkled or poured upon? Must she not reject them, however
                     good and pious they might be? They may be sincere and honest—they may be
                     intelligent and learned; but they are not to decide this question
                        for the church. Those without cannot dictate the terms of
                     communion to those who are within. The church must for herself examine. For
                     herself she must decide, and upon her own decision she must act.
                     What if the nature of baptism be the subject of doubt to many good
                     and holy men—she as a church has nothing to do with their doubts, unless they
                     are her own members. What if good and pious men, seeking to go right,
                        do sometimes go wrong, she as a church is not to forsake what
                        she thinks right, and go wrong too, merely to accommodate them.
                     On the contrary trary, she is to
                     stand firmly, like a great rock in the wilderness, a fixed and settled
                     way-mark, which men may see afar off in their wanderings, and by it be guided
                     back into the old paths. If others, like the mariner at sea without his chart
                     and compass, wander to and fro, being wafted about with every wind of
                     doctrine—she is to stand like the lighthouse, against whose base the winds and
                     waves beat alike in vain, standing ever erect, and sending far across the ocean
                     of doubts and uncertainties the calm and changeless light by which they may
                     direct their course into the destined haven.
                  "Now look at your argument again. In the days of the Apostles, every one knew
                     certainly what baptism was, and every church was bound to exclude all who had
                     not been baptized. But now, many good and pious people have become doubtful
                     what baptism is. Some think it one thing, and some another; and
                        therefore no church of Jesus Christ ought to have any opinion
                     about it; and every one ought to be received who thinks himself
                     baptized. The church has no right to decide even as to what constitutes the
                     very act by which men are admitted to her membership, or as to whom shall be
                     permitted to enjoy the peculiar and distinctive privileges of members. This
                     must all be left to the good and pious without her ranks, to
                     determine for her. If they have doubts, she must give up her right
                     to determine for herself, and humbly receive those who judge themselves to be
                     worthy and well qualified, although she may have no doubts at all.
                     Do you not see, that if the principle on which your argument rests be once
                     admitted, it will destroy not only the independence, but the very organization
                     of the churches?—The principle is this—A Baptist church has decided that
                     certain prerequisites are needful to her membership or communion; but there are
                     certain persons out of her ranks, who think she ought not to require these
                     preliminaries, and demand mand the privileges of church members without having
                     complied with them. The church consents to their demand—admits them on
                        their terms—abandons her own judgment, and repudiates her own
                     rules—does she not at once lose her distinctive character, and cease to be a
                     Baptist church? Is she a church at all, when those without make laws for
                     her—decide questions of faith and practice for her, and determine who shall
                     take the place of members at her table, and by what rules she shall exercise
                     her discipline?—for if they determine that she has no right to exclude a member
                     for want of baptism, they can, of course, with equal reason, determine that she
                     has no right to exclude any one for any other cause.
                  "Look at your argument again. It takes it for granted, that because
                        you and some other good and pious men doubt about the nature of
                     the act of baptism, that therefore NO ONE can arrive at any
                        certainty in regard to it; and therefore no church of Christ has any
                     right to take any decisive action in regard to it. If this be true in respect
                     to baptism, it is, of course, equally so in regard to other things; and the
                     necessary result will be, that no church has a right, in regard to
                        any subject, to hold opinions, and to act upon
                     them, if good and pious people of other denominations chance to differ from
                     them. Your argument, if it is good for anything at all, destroys all church
                     independence and all church sovereignty, and makes it necessary for every
                     church of Christ to go out and ask those who are not of her membership, and
                     have no special interest in her affairs, what she may believe, and teach, and
                     do, and this in regard to matters which are to her of the most vital
                     importance, involving her very existence, by determining for her who she shall
                     admit to the privileges of membership."
                  "Oh, no, Mr. Courtney, I did not intend to intimate that the church had no right to deny
                        membership to those who might sincerely and honestly differ
                     from her on matters about which good men have not been able to agree. But we
                     were speaking of only occasional communion."
                  "The principle is the same, Doctor, whether the communion be occasional or
                     continual. If he may commune once, why not twice? If twice, why not a dozen
                     times—and, indeed, every time the table is spread? And if he may, of right,
                     continually enjoy this peculiar and distinctive privilege of church membership,
                     why not every other privilege? If we have no right to exclude you from
                     communing with us occasionally, we have none to exclude you
                        perpetually, and if we have no right to exclude
                        you, who are not a member of our church, we could not, of
                     course, exclude one who is a member for a similar cause. Your right to
                     determine for a church the terms of its communion, includes the right to
                     determine for it any other principle of faith or practice. If you may dictate
                     who shall commune once, you may with equal propriety dictate who
                     shall commune all the time.—And yet, you modestly require us, because forsooth
                     you and some other good and pious men are doubtful about the nature of baptism,
                     to yield our convictions to your doubts, and assure
                     us that we have no right to decide for ourselves upon the nature
                     of the very act of initiation into our membership—forgetting, of course, that
                     your own church has positively decided for herself, page 146 of the Confession,
                     where she declares that 'dipping of the person in water is not
                     necessary;' and on page 431, (chap. vii. of Directory,) where she absolutely
                     requires the minister to 'baptize the child with water, by pouring or
                     sprinkling it on the face of the child, without adding any other ceremony.'
                     Presbyterians can decide for themselves what baptism is; so can
                     Methodists; so can Lutherans; so can Episcopalians; so can Roman Catholic
                     olics; so can everybody else who will decide that it is sprinkling or pouring.
                     But if the Baptists claim the same privilege, they are counted guilty of the
                     most unheard-of presumption, and all the Pædobaptist world desires to know by
                     what authority they venture, like other churches, to think for themselves,
                     investigate for themselves, and come to their own conclusions; or, if they must
                     think, and investigate, and decide, yet you demand to know how they can dare to
                     carry out their convictions in their practice."
                  "Oh, no, Mr. Courtney, we do not," said Mrs. Jones, "object to your
                        deciding for yourselves. It is to the nature of your decision
                     that we object. If you had decided, like all the rest of the Christian world,
                     that baptism was sprinkling or pouring, or that it was of little consequence
                     which way it was done, no one could object to your exercise of the abstract
                     right to decide for yourselves. But we do think it is evidence of
                     either bigotry or self-conceit, when you set up your opinions against the whole
                     religious world."
                  "Your idea of church independence, then, is simply this: Every Baptist church
                     has a full and perfect right to think and decide for herself on all matters of
                     faith and practice, provided she will always think and decide just as your
                     church does.
                  "But, Doctor, I have another objection to your argument, which makes me wonder
                     how it could ever for a single moment have imposed upon any thinking
                     Baptist—and that is, that it assumes, and takes for granted as the very basis
                     on which it rests, that no one now can certainly know what the act of
                        baptism was. In the days of the Apostles, you say, there could not be
                     any doubt about this, and therefore all who would not be baptized, must of
                     necessity have been excluded; but now it is so very uncertain, that good men,
                     meaning to go right may yet go wrong, and must not on that account be excluded. Let us look at it
                     again in this light. The apostles knew what baptism was, for they had
                        seen the Saviour himself baptized. The early churches knew, for
                     they had seen the apostles baptize according to the pattern which
                     Jesus showed in Jordan. But we who live in these ends of the earth, are
                     entirely dependent for our information on the written Word of God.
                     The Holy Spirit of Inspiration attempted to convey to us in writing such an
                     account of the organization of a church, and the ordinances of Christ's visible
                     kingdom, that we might continue them to the end of time; but he made such
                     bungling work of it, that it is now absolutely impossible to find out what he
                     meant. We can neither know who were the persons to be initiated,
                     nor by what act they are to be brought in.
                  "It is true, that he commanded people first to believe and then to
                     be baptized. It is true, that he never, in a single instance, commanded any one
                     to be baptized who had not believed. And that there is not in the
                     record a single case in which any but a professed believer ever
                     was baptized, nor is there a single allusion, direct or indirect, to the
                     baptism of an unconscious babe. And yet men say, that no one now can certainly
                     determine that he did not command, and does not now require that little infants
                     who cannot believe or perform any act of intelligent worship, shall be baptized
                     and thus made members of his churches.
                  "True, his people are always spoken of as a renewed and regenerated people; as
                     a holy and peculiar people, zealous of good works. The churches of the
                     Scriptures were addressed as active, intelligent, and pious people. And we know
                     from sad and frequent observation, that the baptism of an infant does not
                     regenerate it or make it any holier than it was before. We know that baptized
                     children do not, on account of their baptism, grow up servers of God and of his
                     laws, yet no one now can tell that Christ did not require these unconverted
                     children of wrath and heirs of hell, to be brought into his church and counted
                     among its members.
                  "And then as regards the act of initiation, which the Scriptures call baptism,
                     your argument takes for granted that nobody can now tell what it was. True, the
                     very word itself declares that it was immersion, if we should read it as we do
                     in any other book. No scholar ever dreamed of its meaning to sprinkle or to
                     pour, in any book except the Bible, nor in any part of the Bible but the New
                     Testament, nor in any place in the New Testament where it does not refer to the
                     ordinance. Everywhere else its signification is sufficiently plain. When
                     Josephus, writing in the same language, and about the same time with the
                     Evangelists, speaks of a youth being baptized in a lake till he was drowned, no
                     scholar ever doubted that the lad was dipped. When he speaks of a
                     ship being baptized in the sea, no one ever ventured to doubt that he meant to
                     say it was sunk. No one ever doubted what Hippocrates means when
                     he speaks of the surgeon baptizing his probe into a wound. No one doubts what
                     Homer means when he speaks of the blacksmith baptizing a huge pole axe in water
                     to harden the steel. Those who are engaged in teaching our young men a
                     knowledge of the Greek language, never have any difficulty in deciding about
                     the meaning of this word in any of the poets, or philosophers, or historians of
                     Greece. The Lexicons of the language all agree in giving 'to dip,'
                        'to plunge,' as at least its primary and most common
                     signification; and no one of them gives to sprinkle or to pour—and
                     yet you say, no one can tell for certain that this word means to
                        dip, and not to sprinkle or to pour.
                  "It is true, according to the testimony of Dr. Barnes, that this word is used
                     in the New Testament in the place of the Hebrew word 'tabal.' And Professor Stuart, one of your own ablest scholars, expressly says, that this
                     word tabal always means 'to
                     dip.' It is true that in the fifteen places where Dr. Barnes says it
                     occurs in the Old Testament, it is translated 'dip' or
                        'plunge,' in every place but one, and there it is
                        'dyed,' which supposed a previous act of dipping, yet no one
                     can know that it does not mean to sprinkle or to pour.
                  "It is true, that your own most eminent Biblical scholars, as Stuart, Kitto,
                     Chalmers, and McKnight, agree that it meant immerse, and state expressly that
                     immersion was the act which was performed in the first churches; and yet you
                     say, no one can certainly know what it was which Christ commanded, and the
                     church must now require.
                  "It is true, the Holy Spirit, as if to obviate the very possibility of any
                     misunderstanding, makes frequent and varied allusions to it in the
                     Word, speaking of it as a burial, a bath, and the like. True, He has gone into
                     particulars, so far as to explain that it was done in the 'rivers,' and places
                     where there was 'much water;' and that they went down into the water to do it,
                     and came up out of the water after it was done; and yet we can't know any thing
                     about what it was.
                  "True, the history of the early churches, written by the sprinklers themselves,
                     as the Magdeburg Centuriators, Mosheim, and Neander, clearly shows that, in the
                     language of the London Quarterly, devoted to the interests of
                     the Church of England, 'There can be no question that the original form of
                     baptism—the very meaning of the word—was complete immersion, and that for at
                     least four centuries, any other form was either unknown or regarded as an
                     exceptional, almost a monstrous case.'
                  "True, we can show from ancient rituals and church canons, that for more than
                     thirteen hundred years, it was the only act recognized as baptism, except in
                     cases of alarming sickness.
                  "True, we have the most unexceptionable records made by the sprinklers
                     themselves, showing the very time and manner of the change from immersion of
                     sprinkling, and the very decree of the Pope, on whose authority it was done;
                     and yet you take for granted that no Baptist church now can tell for certain
                     which it was that Christ commanded. And on this ground you demand as a right
                     that she shall give to those who have submitted to the Pope's ordinance of
                     sprinkling, under the false impression that it was baptism, the same church
                     privileges that she offers to those who have entered into Christ's visible
                     kingdom through the door which he appointed.
                  "If you have any doubts about the nature of baptism or the
                     subjects of baptism, you may plead them for what they are worth before His bar
                     to whom we all must give account; but you must not expect Baptist churches to
                     participate in them, or to act as though it were to them a matter about which
                     there was even the slightest uncertainty. If there are any two things which
                     they are satisfied are clearly and definitely set forth in the Word of God,
                     they are, that believers are the only persons commanded to be baptized, and
                     that those commanded to be baptized are commanded to be immersed. They have
                     therefore not even the shadow of a doubt that you are unbaptized, and if
                     baptism is a Scriptural prerequisite, as you yourselves believe and teach, then
                     you are not prepared and cannot claim communion at their hands, unless you
                     undertake to decide for them whom they shall consider as baptized."
                  "Oh, we are willing to acknowledge," replied Mrs. Jones, "that we cannot demand
                     it as a matter of right. But the courtesy, Mr.
                     Courtney. What we may not demand as a right, we surely may claim on the ground of Christian courtesy and
                     kindness—I had almost said upon the ground of common politeness. And now I ask
                     you seriously to say if you do not think that you Baptists are selfish and
                     discourteous, to say the least, in your refusal to invite any but immersed
                     believers to sit down with you? You admit that others are just as good
                     Christians as yourselves, do you not?'
                  "Certainly, we do not refuse because you are not pious, but because you
                        have not been baptized. And you as well as we believe that the Master
                     does not permit all Christians, but only all Christians who are
                     members of a visible church, and who have been baptized. You never invite a
                     person to your communion merely because you consider him a converted man and a
                     good Christian. You wait till he has joined the church, and been baptized."
                  "But we think," said Mrs. Jones, "that we have been baptized. You will grant
                     that we are as sincere and honest in our opinion as you are in yours. The great
                     majority of the Christian world think our opinion better founded
                     than yours: would it not, therefore, be proper and becoming in you to show so
                     much respect to the decision of more than half of Christendom, and so much
                     Christian liberality to those who conscientiously differ from you, as to extend
                     your invitation to them, not of right, but purely out of courtesy and
                     politeness?"
                  "That can never be properly called Christian courtesy, madam, which asks for
                     the sacrifice of Christian principle—and I am quite as willing to meet the
                     demands of open communion on this ground as on the other. But before we enter
                     into the argument, I would like to go back and call up the third proposition,
                     which I stated at the beginning of this discussion, and that is—That no
                        church can either neglect or refuse to exercise the right which has been
                        given her by her Head, to preserve the purity of her communion without being
                        guilty of open rebellion against the positive requirements of the law of
                        Christ.
                  
                  "We have already seen that every church possesses this right, and it is plain
                     that the duty to exercise it follows from its possession.
                        Somebody must decide who shall be communicants; if not, there
                     is no bar between the church and the world. If every one who chooses may not
                     come, who shall decide who may? We answer, the church herself."
                  "By what rule?"
                  "By the law of Christ, as laid down in his Word."
                  "May she not neglect or refuse to decide for herself, and leave it to those
                     without to come or not to come, as they may think best?"
                  "No, for God has constituted her the guardian of his ordinances
                     which he has placed within her gates."
                  "But may she not reverse his order and give communion first and then
                     baptism?"
                  "No, she must, of course, be governed by his law."
                  "May she not dispense with baptism altogether?"
                  "Certainly not, if his law requires it."
                  "May she not treat all those as baptized who think themselves
                     baptized?"
                  "No, she is to be governed by His Word as she understands it, and
                     not as it may be understood by those without her ranks. She is to
                     examine and decide for herself. She is to recognize and treat as baptized those
                     only whom she believes to have actually been baptized according to the
                     Scripture model. She is not the lawgiver, but simply the executor of the laws
                     of Christ. She is not at liberty to set them aside for any whims of her own.
                     Nor is she at liberty to enforce one part and not another. If, therefore,
                        He requires baptism as a prerequisite to communion, she
                        dare
                      not in any case refuse or neglect
                     to do so also. She must see his rules carried out, or she becomes
                     unfaithful to her trust and a rebel to her Lord.
                  "If you have any doubt that each church is constituted thus by
                     Christ the guardian of her own purity, and of the sanctity of his ordinances as
                     administered within her doors, I refer you to Romans xiv: 5, and 2 Thess. iii:
                     6, in which the power of the church to determine whom they will receive, and
                     the duty of the church to withdraw from every one who walked disorderly, is
                     distinctly recognized. But both the right and the imperious obligation for its
                     constant, faithful, and impartial exercise, follows of necessity from the
                     simple fact, that if the church does not herself exclude the unprepared and the
                     unworthy, there is no one to do it; and it cannot be done at all.
                  "I am now ready to answer your question about the Christian courtesy of
                     refusing to invite the unbaptized to our communion. Permit me to put it in
                     proper form for you, and let us see how it will sound. We will suppose it to be
                     communion-day at the Baptist church, and that your church in a body comes to
                     our door, and asks admission to our table—not as a matter of right, but on the
                     ground of Christian courtesy. You say to us, very affectionately and
                     kindly—Dear brethren in Christ, we are fully persuaded that no unbaptized
                     person, according to the laws of our Redeemer, should ever be permitted to
                     approach his table. We never permit any to come to it in
                        our church whom we do not believe to have been
                     baptized. We could not do it without sinning against God. We know very well,
                     brethren, that you act upon the same rule. You agree with us that
                     it would be very wrong and sinful to permit any to approach your
                     table whom you do not think have been baptized. We know, also,
                     that you believe that we have not been baptized, and consequently
                     that you cannot permit us to approach without doing what you would regard
                        as an act of open and deliberate rebellion against the laws of
                     Christ. But we regard you all as Christian gentlemen and ladies, and
                     quite familiar with the laws of politeness and Christian
                        courtesy, and it must be very evident to you that
                        these laws require you to invite us to your communion. You
                     surely will not be so impolite as to refuse us."
                  "Oh, Mr. Courtney, that is too bad! Surely you have no right to look upon us in
                     such a light as that!"
                  "I am well aware, madam, that your people have not been accustomed to see in
                     this light your claims that we should invite you to our communion. You are so
                     accustomed to think of yourselves as baptized, that you cannot
                     fully realize the fact that others should think differently. But thus the case
                     must always appear to the mind of any well informed Baptist. Nor is this by any
                     means the worst of it.
                  "It is always and everywhere considered an act of great discourtesy to ask one
                     to do anything which it is well known he will regard as a moral wrong, though
                     it should be asked of him only as a private individual, and in his personal
                     capacity. But the discourtesy is much greater when you ask him, as a public
                     man, in his official capacity, and in direct and open opposition to his
                        avowed and publicly acknowledged sentiments, to do
                     what not only you know he would consider wrong, but what all
                        the world knows, or might know, he would so regard, what he has again
                     and again publicly declared that he could not do
                     without a grievous disregard of his conscientious convictions of right. To ask,
                     for instance, of a Son of Temperance, whom you know is pledged not
                     to drink intoxicating liquors; whom you know feels that he is
                     under peculiar and solemn obligations not to drink; yet to ask him not merely
                     to disregard the obligation, which you
                      know, and which the
                        world knows, that he recognizes as binding upon his conscience;
                     but to ask him to do it publicly and officially as a Son of
                        Temperance, in the Division-room, would be something such an act of
                     discourtesy, though much less flagrant than it is to ask a Baptist, as a
                     Baptist, in his public capacity as a church member, to disregard his
                     obligations to his Saviour, by which the purity of the church and the sanctity
                     of the ordinances are to be preserved."
                  "Oh, dear, no! Please, Mr. Courtney, don't think so hardly of us. I am sure
                     none of our ministers or members ever intended anything of the sort when they
                     invited you to our communion, or complained that you did not invite us to
                     yours. We never thought about its being a matter of conscience
                     with you."
                  "And why should you not have thought of it, when we have preached it in the
                     pulpit, and proclaimed it through the press, and repeated it continually in
                     private conversation? No one need be ignorant of the ground on
                     which Baptists stand in regard to this question. Their sentiments have been
                     long and plainly before the world. There is no one who has any occasion to
                     complain of them, who does not know, or might not know, that they cannot
                        dispense with what they conscientiously regard as Christian baptism;
                     and that on this account, and not from any impoliteness or
                     discourtesy, they are debarred from inter-communion with sprinkled
                     Christians.
                  "But I have not done with this question of courtesy. I want our Pædobaptist
                     friends to see precisely where they stand. After you have asked us to disregard
                     the most sacred obligations, to repudiate our conscientious convictions of
                     duty, and as a church, in our assembled and official capacity, to refuse
                     obedience to what you well know we all regard as the imperative law of Christ,
                     and to perform an act which you well know we earnestly believe he has
                     forbidden; when we respectfully decline to do it, and kindly give you our
                     reasons, you set up a great and senseless cry of bigotry, of selfishness, of
                     ignorance, and (will you pardon me for saying it?) OF CHRISTIAN DISCOURTESY; as
                     though it were more discourteous for us firmly to resist all your solicitations
                     to disregard our Master's Word, than it is for you, who profess like us to love
                     him, to ask us to do it, or complain of us for not doing it."
                  "But we do not ask you to do what we think wrong."
                  "No, you only ask us to do what you know WE think
                        wrong, and then abuse us because we dare not do it. But let it pass.
                     I should think, Doctor, you would find some serious, if not insuperable
                     difficulties in your plan of inter-communion with other denominations, over
                     whose discipline you have no control."
                  "How so?"
                  "Let me explain.—The peculiar and distinctive privilege of a church member in
                     good standing in your church, is the liberty of approach to the Lord's table.
                     When you exclude the unworthy, they can no longer be permitted to sit down with
                     you at this sacred feast. Now suppose you exclude a member to-day for heresy in
                     doctrine, or irregularity in practice, and he goes to-morrow and unites with
                     some other denomination, can he not, according to your principles, come right
                     back, and claim a seat at your table as the member of another denomination,
                     although you have just driven him away as a member of your own?"
                  "That might possibly happen; but I do not think we have ever been much troubled
                     with cases of that sort."
                  "That is because your open communion is held in theory, but seldom reduced to
                     practice. If there were, in fact, that inter-communion between you and
                     Baptists, which many of you profess
                     so much to desire, I can conceive that it might happen very often, to the utter
                     destruction of any effective discipline in both bodies. Let us see. You require
                     of all your communicants who have children, that they bring them to the church
                     for baptism, do you not?"
                  "Certainly, it is the solemn duty of every Christian parent to dedicate his
                     offspring to God in this holy ordinance at his earliest convenience."
                  "Very good. Now suppose some one of them should take a fancy to ask you for the
                        text on which this requirement is based. You might, as you very
                     well know, search all the New Testament, from Matthew to Revelation, and you
                     could not produce a solitary precept or example. You would try to satisfy him
                     with a wordy jargon about the covenant of circumcision, &c. But he might
                     reply—Jewish children were circumcised at eight days old, because
                     God commanded it to be done. If Christian children are to be
                        baptized, you can show where he commanded that.
                  "You will say—No, but a command was not necessary; they were to be baptized as
                     a matter of course.
                  "Very well then. Of course it was done, and you can show me at
                     least one case among the thousands of 'both men and women,' in
                     which there was one little child. But you can't find it. And he
                     begins to doubt the propriety of performing as an ordinance of Christ, what
                     Christ did not command. He cannot be persuaded to bring up the little ones into
                     the church. You exhort him and reason with him in vain; and you are obliged at
                     last to exclude him. I have read of such a case. You exclude him, and he comes
                     to us, and we receive him. Now he holds the same opinions and is guilty of the
                     same practices. But though you could not commune with him as a member of
                        your own church, because he was guilty of the heinous
                        sin of denying infant baptism tism, you will welcome him
                     back the very next Sabbath as a Baptist. You urge him to sit down to the same
                     table from which you have just now formally expelled him. And I suppose, if he
                     should decline to accept, you would henceforth abuse him as a narrow-minded,
                     selfish, bigoted, and 
                        intollerant
                        intolerant
                      Baptist, who thought himself too good to commune with other
                     Christians.
                  "The same thing might happen to us, and this furnishes an additional reason
                        why we cannot commune with other denominations. I have said we
                     could not, because you were in our view unbaptized; and that is of
                     itself an unanswerable and all-sufficient reason, if there were no other. But
                     there is another growing out of this matter of church discipline. Let us
                     suppose a case for illustration. A minister in our church has imbibed the idea
                     that the sprinkling ceremony, which you borrowed from the Roman Catholics, is
                     valid baptism, and insists upon introducing it into our churches. We would
                     regard it as a great wrong. We would, for the peace and purity of our
                     communion, at once expel him, and deny him the privileges of the church. He
                     goes to you, and you receive him gladly, and the very next day he comes back
                     and claims as a member of your church, privileges which we had
                     just now formally denied him as a member of our own. Do you not
                     see that this rule carried out in actual practice, must necessarily destroy the
                     force of all attempts at church discipline."
                  "But how do Baptists now avoid that difficulty among themselves?"
                  "Very easily and simply. The right to our communion never extends beyond the
                     reach of our discipline."
                  "Then how can members of one Baptist church claim a seat at the table of
                     another, for, if I understand your church polity every one of your churches is
                     an independent body."
                  
                  "They cannot claim it as a right, and our invitation
                     to commune is extended by courtesy only to those whose faith and practice is so
                     like our own, that no person could be a member in good standing with them who
                     would not stand equally well with us.
                  "The rule adopted by Mr. Wesley (Discipline, sec. 5th) and which is founded
                     alike in Scriptural principles and common sense, is the same in substance as
                     that which regulates our practice. That is, 'no person shall
                     be admitted to the Lord's Supper among us, who is guilty of any practice for
                     which we would exclude a member of our church.' This rule you see at once
                     compels us to deny all who teach and practice sprinkling for baptism, and all
                     who engage in what we regard as the sinful though solemn mockery of baptizing
                     unconscious infants, or any others who have not made a personal and credible
                     profession of repentance and faith, according to the plain requirements of the
                     Word of God, which always and everywhere puts repentance and faith
                     before baptism, as it puts baptism before communion. We are bound to this
                     course by that solemn and most impressive injunction of the Apostle, 2 Thess.
                     3: 6—'Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
                     you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and
                        not after the tradition which he received from us.'"
                  "I declare, Mr. Courtney," said Mrs. Jones, "I had no idea that you Baptists
                     had so good and satisfactory reasons for your singular exclusiveness; and I
                     promise you now that I will never complain of you again. In fact, if I ever
                     become a Baptist, I shall be a close communion Baptist."
                  "I do not see," said Mrs. Ernest, "how any one can take the Scripture for his
                     guide, and be any thing else; and I have been thinking all the time that there
                     must be some good Bible reason for it, or else Theodosia and her uncle would
                     not have agreed to it—but now, when I come to think of it, I have not heard
                     either of them say a word on the subject."
                  The reader will recollect that at the beginning of this conversation, Professor
                     Jones had gone out of the room, for some cause at that time unexplained. He
                     returned after a few minutes, but took no part in the conversation, in which
                     indeed he seemed to feel but very little interest Mrs. Jones had quickly
                     noticed his abstracted manner, so different from his ordinary behavior; and had
                     several times cast an uneasy glance into his face, hoping to read there the
                     cause. But she could only learn that it was in some way connected with
                     Theodosia, whom he loved with the affection of a father.—Each time she looked,
                     his eye was resting with an expression of the deepest pity upon his lovely
                     niece, who took no more part in the conversation than himself. In truth, she
                     had spoken very little to any one since the appearance of Mr. Percy at the
                     court-house on the preceding night. His relation of his experience of grace,
                     and his declaration of his desire to be baptized, had placed him in a new
                     relation to her. She did not know that he had then never seen her letter—and
                     once (but only for a moment) the thought intruded into her heart that all this
                     change had been made for her sake, and not for Christ's. She
                     repelled it, however, in the instant that it came, and all day long had held
                     herself ready to welcome him back to his place in her heart as her betrothed,
                     and felt that she could love him now with an affection even deeper and more
                     intense, higher and purer and holier than that which with such agony of effort
                     she had been trying to strangle in her heart. She thought he would have come
                     and spoken to her before she left the meeting, but he did not seem to notice
                     her presence there. She was sure he would call in the morning—but dinner was on
                     the table, and he had not come. That
                     letter of hers must have prevented; but surely there was not in it any harsh
                     expression, any single word of unkindness. Did not her heart ache,
                     with the very intensity of her love, while she was writing it? And
                     now she tried to recall it sentence by sentence, and word by word, to see if
                     there was any thing there which she should not have said.
                  The afternoon wore slowly away. She sat at the window where she could see the
                     door of his office, but it was never opened. She listened to every foot-fall on
                     the pavement, but she heard not his familiar step. Once the latch of the front
                     door was moved, and she sprang from her seat and felt the blood crimson all her
                     face and neck; but she sat down in a moment, for she knew it was her brother
                     Edwin. Mr. Courtney called after supper. Mr. Percy had not come yet; but she
                     hoped to meet him at her uncle's. He was not there, and her spirit retired
                     within itself, and she sat as mute and almost as unconscious of what was
                     passing around her, as a marble statue.
                  When uncle Jones went out, it was to see Dr. Woodruff, a cousin of Mr. Percy,
                     who was also his most devoted friend and confidant—he was to have officiated as
                     the bridegroom's friend on the expected wedding-day—and had just returned from
                     Mr. Percy's mother's, where he had spent the day with one whose earthly career
                     seemed likely soon to close. He had come in to break the melancholy tidings as
                     best he could to Theodosia.
                  The facts as he related them to Professor Jones were briefly these: The servant
                     who waited on Mr. Percy's office had gone there in the morning and had found
                     the young man lying upon his face on the floor with Theodosia's letter in his
                     hand. When the servant entered he seemed to be asleep. He aroused him and
                     raised him up, but his looks were so wild and his face was so pale, and his
                     words (rather muttered than spoken) so strange and unnatural, that he placed
                     him on the bed and ran for his cousin the Doctor.
                  When Dr. Woodruff came, and read the letter, he understood how it had been. Mr.
                     Percy, from the time he wrote and sent that distressing letter to Theodosia in
                     the previous week, had been in a state of most intense mental excitement. Much
                     of the time he had been suffering extreme agony of mind. His physical powers
                     had become greatly exhausted, and his nervous system debilitated and excitable.
                     He had gone from the meeting in the court-house (where he had so unexpectedly
                     had an opportunity to ask for Christian baptism) to his office. There he found
                     Theodosia's letter. He had never till then conceived that his letter would have
                     occasioned such distress to her, or that it would have led her to such a
                     determination. Yet if he had been entirely self-collected, and his mind had not
                     been already exhausted by long continued over excitement, the shock which the
                     reading of her reply now gave him, would have been speedily followed by calmer
                     thoughts, and an instant determination to see her at once, confess his fault,
                     ask her forgiveness, and set himself right in her heart. But exhausted in body
                     and excited in mind as he was, the revulsion of feeling was too great to be
                     endured. He read on till he came to where she said, "When you return, I pray
                     you to consider me but as one dead. It will be better for us both." The paper
                     seemed to grow black before his eyes. The room was suddenly darkened. He felt a
                     strange dreamy calmness creep over his brain. He sunk down out of his chair in
                     a deep swoon, or fainting fit, upon the floor. He became conscious after a
                     time, but had not strength to rise; and subsided again into a strange unquiet
                     sleep, mixed with half waking dreams, in which he saw a beauteous form, more
                     like an angel than a being of the earth, who came and raised him up and looked into his
                     eyes so sadly, so reproachfully, and yet so tenderly, that he struggled to tell
                     her how his heart bled at the remembrance of the act which caused her so much
                     sorrow—but he could not speak. He strove to raise his hand and make some sign
                     to assure her that he loved her better for her firm adherence to the truth, but
                     the muscles would not obey the will. He could not move—he could not speak—and
                     she was gone. Oh, how deep and how long was the darkness of that night! She was
                     gone! He felt that she was lost to him forever. The very light of his life was
                     darkness now,—and yet he waited and watched for her return. Could she leave him
                     thus? Would she not love him still? Hark! he hears her foot-step.—The door
                     opens. Some one touches him. He starts from his slumber to greet her with some
                     word of love, but he sees only his servant, who is trying to remove him from
                     the floor to the bed. He stares at him with the strange gaze of incipient
                     madness, and bids him leave him to rest in peace.—The doctor saw at once that a
                     long and fearful brain-fever was the best that he could hope for; and while his
                     strength was yet comparatively undiminished, resolved to remove him to his
                     mother's house, some two miles in the country. This done, he prepared such
                     remedies as his medical skill suggested, sat down, and watched beside his bed
                     till he was satisfied that there was no immediate danger; and then, at his
                     mother's request, came in to explain to Theodosia the reason why he had not
                     called on her. He had thought best to explain, as we have seen, to uncle Jones,
                     and leave him to make it known to his niece.
                  The Professor had been so much occupied with this matter, that he scarcely
                     heard the discussion which was going on in his presence. He
                     was glad when a pause in the conversation showed that the parties engaged had,
                     for the present at least, exhausted their ammunition, and were prepared for a
                     temporary truce, if not for a permanent peace. He turned their attention to
                     some other subject, and in a few minutes the Rev. Dr. took his leave.
                  Uncle Jones walked home with Theodosia. They walked slowly; and when Mrs.
                     Ernest and Mr. Courtney had gotten some way before them, he broke the silence,
                     by reminding her that she had not spoken a word all through the evening; "and,"
                     said he, "I will tell you why. You were distressed that Mr. Percy had not
                     called to see you since his return, and wondering what could be the cause. Will
                     it relieve your mind to tell you that he is sick?"
                  "I will not deny to you, uncle, that such was the subject of my thoughts. I
                     hope he is not seriously unwell."
                  "The doctor does not think him in any immediate danger, but fears it will be
                     long before he can resume his business."
                  "Why, uncle, what can be the matter? I am sure I never saw him look better than
                     he did last night. Did you not notice the brightness of his eye, and the
                     freshness of his cheek, and how rich and mellow was his voice while he was
                     telling what God so wonderfully had done for his soul?"
                  "I was myself too much engaged to observe him closely, but I can well imagine
                     that the unnatural flushing of his cheek, and the unusual brilliancy of his
                     eye, were but the tokens of that intense mental excitement which preceded, if
                     it did not produce, the fever from which he is suffering now."
                  They had reached the cottage door. Uncle Jones thought best not to go into any
                     further particulars, and returned to his home.
                  That night if one had passed by the window of Theodosia's room, he might have
                     heard many a sob mingled with
                     half-uttered prayers. Had she known all the truth, her sobs might
                     have been louder; but her prayers could hardly have been more earnest.
                  The messenger who went next day to inquire, returned to say that Mr. Percy was
                     no better; and so it was the next day, and the next. Dr. Woodruff had called in
                     a brother practitioner, but did not reveal to him, nor even to Mr. Percy's
                     mother, the whole secret of his attack. The letter which he found in his hand,
                     he had considerately laid aside, to be returned to him should he recover. Its
                     existence was a professional secret. He attributed his illness to the long and
                     tiresome journey on horseback through the sun, and to such excitement of mind
                     as he had himself publicly described before his strange attack.
                  On Saturday evening Mrs. Ernest received a line from Mrs. Percy, saying that
                     her son was growing daily worse and worse; and, strange to tell, he had in his
                     delirium conceived a singular fancy that Theodosia had ceased to love him, and
                     had even formally discarded him. This idea, she said, was uppermost in all the
                     wanderings of his mind, and evidently was exerting a great influence upon the
                     progress of his disease; and Dr. Woodruff had suggested that if Theodosia could
                     herself assure him of her continued affection, it might have a soothing, and
                     perhaps a healing influence.
                  Mrs. Ernest handed the note to her daughter, with the remark, that in
                     consideration of their well-known betrothal, there could be no impropriety in
                     granting Mrs. Percy's request.
                  "We will go to him at once, dear mother," said Theodosia, when she had read the
                     note, with eyes full of tears.—"Even a brief delay may be of fatal
                     consequence."
                  When they reached Mrs Percy's house, he had fallen into
                      an unquiet slumber, from which they did not seek to awaken him. They
                     sat down in the room, and conversed in a low tone about the nature of his
                     disease, and other matters which the circumstances suggested. Theodosia took
                     but little part in this conversation, except as a most eager listener. She sat
                     down near the head of the low couch on which he lay, but presently arose, and,
                     under pretence of shading the patient's eyes, adjusted the candle so that it
                     should not shine upon her own. Oh, who can tell the thoughts that then were
                     thronging in her maiden heart! How changed he was! How pale—how corpse-like was
                     his cheek! How wasted was the thin, emaciated hand, which lay outside the
                     cover! How parched and feverish the lips! How sunken the eyes! How would they
                     look when he should open them? Would he know her? Would he speak to her? What
                     if he now should open his eyes and see me here?—and she almost
                     unconsciously moved her chair back out of his range of vision as she thought of
                     it. His lips moved: she reached the spoon in the tumbler of water upon the
                     little table, and moistened them. He opened his eyes wide; he looked her
                     steadily in the face; he glanced at her white dress; he looked in her face
                     again. She fancied that the expression of wonder on his face gave place to a
                     scarcely perceptible smile. But he did not speak; he did not make any sign of
                     recognition. She sat down again and wept.
                  "You must need rest, Mrs. Percy. You may go and sleep, and leave the care of
                     him to us to-night," said Mrs. Ernest. "We will watch him as tenderly as you
                     could do yourself."
                  Mrs. Percy laid down, and Theodosia withdrew to some distance from the couch,
                     and sat where she could see every change that passed upon his face. The love
                     which she had for a time endeavored to eradicate from out her mind, had only, like the lofty oak when torn
                     and wrenched by the mighty storm, extended its roots more widely and deeply,
                     and clasped them more firmly round her heart; and now when the cause which led
                     her to cast it off had been removed, she clung more ardently and devotedly than
                     ever to the hope that he would yet be hers. Again and again during that long
                     night, when she hastened to do some little act of kindness, did he open his
                     eyes and look at her with a kind of wondering tenderness in his gaze; but yet
                     he did not speak, nor was she sure that he recognized her at all.
                  He slept more quietly that night than he had yet done: and when the doctor came
                     next day, he whispered in his ear that a beautiful vision had come to him in
                     his dreams, and looked at him so lovingly, that he was ready to speak, and ask
                     it whence it came, but feared his voice might break the charm, and it would
                     vanish from his sight.
                  "You must stay with us, my child," said Mrs. Percy, "till my son gets better.
                     He talked of you continually until you came, but now it seems as though your
                     very presence in the house exerts a sort of magic influence over him, for he is
                     quiet, and does not so much as lisp your name. The doctor says if you could but
                     become his nurse, he may yet recover. Will you not, my daughter?"
                  "If my mother thinks there would be no impropriety in my doing so."
                  "Certainly, Theodosia, I think you ought to return and assist Mrs. Percy in
                     every way you can. But your uncle and I are going to be baptized to-day, and
                     you will not be willing to be absent from the meeting."
                  This conversation took place in the hall, from which there was an open door
                     leading to the patient's room. He heard Theodosia's voice; he thought he heard
                     her name.—He made some sound, which recalled his mother to his side, and
                     looking in her face with a more natural express on than he had since his
                     attack, he said:
                  "Mother, I thought I saw her spirit here last night, and just now I am sure I
                     heard her voice, and thought that some one called her name. Tell me if she is
                     here."
                  "Would you like to see her, my son?"
                  "Oh, yes; I want to ask her to forgive me before I die."
                  "You do not think you are going to die, my child!"
                  "I have strange feelings, mother. I do not know what death is, or how he comes;
                     but I am sure I have been very near the world of spirits."
                  "Do you feel any alarm at the prospect of death?"
                  "My mind is very weak, mother. I scarcely feel or think at all. I have a
                     blessed Saviour: I remember that; and I will trust Him, even though I die. But
                     tell me—did I hear her voice, or was it but a dream?"
                  "Try to compose yourself, my child. The doctor says that you must sleep awhile
                     this morning. If you wish to see Miss Ernest, I will send for her."
                  "Do you think she would come?"
                  "I know she would. So make yourself easy, and you shall see her when you
                     wake."
                  On returning to her visitors, Mrs. Percy related this conversation, and
                     insisted that Theodosia must remain to be there when he awoke; and as the young
                     lady did not object, Mrs. Ernest went home without her. She laid down on her
                     arrival, and took a short nap, and then taking Edwin by the hand, joined uncle
                     and aunt Jones on their way to the Baptist meeting.
                  When the usual invitation was given to those who desired membership with the
                     church to come forward and make their profession, uncle Jones was surprised and
                     delighted to see both his wife and
                     his sister go up and ask admittance into the church of God. Neither of them had
                     said a word to him upon the subject, for though both had yielded to their
                     convictions of the truth, that immersion is the only baptism some days before,
                     and both had been convinced that believers are the only Scriptural subjects of
                     baptism, they could neither of them overcome their repulsion to the practice of
                     close communion, or consent to sever their connections with those to whom they
                     had such strong attachments, until the explanations of Mr. Courtney in their
                     last conversation put it beyond the shadow of a doubt that the Lord Jesus not
                     only commanded believers, and them only, to be immersed, but that he had also
                     forbidden all who had not believed and been immersed, to approach his table,
                     and required of those who had in this way become, according to his order, the
                     members of his church, that they should carefully guard the purity and the
                     perpetuity of his ordinances, by permitting no one to partake with them in the
                     peculiar privileges of church members who had not, like themselves, been made
                     members according to the same Gospel order. This difficulty removed, they were
                     now ready to be baptized.
                  We need not detain you any longer, gentle reader, by describing to you the
                     baptism of these three, who, with several others, followed the example of their
                     Saviour, by going down into the water, and were buried with him in the liquid
                     grave. Nor can we now continue the history in which you have come, we trust, to
                     feel so great an interest that you would gladly see the end. We have finished
                     our ten nights' study of Scripture baptism. We have examined it in regard to
                     its mode, its subject, and its results. We have endeavored to do it plainly and
                     candidly, but if we know our own hearts, we have tried to do it kindly—and in
                     the spirit of that 'charity" which "rejoices in the truth."
                  We are grieved to leave our darling Theodosia in such distress. But she must
                     remain a little while in the valley of tears until by her own sorrows, she has
                     been taught how to sympathize with the sorrowful. He was the wisest man of
                     earth who said, "By the sadness of the countenance the heart is made 
                        bettter
                        better
                     ." She needs the discipline of grief to fit her for the life of
                     eminent usefulness which lies before her—and the history of which will soon be
                     given in another volume.
               
            
         
         
            
               
                  
                  PREFACE.
                  THE only attempted review or extended unfavorable notice of the first volume of
                     Theodosia Ernest, appeared in the St. Louis Presbyterian, from the pen of its
                     Editor, N. L. Rice, D.D. That notice is here given, and a Review of Mr. R.'s
                     singular statements reviewed in a dream—and also the natural effect of such a
                     treatment of the best arguments ever produced by Presbyterians or
                     Pedobaptists—the conversion of Pastor Johnson. We regard this Review, in
                     connection with Mr. Rice's notice, as the most powerful argument in favor of
                     Baptist positions.

                  NOTICE OF THEODOSIA.
                  BY N. L. RICE.
                  (AS IT APPEARED IN THE ST. LOUIS PRESBYTERIAN.)
                  IF perseverance and ingenuity were evidences of religious truth, there could no
                     longer be a doubt, that immersion is the only valid baptism. Long
                     and earnestly have the advocates of this doctrine labored to sustain its
                     claims. The pulpit, the newspaper, the tract, the book, learned argument, and
                     assertion, and ridicule, have all been laid under requisition. Then the whole
                     Bible must be translated anew to make it sustain the Baptist sense. And now we
                     have before us, by the kindness of a friend, a Baptist novel, the
                     title of which is "Theodosia Ernest, or the Heroine of Faith."
                     The author has modestly concealed his name, but the work is published by
                     Graves, Marks & Rutland, Nashville, Tennessee. The book is really
                     instructive and amusing. We purpose briefly to notice a few of its
                     pecularities.
                  It displays throughout a consciousness of the weakness of the doctrine it is
                     intended to advocate. 1st. The title betrays this consciousness—"The Heroine of
                     Faith." There is in every Christian's heart a strong sympathy with the
                     struggles and conflicts of a genuine faith, rising above the allurements and
                     persecutions of a wicked world. The author has thought it necessary to take
                     advantage of this noble sympathy. If he had adopted the more truthful
                        title—"The Heroine of Immersion"—the book would have fallen
                     still-born from the press. There is little that is either noble or romantic in
                        the zeal of a professing
                     Christian, young or old, for a narrow sectarian dogma. The author judged
                     merely, that the cause of immersion needs the advantage of a title far nobler
                     than itself.
                  The same conscious weakness shows itself in the choice of a
                        heroine instead of a hero, and of a heroine who is
                     a highly cultivated, sensitive young lady of eighteen. Who can help strongly
                     sympathizing with such a young lady, devotedly pious, evidently conscientious,
                     willing to sacrifice everything for the truth, conducting an argument against
                     two or three men much older than herself? We forget the cause and sympathize
                     with the girl. We put double weight to her arguments, and feel gratified at the
                     perplexities into which her antagonists are thrown. The author of the novel
                     judged rightly that the cause of immersion and anti-pedo-baptism claims all
                     this sympathy and more. If he had been a hero, instead of a youthful heroine,
                     his hearers would have weighed his arguments, instead of being carried away
                     with sympathy.
                  The cause needed even stronger sympathy; and, therefore, Miss Theodosia Ernest
                     is brought in conflict with the man to whom she was engaged to be married—a
                     cold-hearted, formal Presbyterian lover—whom she loved most devotedly. He
                     opposes her joining "the contemptible sect of Baptists"—(we naturally
                     sympathize with a person opposed.) She, poor girl, is thrown into a paroxysm of
                     grief, sighs, weeps, and prays, and resolves to break off the engagement, just
                     for the pure love of immersion! The reader feels his eyes filling with tears of
                     sympathy for the dear distressed creature who had also her mother in
                     opposition, and is almost ready to be immersed himself just to comfort her. Who
                     would have thought that a Baptist knew so well how much it was necessary to
                     excite the sympathies of his readers to prevent them seeing the flimsiness of
                     his arguments?
                  The necessities of immersion were even greater. Although Miss Theodosia is
                     singularly furnished with Baptist arguments for one who has just reason to
                     doubt the validity of her baptism; Prof. Courtney, an accomplished scholar, is
                     called to aid her. He, having been a Presbyterian, and having examined the
                     whole subject, is perfectly at home in the discussion. He understands Greek,
                     and he can read all the learned authors on the subject. On the other side we
                     have, first, Mr. Percy, the gentleman engaged to Miss Theodosia, who is
                     represented as wholly ignorant of the subject; Rev. Mr. Johnson, the young
                     lady's pastor, who is made to talk like an ignoramus and a simpleton, and Prof.
                     Jones, the heroine's uncle, who had confessedly never examined the subject, and
                     scarcely had sense enough to keep him out of the fire. With such combatants on
                     each side, immersion may lift its head in bold defiance. We cannot help
                     admiring the author's clear perception of the necessities of his cause. It was
                     exceedingly proper that he should select, as the advocates of Pedobaptism, such
                     persons as Mr. Percy, who "had never had a serious thought upon the question,"
                     (p. 17,) Mr. Johnson, who said—"I have never studied these controversies much,"
                     and "Uncle Jones," who, though Professor of Languages, had considered it the
                     duty of his parents and their pastor to attend to his baptism, and "had never
                     inquired whether they did it illy or well," (p. 124.) It is precisely over such
                     persons, as the author rightly judged, that Baptist controvertists gain the
                     victory. And yet we cannot but wonder that he would so publicly disgrace his
                     cause, by selecting such ignoramuses as the opponents of the learned Mr.
                     Courtney!
                  The respective characters being thus selected, the advocates of immersion are,
                     of course, allowed to make bold assertions which are utterly untrue, and to
                     keep out of view the merits of the case, whilst their ignorant and soft-headed
                        opponents gape and wonder. Thus
                     "the heroine of faith" decides, as by intuition, that baptism is an
                        act, and that if immersion is baptism, sprinkling and pouring cannot
                     be. Her intellect is too lofty, and her perception too clear to hesitate for a
                     moment to decide against forty-nine fiftieths of the wisest and best men that
                     have lived, both in ancient and modern times. The author rightly judged, that
                     this heroine ought to be very self-conceited. Mr. Percy is made to admit, what
                     every tolerable scholar knows to be untrue, that all the lexicons sustain the
                     immersionists. It suited the purpose of the writer to keep out of view the
                     declaration of the learned Baptist, Carson, that "all the lexicons" were
                     against them. "Professor Jones," poor simpleton, is made to express the
                     opinion, that immersion was first introduced "by the madmen of Munster during
                     the Reformation of Luther." He cannot tell, poor fellow, where he got the idea;
                     but "perhaps he got something of it from reading D'Aubigne's History of the
                     Reformation—perhaps he received it by hearing something of the kind from the
                     pulpit." And the accomplished Baptist, Mr. Courtney, has "seen and heard such
                     statements many times from various sources. They are often recorded in
                     Presbyterian and Methodist newspapers" (p. 160.) And the learned gentleman
                     gravely goes to work to disprove this statement, which was never made by any
                     tolerably informed Presbyterian, or recorded in any respectable Pedobaptist
                     paper. The book abounds with such vile misrepresentations.
                  The book is written with ingenuity—it was necessary that it should be. It keeps
                     out of view the facts and arguments on which Pedobaptists rely, or caricatures
                     them to make them appear ridiculous. It puts into their mouths arguments they
                     never use. It manufactures history to suit the occasion. In a novel all this
                     can be done in such a way that the uninformed reader will not readily detect
                     it. We are gratified at observing ing how distinctly the writer shows, first
                     and last, that the cause of immersion needs very peculiar advantage, in order
                     to sustain its claims.
                  After all, since he was advocating a fiction, he is probably right in adopting
                     fiction as the means of its defence. The only way to find so ignorant and
                     stupid Presbyterians as Percy, Johnson and Jones, is to
                        manufacture them for the occasion; and nowhere but in the
                     imagination of a zealous immersionist can such Presbyterian young ladies as
                     "Theodosia Ernest, the Heroine of Faith," be found. The author could not
                     successfully assail real, living Presbyterians; and, therefore,
                     being resolved on battle and a victory, he manufactures a few to suit him, and
                     then chooses their weapons for them, and directs them how to use them, so they
                     will be sure not to hurt them. Brave man! Don Quixote was scarcely his
                     equal.
                  Verily, the cause of anti-pedobaptism seems to be "on its last legs." If it
                     cannot induce the Christian world to receive an immersionist Bible, and if
                        novels will not sustain it, what is it to do?
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAPTER I.
                     A DREAM.
                     I HAD a dream, but whether it was all a dream, let
                        him who reads it judge.
                     Methought in my dream that I was in Pastor Johnson's study. He had in his
                        hand the Presbyterian newspaper, called the Presbyterian of St. Louis. He
                        had just found the article of Dr. Rice on Theodosia. His little grey eyes
                        began to twinkle the moment they caught the caption, "A BAPTIST NOVEL," for
                        since his troubles with the young lady and her uncle, he has devoured with
                        great avidity everything which he could find against the Baptists. As he was
                        reading, however, a heavy frown began to gather on his brow, his lips were
                        pressed together with convulsive energy, and the paper shook with the
                        tremulous excitement which pervaded his whole body. He continued to read,
                        however, until he had finished the piece, and then, as if to assure himself
                        that he had not read amiss, he began at the caption and read it every word
                        again. When he had done, he folded the paper carefully, put it into the
                        inside pocket of his coat, looked into the fire for several seconds, then
                        nodded his head three times very significantly, not straight forward with
                        the chin towards his breast bone, but diagonally, with his chin inclined
                        towards the left shoulder, and the back of his head drawn towards the
                        right.
                     What this peculiar pantomime might signify, I was, in my dream, greatly at a
                        loss to determine, until he had gone into the room where his wife was
                        engaged in her domestic duties.
                     
                     "Mrs. Johnson," said he, "I desire that you will pack my carpet-bag. I must
                        make a journey to St. Louis, and to get home before the Sabbath, must start
                        this morning."
                     "Why, my dear, what in the world is the matter?"
                     "I want to go and see Dr. Rice, madam; I don't like the way he talks about
                        me. He has had the audacity to call me a fool, madam, nay,
                        more, he has even declared that there is not so great a fool in our whole
                        denomination. It is too much, madam, for human nature to endure. I feel it
                        my duty to go and talk to him as a Christian brother; I want to tell him to
                        his face that I think he has done me great injustice, and, in short, has
                        treated me very badly."
                     Mrs. Johnson seemed instinctively to understand that delay or remonstrance
                        was out of the question. She made at once the needful arrangements, and her
                        husband was gone.
                     Then I saw in my dream, that he entered the room where the Reverend Doctor
                        was engaged in writing.
                     "I presume this is the Reverend Doctor Rice," said he. "My name is Johnson,
                        sir, the Rev. Mr. Johnson, of —. I felt it my duty, sir, to come and see you
                        about your paper of the —"
                     "Ah, I am glad to see you, Mr. Johnson. Take a seat, sir; I hope you have
                        had a pleasant journey."
                     "Why, yes, sir, reasonably so, but in fact I have a great dislike to
                        traveling, and nothing would have induced me to take the journey but a
                        conviction of duty. I felt it to be my duty, sir, to come and tell you that
                        I think you have treated me very badly, sir. And let me say, sir, that you
                        have done more to destroy my confidence and that of my congregation, in the
                        truthfulness of our positions on the Baptismal question, than all the
                        Baptist arguments I have ever heard."
                     "Why, my dear sir, what can you mean?"
                     Mr. Johnson pulled the paper before referred to out of his pocket, and found
                        the article on Theodosia.
                     "I suppose, sir," said he, holding it up before the Doctor, "you will not
                        deny that you are the author of that?"
                     "Certainly not," replied the Doctor, as he glanced rapidly down the column
                        like one who was familiar with the words. "I take credit to myself, sir, as
                        being the first, and so far as I know, the only person who has
                        attempted to answer that peculiar book."
                     "I have no objection," replied Mr. Johnson, "to your answering the book. In
                        fact, no one could rejoice more than I to see it rightly answered, but I
                        want you to understand that you have done me and those who stood with me in
                        that discussion very great injustice. It was unkind, sir, it was cruel in
                        you to intimate that there was not in all the Presbyterian denomination so
                        great a fool as I, just because I had never carefully examined the subject
                        of baptism for myself, but trusted to Dr. Dwight and Dr. Miller, and our
                        other Doctors of Divinity for my information and my arguments. I have always
                        had a great regard, sir, for our Doctors of Divinity. I have
                        supposed they must be pious, and learned and truthful men. I thought I could
                           rely upon anything I had learned from a Presbyterian
                           Doctor of Divinity; I therefore took the substance of their
                        arguments, not venturing to employ a single one of my own, and yet for doing
                        this you count me as a simpleton and called me a fool."
                     "Ah, my dear brother Johnson, you must excuse me, I did not at first
                        understand precisely who you were, I begin to see it now. Let me assure you,
                        sir, that I heartily sympathize with you on the loss of so lovely a member
                        as Miss Theodosia, and so influential an Elder as her Uncle Jones. I can
                        easily understand, my dear sir, that you were deeply wounded by that event,
                        and still feel a little sore on the subject ject. But you must not fall out with your
                        friends on that account. We must DO SOMETHING to break
                           the force of the arguments presented by the author in his silly
                        narrative of that transaction. We must either meet those arguments with
                        sober logic, or we must destroy their influence by ridicule. I
                        am sure when you have come to look at the matter calmly, you will not only
                        excuse but even approve what I have said."
                     "What, sir! excuse and approve your calling me a fool, just
                        because I used no better arguments than had been furnished me by our
                           greatest Doctors of Divinity!!"
                     "Ah, my dear brother, I see that you do not yet quite understand me. I mean
                        to say that in order to destroy the influence of that silly narrative, we
                        must either fairly meet and logically confute the facts and arguments by
                        which Miss Theodosia and her Uncle were convinced that we are wrong and the
                        Baptists are right, or else we must turn attention from them by calling the
                        book a 'NOVEL,' and laughing at the arguments as though they were not worth
                        answering. And now let me say to you in confidence, that it was a great deal
                        easier to insinuate that as a 'novel' it must be a work unfit
                        for the pious to read, and to ridicule and laugh at the book, than to
                        disprove its facts or answer its arguments. I
                        trust, therefore, you will not take it too much to heart if you come in for
                        your share of the laugh, since you can't help seeing that if I had allowed
                        your arguments and those of your friend, Professor Jones, to be the best we
                        have, our cause is at once and forever irretrievably ruined; but by adroitly
                        representing these as perfect nonsense and foolishness, I make the
                        impression on the minds of my readers that we have some others of most
                        tremendous power, which could not possibly have failed to convince your
                         opponents if you had only known them and brought them
                        forward."
                     "But, sir," replied Mr. Johnson, "I am sure I brought forward the very best
                        that I could find—I took those of our most eminent Doctors of Divinity,
                        living and dead, the present company only excepted. I would like to know,
                        sir, if any doctor in our church ever stood higher than Timothy Dwight, D.D.
                        and Samuel Miller, D.D., one the President of Yale College, the other an
                        honored professor for many years in our leading Theological Seminary, that
                        at Princeton, New Jersey. I thought, sir, I was safe from the charge of
                        folly when I followed Dwight and Miller, and consequently I took the same
                        ground with these eminent men to show Miss Theodosia that John did not
                        baptize by immersion, but that the Lord Jesus must have been
                           sprinkled on the bank of the river. Just turn to volume
                        four, page 349 of Dwight's Divinity—'It is,' says he,
                           'incredible that the multitudes which John baptized in the
                           wilderness were immersed. It will not be mistrusted that this promiscuous
                           assembly were immersed naked. To have immersed them with their clothes on
                           would have exposed them to certain disease and death.' Now, I did
                        not care to state it just in this way to Miss Theodosia, so I said that they
                        could not have been immersed on account of their great numbers, and for this
                        I had the authority of several Doctors of Divinity. Says Dr. Summers, page
                        82, of his work on Baptism: 'It was not possible for him to baptize
                           the immense multitudes that came to his baptism by immersing
                        them,' and gives as a reason that his ministry lasted only a year or
                        less, and in that time 'he baptized, perhaps, two or three
                        millions.' He thinks as I did, that they must have stood in rows along the
                        bank, while the Baptist sprinkled them either with or without hyssop, he
                        don't know which. So also Doctor Eagleton, of Tennessee, gives the same
                        explanation.
                     
                     "The great Doctor Rice, I know, does not venture to say, like Summers and
                        Dwight, that it was 'impossible' and 'incredible,'
                        but even he in his work on Baptism, page 116, founds an argument on the
                        assumption that 'it was not very probable.' And Dr. Miller,
                        whom some will consider a greater than Rice, expressly says, 'There is
                           no evidence, and I will venture to say, no probability that John ever
                           baptized by immersion.' Then when I wished to prove that the
                           Apostle did not immerse any more than John had done, what
                        better could I do than follow these great Doctors? Dr. Dwight expressly
                        says, volume four, page 349: 'It is impossible that those whom Peter
                           and his companions baptized on the day of Pentecost should have been
                           immersed,' and gives as reasons, first, that they had no suitable
                        clothes; second, there was not time enough, and he plainly intimates that
                        there was not water enough.
                     "So Doctor Summers says it was impossible, because there were no places
                        suitable for immersion, and besides it was impossible for the twelve to
                        baptize such a multitude in the six or eight hours that remained of the day.
                        So also Dr. Rice himself, page 120 of his work on Baptism, makes in
                        substance the very same argument. 'Where,' he exultingly asks, 'did the
                        Apostles find sufficient water for the 
                           immerson
                           immersion
                         of so many?' And again, 'The number—could the twelve Apostles
                        baptize three thousand persons in that day?' And Dr. Miller, whom some will
                        think a greater even than Dr. Rice, declares after dwelling upon these
                        difficulties of the case, 'The man, therefore, who can believe that the
                        three thousand on the day of Pentecost were baptized by immersion, must have
                        great faith and a wonderful facility of '
                           accomodating
                           accommodating
                         his belief to his wishes.'
                     "On these two points, therefore, you see I had the authority of our most
                        learned Doctors, including even Dr. N. L. Rice himself, and yet Dr. Rice
                        calls me a fool because I could not do better than them all."
                     "Oh, no, excuse me, my dear brother Johnson, but these were not the points
                        to which I particularly referred. I grant you had the substance of our
                        arguments on these points, but then that argument of yours based upon
                           with as the signification of the Greek preposition 'en,' you must allow that it was rather simple in
                        you to rest so much upon the phrase 'with water.'"
                     "Not at all, sir, I can admit no such thing. The truth is, sir, this is our
                           great argument to the minds of the unlearned. It has more
                        plausibility in it than any other that I have ever read. And, sir, you must
                        let me tell you that though you may now call it silly and rate me as a fool
                        for using it, I did it on the authority of more than one of our Doctors of
                        Divinity. The Rev. Alexander Newton, D.D., in the 'True Baptist,' makes a
                        long and carefully elaborated argument, based upon this rendering of the
                        word. Dr. Summers, page 100, says expressly that 'with' is the proper
                        meaning of the word 'when found in connection with baptism.' And even the
                        great Dr. Rice himself, in his debate with Campbell, page 191, quoted
                        Bloomfield to show that it was 'with water' and not in water that 'en hudati' should be rendered. How then can Dr.
                        Rice call me a fool for using his own argument, and that of other Doctors
                           almost equal to himself?"
                     "I don't deny that I alluded to it," replied the doctor, "but I know too
                        well its fallacy to risk our cause upon it as you did. But it was not for
                        this so much as for your calling attention to those unguarded admissions of
                        Barnes and Chalmers and McKnight, that I thought, to say the least, you were
                        somewhat indiscreet."
                     "Why, my dear sir, were not these all Presbyterians? Were they not all DOCTORS OF DIVINITY? Could
                        I not venture to direct an inquiring member of the Presbyterian Church to
                        our own Presbyterian Doctors of Divinity for information? I knew those men
                        were counted among the wisest and the best of all our Doctors, I took it for
                        granted that they had studied the subject before they wrote about it; I had,
                        I am sure, no suspicion that they would mislead those who trusted to their
                        teaching."
                     "But when you found which way they were leading your inquirers why did you
                        not contradict and oppose their testimony?"
                     "I did do my best," replied Mr. J., "but the truth is I am not, like you, a
                           Doctor of Divinity, and therefore I could not contradict
                        such men with as good a face as you can. If you had been there
                        you might have said, 'My dear young friends, it is true that these learned
                        men and eminent masters in the Presbyterian Church do teach
                        thus, but they are utterly in error. They have stated what is entirely
                        devoid of truth, you may take my word, but you cannot trust to
                        theirs.' But you, no more than I, could have denied that Dr. Barnes admits
                        baptize in Greek to be the same as tabal in Hebrew, and that he says and
                        proves that it in the Scriptures signifies 'to dip.' You, no
                        more than I, could have denied that Chalmers and McKnight do both
                        unquestionably give immersion as the meaning of the word, and both agree
                        that it was immersion that John and the apostles employed. That
                        is too plain for argument. But then as you are a Doctor of Divinity, as well
                        as they, and have been Moderator of the General Assembly one year, as
                        McKnight was for twenty, you might have ventured to dispute
                        their word—you might have called in question either their
                        learning or their veracity, for if they told what is not true it must have
                        been either from ignorance or falsehood, but it would not have done for a
                        plain and simple pastor tor like myself to put my word against
                        that of any one of these great Doctors, much less against all
                        three. I assure you, sir, that you Doctors of Divinity have a great
                        advantage over us common pastors in such a discussion as that. When that
                        learned Professor of Theology, Moses Stuart, says that all critics and
                        lexicographers of any note are agreed that immersion is the common and
                        primary meaning of the word baptism, and that the first Christians so
                        understood it, you can simply say it is no such
                           thing; but people would expect me to prove it, and that very
                        plainly, too, before they would believe that Stuart lied about it, or that a
                        man of his eminent learning could be mistaken.
                     When the learned MARTIN LUTHER says that 'Baptism is a Greek word and
                        signifies immersion,' and that the etymology of the word seems to demand
                        that the person baptized 'should be wholly immersed and then immediately
                        drawn out of the water,' as he does in his works, vol. 1, p. 336,
                           you could reply, 'Dr. Martin Luther must be 
                           agregiously
                           egregiously
                         mistaken about this, for I, Dr. N. L. Rice, have examined into the
                        matter, and find it is not true.' When that 'godly, learned man, JOHN
                        CALVIN,' in his Institutes, b. iv, s. 15, says that 'The word baptize
                        signifies to immerse, and it is certain that immersion was the practice of
                        the ancient church,' you, as a Doctor of Divinity, can say,
                        'Dr. John Calvin was mistaken—this is not true.' When that very learned and
                        eminent scholar, CASAUBON, says, 'The manner of baptizing was to PLUNGE or
                        DIP them into the water, as even the word BAPTISM plainly enough shows,'
                           you have only to say, 'Casaubon was either very ignorant of
                        the matter, or else he lied, for I, Dr. N. L. Rice, have found it was not
                        so.'
                     When the learned BISHOP BOSSUET declares that 'Baptize signifies to plunge,
                        as is admitted by all the world,' when the famous critic Venema says, 'The
                        word baptizien, to baptize, is no where used in the Scripture for
                        sprinkling,' when the great scholar says in commenting on Matt. 3: 6,
                        'Baptism consists in the immersion of the whole body in water,' you can
                        simply reply, 'I know these learned foreigners say such things, but Dr. N.
                        L. Rice knows better.'
                     "When such a man as DR. GEORGE CAMPBELL, of Scotland, the President of a
                        Presbyterian College, says that 'the word BAPTIZIEN, both in the sacred
                        authors and classical, signifies to DIP, to PLUNGE, to IMMERSE, and was thus
                        rendered by Tertullian, the oldest of the Latin fathers,' that 'it is ALWAYS
                        construed suitably to this meaning,' that 'it is never in any case, sacred
                        or classical, employed in the sense of rain or sprinkle,' you have only to
                        say, that 'Dr. George Campbell differs on these points from Dr. N. L.
                        Rice.'
                     "When a learned professor of Greek, like the well-known Charles Anthon, of
                        Columbia College, the author of some of our most valuable classical school
                        books, expressly asserts, that 'the primary meaning of the word is to DIP or
                        to IMMERSE, and its secondary meanings, if it ever had any, all refer in
                        some way or other to the same leading idea,' that 'sprinkling and pouring
                        are entirely out of the question,' you have only to say 'Mr. Anthon is only
                        a learned professor of languages, and I, a DOCTOR OF DIVINITY,
                        take it upon myself to assure you that he is entirely mistaken. IT IS NOT
                        TRUE, and whether Professor Anthon is ignorant or false the world may
                        judge.'
                     "Now if I, a simple, untitled pastor, should talk so, they would not believe
                        me. I tried it, sir. I asserted roundly, just as Dr. Miller had done. I
                        intended to use his very words, 'Now we contend that this word does not
                        necessarily or even commonly signify to immerse, but also implies to wash,
                        to sprinkle, to pour on water, and to tinge or dye with any liquid, and
                        therefore accords very well with the mode of baptism by sprinkling or
                        affusion.' 'I can assure you,' he says in another place, 'that the word we
                        render baptize does legitimately signify the application of water in any way
                        as well as by immersion.' Now I could make assertions as confidently as even
                        Dr. Rice himself, but I found that I was expected to prove them, and that
                        from the Scriptures, and in such a way that the demonstration should be
                        plain to the common sense of an earnest and shrewd, quick-witted girl. I
                        assure you I had rather have tried to satisfy a dozen Doctors of
                        Divinity."
                     "But why did you not go to the Lexicons, as I did in my Lexington debate?
                        Why did you permit that young lawyer to wrest this weapon out of your hands
                        at the very beginning? Mr. Campbell began to quote the Lexicons on me, but I
                        showed that this was a game at which two could play."
                     "And yet I am sure, sir, Miss Theodosia would have said that you lost the
                        game, however well you played. The truth is, Dr. Albert Barnes, by pointing
                        to the places in the Old Testament, where they could find the
                        meaning of the word as it was used among the Jews, had taken away the
                        necessity for any reference to Lexicons, unless it were to prove that Barnes
                        was a false interpreter, and this I did not like to do. But what could the
                        Lexicons have availed for my purpose even as quoted by yourself? You
                        appealed to eleven of them, and I suppose you gave the most favorable
                        definitions you could extract. Now you will remember that neither Miss
                        Ernest nor Mr. Percy had taken any such ground as Mr. Carson had done, or as
                        Mr. Campbell did in your debate. No one in our company insisted that
                           immerse was the only and necessary
                        meaning of the word, but only that it was the common and
                           most frequent meaning, in connection with which it was most
                           likely to be employed, and which it must therefore
                        (according to the ordinary rules of interpretation) be understood,
                           unless the context required some other. Now you know as well as I, that the rule of
                        the Lexicons is to give the common, every-day meaning, as the
                        primary or first definition. And yet when you attempted to
                        ascertain the meaning of the word baptizo by the Lexicons, what did they
                        testify?
                     "Scapula, according to your own rendering, gives baptizo to dip
                        or immerse, also to dye, as we immerse things for the purpose of coloring or
                        washing them, also to plunge, submerge to cover with water, &c.
                     "Hedericus gives to dip, immerse, to cover with water.
                     "Stephanus—To dip, to immerse, as we immerse things for the
                        purpose of coloring or washing, to merge, submerge, to cover with water.
                     "Schleusner—To plunge, to immerse.
                     "Parkhurst—To immerse in, or wash with water.
                     "Robinson—To immerse, to sink.
                     "Schrivellius—To baptize, to immerse.
                     "Groves—To dip, immerse, immerge, plunge.
                     "Bretschneider—Properly often to dip.
                     "Suidas—To sink, to plunge, to immerse.
                     "Ware—To wash, perform ablution, cleanse; secondly, to
                        immerse.
                     "Greenfield—To immerse, immerge, submerge, sink.
                     "Now, out of all the eleven, you could find but one, and that
                        unknown to fame, which does not give dip or its equivalent as
                        its first and common meaning. Miss Ernest would have said the testimony is
                        ten to one against you. If you had come into court with ten witnesses
                        against you and only one for you, Mr. Percy, as a lawyer, would
                        have declared your case utterly hopeless.
                     "But Mr. Campbell, at that time, gave you several other Lexicons, among
                        which was,
                     "Robertson's Thesaurus, which defines it to immerse, to
                        wash
                     "Pason—To dip, to immerse, to dye, because it is done by
                        immersing.
                     "Donegan—To immerse repeatedly into a liquid, to submerge, to
                        sink.
                     "Jones—Plunge, dip, baptize, bury, overwhelm.
                     "Bass—To dip, immerse, plunge in water. Baptisma, immersion,
                        dipping.
                     "Stokius—To dip, to immerse in water.
                     "So we have in all sixteen witnesses, who depose that this is its primary
                        and common meaning. Sixteen who testify that it must thus be understood when
                        nothing in the context requires another sense. And only one who gives to
                           wash as its primary meaning. Mr. Campbell also mentioned
                        several others, whom he said gave it the same sense, and you did not dispute
                        his word."
                     "But what of all that?" replied the Rev. Dr. Rice. "I would have set aside
                        all that array of dictionaries by quoting just one sentence from the great
                        Baptist, Dr. Carson, who ought surely to understand what he says, and who
                        was no friend to sprinkling; and yet he expressly says, 'THAT ALL THE
                        LEXICONS ARE AGAINST HIM.' This is testimony enough for me."
                     "But it would not have been for Miss Theodosia or Mr. Percy. They would have
                        asked to see the BOOK and the place, and would have read it for themselves,
                        and doing so would have been sure to discover what you must have known
                        before you quoted it, that he does NOT say that all the Lexicons are against
                        the Baptists—he does NOT say that all or any of the Lexicons gives
                        sprinkling or pouring as a meaning of the word—he does NOT say that they do
                        not all agree in giving dip or its equivalent as the primary and common
                        meaning. 'On this point,' he says, 'I have no quarrel with the Lexicons.
                        There is the most complete harmony among them in representing dip as the primary
                        meaning of bapto and baptizo.' But Mr. Carson denies that it has any
                        secondary meaning at all, or that it ever means anything else but dip or
                        immerse. And it is on this point that he says, page 55, 'He has all the
                        Lexicographers and Commentators against him.' I could not have satisfied my
                        inquirers with such a misrepresentation, even though my conscience could
                        have permitted me to use it. We all know that the Lexicons give secondary
                        meanings to these words, and in our company there was no disposition to
                        question the propriety of their doing so. But, sir, it has struck me with
                        surprise, since my attention has been turned to the subject, that not a
                        single one of all the seventeen Lexicons referred to and quoted by you and
                        Mr. Campbell, give sprinkle or pour as even a
                        secondary meaning. They give wash and cleanse, but
                        several of them are careful to explain that it is because things may be
                        washed and cleansed by dipping them in water. And I have been
                        thinking, especially since I read your piece, that what we are
                        accustomed to call baptism is not even a
                        washing—for if the Doctor should tell me to wash one of
                        my children who was sick, with warm water, I am sure I should not feel that
                        I had carried out the proscription by dipping the tip of my fingers in the
                        water and touching them to his forehead. And the truth is, sir, I suppose I
                        may just as well tell it, that since you have made so light of all the
                        arguments which I advanced in our discussion, and yet have given me no
                        better, nor told me to which of all our doctors I can go to find any more
                        forcible or convincing, I begin to doubt whether we are not both mistaken,
                        and that Miss Ernest and her friends had better reasons for leaving us than
                        I can ever find for remaining where I am."
                     "Yes," exclaimed Professor Jones, (who suddenly made his appearance,
                        unaccountably, as people often do in dreams.) "I have often thought how
                        angry we should be if those who owe obedience to us should render it as some
                        of us render obedience to God. Dr. Rice, for example, says to a little
                        servant boy on Saturday night, go wash yourself, or go
                           bathe yourself and put on clean clothing for the Sabbath.
                        The servant, instead of bathing his whole body, takes a few drops of water
                        in the palm of his hand and pours it on the top of his head. 'You little
                        rascal,' Dr. Rice would say, 'why did you not wash yourself as I directed
                        you?'
                     "'I did wash myself, sir.'
                     "'You did! Do you call that washing yourself? Why,
                        you did not even wet your scalp. Come here, sir, I'll teach you how to
                        trifle with my commandments.'
                     "'Please, sir!' 
                           exclaimes
                           exclaimed
                         the lad. 'Please, sir, don't punish me; I am sure, sir, I did wash
                        myself, I can prove it to you, sir.'
                     'Why, you little impertinent. You just now confessed that you only put a few
                        drops of water on the top of your head.'
                     "'I know it, sir, but that was washing myself, sir, I can prove
                        it by the united testimony of all your DOCTORS OF DIVINITY, including the
                        Rev. Dr. N. L. Rice. You may be so angry, sir, just now, that you don't
                        remember it, but in your Lexington debate you said again and again that
                        baptize means to wash, and of course wash means to
                           baptize, and when you and our other DOCTORS OF
                        DIVINITY baptize, you only put a few drops of water on the
                        person's head. Besides, you said again and again, that wash was a
                           'generic' word (I believe that was it, sir,) and might be
                        performed in any way, and as this is the way which all the
                        great DOCTORS OF DIVINITY use when GOD tells them 'to
                           wash' people, I am sure, sir, you could not expect me
                        to do more in obedience to your command than you
                        do in obedience to HIS.'
                     
                     "But let it pass; I have just called in, Doctor, to thank you for dealing so
                        kindly with me in your article on Theodosia. It is customary when one has
                        been driven by his convictions of duty to leave some denominations for
                        others, for those he leaves to seek by defamation to destroy his peace and
                        injure his usefulness. It is customary to attack his character and impugn
                        his motives. And the same course has sometimes been adopted to counteract
                        the influence of a controversial BOOK. When its arguments could
                        not be met and refuted, the moral or Christian character of the author has
                        been assailed, with a malignity which argues very little for the piety of
                        the assailants, and of itself affords prima facie evidence that there is
                        something rotten in the system which requires such foul means to sustain it,
                        and breeds such rancorous spirits to contend for it. But it has gratified me
                        much to see that you speak of me in 'sorrow more than anger,' that you are
                        more inclined to pity than abuse. You think me weak and foolish, and that is
                        the worst of it. I could expect no less than that, for we all are apt to
                        think disparagingly of the intellect which cannot see what
                        seems to ours as clear as light. You thought that my friend, Mr. Johnson,
                        was simple, because he failed to convince my niece and myself; and I might
                        have expected that you would think still worse of me, because I could not be
                        convinced. If Mr. Johnson had used all the arguments which he
                        could have found in the works of Presbyterian Doctors of Divinity, you might
                        with good reason have thought him a simpleton indeed.
                     "He contended with Dr. Miller and other doctors, that the word baptize means
                        to sprinkle or to pour, as truly as to immerse.
                     "Like several others, and yourself among them, he denied that John's baptism
                        was Christian baptism.
                     "Like you and all the rest he denied that Jesus went into the water, or that
                        John baptized in Jordan, but asserted that he sprinkled the people standing
                        in rows on the bank.
                     "Like you and the other doctors, he denied that there was water enough to be
                        had in Jerusalem to immerse three thousand, or time enough to do it.
                     "Like you and the other doctors, he made an argument upon the
                           design of baptism, as being better symbolized by sprinkling
                        than immersion.
                     "Like you and the other doctors, he made a very plausible argument upon the
                        Pentecostic outpouring of the Holy Ghost as baptism.
                     "Like you and some of the other doctors, he made the strongest argument that
                        it is possible to make upon 'with water' as the translation of
                        'en udati.' And he gave to each and every one of these arguments
                           all the force to which it was logically entitled, and if
                        they could not stand before the simple, common sense of a strong-minded,
                        earnest-hearted girl, it was not his fault, but the fault of the arguments.
                        If he had presented all the arguments which he could have found
                        gravely set forth by Doctors of Divinity, little Edwin himself would have
                        laughed him out of countenance. What if, like Dr. Dwight, he had declared
                        that 'Christ himself has expressly taught us that immersion is
                           unessential to the administration of this ordinance.'
                     "When he said to Peter, John 13th, 'He that is washed needeth not care to
                        wash his feet, but is clean every whit,' from which the learned doctor
                        concludes that 'a symbolical washing is perfect although applied only to the
                        feet, as perfect as if it were applied also to the hands and the head, and
                        if this construction be admitted, it must also be admitted that the
                        declaration is general and extends to every other symbolical washing, and therefore to baptism,
                        unless excluded by some plain exception.' See Dwight's Divinity, vol. 4, pp.
                        150, 157.
                     "So also another Doctor of Divinity declares, that 'Christ discountenanced
                        the practice of immersion in religious purifications. He that is washed,
                        said he to Peter, needeth not care to wash his feet, but is clean every
                        whit, John 13: 9, 10. By reading this text in its connection, we will
                        perceive that so far from introducing the practice of washing the body all
                        over as a religious rite, he discouraged it, by declaring it unnecessary,
                        and by refusing to gratify Peter, who wished to have the water applied to
                        him in a more profuse manner than the Saviour was using it.' See James Wood,
                        D.D., on Christian Baptism, page 35. If Dr. Wood is consistent with himself,
                        he applies the water to the baby's dear little foot, for it was
                        the application of water to the 'hands' or the
                           'head' that Jesus 'discountenanced' and
                           'discouraged.' I presume, therefore, that Dr. Wood is not
                        only a Pedobaptist but a pedalbaptist, a foot-baptiser.
                     "What if Mr. Johnson had said, as more than one of the DOCTORS OF DIVINITY
                        has done, that there is the same proof that the Eunuch immersed Philip that
                        there is that Philip immersed the Eunuch? Yet the great Dr. Miller says,
                        'There is the same evidence that Philip was plunged as that the Eunuch was.'
                        And Dr. Dwight argues that if 'eis' means
                        into, and 'ek means out of, in the
                        narrative of this transaction, they were both plunged
                           twice and the Eunuch three times. Here are his
                        words: 'The declarations here made, are made concerning Eunuch and Philip,
                        alike of both it is said that they went down into the water, if
                        we render eis into; of both also it is
                        said that when they came up out of the water, if we render the
                        word ek out of. Now let us see what will
                        be the true import of the passage according to this method of construing the
                        words in question, and they went down both into the water, both Philip
                           and the Eunuch. That is, they were both plunged. And he
                           baptized him, that is, Philip plunged the Eunuch. And when they
                        were come up out of the water; that is, when they had both been plunged a
                        second time and risen up from their immersion, the Spirit of the Lord
                           caught away Philip. In other words they were both plunged twice
                        and the Eunuch three times.' See Dwight's Divinity, vol. 4, p. 350, Sermon
                        on Baptism.
                     "Suppose that Mr. Johnson, like Dr. Wood, had gravely argued that the Eunuch
                        must have been baptized by sprinkling, because he had been reading in
                        Isaiah, and Isaiah somewhere, though not in the passage quoted as that which
                        he was reading, says that Messias shall sprinkle many nations,
                        while every scholar knows that in the Septuagint, which it is most likely he
                        was reading, the word sprinkle does not occur, but 'thaumasontai' astonish, 'so shall he astonish
                        many nations.' And Dr. Adam Clarke says it is the best rendering of the
                        Hebrew. That the Jews so understood the Hebrew is evident from
                        their so translating it; and therefore, whether the Eunuch read Hebrew or
                        Greek, he could have found no such word as sprinkle.
                     "But though your Doctors of Divinity had talked volumes of such
                        nonsense, my friend, Mr. Johnson, had sense enough to see that arguments
                        like these could not be expected to stand the scrutiny of earnest, enquiring
                           common sense, even in a simple girl, and therefore would not
                        offer them. He used the best you have, and did the best he could with them.
                        I grant that both he and I used some very simple arguments,
                        nay, that all our arguments were silly as long as we argued
                        against the truth, for every false argument must be
                           foolish, but neither of us was as silly as some of you DOCTORS TORS OF DIVINITY, and since you have
                        yourself condemned and ridiculed the very arguments by which
                        not only he but thousands of your people are deluded and prevented from
                        yielding obedience to Christ, I trust both he and they will see their folly,
                        abandon their errors, obey their Lord, and like my niece and myself, unite
                        with His visible church.'
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAPTER II.
                     THEN I saw in my dream that Pastor Johnson sat with his good old wife, in
                        their own quiet room, but his countenance was sad, and she saw that his
                        heart was troubled, and knew that something had gone amiss with him during
                        his absence. With true womanly tact she sought to find out what it had been
                        without seeming to ask.
                     "I hope, my dear, you had a pleasant journey, and met with no disagreeable
                        accidents by the way."
                     "It was as pleasant as I had expected."
                     "You saw Dr. Rice, of course. I have been told since you started that he is
                        a perfect model of a Christian gentleman, and would certainly explain every
                        thing to your satisfaction. Did you not find it so?"
                     "Gentleman! Why, yes; I suppose he is what people call a gentleman—a
                        polished, pleasant gentleman, and he made, probably, what he thinks, the
                        best apology that the case admits of."
                     "But you were not quite satisfied with it? Well, I don't wonder. It
                           was too bad to call you a greater simpleton than could be
                        found in all the Presbyterian Church. But what explanation did he make?"
                     "My dear wife," said the Pastor, suddenly raising his eyes, and looking
                        earnestly into her face, "I begin to think that our Doctors of
                           Divinity are no more to be confided in than other people, and that
                        Miss Ernest, and Esquire Percy, and Professor Jones were right in just
                        casting all their assertions
                        aside, and going to the sacred Word and hunting out its teachings for
                        themselves."
                     "Why, Mr. Johnson?"
                     "Yes, my dear; I never mean to trust the bare assertion of any Doctor
                           of Divinity again as long as I live. Just think of it now—Dr. Rice
                           laughs at my arguments in favor of sprinkling, and at Mr.
                        Percy's, and at those of Professor Jones. He holds them up to the scorn of
                        the world. He speaks of them as though they were almost beneath contempt;
                        and yet you and I know very well that they are arguments which I
                           borrowed EVERY ONE OF THEM from a Doctor of
                           Divinity. They are the very same arguments which have
                        been employed by Dr. Eagleton, by Dr. Newton, by Dr. Wood, by Dr. Summers,
                        by Dr. Miller, by Dr. Dwight, and even by Dr. Rice himself. But to make the
                        world believe that we have some stronger and better arguments he laughs at
                        these, as though they were the mere twaddle of the veriest ignoramus in all
                        Christendom. But does he bring forward any stronger or any
                        better ones? Does he point to the chapter and the page in the works of our
                        Doctors of Divinity, where they presented anything more
                        convincing? So far from it, he was obliged to own to Professor Jones, whom I
                        met at his house, that he had himself employed these very arguments in his
                        debate with Campbell; and the Professor also pointed out to him the volumes
                        and the pages in the works of our greatest doctors, where they
                        had employed arguments so much sillier than mine, that I would
                        have been ashamed to mention them to a shrewd, sensible girl, like
                        Theodosia. Now, what am I as a Christian man and a Christian minister to do?
                        I have all the time believed that we were right, and, therefore, I so
                        preached and practiced. But you know I would sooner cut off this right hand
                        than use it to sprinkle another babe if Christ does not require
                           it. It was because I trusted to the teachings of our doctors
                        that I thought he must be right, but when these doctors hold up these very
                        arguments by which I was convinced, to the scorn of the religious world, and
                        yet give me no better in the place of them, I can't help thinking there is
                        something rotten in the system somewhere.
                     "I intend, God helping me, to search into the
                           Scripture teachings for myself. I remember that
                        we could not find a single command to baptize infants, nor a single example
                        of one baptized. I remember that our own best commentators, such as Barnes
                        in this country, and Olshausen in Europe, say there is nothing about it in
                        the text I most relied upon, 'Suffer the little children to come unto me.' I
                        remember that we could not find one single text, which even our
                        own Doctors of Divinity all agree upon as requiring or justifying the
                        practice,—that even concerning the covenant of circumcision, which Dr.
                        McNought thinks is our strongest fortress. Professor Stuart expressly
                        declares in his commentary on Genesis 17th and Galatians, that they can
                        afford it no countenance whatever; and as to sprinkling, even
                        Dr. Rice himself did not, and dare not say that the Greek word baptize in
                        the Scriptures has ever been truly rendered sprinkle by any
                        reliable Lexicon or eminent critic. He only contends that it may be rendered
                        to wash, and then says that washing may be done by sprinkling a
                        dozen drops or less of water on the person's head. But can it
                        be thus done? If you or I should tell one of the children to wash, not his
                           face, but to wash himself, would
                           he consider it a full and complete obedience if he should
                        only dip the tip of his fingers in water, and touch them on his head, or
                        face, or feet, or hands; for I don't see as there is any more propriety in
                        touching one part than another."
                     "I don't think we would, my dear," replied the good woman. "And if this be
                        so, I am sure it must be wickedMOCKERY ERY to do that in obedience to
                           God's commands, which we would consider as the veriest
                        trifling if it were done in the place of actual obedience to a similar
                        command by us."
                     "I am afraid, my dear," resumed the pastor, "I am awfully afraid we have
                        been wrong. God knows I meant to do right—God knows I verily
                        believed that I was right; but this communication of Dr. Rice has made the
                        case look fearfully dark to me.
                     "I have thought and prayed, and thought again, until my brain is dizzy. I
                        can't help seeing Jesus baptized, as Mark says, 'Eis,' not merely in, but into the river of
                        Jordan. I can't help seeing the Eunuch and Philip going down into the water,
                        then the baptism, then the coming up out of the water. I fear our doctors
                           twist and pervert the words in trying to make them mean
                        anything less. I fear some of them almost prevaricate to hide
                        the simple and natural meaning of the language. But oh, it is a dreadful
                        thought that we have all the time been wrong; that I, a minister of Christ
                        have all my life been the advocate of error, and have been
                        doing in his name that which he never commanded, and having constantly
                        undone that which he actually did commission all his ministers to do. I must
                        study more about it. I must pray more over it. But if I find it so—much as I
                        love my people, much as I love my church, much as I love my brethren in the
                        ministry, much as I love the doctrines and the ordinances which I have so
                        long taught and administered, I trust I love the truth and love my Saviour
                        better than them all, and I will go down into the water as the Eunuch did,
                        and Mr. Percy shall himself baptize me, as Philip did the Eunuch, and when
                        we come up out of the water I trust to meet the Spirit of the Lord ready to
                        find a place for me to labor, and to bless my work."
                     
                     
                     
                        
                     
                     Then I saw in my dream, some few weeks after this, that Mr. Percy had
                        returned from his visit to Nashville and the hill country of Tennessee, (an
                        account of which is given in the second volume of Theodosia Ernest), and he
                        was standing in the same place where Theodosia had gone down into the water.
                        The company that stood upon the bank consisted of a great multitude. Many of
                        them had walked in a procession from the beautiful new Baptist
                        meeting-house, which stood near the old school-house, where Theodosia had
                        been admitted to the visible company of Christ's people. Many others had
                        come from the magnificent old building in which, until recently, Pastor
                        Johnson had been accustomed to minister for many years. Many had come from
                        other places of worship, and not a few were there who seldom witnessed any
                        act of religion, but one like this, which called them out merely to gratify
                        their curiosity. But vast and various as was the crowd, they were silent,
                        and solemn, and tearful, when the old man stopped at the verge of the
                        water—turned to their expectant gaze, and briefly gave the reasons why,
                        following his Saviour's example, and in obedience to his positive command
                        which he could no longer misunderstand, he was about to "be
                           buried with Christ by baptism."
                     Those reasons we have not space to tell as he told them that day. It is
                        enough for us merely to state that after earnest prayer for guidance from
                        above, he had resolved to "search the Scriptures" and discard
                        the doctors. That he had been unable to find any sprinkling commanded or
                        practiced, as baptism. Nor could he find a single text which either commands
                        or justifies the baptism of babes, Presbyterian Doctors of Divinity
                        themselves being judges, since each text that one may claim as teaching it,
                        a half a dozen others will declare has no relation to the case.
                     There are, said he, in conclusion, many of my own former people here. I see their once familiar faces.
                        Some look on me with pity; and could I have continued to practice in my
                        Master's name, what he has no where commanded, I should need their pity.
                     Some look on me with heartfelt sorrow; and I see even now the traces which
                        their tears have marked upon their loving faces. My friends, I am happier
                        now than I have been for many months. Doubt has now given way to certainty,
                        hesitation to decision—the struggle, the long, agonizing, heart-rending
                        struggle between old attachments and personal inclination on the one hand,
                        and duty to my Lord and Master on the other has ceased at length, and I have
                           peace with God and peace with my own
                        conscience.
                     It may be there are some who look on me with anger; some who
                        will follow me with bitter words; some who may malign my motives and seek to
                        destroy my character; some who may send out rumors that their old Pastor was
                           deranged, or something worse, and that the people whom he
                        served so long were glad to be so easily rid of him. Such things have been
                        said of others, and, doubtless, will be said of me. But though you may
                        revile me I will love you still. Though you may persecute me I will still
                        pray for you, and long and strive to bring you to a knowledge of the whole
                        truth of the glorious gospel of my blessed God. And since you cannot make me
                        hate you, you cannot harm me by your hatred. I part with you all in the love
                        of the Gospel, and pray for all that God will help you see as I have seen
                        the sin and danger of setting aside the ordinance of Christ, and teaching
                        for doctrines the traditions and commandments of men.
                     Then they went down into the water, both Mr. Percy and the former Pastor,
                        and he baptized him; and they came up out of the water, and I awoke, and,
                        behold it was a dream; and yet kind reader, was it ALL a
                           dream?
