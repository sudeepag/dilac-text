            TO MY DEAREST FRIEND, JESSIE,
            DISTINGUISHED FOR THE RICHNESS OF HER SOUL AND THE SUNSHINE OF A NOBLE HEART,
            THIS WORK IS DEDICATED.
            THE munificence of her princely fortune has reared this South-born volume to the appellation of its inspiring position; and under her mantle of kindness folds to her sheltering bosom the heart that trusts its guiding power. A venerable, deep remembrance electrifies the idea of her superiority, and consecrated reflections look forth upon years richly embossed with the character of her influence.
            She sustained the courage and hope of the enthusiastic spirit of the author; and over the pride of her imperishable comfort, emotions are harmonized by the bond of double association with her distinguished husband, dear as a brother, whose royal nature heightens the connection, as by permission dedicated to them. The fostering care of this Northern light sheds its dazzling beauties over a heart grateful with affection, and in this tribute of honour fondly cherishes the remembrance of Jessie's smiling feeling, which cheered on a struggling soul, and gave from the Lord "beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness."
            
               THE AUTHOR.
               March 9th, 1865.
            
         
         
            THE AUTHOR'S SIGNIFICANCE.
            AS a preface appears to relate significantly to the characteristics of the work presented, I will not detain the reader by prefatory observations further than necessary.
            First, it relates to a singular part—a poetic line connected with our heroine—as authors must feel the binding of relationship.
            A remarkable vein and connection is in the power of a name. A finished grace to this composition is selected by the writer as nom de plume; and asserts from the words of Scripture a significance which sustains, too, an analogy to the heroine's life, and portrays its earliest nature, like the life-blood of her heart. It is an heirloom—the classic fragment of times that have been, sparkling with the antiquity of the forefather's lustre; in itself a crest taken from the coat-of-arms of the Duke of Marlborough; and traces its diction to the heroine with her distinction of three names, which illustrate three currents by nature coursing through her veins.
            First, her family surname, which is the English type. "Grita," the glowing luxury of the Indian, as physicians allow that traits predominate with often stronger authenticity, as the antecedent of blood or origin is distanced. The proof we will find here, is fact, and the charm of correctness is as the Mandans.
            The admired pleasure of native sentiment contributed to represent her as Grita only to the hero, Granville. The touching faculty of her address as "Ymataca" is handed from the liquid eloquence of the Spanish vein of pedigree.
            Such my reflections on derivable grounds, and the phrase of Scripture is worthy of regard. Whether it is an old, faded garment, or trifle of art, it is a title, or estate, of private significance—of public worth. Convinced I am that God desired His creatures, imaged as they were, to rise in the scale by aspiring. These are degrees of being. We take up the refined and treasured association of the past, of things that were possessed individually and nationally. A distinctive appellation is most necessary to especial respect. To elevate is to rise; to rise, to ascend. If American, I own the crest from Blenheim arms, and insert the Marlborough tie of relationship to my heroine with rightful propriety; for many are the deeds and valour of the New World, which may yet live to future times, and find the antiquity of its great people as great as those who were. Time alone is ruler of earth; and his sovereign, God. Not meaning an unenlightened presumption at heraldry, nor intending to herald my fame, but having acquired a distinctive appellative, I symbolize by the respective one, Descended. "In all ages, we believe that distinctions of rank have been recognized, and this seems to have Divine sanction, as is shown in the parable of the marriage of the king's son" (the words of my critic).
            In our Republican Court of the nineteenth century we find that position has been here received from things that descended, and the significance is as the Pitts, the Napoleons, the Cromwells, the Shakspeares—no throne, nor sceptre, only aristocracy—stateliness of ceremonial productive of degrees. God save my country from Puritanism and Romanism! The Republican Court—may it ever be refined by aristocratic principles. It is a distinction due the work presented to my country's friends, that the higher finish of my human features is heralded. The association is a coronet-gem, adorned with stars, typical of claim to position. This gradual development of past into future has a classification certainly not low.
            
            Before explaining my use of titles, such as "Lady" and "Madame," I will say the sequel and its double sequel will make worthy the superiority of idioms, and be found to correspond with age-toned convictions, which are to give peculiar stress to women of years, of special merit to position, and expressive of solemn influence, charged accountable. I have so titled the term advanced above ordinary Mrs., which might be either lady or menial, taking for social affectionateness the familiar attraction of Christian names; and Mr. might have been Sir applied, &c. Such my novel case of Literature.
            In the beginning, this volume was created by prophecy, from one memory, one moment. Its serial and double serial will relight this Truth and Justice into its Nation's Prophecy, which regards the heroine as personating 
                  THE GODDESS OF INDEPENDENCE.
               
               Stars in the ascendant, closing her eras into its sequel of 1860, and the five in its termination 1865. Such it seems proper to announce.
            Hence comes the nom de plume, which claims the fancy to sustain the heroine's testimony as clear and right, by the ancestral and illustrious name, from generation to generation, from father to son; and typed in her twofold title, which bears out against multitudes of reproach, that Truth and Justice was all her care, and to stand approved in the sight of God, fixed as the stars of her triangle. 
                  
                     "Clear-eyed Astrea
                     Comes with her balance and her sword, to show
                     That first her judgment weighs before it strikes."
                  
               
            
            This crest was all the gift of family bestowals. The old heirloom was marked with arms, upon family possessions; but struck off from the rest, in ink and on paper, it was in cubical form presented to the writer—unknown as such. But the author solved its meaning into possessive right, and the signature balanced by a life, to rise by weights scaled in Justice and Truth—by measure from the deep profound—by power that was given by prophecy. Though crushed to earth, it rises from ashes—Immortalitas—pluming its winged crest into flights triumphant. The gryphon head, cooped between two wings, is indeed a model beauty, with its droplinks of a life which was suspended; but, like its device, the author and heroine lift up themselves to do, and under the sagacious mounting of the eras go on to solve the enigma by another work. Plurimum posse—as the hooked beak represents strength and bears its plummet pendant—Fiel.
            The eye, soaring to the rising beyond, lifts up the glorious cause of liberty. 
                  
                     "Beneath the open sky, abroad,
                     Among the plants and breathing things,"
                  
                is transcribed the writer's significance in dual mottoes, her own 
                  DEO-DATA.

                        Tempest.
                     
                  
                  IT was a lovely evening in the spring-time of 1840. Mild and serene, the twilight had given a sweetness, and softly had the day faded. Beneath a vine-arbour a group of ladies merrily chatted. The little fountain played in the centre of a circular basin, its shower-spray sparkling in the glare of the houselights. Our party soon retired from so airy a retreat to the cottage. Crinkle-Crag windows were closed just then, as the spirit of mystic night spread her veil. Ten thousand brilliants orbed the firmament. It was early in the evening when "they met." Far away in the dim past I recall that meeting.
                  The social family, grouped with guests, had passed away hours in pleasant talk. As the bell rung out from amid the ivy that clung around Crinkle-Crag porch, the heavy door swung back. A gentleman and lady entered the triangular hall, that conducted to a suite of three rooms, which were fitted up with taste. That memorable evening, as certain cousins entered that drawing-room, Mr. Marlborough rose with his usual urbanity and welcomed their arrival. At this instant a tall, aristocratic-looking person advanced to Madame Marlborough, paying his respects, and acknowledged, after shaking hands, the pleasure of the introduction, presented as he was by his cousin, the famed and accomplished Miss Lyttleton. A few moments after, a general delight gladly and affectionately confirmed the welcome of the young officer, fresh from his first laurels. Miss Lyttleton dropped into her accustomed seat by a fireless hearth, as she smiled on the cousin-officer. The earnestness of her look revealed the delicate attraction which brought Granville Rutland to the place. There was a home-loving tie between Lady Rutland, his mother, and his cousin, Madame Marlborough. Lieut. Rutland, heir of Arthur Seat, tenderly regarded Minho's pretty children, who were under the especial guidance of cousin Adelaide Lyttleton. On this occasion the children were clustered in the parlour, mingling their merry voices in the conversation. Attentively was our hero observed: an early wreath crowned his first achievement in the Florida wars; and but a few years had gone by since he began his military renown under the drill of the West Point Academy. He was in the fresh bloom of manhood, and every feature spoke of truth, of pride, of power. He was, moreover, an admirable scholar, naturally gifted and singularly premature— 
                        "A poet of action, and woman his muse."
                     
                  
                  Around him gathered the newly-found relations, eagerly listening to the accounts of his life with the red man.
                  While this interesting narration was going on, Miss Grita was standing alone near the nursery; but she soon tripped lightly down stairs and stepped into the entrance-hall leading to the drawing-room. She approached gently. This fair-faced child, in her ninth year, stood in speechless surprise to see the new cousin. There, under the archway, she paused again, listening to the buzz of conversation. The girl did not appear to feel abashed as she met his gaze, or at his admiration as he rose from his seat to receive her. Rutland took her little hand. As she glanced up at his admiring gaze, though timid and sensitive, little Grita, much pleased, stole away when he asked her to kiss him. She indignantly refused such a liberty. I see her now, as she looked at me then, in haughty silence, and left him perched on the antique piano-stool. The piano was a relic of the mother's in her early reign, on which first she, and now the daughters, played. Grita seated herself by a table in a large, low, scarlet damask chair, her heart beating with excitement. Granville was amazed as he contemplated her. With his arms folded across his breast, he leaned carelessly against the open instrument, and watched every moment to see the graceful figure shrinking behind the flowing curtains. He soon observed her head bent, as if in thought. The presence of this tropic-eyed cousin was tinging his day-dreams with a soft, tender light.
                  Minho seated herself at the piano, and began the father's favourite ballad with much feeling. Her voice sang sweetly, "When stars are in the quiet sky." Lieut. Rutland was a fine judge of music, and stood in delighted surprise. Music and poetry awakened his most tender emotions.
                  It was a happy evening. Hours passed on. Few of the company remained. The rosy-cheeked, dark-eyed, laughing girl was a picture never to be forgotten. Granville again contemplated her nonchalance, and it amused the soldier, as her look and tone sent a dart of sunshine through his heart. The innumerable charms of her extreme youth formed the treasure he sought.
                  In his twenty-third year, he had marked that sweet child for his future destiny. Her sparkling eyes were cast in admiration on his manly features, so boldly defined, and his clear blue eyes and fair complexion, with a profusion of sun-hued hair thrown in careless toss upon his temples. The graceful form of her cousin assumed an air of importance in her mind. His very voice was significant, as if armed with a seeming authority none dared to dispute. Catching her eye, Granville beckoned to the child to come to his side. With shyness she ventured, but soon turned away her head; with a slight scrutiny turned again, and then slowly walked from his embrace.
                  Hours wore away too fast, and soon left our cousins in social privacy. Cousin Adelaide proudly valued her favourite, and rejoiced at the conquest; for none knew more intimately, or loved more affectionately, the high stamp of Granville's nature than she. A close and devoted relationship bound his mother to her, and Granville was Miss Lyttleton's protégé. She was ever a welcome visitor, and leader of all that was good and conducive to happiness. On this fair encounter of two most rare affections she bestowed all her interest. Our hero was placed by station and fortune in the first rank. He possessed kindness and talents. Young and handsome, his blue eyes were expressive of earnestness and deep thought, not unfrequently verging on severity. His nose, inclining to aquiline, suited well his firmly-closing, well-formed mouth. His manners were decided, almost haughty.
                  Often and often did he glance at the child, who stood alone where the curtains would half envelope her petite figure, her eyes fixed upon the officer. Starting up, Lieut. Rutland exclaimed, "Cousin Adelaide, we must go!" but he still lingered. Conversation soon ceased. The silence was broken at last by the approaching step of the officer toward Grita, saying, as he seated himself beside the motionless creature, "We can be more than cousins—can we not? You have charmed me, Grita, A conquest fairly. I have surrendered, little cousin!" A kind of consciousness told her at once it was the voice of him she loved. After a few minutes' revery, Grita raised her eyes, her lip smiled again archly; her brilliant eyes, her flushed cheeks, all told of an impression both would carry to their graves—one which would involve the lives of many. Her reply was scarcely audible as she listened to his rich, clear voice. Soon was the veil uplifted by the soft hand of love. Such an avowal soon attracted comment, for his relatives regarded it with astonishment mingled with incredulity. Further conversation was broken off.
                  Then Granville made his way without hesitation to Madame Marlborough. She rose from her chair as the officer advanced into the centre of the room; there was grace in the apology as he observed, slightly colouring, "I shall request a favour, Cousin Minho. You will not refuse your consent?"
                  Our hero colored deeply as he confessed the strange interest her child had planted in his breast. A light passed over his features as he expressed his warm admiration for Grita,—a feeling inspired never to be effaced.
                  "Before I go to join my regiment, will you sanction a promise? for I shall wait for this little wild-flower." The mother answered, smiling, "Granville, I might venture my approval, if possible for one of such extreme youth, to promote your future happiness. Grita is a wild-flower, indeed."
                  There stood Madame Marlborough reflecting. Rather delicate in stature, very upright and haughty, she wore, as usual, a rich robe of heavy satin, her favourite shade of blue. The accustomed style of half-square of India muslin lay folded across her breast. Woman's highest ornament, braided in heavy folds, still brown and luxuriant, turbaned her head. Her complexion, waxen in texture even at her age, was a remarkable feature. After she had recovered composure, she added, "I don't know." Then Granville solemnly repeated, "She is mine—mine!" Doubts and fears seemed to fill the mother's mind. "Well, cousin," she said at length, and in a soothing tone, "I have long admired and loved you for your mother's sake." "There is hope," he ejaculated, "that you will know and love me for Grita's sake."
                  The young officer smiled, thanked her for her approval, and continued, "Of course, she is not capable of comprehending love. But, I beg you not to destroy my ideal of all that is beautiful. This morning-star is my first lesson in celestial things. Her existence will move along the firmament of my memory. And thus I plight my troth." 
                        
                           "A beautiful simplicity
                           That nestled like a dove,
                           Lay in her bosom, which no eye
                           Could look on and not love;
                           A silent music felt, not heard;
                           A voice that warbled like a bird!"
                        
                     
                  
                  The young officer bowed without uttering another word, and with unaffected ease led forward Madame Marlborough, who sank upon a downy chair, that invited indulgence of her southern languor.
                  The lieutenant felt it was time to renew general conversation, as soon they must leave. By some well-timed remark he gained opportunity to recover himself, so effectually was the first lesson learned. But his heart betrayed him. Half unwilling to go yet, he stood glancing toward Grita. The idea of "Cousin Granville" filled the child's mind completely. He was a man, though still young, fitted to inspire respect, perhaps fear, as well as love. He was in fact a leader, without giving himself the slightest trouble to obtain the eminence.
                  Rising to take leave again, he turned to her mother and said, "Now, cousin Minho, I consign this, my favourite, to your care and training." "Ah, beware! Granville," she rejoined, "I am afraid you don't know what you are bringing upon yourself." "That is not fair," he replied; "my little favourite has given herself away, and says she will wait for me."
                  He met the full, dark eye resting upon his gaze. Laughing and glancing up at him, she promised. Several persons present (I among others) saw the seal affixed. The hazel-eyed young lady slipped around behind cousin Adelaide, having declared herself betrothed to the cousin-officer,—a queer little thing, suffused with blushes. "Much ado about nothing!" thought the bystanders.
                  "Cousin Adelaide," said Granville, "keep Grita for me; watch over my inestimable, long-sought-for treasure, while I go into foreign lands, and brave the paths I've chosen, for my future bride (laying his hand touchingly upon the child's shoulder); and, to be crowned with honours for her sake," he added; "the chaplet of laurels, Grita, to be thrown at your feet. I shall yet remain in the army, but it is quite a dreadful thing to leave you, sweet child, for so long a time."
                  Then, addressing his speech to her noble father, Granville asked, "Will you, sir, accept and understand my intentions? if so, I can wait."
                  
                  "As you please—as you please," returned Mr. Marlborough, exchanging a smile with his friend and relative.
                  "I am, you see, really closing the volume of my confessions," remarked the officer; "I have asked the favour of your wife; now, with the honour of your consent, I shall be rich in promises."
                  As these were uttered, the father, placing his hands on Grita's shoulder, in brief and simple significance said, "My daughter!"
                  Mr. Marlborough's tall figure, finely proportioned, contributed to heighten this picture around the domestic altar. His head was sparsely flaked with gray among straight locks of coal-black hair: a keen bright eye, with a decided Spanish rich olive complexion.
                  "My daughter." Grita was the image of her loved father, "Judge for yourself, sir," continued her father, "fancy such a creature a wife,—a wife!"
                  Granville laughed. "I do not wonder at your incredulity."
                  Mr. Marlborough in the same strain observed, "I am sure, if conducive to your future, with all my heart. I yield to your wish—in ten years."
                  A moment of reflection passed gravely over the features of the parent. "This idea of absence from my happiness is indeed sad," said Granville. "Ten years! The time is short over her young head—to me, incredibly long."
                  He would have said more in the same reflective mood, but Mr. Marlborough pressed the hand of our gallant young hero between his own.
                  "Do not be too hopeful, Granville. I am proud of your penetration, and your courage does honour to yourself and your admiring friends."
                  After a silent revery the father and lover remained looking each upon the child as she stood between them, hands clasped in hand. The compact was sealed with a kiss, with these words to complete the bond: "Will you remember your cousin Granville, Grita?"
                  "I cannot but remember," she answered timidly, tenderly clinging to his hand.
                  "Ten years! and I shall cull the prettiest wild-flower ever seen." He bent forward as if about to speak more, then drew his arm around her slender waist, and remained silent. Suddenly he ejaculated, "O, cousin Adelaide! we must and ought to go. But this child has chained the strong man."
                  That instant he touched upon "the ring." In living lustre it shone flashing by lamp-lights on her finger as it caught his eye. The marvellous stone was but of small value, only it decked her tiniest finger. She took it off and handed it to him as he desired to look at it. As she drew it from her hand, he placed it on his finger, and held it up before her.
                  As a pledge she gave Granville the ring, pure offering of her heart, the jewel of a human soul. Stooping to regard the texture of the pledge, he said, "I will keep it and wear it as if a splendid stone, this tiny solitaire reflecting here," placing his hand, with it yet on his finger, in his bosom; "this shall keep the lustre of my promise bright." Turning to her father, he said, "Have'nt I a right to ask a good-by kiss?"
                  "You have the right with the promise the child has given you."
                  "I shall see you again surely before I leave for my post, cousins," said Granville.
                  "What! going to leave us so soon?" chimed several voices, in tones of disappointment.
                  "In a short time, back to join my regiment."
                  No sunny smile lighted that child's face now.
                  "We shall miss you—very sorry."
                  "Ah! I shall return to see you, and make my adieu. Will you kiss me good-by, Grita? I shall carry that kiss away across the mountains with me, everywhere, and love the remembrance of it."
                  Grita followed at his side as the broad hall-door was flung open, and joined the parting guests under the creepers of the cottage-porch. There they stopped again; the moon was up and shone brightly; a light breeze murmured in the leafy canopy above. Granville caught Grita in his arms, pressed her most affectionately to his embrace: "Mine—she is mine! Good night!" The door of the triangular hall closed with an echo. Such was the evening of Grita's first performance in life—her first lesson among the spheres—twenty years ago!
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  
                     
                        
                           "Full swells the fountain of young life."
                        
                        Byron.
                     
                  
                  'TIS midnight hour. Affectionately, as the family parted, the father drew Grita toward him, kissed "Good-night," and told her to beware of visionary dreams, as she seemed really inspired, and seeking rest in the nest of unfledged birds—the nursery. Our little heroine ruminated to a late hour; the effect was profoundly graven; then, like the rays of the young moon that fell on her pillow, Grita's spirit quietly reposed. 
                        
                           "Sweet be thy slumbers, soft and deep,
                           While life no sorrow feels!"
                        
                     
                  
                  The sun shone brightly into the breakfast-room the next morning, and lighted the cheerful faces of home-guests. 
                        
                           "'Tis a tale of campaigning,
                           Of marches, of routes—"
                        
                     
                  
                  
                  We may imagine the effect of a lengthened sojourn "on leave," and the half-formed desire of striking evidence favours his return. After the first lesson "among the spheres," Grita was summoned by a messenger "to receive her betrothed." Soon after, she entered the drawing room; the warm air and blaze of light flushed her Spanish blood, as a conscious power nerved her to self-possession. Rutland stood at her side in a moment, with evident emotion and gratification at the nearer relationship that existed between them,—a satisfaction at the result of their acquaintance, while a tender smile lingered about his lips. Immediately the officer introduced his bride elect to another kinsman nearly related to both. It was not without some trepidation and reserve la petite fiancée approached to respond to the salutation of Sidney Morpeth. Casting her eyes at the new visitor who accompanied Granville on this occasion, she gave signs of resentment at this second cousin, who tried to play with her as a child. It sorely incensed her dignity. Though so small, she was rather queenly under the conqueror, dreaming of future happiness. Courteous compliments had passed, when the gentleman walked across the room to join the party fresh from equestrian adventures. Tossing himself on a soft couch under the rich drapery of a large window, he kept up a train of argument which restored a lively spirit for the rest of the evening. This heir of a grand plantation had joined an assembly of purely literary people, and music was the passion in the group at the Marlboroughs just then. "Old songs," said the accomplished Sidney, as he bent over to ask the favour of Florence Leaton, the bishop's daughter, a guest spending the winter at the Crag. 
                        
                           "Still on the spot Lord Morpeth stay'd,
                           For fairer scene he ne'er survey'd."
                        
                     
                  
                  Timid Minho seated herself at the piano, and without affectation sung sweetly. The song she selected was a simple ballad; it suited her voice admirably: 
                        
                           "When twilight dews are falling fast
                           Upon the rosy sea."
                        
                     
                  
                  She left the piano to look out upon the moonlight, on the wild flowering almond, profusely in bloom. The outward picture was cooling, and the coloring within the richly furnished room, with its windows mantled by long sky-blue satin curtains fringed with bullion; tables spread with elegant and valuable books, flowers breathing their fragrance in bouquets, vases filled with lilies and rare exotics among straggling dewy leaves, crowning ornaments of the apartment, contrasted with the calm and lovely night. The beautiful turn of expression elicited opinion on the facts of poetical feeling; and Sidney playfully gave reference to the affaire du cœur. "I perceive the officer has really surrendered, and gives much weight to this early attachment,—a fair encounter, as he calls it;" presently he interrupted la fiancée telling Granville it was late. "You will go, cousin? come!" most affectionately Rutland looked upon her, and surprised at once, "Yes! farewell, good by!" 
                        
                           "With silent grief of heart
                           I breathe adieu to follow duty now."
                        
                      "And if I must leave thee, Grita, child-love, remember." A painful uncertainty changed Granville's features, and with mixed feelings he contemplated his favourite flower. Before him she stood in a drooping, pensive attitude. "You will not forget me? the pledge is significant. I will never swerve from its allegiance. A kiss, sweet one, and we must part." Another, the promised kiss—clasping the young thing in his arms, he suffused her with kisses, as the look of triumph passed over his face—She is mine! mine only; forever mine, Grita. Her heart sealed itself to his. Her eyes, tearfully lifted to his, called forth an impressive prayer from his lips; he took her hand, and Grita felt a mystic touch creep over their clasped fingers, electrified by a little ring—still there. "A garnet ring?" whispered Morpeth, "and fair encounter of two most rare affections." At length the officer stirred to move. "It is late. Good by must come, now; adieu, a long adieu! But it is not the last time, I pray God. Intermission comes, and shall bring me to see how my wild-flower grows." Sentiment glowed in his heart, and the soldier-lover implanted his last kiss upon her brow, and that afresh consecrated this his ideal of woman on the purity of her years, and placed the earliest vow in her heart,—when he departed for his regiment. Granville, set sail on the treacherous sea of fate, was borne from those blue soft waves, wafted by gentle zephyrs. Dear to our hero was the earliest vow, and her fair young form was graven on his soul: a beacon to shine on his pathway, and glitter in the watch-fire, in seasons of peril. The garnet ring! a safeguard from harm. 
                        
                           "Secret are the ways of Heaven,
                           Yet to some great aim they tend."
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  "WHY has he left me?" wondered she in her secret thoughts. Committing to memory the rudiments of the first lesson, Grita attended to Miss Lyttleton's teachings. Always ready to talk to others about the soldier-cousin, in her fancies a shadow passed over her young brow, as she thought to herself, "Why did he leave me?" Blessed with a disposition that extracted beauty from each natural source, like a bee, she found light and fragrance in each rosy path; like a lark on the wing, she arose with a song on her lips. Home education was pursued, but our heroine never would bend her real character to the severe discipline of study. She chose to enjoy being visibly led by her guiding intellect, glimpses of her new world a never-failing source of amusement. Her pets, her flowers, her books and music, each had their day, but always with vague aspirations after higher ends—such as might give aim to her life. Her sensibility was perfectly adapted to her simple habits, and early and agreeable attachments were formed by Grita among chosen playmates, but never an intimate one. In her nature, confidence was a pure sentiment, and a unity existed with one to which none other could approach. The daylight would scarce come again ere Grita was yonder, aslope the footpath over the rustic bridge, along the hill-side, and within Wilverly Lodge, lying among heavy shade-trees opposite Park Avon. This was the home of Mrs. Jefferson, the home of Miss Lyttleton, cousin Adelaide's sister; charming women that they were. In this quiet retreat our little heroine awaited news. The powerful tie attaching her with the hands which brought her love's rich life, induced her, leaving every playmate, to seek repose of heart in the calm of Miss Lyttleton's own sanctum. Again she dwelt on the perfections of her ideal hero. Seating her tiny self on a footstool beside his favourite friend and cousin, she would ask first, "Why did he leave me?" So she would remain for hours applying her little usefulness to cousin Adelaide's service. Amazed and satisfied to feel HE loved her, Grita very thoughtfully looked into Miss Lyttleton's face, and involuntarily yielding to instinctive delicacy, earnestly inquired, Will he come again, cousin Adelaide? That face full of kindness and sympathy renewed her protection, affectionately observing the hopes of him far away. Confiding love still looked concerned. "So far away. Why did he leave me? he won't forget me, I hope." Thus soothed by friendship, her heart full of hope, she marched off perfectly unconcerned about rigidity at home. Our heroine was careful of her heart's dearest treasures; none comprehended indeed, thus opened, the source of her singular power and feeling. A light dawned across her brain, through every breeze the spicy scent penetrated with strength, "half hid and half revealed to view."
                  From Petersburg, Grita was planted again in the place of her nativity, Richmond, and the Marlboroughs once more settled at the elegant home, Frosterly Manor.
                  
                  Madame Marlborough's conscious dignity and long habits of authority had rendered her advantages important. Her husband's etiquette and punctilious attentions were quite like those of the Spanish Court in early days. With the fortune of a retired gentleman, none more largely enjoyed society and entertainment than Mr. Marlborough,—well fitted to keep up that course of lordly reception at the beautiful Manor, situated in the midst of a select neighbourhood, surrounded by splendid trees and extensive pleasure-grounds laid out with great taste, noble avenues and matchless flowers: its extensive conservatory was in great repute—stamping a natural air of opulence. And, too, sumptuous equipages, with outriders in quiet livery, marked the state of the Marlboroughs' arms. Palmy days of the Old Dominion! In the background of this delightful Manor a broad avenue of shining white gravel led to a spring emerging from a forest-ground, amid a profusion of thickets, knolls, crags, and shaded by a wood further on. From the shaggy banks a footpath conducted from Laurel spring to the flower-garden and greenhouses. Such were the comforts of the Manor. I reëntered the house and reached the door of the library, opened it, and found Miss Grita alone: my entrance was made so quietly that I escaped her notice for a moment or two. Perched on a chair, feet on the rounds, sat the solitary child, her eye deepened into sadness.
                        
                           "'Twas sweet to see her like a bird
                           Escaped to greenwood shades.
                           Stay yet, stay awhile,
                           Her wildest fancy still beguile."
                        
                     
                  
                  Gracefully leaning against the large centre-table, she rested her elbow there. Her dark hair was braided off a shell-like ear. A cheerful, happy smile was exchanged for one of deep thoughtfulness; her eyes seemed restrained from tears only by the sentiment of pride lingering about her lips, and she sat tapping her slippered foot impatiently against the floor: those southern eyes were bent on the fire, blazing with dried wood, across the great brass andirons, shining like gold. 
                        
                           "No longer Autumn's glowing red
                           Upon our forest hills is shed."
                        
                     
                  
                  As I approached the agreeable picture she was at the last point of descent, and, slipping from the high oak chair, looked at me doubtingly, then passed away. My social obligations called me away, and I took her hand and led her to the right. A large pair of folding-doors admitted us into the room where were assembled the rest. There gathered before tea, they had, as usual, resumed the drawing-room occupations. I have now brought my story to the period of our getting into winter quarters, and with recollections of such adventures as have left upon my mind a chequered and varied feeling of pleasure, I shall trust with no slight gratitude and veneration to the Disposer of human events, who has guided this early course, that the ease with which he has blessed "my life" may seem softer from remembrances and contrasts. So far, therefore, from being a useless and incomprehensible thing, we are to consider the teachings of Grita's life. And this is not all; by such reading, may it reform the vain imaginings of some counsels, that reject impression on the soul of childhood. In the mean time the young, ladies were closely confined at school—of course, Mal and our heroine in the primary department of the celebrated Madame Burke's Seminary, near at hand. Advancing under superior training, they graduated with high honours, yet not emancipated. Our heroine in her teens was the great favourite from home: she was courted by young aspirants whose attentions were daily expressed, at home and abroad, but she held them in strict obedience to self-government; her sunny, enthusiastic nature gave pleasure, but inborn refinement never admitted Ymataca among the rude. Over all her actions. was observable a predominating respect for elders; venerating superiority with unexceptionable grace in one of her years. However, the domestic department may not bear me testimony to her social elements. Among her schoolmates she was regarded as superficial, and some among her companions placed   this girl a myth of quality. Alas, what did they know? how superficial their knowledge of her portion of life's inheritance, by a study only self-teachers can gain. How often she laughed and blushed with thoughts of a bright vision, best known to herself. Twenty years after may tell. What is theirs? Grita's intellectual treasury promised to afford her the acquirements of a new science, occupation and enjoyment for a lifetime. A brief interlude,—nothing to write, but that time passed in dignity and honour to fellow beings, but, O, not to God—taking the ground for his displeasure, we can note no family altar raised to his glory, supplicating for mercy or protection, to consecrate best energies by showing forth God's loving kindness in the morning, and his faithfulness every night,—a direction without which our very lives are perilled. To be insensible to God's dealings, is it not blasphemy and presumption? "Pray without ceasing" reacheth the throne of grace. That indissoluble bond of family union was broken in Marlborough house. A prayerless home, to violate the holy inducement of safety for each soul and accomplish a curse of action by wandering from the one fold.
               
            
            
               
               THE SECOND ERA.
               FIVE YEARS.
               1845.
               
                  
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  
                     
                        
                           "He went by chance, as I heard say.
                           To that same house that very day."
                        
                     
                  
                  THE most quiet of expectants were "at home." But Granville proceeded alone from Frosterly ——, to meet with his child-love. He had, as expected, found her distant not far from him.
                  That inspired presence rendered the spot acute to feeling, and he took possession of a corner on Linden Avenue, to watch for her return towards the Manor; carefully instructed by her mother, to find the child-love there, near the Denmericks, her dearest friends. To her inexpressible surprise she beheld Granville as she drew near home. With difficulty could he take his eyes from her. As she approached, suddenly she stopped between the corners. "Why, Grita, why reject my coming?" She did not stir a moment, nor he,—the creature appeared entranced; and then with expressive step she advanced to his embrace with a hearty laugh. "Cousin Granville!" burst from her lips; he stood transported with the little one clinging to his hand. After a short pause, when they were satisfied of their real existence, "My Grita," he began, "how sweet she looks!" And five years' rich development reassured him of his unquestionable knowledge where "child and woman meet." With that hand upon which it rested, he had raised his sword in Justice, and in truth, worn from 40-5. And not a word had been heard of, or from him, till this meeting in the home of her birth. Our officer's leave was in honour too of a visit to Arthur Seat, his own beautiful baronial mansion, where his fond mother was residing. This liberty afforded him the promised return. Under the lindens they were to part again. Granville looked at her fixedly for a moment, as she said, "Stop here." Assuming his words of endearment, he stooped to kiss her brow: full of meaning that second seal—"Dear and well beloved Grita, God bless you;" then smoothed back her long, luxuriant hair tenderly with the hand on which it rested, drew her nearer to him, until he felt her breath upon his bowed face, and a passionate prayer escaped his lips. "Oh God, spare her, shield her," he repeated, with his eyes gazing wistfully on his young affection, her bright face uplifted to his, and her hands fast locked in his strong grasp. "Grita, tell me, are you mine?" Grita's mood was softened, the roses deepened on her cheek and her eye grew brighter, as she listened, her heart moved almost to tears. She returned that love warm and timidly. Rutland listened to this child, who had stirred every keynote of his frame with a mixture of pain and delight, so tantalizing. Leaning on the wicket-gate, with her nonchalant air, she asked, what is "mine?" which, however, he explained with consistency of sentiment, "You will come with me when I return again; then I shall keep you always; take care of you, and love you forever—forever, darling. Mine, little Grita." "And," replied the child with a smile, "can I think of you always?" "Always," whispered the lover. He was unmistakably sad and gloomy. He did not see the bright tear which dimmed her eyes when she turned towards his downcast face. "And, dear, how rejoiced I am to see you again, heart-free through five years." For this loving power had sprung into existence in one instant; her look of purity first attracted him, and then her face at rest had enchained him, as being angelic; and when she smiled, all that was beautiful on earth seemed to glow in the mirth which shone in her eyes, or the arched curve of her coral lips. He thought how it would brighten his life with such a ministering spirit hovering near. But then the vague five years again took a more definite form of a wish—carrying him back to his lonely home with the red man; with anxious solicitude for his household treasure. "I shall be oppressed with a sense of unrest when I'm gone, Grita," said the hero gloomily: both felt a strange significance in that word farewell! "Remember, pretty one," he said with a smile, "how many things I shall tell you of when I come again." The soldier found himself listening with strange eagerness to those words falling like pearls from her lips; but words were superfluous to convey to each other the impress of companionship, and the solemn stillness that reigned around made them feel it was an earth-period of sacred nature. By that deliciously sheltered spot, or earth-period, they extract its hour of prayerful hopes, and listen awhile with a deep sense of tranquil enjoyment to the soft winds that part the foliage, as the sun shines joyously upon their path. Bewildered emotions of happiness in her young heart could prognosticate no evil in the brief absence of "five years;" and she tried to laugh away his fears. Yet even though the brightest future awaited them, they both felt that a parting was a serious thing. The sun, rivalling their combination of colours, had given new life to the flower "Forget me not." The noble fleur de souvenance had developed its growth to a blessed dream, enthralling and absorbing. A thousand questions were conversed upon while the music of the winds soothed with its influence. Like a child she drew close to that embrace; his secret rushed to expression,—"Remember your promise, Grita." "Will you remember yours?" she asked inquisitively. "Mine, and always mine, I do! Never fear, I will prove true as Damascus steel. Never fail, do you hear, Grita, and so help me God," he said impressively and fervently, "I will guard and guide thee as my wife." "Always," she said inaudibly: her simple heart trusted him, and tears started to her eyes, for she felt the force of his solemn vow, and realized she had gained his love for life. The firm pressure of each hand was a pledge on the compact, and the fervency of that last kiss tipped those crystal fruits of hope with a bright glory, and threw over the mysterious spell a brilliant radiance from the concave heavens. 
                        
                           "Farewell, farewell;—with silent grief of heart
                           I breathe adieu to follow duty now;
                           And if a silent tear unbidden start,
                           It will not, love, disgrace a soldier's brow."
                        
                     
                  
                  As they departed a lingering tone of benediction audibly rung in their ears, and the rustling of those linden leaves, full like a chorus dying away, echoed from the spirit-land, "Only believe; be faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life,"—that future soon to come, bliss of earthly ties to link the chain hymeneal and grace the dawning loveliness of dawning woman. He was the first to plant the impress of love on her young heart, too tender in growth to comprehend its true power, but on her very soul it was burned in letters of two names, in reality one. Half curious, half defined, that noble image lay concealed,—her earliest day-dream. The fresh heart caught its notes, and like a bird sang with joy over his strong and devoted fidelity. Let us now, as then, draw the thin and shadowy veil over those first scenes,—the loved, the beautiful past.
               
               
                  CHAPTER V.
                  Measure for measure.
                  IN the dewy freshness of her morning, Grita's path again turned to change. As womanhood draws near, we shall find her life woven into threads highly productive of peculiar shades. The Marlboroughs proceeded to a Northern home, bade farewell to friends, left the sunny South with innumerable good wishes, severing warm ties of birthright. 
                        
                           "Fare thee well, old noble state,
                           First in war, or peace, or love."
                        
                     
                  
                  Our travellers did not remain long en route, and were ere long residents of the North, received in its vast city with all the marks of distinction which became their position—already assumed dignities among strangers with the quiet air and ease of persons so accustomed to high life. And just two years after the parting, Grita Ymataca found this new home. Transplanted, at first she felt the chill of zone, and really was somewhat changed. Here too she looked with girlish wonder towards the gay place. Yet beneath her mother's pinions, she was carefully guarded: like a bee of morning drowsing on a yet unopened flower, childhood's playful archness brightens into earnest thought's repose, with naught of woman's completeness. But when five more years shall have browned each glossy tress, will she be—will she be another creature! A ray of reflection is cast on her mind, a gentle effort to awaken from a sphere of conscious power. Ymataca Marlborough, like a bird, faintly hears the sigh of an absent lover. Yet the memory has departed like rain-drops from the forehead of a flower. This is but an echo, telling of Pembroke Beverly, to come soon in pursuit of his early love, and it gave credit to his quiet dignity and grave character. A young man of intelligent and cultivated bearing, his frankness of manners and profession moulded a gallantry of thorough good-breeding which had made him a prize in the society of her birth-place. From his first meeting Ymataca, as a girl just verging into teens, he was captivated; and, captured on the sidewalk, on a warm summer afternoon, under the foliaged trees of Capitol Avenue, strolling at the same time with her, and she with her younger sister, and the attendant, or nursery attaché, who had been chief of that government eighteen years, in which capacity she became Mal's adorer, and of course, fiercely jealous of our heroine. So then it was; Pembroke Beverly fixed his gaze upon the floating grace of Ymataca Marlborough: her wild air of loveliness agitated the breast of her silent admirer, surveying the charming idea with her most dear old friend, Walter, who was promenading the avenue with young Beverly, giving a keen look upon even her dress, covered with flowers and beautiful vines, over which a thin muslin mantle was thrown à l'espagnol. It quite distinguished her among the rest. After some questions the gentlemen immediately followed in her footsteps to her home, where they found her ladyship. From that one look commenced his passion for a first love, and he never left her side till his happiness was thrown at her feet. While engaged in contemplation he would repeat, in his soft, gentle tone, the words of a favourite song, accompanied with his guitar— 
                        
                           "Be mine, dear maid, this faithful heart
                           Shall never prove untrue;
                           'T were easier far from life to part
                           Than lose my love for you!"
                        
                     
                  
                  Away now in this distance, Ymataca had just opened his late effusion, which, wrung from his heart strings, breathed with living pathos. 
                        
                           Ymataca.
                           "She was not very beautiful,
                           If it be beauty's test
                           To match a classic model
                           When perfectly at rest.
                           She did not look bewitchingly,
                           If witchery it be
                           To have a forehead and a lip
                           Transparent as the sea."
                        
                     
                  
                  Here she stopped to think, Was it possible he loved her? "Perhaps he believes he does. I will think so." Abandoning the idea, she read on. "Is it possible?" she said, "can I believe? O he must, I know it: beautiful verses!" 
                        
                           "The fashion of her gracefulness
                           Was not a followed rule,
                           And her effrescent sprightliness
                           Was never learnt at school.
                           Her words were all peculiar,
                           Like the fairies who spoke pearls,
                           And her voice was ever sweetest
                           Midst the cadences of girls.
                        
                        
                           Ymataca.
                           "I said she was not beautiful;
                           Her eyes upon your sight
                           Broke with the lambent purity
                           Of planetary light.
                           And an intellectual beauty,
                           Like a light within a vase,
                           Touch'd every line with glory
                           Of her animated face."
                        
                     
                  
                  
                  "I have no doubt of it," she laughed. "But I only partly return such affection, for I told him of another whom I shall wait for, 'mine' always! Strong as Mr. Beverly's love is, I did say friendship was pleasanter; and that, I felt, ought to stop his entreaties." All this, friend reader, was only Fate's accident, and she gave back but a small feeling, and left him, as we said, in Richmond—he said "engaged,"—severing his hopes with coldness. The indefinite arrangement suited but little his views. Her notions of chivalry, as being the right only of woman from man, did not estimate the pain inflicted by such an avowal. "And never to come back? Forever gone. I shall follow your path with unabating zeal. O let me come! I will, east or west, south or north. I shall see you there," were his last words at parting. It was October when the large family from Frosterly Manor left their native realm, and they arrived at the distant city of cities in the same month.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  
                     
                        
                           "It was not thus in other days we met—
                           Hath time, or absence, taught thee to forget?"
                        
                     
                  
                  FULL three weeks after the arrival of the strangers, they were at home in large and handsome apartments; around them gathered already a circle of choice and cultivated ones; friends, and new-made friends of distinction: among the first was a noted individual. In the evening of December, I was among many in that large drawing-room. Late in the evening the attention of every one of the circle was attracted by the entrance of a beautiful girl. After glancing around the room for her elder sister, she advanced towards Miss Marlborough, who received the young thing, also the younger sister at her side—the two younger allowed to carry off the palm between them—so nearly the same age and dressed almost alike. Our heroine was taller; Mal had more brilliant colour, rather a cold expression, refined features, and haughty. Equally evident was the rich beauty of Minho: quiet stateliness and amiability mingled with her talented accomplishments, which graced her worth inestimable. Yet her feelings were reserved—rather chilled, but withal gentle. Our heroine was seated before the piano. While singing a constant favourite, "O soon return," the door opened, and Mr. Oustan was announced. Ymataca left her music at once and drew aside to the recessed window. In a few moments the stranger sought her acquaintance, and Miss Marlborough approached the young sister, accompanied by James Oustan. Ymataca rose with indifference and saluted the new acquaintance. Conversation was entered upon languidly, but the gentleman's interest increased, and his admiration expressed itself unintentionally, not in words, but in the expression of his speaking eyes. Her smile,—those witching hazel eyes sparkling with excitement, then languishing in accordance with varying emotions of her sensitive nature, perhaps, susceptible heart,—a sensitive plant truly, budding in a colder clime (there was no voluptuous splendour ripening in her pure face)—hall combined to attract him. Inclined to receive her father's friend as one superior to her in years, although he was but in the prime of manhood, Ymataca Marlborough rendered her attentions frankly. The additional training of school duties was resumed by our heroine and her more quiet and erudite sister. Mal's studious mind advanced and strengthened as befitted her leading peculiarities. With the wild-flower not so; and only quick perceptions emerged from an unrestrained intellect, which compelled attention at the widely-known young ladies' institute of Mr. Willson. But Ymataca's progress was never stimulated by care nor encouragement. Steadily she devoted herself to play and sport, suffered to have her own way, for she was ever the caressed one.—I am to pass over trivial occurrences, and say that another period has slipped by, and again we reach a point of radiance. Stay awhile, oh dawning maiden, just leaving the restrictions of boarding-school; linger yet on the threshold of woman's domains. Soon around thee years will come: if they bring an added lustre, sure they will take a bloom that will never bud again. I have closed the space, and she, our little heroine, has been advanced with her younger sister into—society.
                  At sweet sixteen she stands on the stage of life. The curtain rises— 
                        
                           "One smile she gave. He bow'd and knelt
                           At beauty's shrine the knee,
                           And in his panting bosom felt
                           Love's deepest luxury.
                        
                        
                           And from that memory ne'er could fade
                           That youthful form divine,
                           Till in the arms of death is laid
                           This throbbing heart of mine."
                        
                     
                  
                  Mr. James Oustan was at that time in the prime of manhood; a great favourite in refined and elegant circles. He was very handsome. Other persons were envious of his influence. His air and bearing created a natural impression sion of his high-bred accomplishments, bearing as he did a remarkable likeness to his Royal Highness, Prince Albert. A faultless figure made him an admired man, which his high character in no way diminished. He was of good family, both English and Dutch. And above all, his kind disposition endeared him to every one who had the pleasure of his acquaintance. Miss Marlborough was his first friend after the introduction and slight acquaintance with the father, who perceived in him qualities calculated to endure, and endear him to the family. He was accordingly admitted as a favoured guest at the house. On her entrance into society, Ymataca was received with exceeding success. Mr. Oustan at once placed himself amongst her warmest admirers. So completely she charmed his eye, that he marked her for his own. To keep other suitors at a safe distance, he defied the laws of etiquette, by paying Miss Ymataca the most pointed attentions. It annoyed her so, that, to cool the ardour of his resolution, she amused herself by baptizing him with a goblet of cold water, at the suggestion of a Boston rival: he tried the joke with revenge upon her; and for days all friendliness ceased. Soon, however, his affection returned, with redoubled force, devoting him utterly to her service. The force of such feelings was heightened to an unusual degree by her bird-like notes, which went to his heart. Absorbed in his dream of happiness ness, he gave all his thoughts how to win her affections. Not yet; for she was too young, he thought, to receive his proposals; and he thought that by becoming a part of her every-day life, it would be glimpses of conquest. So that agreements were not proposed nor negotiations advanced. He liked only to keep watch over her, and endeavour to form her mind in accordance with his own. Another season, and the Marlboroughs found another abode, a mansion in Brooklyn, not far distant from the Navy Yard. A winter passed with its usual campaign, and from the post of national honour "Our Hotel" received its share of officers of distinction. One evening, in the drawing-room, Ymataca Marlborough was introduced to an officer, Lieut. Aston of the navy, son of the celebrated Wif' Aston. His position was particularly enviable, being of a family whose sons and daughters were unrivalled for beauty and attractions by any in America. Such are the singularity of our heroine's charms, that she exacts, as it were, a tribute to her country, in support of her illustrious name, by bringing under her yoke another "man of war"—a naval hero,—by strange coincidence own cousin to the hero of this history, and not unlike Lieut. Rutland. Edgar was agreeable, possessed of natural abilities, urbanity and kindness of heart. Years had elapsed, and no reunion had taken place of these friendly and related families, till now, when the son was met. At first introduction he called her acquaintance a sunbeam! and ere long, sentiments of a warmer admiration were expressed for Miss Ymataca. His fascinations were dangerous, linked with dissipation,—that splendid person of his, his profusion of light hair suiting the expression of his large, clear blue eyes, with a profile a perfect study. His manly proportions, just in his twenty-fifth year, excited the admiration of his youthful cousin. With all the heated current of her sunny nature, she managed her administration cautiously, and managed her admirers in most cases wisely. This delightful little naval flirtation created some displeasure in her family. Although she had entertained only the idea of Lieut. Aston's friendship, certainly it prepared a magazine which might explode at some future time. The lieutenant was bitterly and harshly rejected by her parents. Her youth and his extreme waywardness gave reason for watchfulness. On several occasions, severe rebuke and struggles took place between the father and Aston. Indeed, stringent laws were enforced, and Miss Ymataca was made to refuse his visits. He urged upon her an elopement, but, young as she was, she had too much respect for her parents to elope. At last, after trial, Edgar Aston granted her "unreasonable requirement," and finally they were separated. But long after, she heard that he retained still, "and forever," the warm regard she so excited. In Mexico and other wild lands, Lieut. Aston was still her friend.—Neither father nor mother had studied the subject of our history. They did not commence with right intimacy with their daughter. They allowed the difference to produce a distance between them; and Ymataca was left to grow unnurtured by profound love, which could only have unfolded to them her best nature. Summer came with its fragrant loveliness; and the delicate health of Madame Marlborough required change. They secured a cottage by the sea, near to the small village Lapomuck. Many cottages were filled with summer visitors during the bathing season, and, for greater accommodation, Cape Hope Hotel stood on a promontory,—a fine large building. The country around the small village was flat, but pretty drives and woody lanes stretched far and wide over the island. At Dove Cliff the household of Marlborough settled in their summer home. Dove Cliff became a great resort. The landscape around the dwelling was very picturesque; a garden terraced from the cliff to the water's edge or beach, and perched here and there trim arbours and gnarled pillars, grottoed under great trees, casting their shadow on the luxuriant growth of honeysuckle and woodbine. Smooth gravel walks, with neatly trimmed box, extended on either side. It was a beautiful spot. Our heroine enthroned herself on a garden-chair, where "emblems of mighty chiefs lent ear to her harmony and voice; she passed time away listening to old ocean's roar." On the evening of a sultry day in August, a dark-complexioned gentleman stepped from a hackney-coach which stood before the entrance of Dove Cliff. Weary and dusty with travel, he moved towards the entrance with an apprehensive air. Winding around the gravel circle, he looked towards a bystander, who approached to receive him,—not a stranger. A pause of minutes, and here covered himself from the anxiety and fatigue which he had undergone during the last few days of travel. The sudden recurrence of his thoughts to the object of his fond and ineffaceable love, had completely overpowered his nature. In this extremity the master of Dove Cliff advanced and cordially welcomed the old friend, at once communicating the arrival to his wife, by a messenger announcing Mr. Beverly from the South. In the mean time he earnestly invited him to remain awhile. Madame Marlborough entered half an hour after. His carriage was dismissed, and the Southerner accepted the hospitality. Mr. Beverly informed his host that he had come to pass a day or more at the hotel, intending to see all he could of the "graces" before he proceeded to Boston. Having failed to obtain the situation of officer of Public Treasurer in the city of cities he was about to try Boston. In the mean time, he enjoyed the pleasure of loitering at Dove Cliff, and breathing the country air. The hall-door stood open, the old house-dog lay stretched on the wide piazza, tame birds hopped upon the slender twigs and elm trees, singing fearlessly. The undulating waves were glistening in the sunshine, contrasting with the clear blue sky. All around was still: ever and anon leaves stirred. In half an hour Mr. Beverly retired to his room, Mr. Marlborough leading the way, and the servant following. After an absence of ten minutes, the host returned to the piazza, to finish reading the morning papers. Turning away, he sat conversing with his invalid wife, as she was inhaling the soft ocean-breeze. A brief interval, and the gentleman completed his toilet. At three o'clock he made his appearance. With feelings not to be described, trembling with eagerness, he entered the parlour. The mother was sitting by the curtained window, enveloped in its lace drapery. Our party rose politely and offered him a seat. Mr. Marlborough immediately called the attention of his two daughters, who were entertaining several visitors, to Mr. Beverly. After cordial greetings with the old friend, he resumed his seat. A shadow passed from his countenance, as his genial temperament and easy manner turned in converse with Miss Marlborough.—The first bell rung as Ymataca ran laughing up the stairs. With flushed cheek, quick and light step, she reached her dressing-room to prepare for dinner. Question after question rushed into her mind. "A different meeting from what he imagined! he will not know me! A woman now! with woman's pride." Delicate modesty deterred her from presenting herself early. She continued—"Obliterated, childish nonsense, recollection of a friend." Turning from these thoughts, she passsd on. He heard a footstep on the piazza and cross the hall. Guided by the sound he saw her as she proceeded, walking leisurely along. He started a step forward in her direction, but suddenly hesitated. Alone the one ideal was present to his mind. It filled his imagination, and sent a thrill of surprise and agony through his whole frame—she was but a child when he left her, she now appeared a lovely woman. A painful idea suggested itself to his heart, as he stood leaning against the window-sill, glancing, in the distance, across the piazza at the pure-hearted young creature, who after a day of peaceful employment had, ere his return, just quitted the piano. Drawing a rustic chair to the recess, Ymataca sat gazing in tranquil admiration upon the scenery around. The gentle breeze entered his window, laden with sweet scents of that coy flower—a spray of roses which she was tying into a bouquet. A chilling presentiment infused itself in all his visions—has she changed in mind as in form? or had she lost the freshness of her nature? His low voice whispered," Is there upon earth a more exquisite countenance than hers?" She was sitting listlessly when a footstep startled her. Hastily bounding forward, the long absent exile grasped her hand. Dreaming of days gone by, half confused she looked at Mr. Beverly. "Sit here," she said, pointing to a chair, and with an effort recovered her calmness. He ventured to speak, in a somewhat unsteady voice: "I am sorry to disturb you, Miss Ymataca." "O, no, I am glad to see you, my old friend." All this had been rehearsed by our young actress, while under the hands of her dressing-maid a few moments ago. With folded arms and downcast countenance, he walked up and down the retired part of the Gothic arch in the broad piazza. This was her account: "Yesterday," she said, "the interesting event came off." Nothing could be more touching than his allusion to his sufferings, and the privations he had undergone for his profession. Now he plunged into the cold, deep stream of trouble, which had haunted his daydream and vision by night. Beverly's face had gradually assumed an expression of mute despair. "Mr. Beverly," she said, removing her hand from his grasp, as he stood before her, as if under the influence of a dream. He was silent: slowly and deliberately as her words were spoken, it thrilled him through, and brought hot blood to his cheek. "Mr. Beverly, I shall always be your friend, with
                     sisterly attachment—nothing more. Though I promised to be your wife—I do not, nor have I loved you, and will never try again. It would be false. I cannot torture you longer by holding out hopes. It is over. We are friends—are we not?" "Ah, Ymataca," said he, breaking the silence, "I see too plainly you mean what you have said." When the whole truth came, he bent his head slowly and held his hand before his eyes, as though to arrest some horrible doom which would crush him to death. There was a pause, a long and painful pause. Long and earnestly he looked upon her bowed head. His look was haggard, his whole expression changed, and years of suffering appeared written on his face. "And yet," said he, "you are mine!—No! no! I will not resign you. You are mine." "No longer," she replied coldly. Her task was difficult. It was done. "Since you wish to be free, you are free," ejaculated the lover. Scarcely able to see from his intense emotion, he proceeded with difficulty to say: "Remember me, my own true love, crushed as I am by weight of anguish. Yes, I must go, leaving you in sunshine, my lost treasure. Farewell. And now, remember me ever as thinking of you; ever praying for your welfare. The stars 'will shine for you, but not for me." Laying his hand lingeringly upon her drooping head, he looked once again at her wondrous countenance, so pure, so strangely beautiful:
                        
                           "If witchery it be to have a forehead and a lip
                           Transparent as the sea."
                        
                     
                  
                  Clasping his hands above her, he said, "Loved one, farewell. Happiness and peace, God grant, may be yours."
                  Tears of sorrow dropped slowly down his cheek. Departing from her path, his own good sense came to his assistance. Time had added to his figure ripened manhood. All around him was greatly altered. He slowly walked back again towards her. For the first time in life, a broken-hearted man, suddenly stripped of his confidence, and yet he felt a total inability to surrender his long-cherished hopes. 'Tis at such a time and such occasions the temper and quality of the soul are tried. "Let us discard sentiment, Mr. Beverly," said Ymataca as, at her request, he accompanied her to dinner. "Never think of the past, but the future." Miss Ymataca lost no opportunity in paying her attentions as required to the guest, and old friend, with a view of dissipating as far as possible the depression of Pembroke's spirits. The household gathering at dinner keenly relished the privileges of conversation at the dinner-table. Pembroke and Ymataca rose from the repast in a more tranquil mood than could have been expected.
                  At a late hour that night Pembroke Beverly was alone in his bed-room with a sickening sensation tion; his feet on a chair, his arms folded, his eyes fixed vacantly on space. Trying to smoke himself to sleep, he attempted to light his cigar. It would not light, so he rose, put out the candle, and went to bed. For several days the young Southerner passed his time sadly enough. Having prolonged his stay, he ventured to hear the worst once again. He stood in her fascinating presence with profound and agitated feelings, which the sight of her called forth. The shock to his hopes had not quenched the ardour of his aspiring devotion, faithful and persevering to the last degree. Now in another moment the anchor is cast away and she left him drifting in the gulf of Despair. Half stupefied, he was on the eve of his departure. Scarce half an hour, and they would be parted, perhaps never to meet again. His face bore witness to the intensity of his emotions, and he did not even attempt to disguise his desperate disappointment. Presently the travelling carriage came rolling around the lawn. A brief address of gratitude for their distinguished entertainment, as he smiled sadly on his attached friends, shaking hands with heartfelt friendship, Mr. Beverly heaved a profound sigh, and bid adieu to the beauties of Dove Cliff. Resuming his hat, he dragged himself with rapid step towards the carriage, while happy wishes for his safe return sounded like discord to his ear. Slowly recovering from the vast change in his destiny, rapidly he returned South. The ensuing week found Mr. Beverly at home, depressed in spirits, wounded in heart, crushed by a blow from which he was never to recover.
                  
                     
                        "I saw the storm."
                     
                     Milton.
                  
                  That afternoon Ymataca was confined to her room by a temporary illness. The last moment of disclosure seemed to speak for the rest; when looking up with a blush, she received a long reprimand from her mother, that such proceedings should have been carried on without her sanction or knowledge. "I will not permit or tolerate such nonsense. You are, indeed, not fit to take care of yourself, wrong-headed child. At sixteen to have such proposals, is foreign to my intention. Contemptible deception; my unbridled rein shall hold its check over one so void of understanding and decent propriety." Such were her mother's words. Ymataca's first impulse was to vindicate her conduct, and that of her friend. The next instant Ymataca's head was resting feebly on the pillow. Great tears—not of regret—were rushing down her pale face. A moment like that was the hour for gentle maternal influence. Yet that mother refused to be moved to take her own true part. However giddy, reckless, and heedless our heroine was, her youth required forbearance and communion with a kindred spirit, such as alone a mother can be. At home her wealth of love was uncalled for—depth of tenderness left alone the fountain of warm affection unstirred, except by chill and suspicion. Right and wrong in Ymataca's disposition was largely developing; she had braved in constant anticipation the risk of being discovered and punished. She belonged to nobody but one. Ah, that one, who, if he loved her still, was silent. Had she yet realized the test? Why "could she comprehend the term mine," and not a word? Three years silence seemed strange. No token of regard, and still they loved as none ever loved before. "A test of woman," was Granville's unceasing motto for love. Well in her sanctum she disliked misconstruction, and still avoided mingling unreservedly with those uncongenial spirits. At this stage of proceedings she felt that when entitled to sympathy, she was to endure alone. But a blessed spirit, as it were, beside her whispered consolatory relief; she knew that she had done no wrong, and her devout reliance on virtue and good intentions made her seem bold. Her nervous headache and weariness from such excitement, added fever to her naturally delicate health. As she lay sick and feeble on her bed she heard his departure, for the carriage drove from under the window of her chamber, and the friend of her girlhood quitted the house forever. Again her mother sought the reasons for all, and all were never heard. Seating herself on the bed, Madame Marlborough indulged in angry resentment ment, which was fully applauded by the old nursery attaché. "Yes, poor, ignorant, foolish child, ensnared by the common flattery of Mr. Beverly," so said Thacker, the attaché. The regret, not love, that Ymataca showed, afforded sufficient apology to the enraged mother. Madame Marlborough was called away, and Ymataca soon fell into a quiet sleep. We can imagine these suspicions of "wrong actions" to leave its unfailing impression on her mind. Weeks glided into weeks, her suffering and regret at the pain she had caused him passed away. Her pure heart elevated her mind to better things and strength. With natural buoyancy she recovered her spirits. Thoroughly inured to their injustice and the jealousy of Thacker, who was ever willing to find ground of offence against her, constantly subject to her malicious tongue, the unoffending Ymataca had no advantage except her defiance. She struggled to forbear as under the same roof, when unexpected provocations were already in store for her. Her spirit chafed and rebelled at such freedom with her rights—despicable interference calculated to distress and wound a sensitive, delicate spirit. And now a heroic resolution imposed decorum, and upon the great pivot her whole arrangements were to turn. "Dieu et mon droit."
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  ON the morning of a day in September, that same summer of—, we found our heroine isolated on the coast, resolved to brave the storm. The dark eyes of Ymataca selected a rock beside the sea, on which she stood, her hair floating in the breeze, as she inhaled the fresh morning air, with ecstasy rhapsodizing on the heavy booming surf as it thumped against the rock on which she stood; anon watching a large ship that dashed onwards before a heavy gale of wind. The heavens were covering with black clouds, a storm quickly gathering: the little sea-birds came flying close to the breakers. And, her rich full notes echoed from a sort of cave, 
                        
                           "Oh could I be a bird
                           I know what bird I'd be,
                           An eagle 'on the mountain
                           Or ospray on the sea.'"
                        
                      We may judge from some remarks, our heroine belonged to an untamed race, and there she clung like a siren in her light airy garments, drenched by the rain and spray—wrapped in the majestic robe of thought, taking her observation and delighted with the tempest. Nor was she discouraged by the raging elements that strewed the sea with creamy foam. The dazzling lightning streamed from the blackened heavens; the pealing thunder roared along the surges. Her upturned eye seemed to dilate into silvery light—her clasped hands suggested profound feelings, the soul holding converse with the Creator of all things. Putting back her straying hair, as it fell over her forehead, she seemed to read the book of nature as it were an allegory. The world's busy voice had no music like the spreading gale swiftly rolling on that briny deep. Then passed a sunbeam, and lingered on her lonely bosom, answering her love and trustfulness borne to heaven. In solemn thought she yielded praise in glad but feeble accents, like the tender dove beneath the Almighty's wings. In order to elude the watchful eyes at the house, she gathered shells lying on the hard white beach, even snails' shells, and dropt them one by one into a basket. Then she seated herself on a moss-covered fragment of a jutting rock, glancing around to avoid suspicion. Ascertaining her groundless apprehensions, she manifested extravagant delight, then wandered away to the sea-birds' point, where she watched the bursting rollers; and paused to examine the profusion of interesting objects strewn along the reef from the tempest path.
                  With a clear voice she sang—
                     
                        
                           "Alone I walked the ocean strand;
                           A pearly shell was in my hand;
                           I stooped and wrote upon the sand
                           My name, the year, the day."
                        
                     
                  
                  She returned homeward, collecting the spiral fragments to keep for her herbal. Proud of her cargo, she arrived again at her rock, and smiled as she looked around her, saying, "It is lovely! What a nice place!" "I agree with you, Ymataca," replied a manly voice, overjoyed at his discovery and insight into her character. "Well, this bright, clear atmosphere makes a great difference since morning." He continued, "Your absence caused alarm; but here you are, free, you thought, from the trace and presence of man!" "Forgetful of everything, Mr. Oustan, in contemplating these beautiful treasures and my adventures." At that instant she made a leap and scampered to her rock beside the sea, which was sheltered by a clump of cedars. Ascending to the matted region by a wild path, obstructed by straggling branches, moss-covered water-logs, shells and gnarled ropes, old tar-buckets and tin pans, she turned to her companion and sprang again on her rock beside the sea, and thence surveyed the ocean and sky. Her companion was far behind, laughing at the swift-footed race. Scarce a moment, and he came fast running after her, exhilarated by the exertion, and equal to his fair chase he toiled up the rocky ridge.
                        
                           "'Will you walk into my parlour?'
                           Said the spider to the fly."
                        
                     
                  
                  That verse answered to her fair domain. Seated on her stone bench covered with moss—a rock carpeted with grasses and fern—flowers scattered thickly about—she drew the net closer as into her web he ventured, till all his attempts, if he cared to extricate himself from any such meshes, were hopeless. In silence they stood for some moments gazing on the landscape. "Nothing I've seen compares to this picture," turning to Ymataca. "What are you, a beautiful coral among sea-weed. so unconscious of care. On your sea-snatched isle I am transported, and in your hall of glee. Queen of mermaids, will you drop poison in man's cup?—a beautiful coral. No! Really I class you as my favourite flower, coloured as an elegant species of the creeping plant. Or are you a sea-shell changeable in colour? Yes, rose-lipped type of thy mantling cheek. Ah! Ymataca. Thou art a truant girl, and hast left thy playmates 'neath the beeches' shade. And that laughing eye of yours following visions where the sea boils in fury." 'Twas delightful to hear them on such occasions, he offering his handsome compliments, yet endeavouring to conceal his profound admiration dexterously. "You are a miscreant, Ymataca, always running away." "Yes," she responded. "Like a wild goose—like Mr. Bryant's water-fowl, continue my flight, but, sir, usually in a straight line. You think to tame me with common geese! 
                        
                           "'I seek the plashy brink
                           Where the rocky billows rise and sink
                           On the chafed ocean side!
                           There is a power whose care
                           Teaches my way along this pathless coast
                           Lone wandering, but not lost.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  Gayly she raised her head, colour came to her cheek, light flashed from her eye, as she stopped quoting. Disarmed by her manner, James Oustan was content with the result of his renewed impressions: "Incomprehensible! proud, very proud." Seating himself at her side on the tufted stone, they entered into confidential chat. The secret had been told him. "The broken engagement—announced." Disinterested advice, she thought, caused Mr. Oustan to recommend that she should not marry too young. At this discovery, she started, with confusion colouring her face; a full, indelible impression had been cast on his mind, and a very lengthy discussion arose between them. As he told her how cold-hearted her conduct had been towards Mr. Beverly, Ymataca burst into a gentle fit of laughter. "Why, Mr. Oustan," she exclaimed, "'twas only a little juvenile indiscretion," and she looked at him a moment with evident surprise. They continued sitting together for a short time longer, his eyes fixed on her face. A bitter smile stole over his features. His attitude expressed a train of cherished plans. If over this sea—of love—I must sail, I may suffer wreck; but, I will be wise early. "Then you decide to give up your hopes, Ymataca?" "Yes," was her reply. "Without having had any, I have said it was a juvenile indiscretion. I don't like thraldom." "Tell me if you discard that past, will you?" He stood leaning towards her; a sharp pang of jealousy mingled with the interest he felt. Eager to supplant, but not yet, he dropped on his knee by the stone terrace. Colour mantling his countenance, deep feeling lighted his large blue eye, and with affectionate admiration, he ventured to ask, if she meant ever to prepare for any thraldom. Bending towards her with a peculiarly dignified bearing, which spoke of resolution and veneration for a creature so rare, "Will you decide this point for me? Don't marry till you are older. Would you wait, and let me, Ymataca! dear girl, let me make you happy, if you will but promise not to marry yet: you are so very young." She was annoyed, and changed her position to another step. "I will never promise, Mr. Oustan," she answered, with a blush. She sallied forth, and in a few seconds heard his step as he advanced and led her to the bench again. He soon resumed his serene and kindly expression. With indescribable tenderness he gazed on her. He dared not kiss either her lips or hand, but raised her slender hand and pressed it in his own, asking if she was displeased, and if she would receive his intentions as devoted, and full of interest. "I perfectly understand you, Mr. Oustan; and I am not offended, for we were good friends. I think you take great pains to entertain me." Uttering a profusion of thanks and compliments, he courteously bowed, but his deep feeling of affection suggested concealment, so that he might bring other forces into the field, by aid of which he yet hoped to win. The important step was in advance now, and he meditated on the method best suited to her caprice. The warm-hearted Ymataca believed this a truce, and the brief affair passed away in the breath of an ocean wave. Listening to what they were saying, he resolved to pledge himself her friend, and proudly declared he would make up his mind to suffer if she commanded. For her wish should be his object to gratify. Listening to his voice and eloquence, meeting his clear, honest gaze, peace nestled there, and confidence grew up between them. His higher interest, higher hopes, higher admiration, all centred in the years she ought to wait. Mr. Oustan gave her a most rare rosebud, half open. She clasped it, at his request, 'neath an heirloom she wore—a jewelled pin taken from her mother's casket—as a first gift. Calling her greyhound, Nistan, and Plunge, the Newfoundland, with a leaping bound they were at her side, and thus they returned from their little voyage of discovery towards the house. Lights just twinkling welcomed them home. Rather tired, Ymataca accepted his arm, and he drew her forward with languid step. As they neared the house the maid met them with the announcement, "Tea is ready—ever so long, Miss Ymataca." Our rovers hurried on, and succeeded in getting as far as the steps leading from the bath-house to the terraced garden, and at last the dining-room door was entered. "My dear, where have you been?" anxiously inquired her father. "Only strolling for sea-weed, papa." "Yes, but too late: punctuality at meals is our household motto." No little point of etiquette ever disturbed Mr. Marlborough more than irregular attendance at meals. "I will make excuse for Miss Ymataca, sir," said Mr. Oustan, in his quiet way; "I bring good report of the errand you intrusted to me." "Here is a seat for you, Mr. Oustan," said Mr. M., rising and offering a chair at the side of his wife. Accepting his "at home privileges," James Oustan seated himself, and conversation flowed freely, in unsion with the tea and coffee boiling and singing in their respective urns. "Why, Ymataca," said Mr. Oustan, "it is half-past seven." "Well, I am tired, but such a day is worth some pain. Father, it was so very delightful." "Yes, Madame," said the path-finder, "I found her among the rocks." The other guests had passed from the tea-table into the parlour, and in a corner were spread thes beach gatherings—her frail cargo to be assorted and untangled for the herbal. The parlour was soon well filled, and as usual, with company. Among the late arrivals, the path-finder, Mr. Oustan, had come on a visit for a week, but staid over two. Now preparations were being made for a visit to Cape Hope Hotel. Mr. Oustan succeeded in seducing the family from Dove Cliff to the Hotel, thinking to please Miss Ymataca, who desired something new, even after a gay and exciting summer at home. The unspoiled darling of his heart fulfilled his most fastidious imaginings. Her straight-forward simplicity of character, so opposed to any worldly training, was fully tested in that hall of gayety and fashion. He was her daily attendant. She the exclusive object of his care—watching her jealously and riveting that strong chain of friendship. After a pleasant visit, the family left Dove Cliff, and the coast barren and bare, stripped of all ornaments but the grand battlement of Fort Ezile, which had contributed to the enjoyments of our friends; as their residence was so near to the fort that they could hear the tattoo and reveille. A regiment had just returned from the battles of Mexico, and she might have heard a distant report from the captive knight. But she was acquainted with none of the officers, as they arrived late. Fort associations accompanied summer reminiscences, and our heroine's memory was affectingly awakened. Soon those scenes closed upon them, and I chronicle their happy settlement in a new home. Not hotel life any longer, but a most charming residence on the avenue. 
                        
                           "There is joy in the castle, 'tis a banqueting night,
                           Sweet laughter rings through the brilliant hall;
                           Gather'd here are the noble, fair and young,
                           Gay music is heard, and songs are sung."
                        
                     
                  
                  During the long cold winter of '48, much transpired. The theatres all recommenced, literary institutions gave lectures, and a series of concerts advanced the campaign. Masquerades, elite soirées, dancing parties, all added to the gay carnival of city life. They now awaken from the long nights and cold days, and endeavour to rally for summer. It came again, with glad birds, gay flowers and balmy air; but to our friends the gay season closed most sadly. Melancholy gloom draped the gay mansion. Heavy tidings were telegraphed from the far South. The good man, the noble father, had yielded up life and all its solemn tasks, at the summons of a mysterious and righteous Providence. The afflictive and unexpected event occurred in the latter part of June. After a brief, but severe struggle, that fatal plague of '49 seized him.
                  The widow and fatherless were more than shocked by the blow of the Reaper. For, far away from his home and all that his heart held dear, he breathed his last. The Father of all gave kindest attentions to the dying stranger. At his hotel in Alabama, he died; having left the Crescent City impregnated with that fatal disease. 
                        
                           "Dear mother and sisters and brothers, oh say,
                           Can his memory ever depart?
                           Tho' the tomb where he sleepeth may moulder away,
                           He must always live in our hearts.
                           For his voice was so kind, and his eyes were so bright
                           With goodness warming his soul,
                           Oh his memory will beam with a lovelier light
                           The longer years over us roll."
                        
                     
                  
                  As the ministering angels waited for his spirit, around the death-bed came woman's mission of earthly care. It was a voice that touched the vital part ere it fled. In a solemn and peculiar hour, the brother and sister met. One, lost to all earthly ties, and who had been a distant resident of other lands, when here she came a traveller from distant parts again, and he was reunited to his idol sister; who had been thrice married. The first time, alienated from his father's home by a quarrel. She had lived in the South now thirty years, and not a token of any existence had ever been associated between them till now. Mrs. Venable was travelling to her home in Georgia, from a wealthy plantation in Kentucky, and as a traveller rested at the hotel; where she heard of a dying stranger. It is almost too solemn for this world to feel a touch so exquisite as that sister's hand. It was Ymataca! A brief and sad allusion to the loved ones at home closed the mournful career. 
                        
                           "'Twas midnight—
                           A darkness comes athwart his eyes;
                           To rend the veil in vain he tries;
                           His feeble efforts are, alas, in vain;
                           His strength is fled, to ne'er return again.
                           Then loudly ring, O minute bell;
                           Thou soundest but a stranger's knell."
                        
                     
                  
                  How wofully was every thing changed, in the once gay and happy residence. He was taken from their midst ere they could realize he was a prey to the disease, and cut off in the full strength of manhood. The event made a deep impression on the wide circle which he adorned with rare virtue and guileless heart. I sadly remember the dark night and sky so clouded that hung over the loved ones at home. The mother plunged into such profound grief, new responsibilities crushing on the widow and six fatherless children. Madame Marlborough, we conceive, was unfitted by nature to encounter the storms of adversity. She shrank from the blast. "If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small."—Proverbs.
                  It overpowered her senses. For weeks she was confined to her bed. What a change! All was sad work—the silence of that darkened chamber seemed to herald a desolation. Collected around the bed the sad group, all with their eyes bent on the venerable figure, so prostrate she lay upon the snowy cover. Minho, so pale, and thinner, exhibited her serene lustre of expression. Composed in manner, which bespoke superiority of soul. The sad spectacle which her idolized mother presented, imposed upon her anxious and affectionate heart the duties of a tender and vigilant nurse. In this deep sorrow, she had begun to humour all her mother's little whims, and to accommodate herself to every phasis of her mental malady. Alas! no religious faith beamed forth from that prayerless home. The altar of hopes had never been raised. Sorrowful faces watched with apprehensive eye, for she was scarce able to comfort her children. The kind and faithful type of heaven's protection came. The family physician, Lidale, came with peculiar and solemn words of cheer. Kind neighbours offered overwhelming blessings and service to the bereaved ones. The new neighbours—not their pastor—came in on hearing of the sorrow which closed those bright blinds and trailed the type of death from the door-knob. A venerable father of the holy church, Right Rev. Dr. Calcot, brightening his glory as the ministering servant of God, entered the darkened chamber. As he approached the grief-stricken ones, he said, in a deep clear voice—" Peace be to this house, and all that dwell in it," and then his towering form kneeled in prayer. This brief tribute from an unknown pastor, as the servant of God, might have raised almost the dead, had "Rachel" not refused to be comforted; even the chiming of those beautiful vespers ceased, and the matinal stopped fearing it might grate a knell on departed hopes. All comfort was of no avail; the hour of adversity appalled the weakly soul. The power of prayer was gone. God of the widow! be merciful. The chimes again muffled, a soothing tone in honour of the dead. On a distant shore they laid him to rest, where the tall dark pines sing requiems to his grave, and point to a lowly stone. The South's most noble son sleeps his last sleep in Montgomery, Alabama. Months had gone since the day alluded to: it was a calm autumn evening, in the early days of September; the sisters were standing together in the long broad recess of the parlour window, watching the setting of the sun. Alas, how changed now is this! what oppression, vague and indefinite apprehension. For soon they must return to the sunny South. A long melancholy journey, and reunion with friends and relatives. Alas, how changed! No place awaited their arrival, only a temporary shelter, quiet and inexpensive. This was a sudden glimpse—a vivid evidence it was of old and familiar scenes. Feelings gave way. Ymataca cried heartily, Miss Marlborough was calmly oppressed—Mal shed tears as she grasped her sister's hands, so painful the rehearsals of a future. The sun sank down to rest, and they retired from the window. The doors of the picture gallery were closed, and we enter the back parlour, where the sufferer sits in her great soft chair—her children are gathered together under her wings—the age of innocence grouped the players as before. The hour for bed is at hand, the little ones are off, the old familiar air is present, but the irrepressible sigh and rebellious tear. Her young daughters looked sad in their sable garments; yet theirs, at least Ymataca's, was the sadness of a spring morning. The clouds and sunshine of her nature, so happily blended together, would not give up the temper of that sky. Ymataca and Mal were at an age which needed much the mother's care and direction. Minho was the tender watcher, and became the mother's daily counsel. He who had watched her from girlhood, as grown up under his eye, now became the centre and stay of a circle of confiding hearts. The father, brother and friend all combined in Mr. Oustan to win the affectionate recognition of his character, which shone from an unselfish heart. His unassuming traits were expressly adapted by intelligence to aid such a cause. The ardent desire of his heart was that which contemplated the happiness of parent and sisters, in the saddened home; need I say, all that love on his part was amply repaid on theirs, as a brother and son fondly cherished. From the hour those heavy tidings came, Mr. Oustan was earliest at the grave of buried hopes. After the mightiness of the blow had fallen, like an iceberg on a precipice, the thunder-bolt came, loss of fortune! its echo, and we pause a moment—and of friends. Charity, our family were shielded from the shafts of such heart-sickening words; we only know that it was finely pictured in beautiful and holy examples to the Marlboroughs. But "Rachel would not be comforted." 
                        "Clear waters reveal secrets."
                     
                  
                  Over a table, a little way off in the chamber of Marlborough-house, our heroine leaned, pale and agitated; before her was a letter from Don Ticethorpe. Over his dearest hopes she had thrown a pall, having created his paradise around her, long years ere she left him in Virginia. The separation had grown into dark despair. His strength and courage yielded to misery as he gave her up. And his parting words were: "My dial has set ten degrees back." These cousins had become attached under the shade of a broad-breasted oak at his father's plantation, while she read in his fair countenance the sentiment that stirred in his large blue eyes, living on the power of her influence. Tenderly she reminded him of the years they had passed in sweet communion, and told him she would ever share his happiness and feel grateful for the preference he had shown for her. Their intimacy of sisters' children should be always entitled to that. "Nothing more, my first cousin," she would say, and anticipated no evil consequences. The lucifer-match Don had laughed scornfully upon her one evening just before she left their haunts of childhood. "My first cousin," he repeated, "I am resolved to exert my power to part the cousin you wait for, and will, I assure you, alter that idea." With dignity she replied: "My first cousin, I am convinced fully of your good-will and desire to do as you say," and turned away, uttering these words: "It is, Sir Don, high-flown impudence on your part. I'm o'er young to marry yet."
                  Such recollections as those of that last evening in their haunt of childhood brought back the scene vividly to her mind, as he persisted in the renewal of his suit. He taxed his memory to recall every word of her enthusiasm for the second cousin. Two years had nearly gone. Hark the echo, in its lamenting, lonely strain, bearing these lines: "Ymataca, remember, you have signed my death-warrant; as coldly, too, as Queen Elizabeth, her blot-stained mandate for poor Mary. Fare thee well, thou vase of splendour. You know my heart is breaking, and, like a statue, am powerless to speak.
                        
                           "Nor need I write: to tell the tale
                           My pen were doubly weak,
                           For what can idle words avail
                           Unless the heart could speak."
                        
                     
                  
                  "I change but in death," wrote the trace of his pen in this reply to her letter written to ask Don, "if the second cousin had returned to her birthplace, to seek him, and demand back her ring." A singular topic to invite his attention, for he struck the blow when a short time ago, he; by letter, coldly informed her that the second cousin was in Richmond, from the wars, wounded, but covered with glory. "She might," he said, "wear the willow, for Granville Rutland had ceased to know her name." The cousin she waited for, was engaged and on the eve of marriage to a fairer belle, an heiress, not his first cousin. "Your noble cousin officer, now promoted colonel, smiled scornfully at your name. The ring is gone. It is no longer worn. Heigh ho! poor, wounded creature! captive birdling! You are free. Forget him, Ymataca. He feels no obligation binding him. He seemed amused at my interference. Nothing to him. He is engaged to another. Enough. 'I change but in death.' Ymataca, you have not gained your victory; will it mar or wound your peace forever when you are told that he is flirting and to be married? I say, so ends your romance." Poor heroine. She crushed the letter in her pocket with the hidden secret. A deep blush overspread her features at having intrusted and revealed to Don the ideal of her soul. Even then Grita did not distrust Granville. She was incapable of casting dishonour on his gallantry. Colonel Rutland, we are told, abused her confidence. He had resumed his march from Florida to the Mexican campaigns, and the papers bore testimony to his gallantry in the sabre and bayonet battle of Resaca de la Palma. Most distinguished among the aids of General Taylor, throughout all the brilliant victories, our hero's rise was rapid. Fighting well in the battles of El Molino del Rey, he received honours, and was appointed captain. The intrepid officer entered sword in hand, and displayed his enthusiastic patriotism in gallant combat at the fire of Chepultepec, and won his promotion as brevet-major. And fresh laurels in the capture of the city of Mexico, where he received the distinguished notice of General Winfield Scott. Now to Grita, the expressive dark-eyed one, why not have narrated to her the simple truth of his story? From the roar of artillery, the lurid glare of torches, and all the crimson horrors of war, Colonel Rutland infringed his honour in regard to her. Both will carry this trial to their graves. We hear his first inquiry, on his return to Arthur Seat, was about Grita. Some but slightly known to her, yet, of course, well-informed of her affairs, slandered her with their festering tongues, and gave confused reports, diminishing her worth to her lover. His own jealous thoughts added to gossip's talk. He said, he cared not a rush what others said; if she loved him, she would have loved him the more for every tale that belied him. Enough to know, even from gossip, that she loved others. "You are entangled, Grita, and deceive yourself. A belle, a heartless flirt of sixteen summers. A foot-ball for every man you meet." This his language and surmise, and into that train of reflection his mind passed. Unjust indifference, to say the least—unkind, to say nothing of the importance which came from such dereliction. "Ah, Granville!" was her plaintive sigh. "Enough to know if you loved me, you would love me spight every tale that wronged me. Fables dressed to malign my truth, my character, is poison dropped into your ear by rivals." It echoed distinctly on her heart. Could Granville be false? For years his name had been forbidden in her family. They told her not to love him. That he was black at heart, and would not, did not regard the compact. But she believed them not—a matter of scandal her young innocent heart knew not how to comprehend. With the least apprehension of having done aught to merit his ungenerous treatment—ungenerous, indeed, thus to discard one so young and lovely without an explanation—ungenerous to expose her to the slights and sneers of a heartless world on mere scandal. High-minded herself, she had no suspicion of deceit. As purely unconscious scious of a wish as a child might be, she was indifferent to gain an end by a selfish act. There, at her shrine, he should have refuted all calumnies against the only woman he loved. She was left to grow untended by his care. Her training up was under conditions over which, as child, girl, and woman, she appeared to have no control. Good seemed to predominate over her indiscretions. Such a formal resignation subjected her to a bitter reflection. Having finished the unpleasing correspondence, she resolved to consult none other, until she was angered again by receiving a letter from Don, sent from Rio Janeiro and South America. "Ymataca, the wound has cankered. I roam about the world without an object—anguish written on my brow. How I loved you, Ymataca! It has killed and deadened my life. Stagnation will soon rot the vitals. Tears are now rolling down the haggard face of your youthful companion. As one too dear to love, I'll think of but to bless. A voyage of long months has brought me to Brazil, and the letter, on coast cruise, is written while our ship is anchored in the beautiful bay of Rio. From its hull-shaped side go forth the last tidings, and all trace of Don." She sat for minutes absorbed in her own feelings. The dark brown hair was tucked loosely behind her ear. The breath of that moment consigned her destiny to fates. In '49 our hero's triumphal cortege swept through the streets of his old city, amid the rejoicings of friends. Colonel Rutland rode along slowly into the city, his attendants by his side. He was mounted on his battle-horse—an animal that seemed moulded from his coal pits, noble and sleek. He was covered with gay trappings, and the splendid beast stepped to the notes of enchanting music. Believing it the sound of the trumpet. Ha! ha! and smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of his captain shouting. In answer to the bugle and the peal of the drum, he tossed high his head, his mouth embossed with foam, snorting, and stamped in defiance of brandishing swords. Regardless too of his rider's rein, that keen, wild eye never rested a moment—fixed as if ever seeking danger to oppose. The warrior Rutland spurred down his fiery charge. The soldier was finely developed. The dress of Colonel Rutland was the rich military mantle, scarlet and white, with blue borderings emblazoned with gold. The ornament of his casquette, a single white plume. Appearing with his retinue, he exhibited marks of attachment to the grateful crowd who gave tribute to the brave. With firm grasp held his drawn sword, and applause greeted his entry. It produced imposing effect. An air of openness and graceful courtesy gave back the old impression. The eye, brow and lip indicated a sense of personal importance. The eye flashed habit of command, decision, and a haughty vindictive temper. But his countenance gave another colouring—a summer cloud to pass away, leaving a smiling influence, which made favourable impressions among his people. Here introducing, on its occasion, a topic of deepest influence on his character and actions, as well as important subject of his life. Arriving at an early hour at Hanover Lodge, he entered the apartment and decorated hall, fitted up with emblematic marks of honour and achievement. Three friends rendered the reception of the people, while he was conducted to an honoured seat. He took his place in a chair covered with scarlet velvet. The soldier reflected lustre upon the large assembly to whom he felt deeply grateful, as he raised his eyes to the splendid devices which, too, ancestors had borne in the field of glory. On its azure surface the pointed brilliants of a Star Spangled Banner was raised, with its appropriate motto, "E Pluribus Unum," blending, in its effect, gleaming sunlight. The first proceeding of the thronged company was directed in the name of the people, to present the "Sword of State," as symbol of attachment, fidelity, and reliance on his arm of victory—gift of his soilsmen. 
                        "Pro bono publico."
                     
                  
                  His extraordinary abilities, which had shone through his young life, seemed on this occasion to shine out with increased value. Amid the imposing assembly and natural excitement of first meeting, he rose to receive the trophy, "gift of his soilsmen." "His name, the year, the day." Amid deafening shouts of joy, flowing from a reservoir of feeling, he looked on it with affectionate interest, till breathless attention was fixed on him; immediately assuming the prepossessing calm of the scholar and soldier. Colonel Rutland gave way to strong emotions. The impressions which his enchantress had made on his mind from their "first meeting," had grown stronger on the battle field; so that at that moment of golden opinion won, a mysterious link drew its influence of honours won to her feet. Promoted by her great influence, his illimitable overflow of eloquence and spirits was translating the feelings of his people into his own, and which could not fail to produce a deep and general sensation. Acknowledging, by kind allusion, the power of his sword of state, and the effect of this extemporaneous speech, augmented the circumstances attending—with a profound bow retired amid deafening applause. These first salutations over, he passed into the brilliant and grand banqueting hall. In justice to the fair mistress of his heart, her form, her image had lived in his dreams all the time of his absence; and yet the gorgeous trophies of his fame were hidden from her eyes, as if its glare of pageantry would have unstrung her soft heart to worship mortal. Only visions of his nobleness were granted her in memory. A paper she never read; whether from dislike or eccentricity, I do not assert; it was so. We note her neither a gossiping child nor female politician; nothing of the hybrid offended the symmetry of inner life nor outward peculiarities. So "the army list" was not a studied part; or perhaps by chance or destiny, that same power that drew his footsteps across and near her path, only—to pass on—to meet the terminus, "five years,"—believe it, reader, that same power kept her from seeking knowledge now of one who, to all appearances, had forgotten her, overclouded with correction by Madame Marlborough for her unblushing daring, in the letter from Don. The letter had been read by the unsympathizing parent, who had positively forbidden the subject under penalty of coercion, and commanded that his name should go unmentioned forever—entirely a vagabond. "His compact as nonsensical as himself. Never, I command, breathe his name to a living soul. Let your motives dwell on a higher, better fancy."
                  The recollection of such days with that mother, was ever a rankle; and then she cried, "Oh do, dear mother, permit me to cherish his hope, and mine! It does live: he remembered and wore my ring five years. He may come." Enraged with her unmaidenly impudence, her mother threatened vengeance, if such matters advanced a step. It was silenced forever. There his name was never heard. Uniting her scrupulous rectitude with a task to her elevated feelings, a pang attended Granville's memory. She was long trying to forget. The price of experience—destiny's discipline. So the juvenile teacher of self, Grita had to appreciate her own responsibility. For Granville deigned no correspondence with his ideal's "test of woman." The unreasonable type of humanity was pronounced positively strange—a wild object, "not flower" untamable, belonging to an early period of society, her own stamp. Tinctured by stupid nonsense, a simpleton void of understanding. But, clothing her mental faculties in a radiance under her own tuition, she marched on the field of life, ready to conquer. Her ungoverned will and easily aroused nature dwelt on her wrongs. Apparently satisfied with being learned, she ceased not, however, to yearn restlessly for a congenial spirit and mind to strengthen her own. Successfully combating by conflicts, Ymataca Marlborough entered largely into society now; unaware of her advantage. Independent both in character and manner, she was admirably polished for her sphere. Without flattery to her marked career, modesty soft and blushing acknowledged her key-note of virtue. So independent to opinion, so indifferent to applause—crushed at home with awkward restraint; blamed, chilled, and angered to an irritated, torturing feeling, pride scorched by imputations became intolerable. The collision with her fiery spirit was a fit instrument to ruin, to excite to deliberate disobedience. It was incendiarism. Books opened sources of delight, increasing too with intercourse, which was an aid; too young and inexperienced to observe her deficiences, too great her flow of natural spirit to be cast down. At this epoch of my story, I have surely satisfied our heroine's well-wishers of all antecedents to the illustrious and beautiful accomplishment known, as to be revelation, or great depth of clear waters drown the unprovoked enemies, who should not have entire advantage over fair reputation. A chief reputation hangs on the tale just here, ere leaving the glimpse of our hero's feats, and complaints of the lover; we must now trace our hero's progress on both fields pursued by Mars, whom he conquered, and followed by Cupid. Even from the banqueting hall, and its interesting occasion, to the walls of Arthur Seat, in the Heart of Midlothian. In his heritage he reached the embrace of peace, in the arms of an idolizing mother. The days of dread, and nights of anxiety, with its hoarse farewell, are silenced, forgotten. Amid repose won, the blessings and tears fell for joy upon the noble chief, as he was met at the door of his heritage by his widowed mother. With much ceremony and reverence she heartily grasped his distinguished hand, kissing both sides of his face—"My son! my son, God bless you!"
                  There, too, indulging his temper and character like a child among his toys, "chewing the cud of scenes" with a younger and only brother, Baron Rutland. His servants, the faithful sables, flock around their young "marster" joyous, and reverent to excess, flinging garlands and flowers profusely at his feet. The beloved mother watched the injured limb. Away from the hospital surgeon, the new practice of his good Ellen was applied advantageously; and Turp, his body servant through every battle attack, was fondly devoted at his master's side. Disease and war had so emaciated his form, that blindness almost occurred. Although not yet recovered from writhing wounds, his feverish sleep and exhaustion were abated. To the scenes of his sylvan camp he owed his recovery of strength and health. In the home of his lordly domains he passed the greater part of his time. The quaint old mansion was the birthplace of his grandfather, the illustrious Jefferson; and received its moral interest as a residence of a family who ranked in the Old World among the ancient peerage, and in the shade of private life had settled around these baronial estates in the New World. Colonel Granville Rutland was the lineal and undisputed representative of the Rutland family. The experienced sportsman traversed the thickets of the well-wooded domain and cultivated lands, arranging in sort of battle array his army of animals. The main body of dogs, following lowing the chase over the highlands, would induce their master to hunt with them, and bivouac among the laurels and flowery meadows. Summer was passing thus; so, whiling away cares of life, if forgotten in the drawing-room, his fond resort with companionable women, he was always caught in the sweet spirit of their soothing influence; the atmosphere of their beauty won his admiration and respect. He was one who revelled in and highly valued female character in its purest reflection. So that he signalized his fancy among the belles of Midlothian, a gallantry more zealous and natural, after the life deprived of her high influence. The Rutlands exceeded the usual hospitality by sumptuous entertainments. And now the chances for the hand of Colonel Rutland were freely discussed, as it were a prize in a lottery. The ticket-venders from fashion's circle risked the inbred calculations, and coolly appropriated "a chance" for our hero! This curious bargaining for husband, on the part of father not less often than the mother, destroys the character. The old maiden relatives sharpened their wits' end to run the gauntlet for the prize, forgetting to blush at the monstrosity of sovereign fashion. Our hero left their captive queens hanging—suspended—and they halting between two opinions; those colourless jewels were left by Colonel Rutland petrifying the frame of worthless woman, their counterfeit charms a Judas kiss; and next behind the second act, the play-house of slander, dissolving another deed into their cup, creep stealthily forward, towards our object; fulfilling their professional engagements, spread calumny by the way, electrifying their atmosphere with the first pangs of jealousy. Those were the evil spirits pouring venom on "her fair name." We can easily imagine that one so peculiarly fitted to charm and fascinate, accustomed to the compliments and etiquette of fashionable life, in hotels, at balls, and receptions, at the gay capital of his country, had charming daughters thrown in his way. These poison arrows from the God of Love never strike such men as Colonel Rutland. The husband-hunting girls were soon found out, and his own good management in time turned his admiration to account. Grita was only sixteen then, and now seventeen. There was no haste, notwithstanding that hazel eye shone yet like a sunbeam in his very soul. Our male coquette, though not as injurious as might be expected, is a dangerous character. The amusement is ever dearly bought, besides its cruelty, from which some of the most melancholy tragedies that have ever taken place have arisen. Such levity of character implies want of principle, indulging of vanity and risking happiness forever. Subjected to ridicule and disappointment—as these unprincipled propensities were discussed on each side with freedom. Thus lightly their conduct was regarded, as that of heartless men and women.
                  The Goddess of Justice and Truth particularly adapts her system to square measure—Troy weight; and her scales give down the grain to her wheel of fortune—not misfated. Granville Rutland was not the man to risk his happiness to the keeping of a known flirt. The fair test of such a flaw would have been examination. The "hand belle" was a golden wire, with a jewel called the pearl of great price. I must proceed with his history, as the "character of a man or woman is as much of value, if not more, than gold or silver. It is more lasting and durable." In the mean time, know that our heroine is no flirt. If Granville indulged his fancies, most natural, "on leave," he would play knight again. Old props staked new claims, transforming his nobler zeal and real worth into their gold-dust of general opinion, which assigned him to the fair belles, Flora, and another McFlimsy, before the old love was cold; for absence had not conquered! Grita was hardly aware of her possessions furthering the trifling affair, which will prove by scales of Truth and Justice to be a most serious one. She was totally ignorant, in the interval, of his sentiments. Only around her pillow would visions come. A little pain mingled with that pleasure. "Is he married, or does he love another?" She felt her imperfections keenly; yet misgiving, as before, seemed all the more agreeable, for it sounded like the whisper of hope; yet, contriving her best, the disappointment ended with a sigh.
                  I must record, in justice to Granville, the accustomed uniformity of his character; for he was a person to make happy a nature like Grita's, which corresponded with his own, notwithstanding the harsh discussions of contending claims. Softly—softly now the magic influence stole over his military honours, swept along, as it had the tented field, by a flood of thought. Those solitary days and haunted nights, escaping from the vortex of fashion at the Federal capital, the officer again sought the rural pleasures of his sylvan camp; again, in his own chosen chamber—the reserved apartment, closed as he left it, and watched over by his dear mother, and kept in the brightest order by his favourite housemaid, Ellen—a slave. She was proud of her young "Marster" Granville, as if he reigned king over the globe, having watched his infant hours in that very chamber. One stormy night Granville retired early to his room. Unbuckling his broad sword and throwing it down on his bed, he exclaimed: "With this hand, on which there rested a circlet, I raised that sword, on certain occasions, in the hour of victory. Will she ever share my triumphs?" The very veins on his broad brow swelled with the agitation of his heart whilst dwelling on her image. The child he had fostered had grown to womanhood. And, "Scarcely yet," he thought; "there is time enough. They say she is beautiful. I hear she is very fair. The eloquence of those hazels and winning variety of expressions give delicate finish to Grita's charms. 'The smile'—that smile—yes, I see her still. Ideal of my boyhood! Yes, there she is, unspeakably beloved. How radiant that smile. In our parting hour, I said, 'Be faithful; I will return again.' She was too young—too inexperienced to estimate the full depth of love. My Grita of old, I see her still' under the Lindens,'—a slight young creature; a voice sweet and clear as that robin: 
                        
                           "'Then while my every thought and dream
                           Is centred still on thee,
                           Oh, hast thou not one tender thought
                           To lavish, love, on me?
                        
                        
                           And oft at midnight's solemn hour
                           In waking dreams I start,
                           To find thee but a fancy flower,
                           Still idol of my heart.'
                        
                     
                  
                  "Under the Lindens, 'five years ago,' and here she speaks in the song of the birds, chattering and ringing her silvery laugh from under that old tree, the linden. Mid the cannon's roar, I remembered her. Around the camp-fire in the bivouac, me-thought of the dark-eyed one. In the trumpet's clang, I heard the silvery laugh of her sweet voice, fresh as an April morn—a bugle-note inspired-notes of her—a talismanic touch to go to battle, and forth to meet the armed men. That type of her jewelled hand charged on to victory, never paused, never wearied in its steady, equal grasp, the flash of its lustre answering to the electric shock, the magic of her power. What is Mine, that kiss! that ring! that image contributed essentially to victory. "The restive man sat in his favourite window seat, shaded by catalpa boughs, gathering treasures from afar, inhaling pleasures and fragrance from the profusion of flowering climbers that stole around the rustic pillars and crept on artificial mounds. Groups of orange trees, and lemons grafted, lent their perfume to add richness of contrast to the Cape jasmine fastening its sprays under his quaint-shaped windows. Resting carelessly on the arch of gray stone, his figure stirred again, and he turned his face from the transparent curtains. A defiant gleam fixed full on his countenance, kindling his eye and burning his cheek. Suddenly his proud air of self-importance, yet withal unassuming, flourished about that room, thrusting his fingers through a profusion of light hair, laid back the waves of care. He stopped in silent wonder, as a light flashed like electric swiftness athwart his face, exclaiming—"Ah! well! never mind the ring! Oh, no! She deigns to remember me," stretching himself out at full length, and closing his eyes. "But, I will show her that I am not grateful for the leave takings of a heart. Chips 'of my block.' No proud beauty, with hosts of supplicating wooers, I will not receive such mock memories." This unrestrained suspicion gnawing at his bosom, jealousy's green coil, cold and icy, curled into iron links, but that queen of love haunted the shade trees of Arthur Seat. Again, he stammered forth reveries: "Yes, Grita, let me remember the agony of my dying hour: my hovering angel filled a glass with mysterious cordial—the elixir of life—and her dark eyes unloosed the icy chain on that foreign land, and embraced the strength of flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone, to cherish hope. And here, the hospital patient is hers in every thought and memory. She triumphs yet. I am still alone. Alas! if captivated for a moment, it was by something that reminded me of my Grita; and so must this be? Ah, Grita! child love! remember the promise." 
                        
                           "But on—still onward speeds the rolling year;
                           The Spring's glad childhood, Summer's glorious prime
                           Fade into Autumn while we garner here
                           Triumphantly, 'these gifts,' for future time.
                        
                        
                           "His woods grow gorgeous in decay's first stage,
                           But gone are singing birds, and clustering roses,
                           While calm and tranquil, like time-honour'd age,
                           The weary Autumn on his hills reposes."
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  Looking back from that time of churchyard gloom, the green mound of his last, long home, nature's book of life laid open, and the Marlboroughs boroughs were introduced in the training-school of affliction, and lessons learnt nowhere else found. The grave scarce closed over Mr. Marlborough when information was handed to the grief-stricken widow, that his affairs were in an irretrievable, hopeless condition. Such news would have been bad enough in the sunshine of health and strength. In this storm it was a deluge. The late lamented father, before he died, struggled hard to stem adverse fortune. Death struck its seal on the memory of the ruined merchant, and the bankrupt's sale was the saddest thing. Private debts penetrated the household miseries of the widow and fatherless, but unblemished honour to his name. Alas! alas! life's changes. The bitterness of want, fragments of their golden age, were drifting on the wreck of her wealth. Unaccustomed to struggle with angry waves, from the visible fairyland of luxuries, they passed into the stern land of fate. Madame Marlborough's determination to return to the South was fully planned: not knowing where or how to find a home, she glanced at the past, and still had no power to brave the torrent of the future. But, cease repining, O foolish creature; knowest thou not thy God?
                  Minho Marlborough, the child of proud ancestry, nursed in the lap of fortune, and caressed by devoted ties, could plan no schemes; worn and weary, her cheek, always delicate, was now dull and white. Her massy hair, parted its brown tresses from her brow, was all but concealed by by the widow's cap. A painful look of care in the dim eye harmonized with the deep black dress. Madame Marlborough, we shall see, was one of those women whom no force of circumstance could teach self-dependence, or command. Having in her life of affluence looked entirely to her husband for guidance, in the strong wrench the mind so finished and formed by cultivated education sank to vacillation, and now she looked to the daughter, changing places. The passive, grief-stricken parent was guided by the duteous daughter, Minho, who fulfilled that holy duty, watching her mother's feeble age. She arranged everything, argued, and consulted in all things. Implicitly she yielded, without acting for herself. The maternal and filial bond blended in one heart. Every grief, every joy found rest in her bosom, honour and obedience of Minho.
                  The time of departure was fixed for an early day in September: the day was at hand. A trying duty to perform the long melancholy journey. For weeks before they were to leave, every preparation was made for comfort. Plans were arranged, regardful of the small stipend. Here comes a pleasure with pain; the consultation and free gifts of Mr. Oustan, which accorded so well with his great, kind heart, deadened a pang and more, crowned with kind feeling and generous friendship. He presided over these grim scenes of seclusion. In the farewell of its back parlour, he had fostered sentiment. A bright romance around the bright-eyed "half nun" yes, dreaming of wooing and wedding. Together with his intensified devotion to her all unconscious of it. For on the cliff, remember, Ymataca Marlborough had rejected his suit. James Oustan approached with holy care to her hushed and guarded temple. Enrolling his name a living chaplet, no mere pretender to the royal chain, friendship! but a friend in need, the friend indeed. He knew he was absorbed in all the interest of the secluded inmates of, secluded care. Here pause—pause reader, and listen! He had been aroused by sympathy, to the sweetness of her serene face. Minho he learned to admire, and attend in Ymataca's absence at school—first the sister's charming friendship, nothing more, nurturing tender joys, and in the winning grace and mirth of the second sister. Minho knew, though she scarce acknowledged to herself the pale mists of that gilded intercourse, of the morning visits of that guest at the Cliff; while devoting herself to this only parent, she learned to love, and dared the conflict of interest for more than brother. She had given him love, and that sacred love was woman's all. Yet conscious of its pain stealing into her heart, pale with joyless sorrow, while filling its memory with self-martyrdom; her pure soul clung in its labyrinth to his proud esteem and warm admiration. Thoughts again, like a rock-riven wave, and in horror, she rooted the misplaced yearning—burning tears lifted the unwooed veil. Then she trampled the root of bitterness from the garden of its bloom, and calmly met the after growth. I will not do Mr. Oustan the injustice to believe he hopelessly, silent or spoken, deceived the elder sister (four years older than Ymataca). She deceived herself unfortunately. At this hour, thoughts of parting came like the sting of death. James Oustan never saw, we are assured, or felt her love. Minho Marlborough asked herself the question, if such a cruel taint had ever lived in a heart so noble, so brave, so royal in honour; rarely such distinction of purity lived in the heart of man. Having put my hand to this plough, I must not turn aside, right or left: Justice goes straight on, as the inward voice impels; and He who seeth in secret will guide me. All its circumstances will reflect the nature of its soul. Faith translates death into immortality, and the silent beating of her heart folded around her like a shroud. "He will marry another, he will marry, he will leave me as brothers leave sisters. "Conscious poor Minho was of his happiness created in one he loved too well; it aroused sympathy, and envy, riveted to the inexplicable influence of that careless nature whose haughty ignorance was dawning in the erring Ymataca. "My sister," gasped the hopeless Minho—" I will not doubt him or his true regard for us all, the friend indeed. 'But, who shall school the heart's affections, who shall banish its regret?'" With poor Minho, life became sweet in faithful watching the feeble health of her widowed mother. I cannot say if its bitter associations were compensated as most sorrows grow dim filled with holy interest. The great trial was almost unseen: fervently loved by her mother and admiring friends, she may not suffer now, but a sadness crept over her youthful beauties. It happens, too, the intervening days before departure, they met oftener, but her health was failing, and her cheerful spirits broken with the mournful struggle. The evening before the last, the mother and daughter were alone in the secluded parlour, hands clasped and chairs linked arms. Minho chafed the mother's bended fingers, as ghosts of the past clustered around the worn ring on the left hand, scarce withered, still delicate and tender. Thoughts rested on the circuitous route; in deep pity, they sighed, together sighed, "To-morrow, if it comes?" They listened for the almost daily footsteps, when they all spent evenings together: it grew late, after tea, as his welcome ring was announced by the servant. With courtly grace he entered that room—showing reverence for the sad mother, and sincere admiration for the noble-hearted woman, minho. Reaching his home, as he called it, he sat down to enable her to recover her strength, and think over the best plans for the family comforts. How sadly he regretted they were going home—away—how he should miss their society! His frank, affectionate smile fell on Minho like a sunbeam. A thought broke that happy spell, and she felt only his kindness. Always glad to talk with the noble friend, clouds passed away, and during the evening he planned the farewell meeting. "My good friend," (to Madame,) "I have some important matters to arrange," said Mr. Oustan, with most affectionate observance, which revealed a secret. The examination was accomplished; when later in the evening, the bell rang, as the servant ushered Mr. and Mrs. Calby in the back parlour. The cousins by appointment met the friend to negotiate the propriety of contributing comfort, and to relieve Madame Marlborough's care on her return and during the long journey; enlisting their service in favour of a visit to the house of Mrs. Calby. This new affair resulted from private consultations, held in business hours at commission offices; Mr. Oustan conferring the opinion of relationship to the firm perseverance of the cousin's powers, to reconcile the idea of taking care of the two young daughters, under his roof. And this to come will soon set the reader's mind at rest, concerning the incidents referred to in the last few pages.
                  "A constant stream of love that knows no fall." As Mr. Oustan often found it necessary to walk home with Mr. Calby, he contentedly deepened his fate, by threading the history of Ymataca Marlborough, full of dear ties. His whole aim and desire was to promote the happiness of all connected with his love. Her fate seemed plain before him—the following responsibility, a precious charge, and under his guidance to frame his sole wish. "Beautiful, beloved child of Destiny!" This momentous crisis was to stir within her heart a responsive chord. And, many times during that evening he derived a thrill of unutterable courage for hope, from the lovely and kind Mrs. Calby, the accomplished beauty from Richmond. Mrs. Calby sat down in the circle to talk over the departure. Tempered with feeling and affection, such unobtrusive sympathy. The Calbys felt a warm interest in the mournful change, and persuaded Madame Marlborough to allow Ymataca and Mal to spend some weeks or months at their house as best for their happiness, and inviting it as relief to the sorrow-stricken orphans. In quietness, they should enjoy their pleasure. "Certainly, they must come? How could she part with them? It is best for all," said the son of affliction. Half suspecting him of originating this plan; as well as the amiable disposition and highly cultivated mind of this branch of her illustrious family. A man who was ever contributing his benevolence and adopting sorrows as his own. Pleased with these series of contemplations, Mr. Calby contributed to his wife's appeal—filling his prominent place in society with ability. We must esteem them fit emblems of goodness to execute the ministering part of consolation. Mr. Oustan's victory of appropriating his protégées, as a grand charge engaged the whole evening; filling the office of spokesman, Mr. Calby, in justice to the acquired property, invited Mr. Oustan's active service, and allured by prospects of gain, he eagerly assented. "Convicted on evidence." Mrs. Calby, touched by his kindness, bent down and kissed the cheek of sad Mal, took her hand with a tender compassion, saying, they must come? "Ness, what can I say to you or Tinto, for this amazing kindness? Is it best they should go, and leave me? Ah, this bitter change in recollection," she added mournfully, and wept bitterly. "I know in whom I trust my fatherless, take them. Children, be faithful to your promise, be thankful for so much, from such great and noble friends." So were those two blushing maidens intrusted most fortunately to wise counsellors and friends, elevated by benevolence. Mrs. Calby tried with her womanly kindness to disperse the sorrowful cloud with words of cheer. She united those qualities calculated to endear all; and placing his dignity in its true situation, this plan was decided upon. Ymataca's entreaties having no small influence in turning the scale. "The next morning certainly," rushed back in smiling words upon the orphans, as if from heaven the cousins came. As they went off, Ymataca looked up with a new face, conscious of delightful times, away from the gloom she could not understand. How, in after life, will she follow such procession? Ah, indeed, she knew nothing of the world, and cared less. The enthusiastic defender of her rights attained the consent he wished for, and to his care she was committed. Laid, as it were, on the foundation of his pledge. he promised with assistance to protect and advise his orphan protégées.
                  The next morning came, all things settled—then came the final parting forever, from their late union of a household in which the little family had lived together so long. Madame Marlborough's voice faltered as her tears fell. To-morrow has come. Adieu was spoken, and that family parted forever from their prayerless home.
                  That day the carriage conveyed the Misses Marlborough to a rich and neat dwelling on a commodious avenue. They were duly received with tender and hearty welcome, and appropriated a charming room, with white draperies and beautiful furniture. Every luxury, every comfort was theirs, besides the rich ornament of the cousins' society. They grouped around the evening board, seated beside the distinguished heads. The family, consisting of themselves, a beautiful boy—"Our baby Pet," as he was called—and Mrs. Calby's sister, Mary of Argyle, as she was called more intimately. She was a rich Scottish beauty, with full soft eye and snowy complexion, with a tincture of rose on her round cheeks. She was lovely, and kind to the orphan girls. Another of their family, Mr. Calby's bachelor uncle, who became most friendly to our heroine. As he was a man of strange qualities, it was considered a feat. Another valued member of that household was a splendid French boy, not far from the Pyrenees. He came to reside with Mr. Calby. A most handsome type of French manliness, he soon became a friend and favourite of Ymataca: his great bright-black eyes, his red rosy lips, and rich pink, bronzed complexion, with jet locks waving on a low brow, gave tone to the expression of his finely cut features and best of hearts. A general favourite was the young Ivray Leronde. Within a few days the orphans were much better in spirits. Peace smiled on the happy family in that drawing-room. The sun shone bright for everybody. Sometimes in the evenings, cousin Tinto stole aside and napped it, on an antique divan, that invited his sleepy fancies at that hour. His wife presided then and seemed to enjoy all, and enter in all pleasures within her restricted bound of mother and wife; giving her example as a preserved lesson, to those rising around in the sphere of woman. Her superiority and lovely qualities added lustre to those household attractions. Of mixed Scotch and Southern origin, she finely represented the beauty and learning of her types. Meanwhile their circle increased, large and more social, the essence of all pleasures, which refined and kept up the utmost enjoyment. Sometimes they sang together and read aloud the literati. External objects, of course, were watched. Opposite to their house rose the gray walls and towers of a sort of pantheon. Enclosed in a handsome square; on the right a bold spire of the vast architecture was of special interest to our ladies on moonlit nights. The rays, glimmering, cast shadows before them. The chaste model was an imposing fabric of architecture, which was a pointed object on this broad avenue, with its continuations of stately mansions of the princely merchants. Again, in early maidenhood, Ymataca was before the curtain, into society and society-beaux, neither good nor bad, floating upon the stream of time. She passed by, with calm indifference, a few coxcombs—the sad classmen of pleasure. In such entanglement she was a looker on. Her inclination always drew toward the clever and the friendly. Her ideal beneath the surface reflected on the mirror of her soul. Destiny held the scale—the unspoken name; its solution her problem of life. Awakening slowly to woman's life, her heart still yearned for something not even a mother could satisfy. To Mal more thoughtful, and to Ymataca often, reflection brought back memories of the sad parting. In the sunshine the passing cloud vanished under the influence of the marked sympathy and goodness of the untiring relatives. Confiding and gratefully receiving so much to enjoy, those days were purely happy. During the day ever-varied enjoyment occupied their hours, and often receptions and matinées, called in a club term, Liberté, Egalité, et Fraternité. Life's shoals were yet invisible to the young sailors. The sweet dream Arcadian resembled the only paradise they required—earth almost a heaven. So inadequate were the teachings they had learned from "the prayerless home." Faith was, however, the largest ingredient of Ymataca Marlborough's nature. The original evidence was irregular now, as religion vexed her soul according to any restriction. No rule of prayer in its right hour, or religion in its right place, aided her untaught mind to its diviner lesson. She had been undirected by household example, except in fear of some unseen spirit, robbing her of joys, which seemed sins forgiven. Here, then, think how frail her teachings, exposed to the dizzy brink of eternity. Between the two unbounded seas she plunged in the stream, and the influence of her beautiful creation shed light—a pure light—over the surface of occasion. The affectionate interest of that brother-friend became constant. The trustworthy Mr. Oustan was an every-day guest at his friends'. In the twilight of an autumn evening she sat alone in the drawing-room, reading in the bay-window. The door was swung open by Mr. Oustan, and he was at her side before she heard his step. In an instant he began smilingly to refer to his anxiety for her frequent waywardness. Her coquetry was unreasonably an armory of arts upon the late love adventure of the gentleman. Ymataca drew back at the domestic storm. By word and manner lecturing his gay little friend, warmly interested as we well know—his strong delight to attack her weak points. "Everywhere the belle," he continued. "I want to hear of no fiancé so early. Remember, dear girl, I stand as your friend, to remind you of your promise, and expect much good behaviour. I regard my duty as a sacred thing. Your mother's wish, and my advice. You have little knowledge of the ways of the world. Without a father or brother, you have no counsellor except the kind guardianship of these, my good friends; your cousins and I are the best judges. Ymataca, with Mr. Calby's opinion and mine, I say, beware." "Oh, yes! certainly I will; you are right—and so am I," she added, carelessly. "There is no harm in good society. I hate deceit. This, Mr. Oustan, is a mere trifle, my trite indiscretions. They are dignified. They suit me," and she resumed her usual manner. But the light-hearted trifling of Ymataca's outward demeanour was a little subdued. Seriously he talked a long time. He felt that he touched the high strung chord of her feelings, and said, kindly, for she was retiring rather coldly: "This deeply pains me, but do not let it be a cause of division between us, Ymataca; may I not tell you that it seems scarcely right not to offer advice, for I am a strong friend, and warm admirer of your lofty traits?" She turned from him, not in dislike, but indifference, as her slight figure expressed the usual demeanor. "Hold, Ymataca, you are not angry? I have neither the right nor the wish to rule you. There is the difference of thinking. I must advise you—pause, consider; you are a cold-hearted woman, or you would not have rejected my humble admiration." "Mr. Oustan, I remember," she said, "you are very good and kind, and very much am I grateful; but you don't understand me. Your advice I am ready to listen to." Her old confiding ways blending with the newly assumed importance. "No, you can't interfere with me," she replied with feeling, "for I have had no control—none have taught me o control myself. It is too late, I grow as I was bent. There is the difference of opinion; for the future, I shall not permit such conversations," and she made no other remarks. Abruptly, "Good-night!" a slight excuse was offered for her absence as she left for the evening, and she was soon in dream-land. Her life was then spent in an atmosphere so pure and full of love, that it never gloomed such domestic storms She wished he would not interfere. How useless her cogitation on that point! for James Oustan determined that, whether Ymataca, the headstrong creature, desired it or not, he would never lose sight of her, but that he would never again refer to her cold indifference and flirtation. 'Twas a Siddons the Second that seemed to concentrate the nightly assemblies that crowded that house. For surely a benefit occurred one evening when the hopelessly entangled Spaniard and South American, with five or six others unnoticed by our heroine, collected individually around to test the worst. Her sable fan swayed its steady art as a sort of ventilating steam-engine in operation. Divers amusements and pleasures marked their stay a little longer, in the sere leaf of October, '49. The young ladies received with advice the courteous acknowledgments and letter from Mr. Oustan, fixing, according to promise, their return to the South for the next week. At the breakfast-table regrets and pleasures were topics of conversation. They were hastily summoned to. the usual trysting place, gravely and seriously to discuss their departure. Next morning, in the midst of this conflict, a gentleman passed in the hall to the drawing-room, and not an unusual announcement, Mr. Thetford. For the last time he sat gazing on the rich flowers of the carpet and furniture. In keeping with the quiet elegance of the room, where nothing was neglected, life went very smoothly with Mr. and Mrs. Calby, and as was natural, their happiness was blended in characteristic loveliness. Miss Ymataca was sent for to receive a morning visitor—a few simple nothings spun out the conversation. Mr. Thetford loved her very much, and alone with him now, affairs were discouraging his buoyant hope: it now yielded to despair, and he dwelt on the last promises. She studied every word and phrase to meet a sudden change, and alluded to the conversation which had passed between them one day, when together they marked the spot. Soon after she broke the engagement with him. Never was man more lost to woman's power, as during the first season of '49, Thetford met her passing on State avenue, and with confidence in himself, he eagerly sought her acquaintance that afternoon. He saw her on the first walk after her father's death, in all her bewitching loveliness—the pensive expression spoke of inward sorrow, and the deep mourning robe of adversity. He heard her voice; as its tones vibrated on his ear, he followed, eager to know her name. He went in to a neighbour's, and made known to a lady friend his affair which elicited the romance of the strange adventure. Her friend, by request, formally called with him upon Miss Ymataca Marlborough. The gentleman was of well-known family and wealth. Thetford was excessively handsome, of winning and amiable manners, easy and graceful; six years her elder. Thetford was stimulated by the strange adventure, and endeavoured to find rest in her society. Things went on, but a dubious state of matters stormed upon his entreaties—his powers failed, and he became more and more anxious. The first sharp pang of rivalry excited torture. She then rejected utterly his suit—after long entreaty, she decided to favour his petition to be considered as a friend. Ymataca Marlborough was not a practised flirt, but mists rolled over this rash adventure, which yet astonished and made her incredulous to the spell which bound her. Entirely free from all vanity, all desire of triumph, his sincere devotion touched her feelings. The haughty boarding-school belle—the flirt of sixteen summers went through this act with less spirit. She had no idea of making this a lifelong matter. Not over clever, Thetford's heart was greater than his brains, and his daily devotions wearied her ladyship. Girl as she was, love was only a shadow, nothing vital, for the soul of her life lay yet under current. She was yearning for sympathy more than love. The image was graven with an impression both will carry to their graves. The first imprint of that impression was down-trodden, crushed by the brief lines—"But truth, though crushed to earth, shall rise again." And now she allowed that Mr. Thetford was very much fonder of her than she was of him. The stream of enchantment never bathed her love in those days. Ymataca was always anxious to do right, yet undeveloped judgment often led her to do wrong. I shall justify her conduct by calling it indiscretion, perhaps, but half excused, for few women of stronger mind do as well, certainly do not display more womanly propriety. Her conversation in ease, polish, was rarely equalled by elders.
                  The thoughtless expression of a large heart displayed its truth with an artless freedom of cordiality. How much better then for her mother, to whom every such feeling should have been confided, to have taught at least the responsibility of those future things—yearnings which involve no wrong, if directed right—the deepest, most internal feeling of life! Thus we find her leading her own destiny. The first filial tendril wounded, but never, from that early hour in life's young history, forgotten. Six weeks from his first visit Ymataca became engaged to Mr. Thetford; and here he had just come to fulfil the last appointment. After two months' devoted attentions, the sad reality, her careless smile froze upon his cheek, blanched at witnessing her smiles to the admiring crowd that gathered in her train. Walking amidst the group of suitors, the imperial belle was utterly regardless that she was more to one than another. But that look, coldly beautiful, fell like an avalanche upon her lover. And now a fierce combat of attention threatened to shift scenes with the adversary. It amounted to consequence. This practised drill had been carried on for weeks. One instance was rather deemed sanguinary, though recalled, as Thetford was convicted on evidence. To put on end to his miseries, he became the inebriate; but she soon restored his deluded hold from the wine-cup and dissipations, and by her influence he came again to his senses. He plead for the early announcement of their engagement, which she refused. Inconsolable at her preparation to depart, his strong affection tempered with his fierce rivalry, he said, "Miss Ymataca, I shall miss you dreadfully. If this, your journey, is best, I regret it." She had often softened his ebullitions; but now he was very desperate—" You are going far away, and I shall soon be forgotten. Your promise!" Her fate was all in her own hands. The inwardly-tortured man threw himself back in the chair and said: "Oh! it is too late! that deed is done." Ymataca blushed deeply: "What, why do you look so anxious? You are soon to visit me in the South." Thetford leaned forward and took her hand, conscious of his love and the cold blank of existence without her. His fingers, trembling and icy, smoothed back his rich abundance of light curly hair; a moody frown was on his face. His lips writhed with a forced smile; choking with emotion he stammered out: "I can't, cannot believe it. My veins are icicles and frost. A dread presentiment sentiment is on my heart. He loves you, and will make you his bride, in less than six months." His keen searching glance was full of sorrow. "Ah," he continued, "what an anxious summer I have had with you in my blissful joy!" She felt all this bitterly, and as far as possible, was unconscious of a circumstance which could bring matters so close. "His bride!" she rejoined in a startled voice, really repentant—"yet am I unconscious, Mr. Thetford, of the least outwardly accepted attentions from Mr. Oustan—to whom else do you refer?" His evident agony touched her cold manners—"Alas, I need no promise longer than your arrival. Then his strong love comes between us, the discharge. For heaven's sake will you bind yourself to our conditions, and you cannot yet understand how deep, how great my love is. Resolutions strong as this very existence;" clenching his hands in a vehement manner, his large blue eyes flashing fire, so vividly did his soul send out its burning rays. Is it not a serious, a solemn thing for any woman to study with delicate perception a heart's joy and woe? He stood for a moment frenzied, then burst into a passionate entreaty, piteously imploring her decision: "Ymataca, I cannot submit to your complicated vanities and concealments. God spare me the blow. Is it a fiat? No, no, I have given you devotion, all my life-long happiness at your feet, to your commands as husband I bow in love and reverence." Solemnly she assented—he drew a long sigh, and after an explanation, appeared relieved in mind and heart of a grievous burden. Again it was mutual, the bond of confidence re-adjusted, and modestly and quietly she turned away—a sorrowful repentant. "Mine once more," he said. "Ah, you cannot weary my love." Pleasant summer scenes brought up memories, pale, slender and sad-eyed, yet loath to admit their reveries—for her own sake—but, how like her flowing style, impulsive, natural translation, in action strong, imaginative! "Indeed, Ymataca, inadequate to the power of my love for you, which it is so impossible to convey; but not without belief in the possibility of any uncertainty of my future, under contrary influence. You yourself shall be judge to hear this my solemn utterance." A cruel suspicion flashed through the mind of Thetford, as he glanced at the mournful expression of her he loved more than well. She hesitated again, and looked at the ghost of departed hope. "If I hear its issue: as I hear the report, I shall become lost indeed, lost. I declare, and tell you in truth, ah solemn! my life will become a reckless dissipation, exhausted and dispirited. You! will be my murderess! Murderess—treasure my words; I warn you to hear that." A helpless sense of wrong crept over the artless creature. "It is too late. Ah, fair girl, the cup of fame was not mantling with wine of delight, which made your heart glad. Another held the chalice, and its elixir of living love. I have tried, Ymataca, bravely to escape imperative duty, but am forced to give up the prize with a mournful and marked regret. I do feel seriously disturbed that Mr. Oustan will be your escort instead of myself, but it will be sooner in my power to come after you, as my bride, if I attend to business now." With this, the few hours completed the engagement, and the next day announced the Marlboroughs were going away. It came, and awoke the painful separation from such delightful enjoyment, with an act of his fatherly tenderness, from the kind cousin, Mr. Calby, and his lovely wife; with Mary of Argyle's parting lines. Once more, again the last kiss, and tender gratitude took up their only minute. The female figures entered the roomy carriage in travelling dress, shawled and veiled. A very distingué handsome man followed, carefully assisting their comfort—had the luggage adjusted. Again last words, and they were gone. Lonely stillness seemed to settle around that house as is usual after a gay season closes. Approaching the railway station, our travellers discover the retinue of followers of Fraternité—to wish sweet adieus, Miss Mal's beaux, and her own admirers. Angry eyes, as the adversaries both suspected, greeted their arrival. Mr. Oustan laid special claim to his precious property, and she coolly informed him she allowed no perforce force. "I wish you were not going," said a host. Sadly approaching, the disconsolate knight remorsefully, reproachfully muttered, "It is too late. I wish I could have stolen my time, I should not permit another this privilege, with you, as escort on the journey." His face darkened, his cheek burned, and he grew ghastly pale. "I am determined to visit the South very early. Keep our conditions." His countenance became grave, and he sank into deep thought. The last glimpse of Thetford was as he stooped down affectionately to get the parting look as the train swept from under the broad iron concave of the rail-station. It was a leisurely pleasant tour, after loitering at some large and delightful cities, where Mr. Oustan spared no means to introduce his young protégées to every pleasure and comfort desirable. His judgment made enthusiasm practical. His head and heart worked together. They had entered a fashionable hotel of the great city, and he accompanied Mal and Ymataca to the ladies' stairs. A few minutes' conversation at the first landing, for he ever manifested a desire to know if all things were agreeable. Handing to each a superb French boîte de bonbons, which they, with easy grace and brilliant smiles, accepted; this unexpected opportunity of the artless girl betrayed the secret. Of course she had no confidante, and where there were so many eyes to see the outward marks of that one attention, Ymataca hid away la gage
                     
                     d'armore. A deep blush had crimsoned her cheek. Mr. Oustan fixed his gaze on her laughing eye, always expressive of pleasure, indeed just now to repay by gratitude his most untiring kindness. Her ungloved hand rested for support on the broad banister, and very solicitous were James Oustan's thoughts when he asked—"And what is that?" He touched an exquisite ring; the first time she had worn the handsome jewel. "May I be allowed to read the secret, Ymataca?" he asked, and she did not at first reply. He examined it now more closely on her finger. The hand lay like a statue. "It is true then, as I supposed," he exclaimed, rather astonished, with a bow and look expressive of deep regret. "How soon to be married? Oh, how cruel!" Mal, as much amazed as Mr. Oustan on seeing the ring, left them still contesting the propriety of the newly-discovered secret. Hoping to ascertain the depth of her story, he said, "Ymataca, how heartless! Have you forgotten a request I made, that you should not marry yet—so very young—nor become engaged without my advice? Can I suggest this is wrong?" The strong interest absorbed his mind to serious reflections, as under his sole care he felt anxious and responsible. Interesting themselves with the uncontradicted event, Mal returned to make preparation for their departure by the evening train for Washington. He looked doubtfully at Ymataca, as wearily she sat in her chair at the tea-table in Willard's Hotel. Attempting to eat, she rested her face on her hand demurely. He was annoyed. Suddenly Mr. Oustan resumed: "I have taken you at your word never to interfere," with a slight shade of satire, "but I am all attention while the gentleman is in the distance. Are you satisfied, Miss Flirt?" She listened in silence. Immediately her face changed. When he had done, she replied: "We will quit the subject, if you please. You must be jesting with me, Mr. Oustan." His bitterness passed away, and he was silent for some time. Again he began: "So you are really going to live in the South. How will you like it, Miss Marlborough?" "I don't know, sir." So on they passed to take the Potomac boat. The tolling bell of Mount Vernon chimed its awakening to immortal remains, as they noted the two years that had gone by since they passed there to find a home North. Here again coincides to October the last evening of the same month, to return to the South.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER VIII.
                  
                     
                        
                           "Our ancient house!
                           No more—I cannot see."
                        
                     
                  
                  PREVIOUS to the sad return of the family of Marlboroughs, letters had reached them at the North, expressing deep sympathy from many kind and affectionate relatives and friends: first and foremost were urgent inquiries from the Westerlings. Clara, the niece of Ymataca's mother, had desired the whole family should return to her house, in their unsettled state, scarce strengthened from the blow: before any future arrangements made, they must be first domiciled with her, as a home; as long as it would be agreeable. Under such inducements Madame Marlborough had arrived in September, accompanied by all, except Mal and Ymataca. With open doors, purse, and hearts, to assuage and cheer the terrible fate that awaited the grief-stricken ones, they were all welcomed back. Clara Lalner had been a celebrated beauty, and one of three cousins who were famed in their day for much. This jet-eyed, raven-haired signorita, as she ever appeared, was not more brilliant in beauty and riches than adornment of still greater attraction and quality, by a heart superior to any in its bright ray of goodness in every feature. On this occasion, we find it best to observe her character, as our model of a whole bright soul introduced to our reader.
                  On the last evening of October, '49, my story opens. The new parlour, furnished with elegant ease and luxury, was occupied on this occasion. The family and relative guests were assembled about twilight. The carriage from the Northern railway reached its terminus—and soon our travellers arrived at the pretty residence, "Le premier du Sud." As the gentleman and ladies alighted, Richard, a very handsome mulatto—threw back the front door with a lordly air, and bowed with a sweeping welcome, as forth came the expectants. The visitor newly arrived, as generous guardian of the afflicted family, was received with warm greeting.
                  Mr. and Mrs. Westerling with great courtesy welcomed their aunt's devoted friend; and with his formal and elegant suavity, Mr. Oustan accepted the invitation to pass the evening at their house. Already his trunk had been sent to the Templeton Hotel. So that he only retired to his room, to arrange his toilet after the dusty travel. After much affectionate congratulation, our wearied young travellers were offered the ceremony of removing their travelling dress; committed to the care of half a dozen attendants, the preliminaries were soon arranged, and they passed from their respective rooms, thence to the richly furnished nished drawing-room, again seemingly at home, so cordial a welcome was offered.
                  The evening lamps flashed out in dazzling light, as Richard touched the burners. The bell rang a new chime—then they entered upon the new scenes. The drama of James Oustan's life was unsealed. The last person had taken a seat at the tea-table, when the friend followed with Miss Ymataca. Sinking gradually into her chair, Mr. Oustan was invited to seat himself. He assumed the one at her left, and engaged in lively conversation, recounting their pleasant trip from the North. Everything passed off admirably—the faithfully trained servants of the old school moved around like clock-work. Mr. Oustan expressed his delight in the change, and insight into Southern comforts. After tea, the party gathered in the drawing-room, and in the alcove of a window, behind the sweeping draperies of the crimson curtains, Ymataca reclined on a pile of crimson cushions; the company clustered in groups. A number of visitors called in to welcome the return of their old friends; the Miss Marlboroughs' arrival had long been expected, and many were the expressions of affection which flowed from their old friends;—the stranger gave great pleasure to the agreeable circle by whom he was surrounded. His polished manners and address shewed one who had travelled almost the extent of his own continent; he was full of anecdote, and his wit, well directed, gave tone to the first evening. Mr. Oustan turned from the group with a smile apologetic, to resume a tête-à-tête. He sought Ymataca Marlborough of course, at whose side he remained the rest of the evening. Her intellectual countenance was irradiated. Again, three developments since she had left her native home. Her face was one you could place confidence in, and while he gazed upon her quietude, great force of character was discoverable. The consciousness of that power was the calm of a self-dependent, self-poised nature, reposing sublimely on its own great strength. A most beneficial mesmeric influence emanated from the presence of Ymataca, now really seventeen, though some thought twenty. Suddenly a shadow over-swept her countenance, as she was awakened from her silent revery by a step, and he stood beside her, till then unobserved. She smilingly received her most noble and devoted friend, and soon became absorbed in talk. Her unique naiveté curled the lip, like Cupid's bow, and went like an arrow to James Oustan, who in admiration seemed never to have been more entranced. Listening to her words, as though he lived upon the light of her countenance. He had never seen her melancholy. Recollections of a past now came to her memory; before her the lifeless remains of an early past. So ardent and animated those sunbeams flashed back; here! there! under her window; the next street lay opposite, over the broad garden and avenues of Frosterly Manor. Beautified and kept in its stately prime by other hands, there, beyond a few paces, were the lindens. So why the pensive cast, unhappy about something, that pensive cast, pregnant of the future? Mr. Oustan's departure was deferred from the next day to another week. Little did Ymataca dream of matrimonial designs from his friendliness. He promised to yield to the entreaties of the Westerlings to come frequently and make their house his rendezvous; to call it home while at the South. Not a stranger exactly, for he was extensively known in nearly every city of importance in the United States. Widely known and beloved by all who knew him for integrity and justice; as one of the first and most wealthy heads of a large commission house in the city of his birth, where he had met his ideal love. And, too, his acquaintance was proudly associated with the first mercantile connections and great bankers of foreign marts. Pardon the digression, but one of the strange co-incidents of the selfsame gentleman comes up on this stage of life. He had visited Richmond but once before, and then for a short time, and on that special occasion he was an invited guest at a large dinner party, in the superb mansion of Judge Tudor, directly opposite Frosterly Manor. The family of the chief of the bar and the Marlboroughs were long intimate friends. On the occasion of that dinner party, Ymataca just remembered to have run in among the smokers who were regaling themselves after one of Judge Tudor's magnificent entertainments. A friend among them, as they sat on the veranda of the mansion, enjoying the fine scenery over the hills, called Ymataca to come and be introduced to a "gentleman from New York." In a moment she had flown, only casting before James Oustan the shadowing of coming events, like a bird lone wandering but not lost! Here at her side, he is happy to renew the broken thread, drawing out unawares her history, based upon his model of her sex—his conception of all that was lovely in woman. He recalled in her the child, altered and improved. His eye had been released from the dazzling glitter of show and fashion, since the first look met the tiny figure of his chosen one. The worldliness of contemptible rivalries, based on selfishness and deceit, the basest passion of human nature. The imposing index of her artless adornment supplanted all other women of more equal beauty in the furnace of gold. The self-sacrificing and affectionate disposition, together with her cultivated mind, stood forth the embodiment of the brightest ornament that he held dear. And here before us they stand. He only waited to unite a chain riveted to a first recollection.
                  Ymataca was afraid Mr. Oustan would inform her mother of the secret. She bound Mal to keep it, saying—"It is of no amount in consequence." Believe, reader, our heroine was neither mean nor false, only unconscious of her real power. Innocent thoughtlessness distinguished her unpractised ways. She used all her tact to avoid the discordant subject. Apparently obliging, still she did not feel at ease in her old seat. "It is of no use to contend the point," she coolly observed to Mr. Oustan, and he, with indifference, was unwilling to be convinced of the folly of his sudden choice. Ymataca felt a pang of provocation as she stamped on her mind the undisputed claim to his regard. There was a constraint on both afterwards. In her heart she marvelled that this should have been, and here remembered the pain of doubt and weary waiting. "Will that girlish fancy ever pass away, Ymataca?" he continued. "Forgive me, if I have pained you, seeing how much I love you. Everybody loves you—we can't help it." Carelessly she added, "Possibly not." She saw how he was troubled at something, as he said, bitterly, "I ought to have known that amidst your pleasure I shall scarcely be remembered." She urged an excuse, and smiling away all harsh lines: "We have always been good friends, 'nothing more!" "Yes," said he, all these conflicting relationships wrapped in Ymataca's inexplicable net. "One pang absorbs the rest in my bosom," remarked the devoted man; "the thought of going away—how can I leave you?" "Back as you came," she answered gayly, "and forget me!" That long journey alone, it was hard; Mr. Oustan was in no jesting mood. "But I will not forget you. I start to-morrow for the North." Ah, the excitement of parting for some weeks, he thought—another barbed arrow. One more look at the beloved face; one more clasp of that dear hand with the faintest echo of devotion, and chance must decide.
                  "Will you care to hear from me?" thinking her manner more gentle. He regarded it with hope. He would risk an experiment. "I shall be so glad to hear of your comfort, and your mother's plans; at all events, let me write to you?" These words annoyed her feelings, as too frozen for a friend—one so great and true as he was. She wondered at this. "Very well, if you choose. Such kind interest—write to my mother. She is fonder of correspondence than I, at present, I am engaged with such amusement." "Then I must patiently live on? Ah! but I shall have tales enough to tell you, when I come back. Shortly, I think, for I have business to call me here in a few weeks." The company all rose to bid adieu to Mr. Oustan, which was indeed a sad thing to do, for, during two long years, a week had not passed without his visit. The prospects were indeed dark, as he expressed his hope of meeting very soon; with such stress of sincerity, none doubted the plan. "Au revoir" was bowed to his last moments. The door shut with a heavy sound; they heard his footsteps on the sidewalk as he quickly vanished to Hotel Templeton.
                  "Once more, let me tell you, I have business in that city of tobacco," said Mr. Oustan, and parted from the favourite home to seek greater pleasures. It seemed to be beforehand, despite his reasonings, and the settled conviction to which he had schooled himself—James Oustan had a faint thought that Ymataca loved him, or would, in time. He rose and left Hotel du Nord at once, and turned longingly toward the South. In dreary hours, tired and worn, he reached his journey's end. An anxious, solemn feeling lingered long ere he tried to break the seal—Ymataca asked but a place in memory. To such sterling qualities, high deserts with fidelity of service and devotion, she ascribed only a warmer meaning. But, the friendship was only friendship, having already promised her love. It was growing bitter for some time past. "Indeed, I am innocent of injury, I know it," she murmured, and began to realize the truth of a sudden choice. That passing dream altogether blurred her light. Has she to reveal its truth, and blast forever his dawning manhood? Thetford so full of life and hope. Her hand to place the stigma on his brow. The thought of it was a perpetual burden of that secret—a continual dread of its betrayal.
                  James Oustan, we know, and she felt had always regarded Ymataca Marlborough as an accomplished flirt. Yet if flatteries of a corrupt principle had deceived, he was very truly bewitched with all this, upon the knowledge of her affairs. Just one week after his leave-taking in the dwelling from which he had departed with a flood of November sun, James Oustan stood again in that same room; everything looked as if it was yesterday he left. He stands there with face flushed, and in a mood pregnant with consequences. Ymataca appeared soon after, to meet the smile of her guest. As he beheld the face, he half dreaded to encounter the girl's countenance, which looked so excessively fascinating. His rapture was speechless, adoring love—her guileless simplicity rushed upon him as he strove to assure her of his most ardent admiration.
                  That afternoon, with comparative ease, she was urged to take a stroll with him across to the fairgrounds. She looked pale and proudly coquettish, if ever she did. They sauntered along: as her sister Mal found herself de trop, she said, with an unusual toss of vexation, "Ymataca, I shall proceed, leaving you in Mr. Oustan's company." On they followed, as about to have an explosive settlement. But he gained ground for a time, and confessed that a warmer sentiment than friendship must exist between them, else his life would become distraction. She played ironically with his interpretations tations of her actions. But she missed her mark, and fire flashed from her eyes; she shook her head. "No, Mr. Oustan, it can never be. Feel for me as if your own true sister." The hue of his features became ashy at those ice-clad words. He turned promptly from her side, and remained motionless on the brink of a steep hill. She was some distance on the return, walking rapidly, as he hurriedly joined her, and grasped her hand. "Say! It is misery enough to know your hand is promised, and only to boyish romance! I am too late! too late! Tell me, friend, has anything passed between you since I left? He writes you, then? I regret the injustice to your mother. I feel anxiety for your happiness. While I would not violate your confidence without your consent. I feared this," he said, compassionately, "and it was madness in me to think of you in any other light than as—sister, friend. Indeed, must I be content to make friendship secure." James Oustan looked very well in his mood of defiant courage, ascertaining only clearly it was amity existing in her heart. His large and expressive blue eye lighted up with good feeling, reversed his dampened confession, as he handed her a cluster of the rarest exotics of a Southern conservatory. She held them with true regard for the giver. They went sweeping past the long avenue of noble old trees, her bonnet and shawl hanging on her arm. He followed her on in breathless pace, doubts explained plained and ended as they approach Mr. Westerling's. The tragic queen gathered her long train and wrappings into her hand, and swept past the valiant knight up the steps. He whispered as she parted to advance, "We shall forgive and forget, Ymataca, is it not so?" That moment he turned and left the gate, as a large party of ladies smiled on the traitress. He went that evening on his journey North; on the way noting in his mind events of marked interest full of apprehension, and love growing stronger. Thus he was forced to leave those shadowy chances, trusting this affair of life to fate. He was to return very shortly. He was brave to do so; and working up his courage without a faint heart, he thought to win the fair lady yet. Immerged in unpleasant contemplation, the calm and intrepid man was considerably shocked at the failure of his fair art of persuasion; and pursuing the strongest right as manly, consoled himself to think of another renewal. There again his advantage a test, leaving her preëminent among scores of suitors. She was very well satisfied, and passed her time pleasantly, as often at her music as anything else, trying to keep down unreasonable pain of—memory. At the zenith of her belleship, brief years then consigned to her again the home guard—ardent on the list, the refined, grave and trustworthy friend, Pembroke Beverly, for he hopefully renewed his attentions, and we judge from his manner, neither pique nor anger had dimmed the lustre of his vision by night, and still his day-dream rendering the same old affection to the merits of his first-love. "Will any lover ever comprehend you, Miss Ymataca?" Pembroke would ask, and he would reflect sadly, seeing the caresses of so many devoted ones. Despite the prejudices which fell on her as home thrusts, Ymataca blended her brilliant qualities with a sort of emotional repose. The mainspring of her truly interesting character was condemned as levity.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IX.
                  THE Marlboroughs disperse for a season; Madame and Minho, with the boys, visit her only sister now living—Mrs. Don Ticethorpe. A very moderate competency obliged the grateful acceptance of the solicitous forethought by which the excellent cousins and generous niece urged the afflicted family to reside there, and in her house, just as long as their pleasure and comfort found it necessary and agreeable. "Cousin Clara's" consecration of self and devotion to those she loved was unparalleled. Coincident with the same disinterestedness of liberality, her husband courteously ously extended his own. Among the peculiar charms and complete polish of refinement we find again the Marlboroughs. Time and incidents are too largely diffused for me to linger much beyond the life and narrative of our heroine. But I am forced to lay stress on the strongest connections which form the links in her chain of life. Mal and Ymataca, gay and frolicsome, preferred naturally enough less restraint than the gloom of their mother's presence. Untaught the lesson of appreciation of sadness or sorrow—they were glad to accept a joyous invitation in another direction, to another uncle's, at Matlock Spring, on the banks of her native river. The rich mansion had long been in the family as an ancient site, and surrounded by Indian legends. Winding through laurel groves, the private road opens to a wild and pastoral district, blending with the famous vineyard sloping beyond the mansion. Towering on the summit of the plateau stood the residence of Tarl Lalner, Esq. Immense orchards lay stretched around, and the "cold stream" edged a forest, then widened down a luxuriant plain. At a distance of seven miles, rose tier above tier of her native city—and the Acropolis, or Capitol—in the back-ground of the wealthy home. The house-servants' cabins were successively dotted—comfortable—where slaves had lived and died in the lap of ease and indolence rarely found. Pardon, reader, for a digression. But we must mention one who belongs to our heroine's history and recollections. Aunt Zilla was a babe of slavery transmitted from Ymataca's grandfather, but her chain grew brighter each year it waned. I saw her bordering the spirit land, as she told off the hours of her life, dressed almost in the garb of immortality. She irresistibly enchained the interest of her listeners to the profound religion of her heart, unfeigned and absorbing. Almost her hundredth birth-day had come, when our heroine was called with the family to see her die, a child listening to her children as she called the household familiars, who paid worthy tribute to her goodness. Such undoubted fidelity was her latest and very special gratification. The soft white hand of our heroine, and anon her young "marster," with his sister, bathed those clammy temples, and smoothed back the gray and white wool that knotted thick around her head. A frill of unrivalled size was fluted close around her shrivelled tarlike face. A gentle breath revealed another life as her spirit fled to our God. One of the patriarchal ones, she had her burial on the rich domains of her master.
                  A few days after Mr. Oustan's departure, he had written on his way North, to Madame Marlborough—first letter, intended for the eye of his incredulous queen. It announced his increasing admiration for Ymataca, asking Madame's permission to return and pay his addresses to " that lovely daughter." In the mean time, another request to allow him to send a letter to Miss Ymataca, informing her of his interest and his desire to return; on which occasion he would hold a private interview with Madame, and make a formal announcement of his uncontrollable affection. Madame Marlborough acknowledged the honour, and propriety of his compliment in seeking her views; and her heart bounded at this information: as much as she idolized her eldest daughter, this was suspense no longer—a confirmation, to secure one of the family, might secure all! with such a son-in-law! This news was a bright ray, and well it might be after such experience—however, without consultation with our heroine—as absent—the mother's letter was highly favourable at that moment. Distance lent enchantment to her strength. Her triumphant delight held the secret until to her address another, the second, came swiftly; enclosing one for Ymataca, "the young lady herself." Mr. Oustan had not been disliked by Ymataca, she knew, and much to Ymataca's surprise that letter came. At Matlock Spring, the fine weather had drawn the cousins and visitors to the beautiful steps overlooking the fine landscape and city of Richmond, piercing its lofty spires into the spongy clouds, tinged with gorgeous sunset. The young daughter of Tarl Lalner joined the company then. As she came towards them, she held up a letter for "our finished flirt." Our heroine took it from her cousin's hand, amazed at its unknown superscription, and blushed excessively. Tarl asked, "Is it the familiar writing that called such colour to her pale face." "Why, Ymataca," he said, "have you finished him, as you have done my poor heart? So often that it is dead to feeling." Tarl was a most noble specimen of man, about twenty-nine. The group loudly exulted in the affair.
                  "I did believe, Ymataca," said Tarl, "that you were the business which kept Mr. Oustan lingering at the South. Tobacco plant has risen, n'est-ce pas? Will he speculate now? Let us hear if business is dull: the contents, cousin?" laughed Tarl. "If you will let me read that letter aloud, I will honestly give you another ring, handsomer than the one I gave to be lost on the battle-field. That was a cruel mistake—where—oh where is Cousin Granville! I shall never give you anything more; but if you read that letter aloud, I will give a promise." Ymataca turned away, indignant at their jests. She was greatly displeased, and walked away with Cam. On the grassy brow they threw themselves down, and perused its mysteries. With a letter from her mother, to mention her late impressions, and his desire to return, as also the mother's injunctions, desiring her to answer with delicate friendship, and regard for her position:—four pages, masculine-sized line-sized pages, traced in a noble style of caligraphy, the fac-simile of his own true heart—hand open and fair, it eloquently expressed the most bewitching compliments without reference to common love. But reason and friendship told its depths in rich language and warm sentiment. Even at the beautiful mansion of her uncle, it would have been a difficult matter to say who would win? Wye Talbot, a splendid fellow, stood all devoted, and mad at this late news. He was more than satisfied that Ymataca did not love James Oustan, but himself as a friend and darling brother. "In a few days," her mother's injunctions summoned the young ladies from this charming retreat, to join her at Quillberry Park. Much regretting such deprivations, as riches, love, and sympathy had been showered affectionately and elegantly upon them, by their dear cousins—the doctor, his wife, and their courtly Uncle Lalner, with Clark, Cam, and Tarl, devoted to them—with all this came, as sweetly, anticipations as delightful, the kindness which offered another home. Soon they set off with Tarl, and reached their fatherly uncle's. Mr. Ticethorpe, with his most fastidious air of the courtier, welcomed cordially and with affectionate sympathy his nieces.
                  The beloved and widely-known family were distinguished for goodness and hospitality. We may expect the young ladies enjoyed the reunion, except cept Ymataca, poor thing, her heart was growing so dull. Her mother made her confidant by him! She was never nearer hating Mr. Oustan than now. Much was said of the late announcement, and all observed that it was a brilliant prospect for one so young, indeed for any woman. He was a man to admire. Now, thought they, the family will be benefited by this wealthy alliance, and she was drilled to hear his praises. To marry another was worse than lunacy. So openly to have the opportunity of doing so well, it is a wonder, it is strange, of course, she is so whimsical and stupid about the affair. "Of course," said Madame Marlborough to her daughter; "Ymataca, you must be prepared to receive Mr. Oustan's proposals." And days wore on, surrounded by Quillberry Park family, and the house stored with company. There was no room for reflection now. Under Ymataca's contending feelings, uppermost was the sense of generosity, good-nature, and respect which prohibited her hating the guardian friend. When obliged, she remained a listener to him, only because she knew he had so deeply trusted, that to offend him now might endanger the happy comfort of her family, and to whose interest naturally she was attached. The self-sacrificer was thus disposed to consider this piece of gallantry, which might secure her personal thanks to the zeal of her admirer. It awakened in her bosom a sense of his natural goodness of disposition which produced a regard for his virtues. Conscious of mutual sincerity, their intellectual communications appeared to clear away his precise words. On some future occasion—"Not yet!" she said to herself. Still it was impossible she could have the slightest suspicion of reality. In the meanwhile the prudent girl sheltered herself as much as possible from any persuasions. If he did follow her with his visits and address, it should be to little purpose. She was deaf to maternal arguments. That day or the next was to announce to Madame Marlborough Mr. Oustan's arrival. He impatiently watched the time which should at length procure him such an opportunity as he had so long coveted. Ymataca had been a week at her uncle Ticethorpe's, when a letter came accepting the warm and kind invitation which Mr. Oustan had received from Mr. and Mrs. Ticethorpe, welcoming the visitor of his attached friends to Quillberry Park. Such was the respect in which he was held by the whole family, that to neglect any wish of his that could be gratified would be a breach of unheard-of sacrilege to gratitude. His arrival at Templeton hotel, in the city of ——, was only a rest. He took a carriage to travel an unknown country, and rapidly pursued his long ride of forty miles with a strange driver, who lost his road. The travellers wisely stopped under the "flat rock" to ask the direction, which delayed his arrival until the evening meal. As it was just at quiet sunset, within the verge of a forest, Mr. Oustan encouraged himself. The gates of Quillberry Park were open on the evening we allude to. The gypsy boy of the forest, in his gay woolseys, promised welcome with his black eyes. The juvenile sable attendant whirled back the big gate of Quillberry Park, and offered his services to the cheerful visitor pressing forward through a shaded avenue of the stateliest elms to the lovely home of her uncle, where the party all awaited him on the broad piazza. "Ah, my worthy sir," said Mr. Ticethorpe, as the ladies and gentlemen gathered on the lawn to welcome the friend. The modest intruder stepped from the hack, apparently tired. Mr. Oustan clasped the stranger's hand. "I greet you with warm welcome, most excellent sir," were the words of salutation from her uncle. "I thank you," replied the friend, as he walked with firm step to Mrs. Ticethorpe to receive her greeting. "Madame, I accept with proud gratitude your good will." The hearty congratulations of the attached friends instantly reassured him of their esteem, with thanks for the trouble he had taken to come so far. The first excitement of meeting in the far interior of Powhatan settled into quiet, proposing that he should rest himself. Mr. Oustan, stepping up to Mr. Ticethorpe, with all the energy of full manhood, and his handsome countenance lighted by earnest meaning, said, "My kind sir, I am somewhat fatigued, for I lost my way among your native oaks." As the words passed from his lips, a bustle occurred—the coachman was unlacing the traveller's trunk from the carriage, when one of the best of the horses dropped at the gate—so the gentleman was suddenly interrupted by his only attendant through the lonely road, to say the animal felt seriously his fatigue. They stood sorrowfully by to see the groom from her uncle's stable assist in restoring the dumb animal. His last agonies had ceased as he fell, and he was removed sadly to the stables. It was an unhappy chance, for the coachman had to leave early next day for fresh horses. (Detained for a longer time than expected.) Proceeding to accept the rich hospitality of her uncle, Mr. Oustan instantly changed his dress, losing no time to stretch his limbs; he composed his thoughts and refreshed himself with some claret cordial, sent to his room as is customary in Southern hospitality. At present he desired nothing to frame his powers but her blessing. A temperate, very temperate man, he left untouched the delicate attention, and went hastily to the parlour, where hosts of lovely and accomplished ladies gladly received such an acquisition. It grew dark when his eye glanced keenly around, restlessly watching for the evening-star. Alas! Miss Ymataca was among the sylvan retreats of her native forest, and desired to renounce the thought of meeting him. As a figure darkened the path up which she came in the twilight, they gave intelligence of her visitor, and at once summoned her to come to the parlour. She replied to her mother's messenger,
                  "I will not go; my sisters and cousins are enough to entertain one guest."
                  Our heroine loitered there, rather moody, and drank in the scene of her childhood, as fancy turned to Don, when they gathered acorns from that noble oak-tree. She arose from the fountain, and, calmly unconcerned as to his opinion of her graces, was not inclined to James Oustan's wooing. "Metaphysical work," she said, sauntering along very slowly. Her eye reposes on the cascade bridge, and, from the vista of brooks, Ymataca comes forth. The rustics had been summoned by the brook-side to receive the friend. All had passed on, and were among the parlour guests ere our heroine chose to seek them, first visiting her dressing-room. Then she heard his voice among the charms of social charms ever found numerously collected in the quaint old drawing-room at Uncle Don's. Unusually late in the evening, Ymataca made her appearance. Almost with force she was urged to go where he was. At last her resolution was overcome. There she found him, his faultless figure and very handsome features flushed with pride as he rose to accept her greeting. He was made quite at home by their accustomed ease of entertaining and his own easy manners. Till that moment she scarce realized "his proposals." The hour came for the evening meal. The devotion raised at the family altar had been enjoyed; when they quietly gathered around for talking. She was not brilliant with her prattle, and his attentions were marked. She endured the ordeal with dignity on her brow, and compelled by circumstance to respect the formidable injunctions. After the ladies had retired from the drawing-room, Mr. Oustan was summoned by a sable lord of the premises to be escorted to his room. Through a labyrinth of uncertain passages, winding and turning for a considerable way, they ascended at last to the chamber assigned, as a sort of concealed antiquary—— Having reached the apartment, James Oustan stood hesitating before the bolted door, descanting on the position of his rival, as if touched to the quick by uncertainty. Baffling this fit of hesitation, by which his enterprising spirit seemed to be so suddenly paralyzed. Ardent enthusiasm intermingled with the great undertaking he had come hither to execute. He sighed deeply. "Her same provoking tone of calm indifference," he said. A menace trembled in the scale, and it highly incensed the lover. He anxiously watched a place in which he might again try his suit, with an energy that should command attention. "I trust," said Mr. Oustan, as he sank into bed. Some days passed away most delightfully. The friend was sumptuously entertained by the family of neighbours, whose wealthy hospitality tality only out-rivalled the distinction and general harmony which united such a number of counties. 
                        
                           "Calmly he stood, and with collected mien,
                           Breathing his soul in voice so firm but low,
                           As in the spirit of the hour and scene,
                           With the wood's whispers and the wave's sweet flow,
                           Strong hearts endure—
                           Stood one that seemed the monarch of the soil,
                           Serene and stately in his manhood's pride."
                        
                     
                  
                  Ymataca is pressed into submission, and reluctantly assented to stroll through the park to the natal oaks. She assumed the same indifference, but such jealous, adoring love was too blind to see a fault, and impatiently contrived access to its secret spring. She said, "I know that voice," and darted to the dell. "It's Nemy, spouting the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet." "A truce to such nonsense," as he turned angrily from her side. "Your cousin is psalm-singing." Advancing towards them, the two cousins, Mal and Nemy, were on the same road, with Dinah, the usual sable escort, and Pelham, springing at their call. "We passed through here in quest of you—from the Doctor's," they said, smiling at the lovers. "Yes," replied Ymataca, "this incorrigible man has exposed me to the dangers of the night air." "Ay, verily," said her cavalier, "you have practised your accustomed hazard on your safety without the slightest obligation to my credit—just what I asked, that you might conform to my protection. Your speedy 'pass-port' was neither civil nor obedient to my part." Mr. Oustan's demeanor evinced a struggle. The task was not yet easy—he diverted from the purpose by better reflection as they enter domestic scenes.
                  Another day, and without a cause, Ymataca was induced by her mother to make preparations to return to Richmond. At once, she answered firmly, "No." But a formidable low-pitched argument was followed by triumph. The first communication made to Ymataca on this new subject seemed like exultation, so little did her feelings correspond to the design. The hour came, Mr. Oustan's carriage had returned with all comforts and suitable road conveniences, also horses fitted for the journey. The earliest hour after breakfast the friends mingled regrets with surprise at the departure. Business of importance took Madame to the city among lawyers. Mr. Oustan arranged the pending difficulty for a suit in the Supreme Court:—and in thankful recollections of his vast kindness Madame Marlborough accepted this proposal "that she should avail of the moment to accomplish the speedy work, between the lawyers, and tobacco." Our heroine was made ready for the occasion. They arrived at home after a pleasant visit by the way at Mrs. Westerling's.
                  The farewell to the Park and leave-taking of their dear aunt and uncle render the grateful interest a punctilious wound of parting, ruling the fragmentary language, "Farewell to all."
                  It must be a trial for any mother to give her daughter in marriage, if she have the strongest reason for doing so, and the most disinterested desire for her child's well-being. In our story it was cruel necessity; flower-roots in frozen ground. Could anything be more distressing than now! In Ymataca there was no graceful yielding of affection and reverential submission. But the over-scrupulous mother's creed was impressed by nature. This daughter's temperament was gentle and impressible. In such hands no wonder she was moulded like the clay, yet not exactly to her will. Having inquired the sentiments of her child in respect to the projected marriage, Ymataca replied, "I do not love him, and will not. The gentleman is worthy a woman my superior. Your favourite, mother, must ask some one else. I am more than in love with another already. A day was set, and these notes taken." "I am shocked at your daring to refuse so choice a prospect. Will you accept Mr. Oustan's proposals?" "I will not, for I hold to my own engagement, and cannot." "Reckless, indecorous woman, or plainly, a foolish child! Abandon such absurd nonsense. Think what a mortification to your guardian and friend, to find you have such little judgment." "It will pass beneath my notice, and I shall answer, if I must meet the crisis, negatively." Reason, cold reason hardened the youthful mind. This interview yielded to trial equivalent to declaration of feud in the family. 'Tis over, she lingered on the severity of that mother's wish; it passed the circumstances extraordinary. Two days after this our heroine was out with Clara, and met James Oustan on his way, accompanied by a very handsome Scotchman, and a rich célébrité whom our heroine had never seen before. Mr. Oustan dropped his arm and joined the ladies. Ymataca was given into the guardian's hands, to be safely carried to the Westerlings. Clara slipped off into her husband's office—the banker's. They entered the state parlour at Clara's. Ymataca, silently indifferent to what might come, seated herself under the curtained window, by the half-closed blinds. He raised her gloved hand, and clasping it in his own, his courtship began more particularly now, with reference to marriage. Surprised, somewhat softened, by this overflow of the most generous heart, Ymataca accepted the ungloved hand, vainly endeavouring to conceal her emotions. "Let the past be forgotten, Ymataca, sole object of my highest aspirations, in your acceptance of my wild resolves and uncontrollable love. Judge differently when I point out to you the true state of my case." A painful flush passed over her features. "Oh, I trust there is still no barrier between us. I remember you were engaged; I thought it only vanity of life, a thoughtless action without feeling. My motives are too honest to ask if obliged to resign the being I have so idolized: you will not feel the difference of our ages? for I shall feel as if one life was our main spring." Mr. Oustan paused before he added in a constrained voice, "Are you free?" Half willing, half reluctant, Ymataca sat lost in revery, still resolved—a chaos passed quickly through her mind. At length the subject was exhausted; she yielded to her natural buoyancy of disposition: bending down her head, archly looking into his eyes: "I did; I am free. Yes!" "I was quite convinced," he answered joyously, excused and defended her release, extenuating such by her wilfulness. "I don't even like to think of it, and you will at least promise me never to refer to it again," said Ymataca. The reasoning and reconciliation he hastily gathered up; anxiously avoiding any debate—a total oblivion of that event found favour in his eyes. Drawing her towards him—dread apprehensions must find relief—earnestly he asked a few moments. "You will listen, for honour due friendship, greater than often exists between the nearest relations. Intimate we have been from your childhood. The idea of any happiness or enjoyment without you is beyond the stretch of my imagination. You will not misunderstand: my wish is unselfish as man's can be. I mean, dear girl, to say the sweetest, most exalted triumph of my life will be, has been, to ask now: May I call you by another other name dearer than friend, nearer, 'wife!—my wife?'" He looked in profound gaze at her slender figure hanging on his arm, as they stood before the soft coal-fire. "No answer, beautiful, guileless Ymataca! Child of these tropics, have I chilled you?" Her colour increased, and her heart beat quickly at this appeal. Her dress of night contrasted with the white and crimson blush; those dark eyes watching her companion's eager flash. Her brown eyes gave a side glance and looked down, endeavouring to summon up the necessary courage. Now, halting between two opinions, listening to every word, she withdrew her arm and walked across the room. Sinking into the nearest chair beside her, she murmured, "You force me to be brave." He said, "Are you determined to meditate? My love can never change, and is stronger than ever." "Mr. Oustan," she replied, "I would rather not assume so great an honour as your wife. My qualities, if in an attractive form, might not confer to your well-merited happiness. Ungrateful I shall never be, and dare feel a kind of worshipful gratitude, conscious of a sweet and very intimate bond of obligation woven in friendship between us. The imposing dignity of your excessive compliment I must decline, and regret, with compassionate love, 'faute de mieux,' that you should care at all about it. Your greatness of every move and your eloquence inspire my warmest admiration, my affectionate tionate friendship and profoundest gratefulness. But forget me as nearer." "Impossible; Ymataca, I scarce ever think of anything else. My expressions are strong. I implore you to consider, glorious creature." Indeed, continuing courageously to oppose her generous instinct, he stooped over her bending form, whispering, "Shall it be?" Shaking her head, she silently gave consent. "Ah!" she said, "you have yet to submit to examination of a day or two." "Have mercy! Ymataca. How can you tell me that? I shall have no hope, I fear. Will you not relieve my sufferings and the slow torture of your decision, by giving me concisely and clearly your opinion to-morrow morning." "I agree with you," was her reply. Brighter smiles, brighter glances governed a joyous confusion respecting the uncertainty. He left her, to be early there that evening, and the next day to seal their impending fate. For nearly an hour silence reigned in the room, where Ymataca was sitting contemplating on the eve of action. Her mother's influence and her guileless simplicity lent enchantment to the laws of her love. Colouring the mitten to suit her hand, she had granted his wish to the proposed declaration; and he came again that night. The next day, in a bright morning sun, she went into the same room to receive the welcome visitor. Further discussion was needless; and struggling with traitorous inclinations, she entered his presence.
                  Immediately after she took the hand he offered, and they sat together upon that sofa. Each seemed to have no thought for anything but the moment. He seemed really to enjoy her childish wilfulness, which betrayed his doubts were almost at an end. Bestowing on her a gentle look, he said, "Ymataca, to-morrow has come. I have submitted to your ordeal, and wait to enhance the value of your honours and consent to become my wife. Do not permit a long engagement." "Well, it must be so perhaps. I am convinced of my warm feelings, Mr. Oustan, a provoking attachment," was her reply, half laughing, half serious. Surely a man who could speak so gently, so kindly, so careful in his devotion as he had been, must value affection. His heart sank, for he deserved love, pure love, woman's whole existence. With head erect, his lips firmly pressed together, he paced the room. His brow contracted as he moved toward her—tormented with doubts and suspicions of the most complicated description, while enduring with fortitude the painful patience. Provoking love! After this flaw, James Oustan drew her from the sofa, as he held her hand. Assuming as a basis his well-regulated judgment, and exercising his reasoning faculty, he spoke in firm accents, "Will you love me?" "Perhaps so," she rejoined. Irritated by her manner, he turned away. Neither of them knew how to continue the conversation. Unconscious of her tyranny, her look upon him was startled at the pallor on that splendid face. He asked again, "Ymataca Marlborough, can you be serious, or, is love your play-time?" She faltered. "I cannot help it," was her answer in a subdued voice; "I tell you it is possible that you may sacrifice yourself, to engage my acceptance for that promise." "Another enigma," said James Oustan, shrugging his shoulders, his sanguine temperament grasping at every shadow of hope. "Tyrant," he said, forcing a smile, "you have tried me severely. If unconscious of your power, let this limit dispose my freedom to trust and love you still," he repeated reproachfully; "I say devotedly, I promise to secure your happiness; as I once said, time and love will secure you what I ask from you, stony-hearted woman. Unchanged and unchanging, I assure you never to lessen love for you, never to deceive by word or action. Suggesting to our future bright visions, wealth and love lies at your feet. Tranquillize the certainty of our engagement," he whispered, "be assured of ensuing endurance." He had adopted a system of appeal too well calculated to work on her young warm heart. "I am beginning to think of receiving your esteemed and appreciated affection—I am too young to say love. Accept my modest acknowledgment of your honour: I will promise to be your wife." With his usual warmth, he knelt before her shrine of beauty, reproaching and entreating forgiveness. "I am running no risk in your confidence now, dearest Ymataca, my little wife? I tell you, dear girl—my wife, I defy a rival of any kind," said the lover with a smile. The efforts of her mischievous qualities were unreservedly made to please him. The impress of his own possession was chosen from his finger—the seal ring signing his name as her future husband. The token of possession was carefully adjusted to the size of his small finger—again it circled his hand to be conveyed to the jeweller to be fitted to its future owner. Obtaining this foothold more intimately in the presence of their mutual relationship, he placed his arm around her waist, bending his head to kiss her averted cheek, with these words, "For ever. I dislike long engagements," and earnestly, with fervid carefulness, he desired her to make speedy arrangements for the marriage ceremony. "Ymataca, I must leave to-morrow, to hasten our necessary preparation." Till this moment Ymataca had scarce realized her circumstances, and over which she had so little control. In her heart she trembled whilst she leaned on the handsome gray slab of marble that topped a richly carved table. In painful mental bewilderment, after the fruitless efforts to enliven her abstraction, she commenced to moderate his expectations. "Mr. Oustan, you will deserve a better, prettier wife than I shall make." Laying his hand on her shoulder, he bade her be still. "Nothing shall interfere between me and my wife," and reminded her of the promise, "forever." It is unnecessary that we shall either witness or note that parting. Scarce willing to leave his own pearl unset, yet guarded by a strong band, delay was useless. "And now," he concluded, "everything shall work together for our good," and he was gone. Shutting that door with greatest care, Ymataca passed on to a seat. Resting her head on the arm, she prayed for help in this trying hour. A feverish impatience, with intense yearning for another—another more genial. Yet all woman could seek or find was embodied in his person and love. James Oustan possessed her chronic disease of the heart, and she was worse instead of better. So she determined to keep the secret, and had not the slightest intention of confiding the case to her mother. As Madame had chosen for her, "Time and things," she said, "shall produce their results." She contrived some way to screen herself from the progressive work, braving all mock congratulations on its surmise with undisguised inquietude. A few days after he left, she received a letter from the postman. He assorted his pack, and sent to her apartment a document. Others were in that chamber when the servant handed the confidential letter to the fair lady. The countenance of Ymataca assumed a deep expression: in silence she broke the seal, and, without reserve, read it calmly. "Are you," said her mother, with some hesitation, "are you engaged to Mr. Oustan?" "If you judge from trifling occurrences," replied the daughter, reproachfully. "It is really difficult to understand such indifference," observed the parent; "you seem to consider my wish unintelligible, my child." A moment renewed all her horror of this cruel wish, and, for a moment, she was unable to speak. Turning very pale, she answered with a cold respect, "You know I told you I did not and would not love him—never shall! Do you think best I should receive Mr. Oustan's pro-po-sals?" Ymataca, I do not know how to express my astonishment at your conduct!" Fixing her keen glance on her child, she laughed at her misery—her nonsense. "Ah, it only shows a sentimental way peculiar to girls. And, not to accept such a possession! who yields without reserve his noble, unselfish love! I feel assured that you are attached to our good friend; he is, indeed, more than worthy your love! Your want of confidence shocks me." "Want of love, mother, is worse." "My child, you must not expect too much: and there is no impediment now that you should not marry him." "Your influence is a mother's wish, but it is cruel. I think not to marry him." "Provoking perverseness! I recommend you to consider before you leap in the dark." At these unfortunate interviews, Ymataca lost all command over herself: that manner of listening and answering her mother was evidently disastrous. Can we wonder at our dispirited Ymataca entertaining a reasonable prejudice and quiet indifference after this non-committal discovery? She at that moment remembered to arrange her indolent fancy, and tossed some fancy articles in her little basket, gathering up fragments, and rushed from the room. Had James Oustan a point to attack, her innate delicacy would have died in the flame rather than to stand as she did, and then to find a mark of ridicule in the man she would marry. Nor was Mr. Oustan's love strange in such a man. Scrupulous of his own worth, he was humbled to weakness by love, as a Cleopatra's. His was superior to Marc Antony's. Cæsar had bowed to woman's caprice. So she had never seen or pointed the arrows of derision at his nobleness. Incomprehensible his incoherent, despairing perseverance! A steady resolve, mesmerized by a singular fate. With his feelings and rare proportion of intelligence, I leave you, reader, to be judge. Or shall we at all wonder at the inevitable influence which such a mother as Madame Marlborough could exercise over a girl so wholly inexperienced, so guileless, so unsuspecting, with respect for filial affection and honour for God's command? Mesh after mesh wove the web. Inexorably hard the duty of such terms. With all this, Ymataca had not learned the first rudiments of the knowledge of its terrible responsibility. The fearful step must be taken without a view beyond. Now each day was busy with their interests; another day disclosed this fact. Said her mother: "Ymataca, I know your secret—Mr. Oustan hinted as much. He said you were undecided then. Is it so now?" Those cold hands and stupefied looks did not deceive. "I confess, my child, I do not comprehend such feelings or want of sense. I advise, as I know it is best—you cannot be aware of the store of happiness for you—lose not the opportune hour." "Alas! how bitter!" she replied, meekly; "I can not love." "You will, my child. Others have married even disagreeable men, and, after marriage, loved them." "Leisure enough, perhaps, to make up my mind." "Impossible! Beware of filial disobedience! Bitter are its fruits," replied the mother, with stern composure. A huge mountain rolled up to the heart of Ymataca. The rock shivered to disbelief—and retreat inaccessible. She sat for hours, alone, agitated with most embarrassing meditations: insensible to the beauties of the view. In future, Ymataca determined to avoid her mother. If so obliged, by respect, she assumed a studied reserve of manner. She consulted with no one for weeks. The familiar ring of the bell announced her letters. But she even ceased her blushes, entered into no allusion whatever to her engagement, but spoke generally on enlarged subjects; compelling the moderate cheerfulness. By this means she endured the penalty. On one occasion casion, Clara found Ymataca alone in her wing chamber, and said: "I hear you have accepted Mr. Oustan, and will soon be his wife." "Ah, Cousin Clara, tell me, is it an unalterable decision, so that I must marry him?" "Unalterable, I should think," added Mrs. Westerling, gravely. "I saw the shadow on your heart, poor child. It is not your wish. I am sorry; but you do right to obey the very heart's desire of your mother; her preference and mine. I think him an extraordinary choice. What! you are not really going to change now? It is seriously important, cousin, and affects you much." "Yes, truly, compelled to marry a man I neither love nor hate: it is terrible." "Yes," said Clara, "I feel it a sad thing, but be brave and obey your only parent; promise me, for your own, your mother's sake, you will fulfil the promise." (From just such a memory, poor Clara had once recovered—love after marriage. A mother's preference bound her life to wealth, excellent as a man, but her life a darkened ruin, by a mother's wish.) The carriage had scarce driven from Templeton Hotel, when its occupant very hurriedly retired to the familiar room and assorted his wardrobe. A moment he stood there, and with a smile turned away to arrange his change of dress, happy at the South, and near the crowning reward of all his sufferings. Descending after this to the tea ordinary, he refreshed himself and started on the way; wrapping his cloak around his shoulders as he went on. Thither we trace the undaunted lover; through dark unlit streets, he gained the door—in his breast lay his calm memories, and aspirations clung to his heart; another pause, and he stole in unawares on the grouped ones in that parlour. There was something magnificent in the delicacy of his touch as he grasped their extended hands, surprised at the unexpected return. A brief season had crept by, despite his pride, which revolted at obligations to another and now to woman, the gifted stainless name of the superior being, and with eternal recollections of the smile she gave, he knelt as the young lion charmed by the eyes of Una. Welcome he was ever, so he assumed with dignity and ease the secret. 
                        
                           "A little in the mist, but not dejected;
                           Never—but still myself."
                        
                     
                     
                        "I see him not: some cloud envelops him."
                     
                  
                  That very evening after this "drop-in visit," he was alone with her, and addressed Ymataca with a slight hesitation, which he instantly overcame by a smile; a half sigh swelled his great heart; she does not love me?—she shall learn. That solemn accent convulsed but soothed. Blind to his own love, with his arm thrown carelessly around her waist, James Oustan sat in silence; he spoke first, by saying, "My comfort, my wife! accept this pledge of betrothal," and drew from his vest pocket a ring, concealed in a jewel-box lined with white velvet. Lifting her hand, he touched his lips to the finger, and placed the band as bond upon the forefinger of her left hand. "Forever, until death us do part"—he solemnly repeated, "Amen." The diamond ring sparkled clear and radiant from its chaste gold-edging and band, round and rich tinted. The splendid brilliants were three, as typical of graces. They shone dazzlingly in the exquisite workmanship of fine gold; on the inner ring of the band was written, "J. O. to Ymataca." Sweet flowers had been the only token of James Oustan's love in gifts. The cluster and the bud she had clasped 'neath the topaz breastpin on the Cliff; as if symbolic of her exuberant beauty. The consequence of plans were more deeply laid from the band of endless love faithfully sealed to her very flesh. Imagine that every feature of his chiselled face told of wild exultation. It increased his reason and power. The time, however, lays claim just now to matters of worldly wisdom, which set in his own mind a brief period, to consummate the grand culminating point. The eve of marriage—within three weeks to wear the yoke of woman! 
                        
                           "The knight of arts and industry
                           And his achievements fair."
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  CHAPTER X.
                  
                     
                        
                           "How is my heart divided
                           Between the duty of a daughter and my love!"
                        
                     
                  
                  BUSY with matters affirmed by fates, with seal prefixed; the wedding-day all in preparation. Inexorable fate shuffled on the needles of the seamstress and dress-makers, to arrange "sa trousseau;" the ensuing morning the ring of diamonds was first seen glittering on her finger, while at breakfast. Evidently Ymataca was unwilling yet to wear the bond, and evading all questions, rose and left the family. Conversation took its natural theme through the house, and her mother soon came in her room, to take position with full responsibility of her law just executed. "At any rate, Ymataca, you must understand this must so soon be settled, we have but little time to consider now." "It is never too late to mend," was the laconic rejoinder. "I feel I must decline the alliance rather than complete it." "Pooh, pooh, childish nonsense; fickle flirt you are indeed. Marry him, you can't fail to be happy." Ymataca stood aghast, incapable of thought, almost of feeling. She passed from the presence of that parent with a singular and meaning horror. Her smile became melancholy, and the change observable to all. At noonday of that week, a noble cousin came in, he said to congratulate" the bride elect"—"such a mistake." Elt Talbot looked on the creature of impulses, knowing and loving her well. He uttered all sorts of waggeries upon the subject of this marriage. Elt was her sweetest brother friend, with Wye. They had loved each other all their lives. The cousins were more than absorbed to know the current reports; and Elt had known, and was her confidant upon the affairs of Thetford. "Ymataca," he said, "you old flirt, you have tried to conquer me, and here, n'est-ce pas, woman's love on eve of marriage? The wealthy gentleman has yielded up his territories accustomed to your invasion. Ah me, follies and flirtations, most over. On hearing of the diamond ring, I expected you to show me the central point on which legally you stand suspended. Tell me in confidential whispers"—turning the ring on her finger, watching it send forth dazzling sparkles. "Say what, poor child—that you love another?" She burst into tears and fled. As he caught her hand, drawing her to his sheltering bosom, he said, "Oh, Ymataca, foolish girl, you are not angry at my frolic—only jests. This is a costly beauty indeed; vastly beautiful, well worthy the taste of your elegant lord and master. Such a mistake! "Wye looked embarrassed. Elt looked in amazement at her mother. "Is she angry with me, Cousin Minho?" "Only nervous, Elt." He vowed she was not happy. "I know, Elt Talbot, that Ymataca is a foolish simpleton; never knows her own mind three hours to four. I am better able to judge for her. Such a match, so eligible in every way! She would be mad to let it pass." "But," said the warm and noble-souled Elt, "why! oh, why shall she marry him? If she cannot give a heart, it is wrong, cruel. I will send him off. She shall not marry James Oustan. Cruel—cruel. Spare her for him she loves." "Elt Talbot, hush! dare not insult me. I will allow no such liberties from you, and will permit no interference." The affectionate fellow, with his usual air of ease, marched over to his cousin, with "Never mind, I'll try to keep him off." Tenderly he spoke, and his tones thrilled the sad girl. His eye so bright, his mien so noble, that she almost strove to cling to his protection as he passed from the door. "Good morning—I think this diamond ring affair such a mistake." So he told his lovely sister on his return to their residence on Holly Avenue—"Ymataca shall not marry James Oustan; I'll prevent it." "No, Elt, keep quiet. A mother's influence is higher than all earthly laws, for good or bad. So if it is her choice, beware of meddling." Madame Marlborough said to Ymataca, the next morning, "Child, you must smile and be gay. Do be as cheerful as of old. Mr. Oustan has observed the change, it is visible to him, he told me. Let not the brighest ornament ment fade on the auspicious moment; it is unjust to his claims; be bright, such happiness is awaiting the nuptial hour. Your smile, your cheerful gayety won his love at the breakfast table where he first saw you. Let it be natural." Reader, these were the encouraging lectures by which our frail Ymataca was urged on to the contest. "Don't cloud his hope by sedateness. Ah, he was captor to your buoyant manner. Cheer up, his devotedness will, I know, reassure you of his worth after marriage. "Ymataca bowed to duty—and the cold call divided. Her spirit not willing, but nerves weak to bear her mother's wrath and anathema—"Questionless." "No!" Was it a duty, or to her betrothed less than infidelity—false to the bridegroom. Thus, poor child, she analyzed motives and felt convinced of her position. Wrong in some way, gratitude—the weighty debt—a settlement by perjury in the sight of heaven and on earth. All opposition outwardly subsided, Ymataca hoped even yet for strength to resist the current against her. Quiet weeks of busy preparation might even avert the storm. And in this state of apathy she struggled. Subdued in spirit and alone, she would look in sadness on the seal of state. Recalling the scene, as he stood erect, and placed on her finger, half trembling, that costly ring of exquisite device—"'My wife!' those were his words; he called me his wife." Alas! her joyous face deepened into thought; blooming young womanhood assumed diffident coldness; she felt a presentiment of misfortune; her gayety gave way to reserve. 
                        "Sigh, poor heart, but do not break."
                     
                  
                  The five years is nigh at hand, and Grita remembered that Granville was procrastinating; which henceforward became treachery toward her. Deficient in promptitude, which, in an ordinary case, had been, perhaps, excusable, he, however, by promise, should have plunged his hand into the cold waters of jealousy and slander, and have scattered brief errors then circulated; then to have dispersed his crowd of rivals. The aroma of the girlish affection had been exhaled; other love had breathed on his flower, carried off its dew, and withered its freshness for him. Ah! mortal—mortal man, you left it to die far away from love: vitality had been chilled. He might warm it into life again; but, oh! where was Granville? Days passed, interspersed with the same wild effort, and moments which had something strained and unnatural. Ymataca reposed only in the depths of comfort and kind care of household communion; filling up the interval between dinner and tea with ordinary interest in her bridal accomplishments. See the strange complacent smile upon her lips as she was forced to handle the new work! Frequent and long letters from her betrothed came still. Hers were briefer and more subdued. At once we saw she was no longer herself. When she spoke, the music of her voice was not settled, but tremulous. She no longer chanted as she tripped along, bewildered by the change, "It is true; it is true. "Three weeks before the appointed day for their wedding, our heroine accepted the warm and generous invitation from Lady Atholl, to join Madame Marlborough and her sisters at Ambleside—a pleasant walk from old Frosterly Manor, on the same avenue or street, three squares below. Madame Marlborough and Lady Atholl were own and devoted cousins; and, with sisterly sympathy, she opened her heart and hand for the comfort and enjoyment of this afflicted family. In this handsome house the Atholls had lived for generations. And let me introduce to my readers "the charming widow," matured in face and form, but a sunbeam piercing everybody's dark cloud. Her residence stood on an eminence, and occupied large grounds, a kind of park, extensive often in cities of the South. 
                        
                           "And sweet that dwelling rests upon the brow
                           Beneath its sycamore of Ambleside."
                        
                     
                  
                  Toward the close of a winter day, Ymataca surrendered charms indefinable at Mrs. Westerling's, and bent her solitary way to her cousin Lady Atholl's—"residence second." "All's well that ends well."
                  Seated in lazy enjoyment by the blazing fire, the loiteres were assembled. Lady Atholl reclined on a sofa by the window in her drawing-room, tête-à-tête with Madame Marlborough, recollecting thoughts of the enviable affair soon to transpire, and to advance guard to the vanguard, promised from Clara Westerling's. These two presiding judges, having accumulated true rights, felt every faculty now prodigiously sharpened, and resolved to know their true grounds, as the game was at its meridian. The new comer passed its threshold, and introduced herself into the quiet parlour—a spacious room which displayed wealth and luxury. Above, carved cabinets groaned under the weight of silver heirlooms, a salver and water-pitcher with goblets around. The walls here and there interspersed masterpieces of the Italian and Flemish art, with portraits of ancestors. A small table was beside the sofa; on it the servant placed wine and glasses.
                  The sisters gathered in; Minho was engaged in conversation with Harry Atholl. The girl of seventeen summers, unconscious of her coquetry, had rather silenced the excitement of merry laughs as they all met once more. "Is it possible you are among us?" said the charming widow, as she rose and again welcomed the bride elect. Lady Atholl looked inquiringly on the blushing face, whom she also addressed as "the captivating coquette." Ymataca passed her arms round her neck, and kissed her dear cousin, and nestled herself at Cousin Kate Atholl's feet, leaning her clasped hands caressingly on her knee. With the same changed face she entered on a singularly ominous conversation betokening premature care; calm sadness seemed to tell her fate. A forcible contrast between the reciter and listener. Necessary duties called the skilful and accomplished manager of household fortune away. Drawing herself up with her usual display of energy and vehement character, the rustling silk vanished with her graceful apology through the door.
                  The double marriage!—while the story interests, the events romantic, the moral is practical—the proverb old: Be slow to promise, but quick to perform. 
                        
                           "Good lady, love him!
                           You have a noble and an honest gentleman,
                           I ever found him so.
                           Love him no less than I have done, and serve him;
                           And heaven shall bless you."
                        
                     
                  
                  The house and inmates of Ambleside were well suited to bestow great pleasure and rich attention to large numbers of kin. Lady Atholl's was a century plant; under its grassy canvas were night-bloomers; around her had grown up one son; only another boy and a daughter, the child of eleven years, constituted her family. Her house, large and well arranged, was handsomely furnished, always open, always full of guests and company. A blue sky ever there. The widow was a personage of importance, and gave name to her neighborhood. A large heart and cheerful disposition were her choicest merits. A savage opponent of gossip, her moral as well as physical power possessed high excitement. She enjoyed everything, and was a woman of superior education, evidently skilful in her conversation and influence. The incomparable, extraordinary widow, in this second reunion with a favourite cousin, Minho Marlborough, gave a natural tone to the lifeless film over her sad fate. Under her own roof refreshed the change in her life, which was soon expanded into light air by the power of Lady Atholl's charms. She was a creature to do wonderful things, so that she ever raised the wounded and dying hopes with her compassionate voice. In one week the frivolous little flirt, silly and vain, was to be a butterfly wife. "You will be so happy," said her cousin Kate, as she came into her chamber. Seemingly Lady Atholl had no knowledge of Ymataca's fatal secret. The fair side, its lights not shadows, were associated by the presiding judge. Ymataca trembled at congratulations. Courage failed to animate the valueless service. In stoical attitude she heard the speech suggesting the same counsel. She was silent, her face colourless; but she overcame embarrassment, whatever her other feelings—fate demanded attention, the strongest point of the dilemma was at hand. She had yet to learn also at what price the more valuable part of her right was to be sacrificed. One intensely cold morning Ymataca was summoned to the council chamber by the worthy coloured maid, Nolens—"The ladies is waitin for you, Miss Ymataca." The faithful and valued servant departed. After these words everything seemed strange. "The sting presses deeper," was spoken as it ran through her brain and expired. A time elapsed, and the powerless nerves scarcely comprehended this new call. "I don't know if I am a culprit, that I must have a guard." Sadly and unwillingly, she rose from her seat. The scene changed quickly. She arranged to go with a courageous heart. "I must descend." "This most frivolous of women," child of inexperience, for I can conceive no woman womanly at eighteen, drew the folds of her black mantle about her slender shivering form, and tucked her hands into her muff, trying to recover from her dream of sorrow. More and more brightly the sun shone into the room as she left it. Descending a broad flight of white oak stairs, Ymataca drew back the folding doors of a large room. "Go in?" she asked herself—the agitated creature entered. At nine o'clock they were all in readiness; and satisfactory discussions were accomplished; already amply supplied with elegant articles, except the last touches to be finished according to her taste. Ymataca always had an antipathy to needle-work. Perhaps—like Catharine Parr, the beautiful and illustrious queen—she had presentiment that "her hands were not formed to use the spindle or needles." There was no smile of pleasure at such business, while her heart warmed to the generous donors of the elegant bridal gifts already acknowledged. Then rushed up a thought: "If I abide by my promise?" Delivered into the hands of a close set column, Ymataca was aware of her confinement, with such restrictions as her sisters and the wild dashing Memmie Poll. Like a condemned prisoner, Ymataca was controlled by circumstances. The sentiment of such enrollment breathed suspicion, and merely from the symptoms of dissolution of Madame's fears and aspirations. The grave reflection: "It was so near her wedding, and all preparations made." So, she feared Ymataca's fickle nonsense might be indulged too late, if the chance came. No! the engagement should not be interfered with, she must abide it now. These three spies were enlisted to direct her path. The snow had fallen fast and heavily the evening before this shopping expedition. At the hour of nine, the morning was dazzling in sunshine, the city covered with its wintry robe. Ymataca gave herself to her nobleness, purity, and child-like faith in God, to whose guidance she committed her cares. The young ladies, leaving their footprints behind them, proceeded to the "Ville de Paris" of Southern marts in her birthplace place. The high-born cousin, a rattling beauty of the bright brunette cast, dashed on with sweeping grace, followed by the cold calm of Minho's dignity, and Mal. A gay set with the society of Memmie. Soon in the excitement of high play all differences of mood vanished, and introduced with usual dignity their position and search for tinies.
               
            
            
               THE THIRD ERA.
               FIVE YEARS.
               1850.
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XI.
                  THE NEW SUITOR.
                  OUR military hero's destiny led him into conjunction with our heroine's star, whose light was closely interwoven with his own. It will be difficult to separate the rays.
                  Oh! blame her not; 'twas destiny that led on where care and error meet. She saw the power and felt the heavy chain.
                  "In the new year," in the first month of 1850, Colonel Rutland, with immortal fame, approached our heroine. His prolonged absence had spun out just even the last term. The "five years" in ten has just returned; and he has placed himself before his life's history, immediately from Arthur Seat, only a brief visitor in her birthplace. In a frolic, the gay brunette, with sparkling hazels, desired that their delicate frames should balance weight; no sooner said than done. Young Marlborough borough accompanied the ladies to a near office where cotton was raised by weight, in order to find their own. After the sum-total was accounted, they returned to the chief old shop of fashion. The satisfactory purchases were made; and they passed toward the wide entrance, as usual, marshalling for the return to Ambleside. These judges of her nature in body-guard stood ready to oppose resistance to the olden time rule of scrupulous propriety; thus strictly adhered to, as an inheritance, to hold in reserve the elect bride from three to four days before marriage—a total retirement from the elect husband; and this outward exposure was unheard of. The ancient honoured law was obediently observed, even tried by confessional, in justice of this petty errand. A little scene took place: Another five years, and Granville and Grita are to be side by side, as if again her pass-key re-admitted him. As they reached the door on the main street, the ladies were stopped by a gentleman, loading them with early morning compliments, and, after several questions, passed. Little by little the skein of ideas was entangled before him; each thread was a thread of gold. Grita was very confused, hardly looking at him, but melancholy crept over each blushing feature. "Filial affection! how my heart shrinks aloof from the great ambition. One hope, but one hope, long since chilled." This was a sudden and dangerous reunion. The man of gallantry lantry and of the world startled her with an unchecked affection of respect and relationship, which touched every line of his animated face with a warmer emotion. Colonel Rutland had drawn the glove from the hand on which she had placed the tiny circlet—ten years had passed. Placing his hand in her own, with a cordial shaking, emphatic with the truth of sentiment, and surprise at the trivial meeting, with an air of supreme and half-compassionate embarrassment, Granville Rutland traced the wear and tear of his heart in her web;—haughty struggle in the labyrinth—indifferent now to the analysis of his captive queen. Did he blame her? If he loved her so dearly, he loved her too late! The tenderer and more helpless claimant of the two, fixing his eyes with earnestness on her, his heavy gaze penetrated her very soul; with an arduous effort to rebuild his first foot-hold in the Temple of Fortune—an improbable hope. But her image that often cheered him in his exile, through hardship and through dangers, came back with all the passions from self-love to such love, so fervent for his forsworn ideal. These baffled aspirations preyed upon his breast. Writhing pride almost stung to death his ambition. That ring, the recollection of which haunted him yet. He wore it, and kept it; often kissed it in memory of his child-love. Above all, he cherished that pride—that strong hope—yet to regain that to which he conceived himself entitled. Recoiling from the announcement of the betrothal noised abroad, Colonel Rutland tarried before this new-found idol of his heart. Gazing on the beautiful Grita, doubly dear by reveries, it filled him with emotions; brought back the old memories when first they met. Before him he sees her in all the loveliness of womanhood—bright, gay, and beautiful: her eyes as dark and pretty as ever, that mouth as sweet, and that laugh so joyous! Now?
                  Granville:—"How now? what news, what hopes and steps discovered?"
                  Grita:— 
                        
                           "I do begin
                           To feel an alteration in my nature."
                        
                     
                  
                  They return up the same street with softened brow. The smile at this moment seems expressive of one of her successive revolutions, which mark the eras of Grita's moral existence. It took another date from that last time, when they walked together and conversed as the wind. Grita's cheek wore a flush of pride when she saw him, Granville, carrying her little purchases, as he waited for her to procure her commission in this shop or that. After many moments' musing in patience, Colonel Rutland sauntered forth with Grita, chafed to the heart, gnawed with proud grief, as he obeyed the royal mandate of his captive queen. As a soldier enamoured of discipline and order, he followed his ruined hopes. Touched he was by her cordial and affectionate respect; her simplicity, her beauty, her misfortune was heightened in the danger she had run. Ripening within, still the surface misled the eye as to the depths. "Ah!" said Granville, shrugging his shoulders, as recoiling from the subject so fatal. Observing that after a pause, Grita was silent, absorbed and womanly, with great propriety she was entitled to the point of attention; concealing his most agitated feeling, Granville thought too, his habits of thought and reasoning those of the camp—beneath the injustice of wasps. "Alas! our sufferers—afflicted with wounds. "His cheek burned, as his fine voice spoke the unutterable stab: "Soon to be married! Aha, my little cousin, you are very young, but—my congratulations." Grita blushed deeply and evaded the charge. Her timidity and blushes intoxicated him with the belief that his feelings were not unshared. Yes, my reader, 'twas then, truly then, with such emotions as made him almost blind to every thought but the luxury of breathing the same air as his fair cousin, which swept from his mind the past, the future, leaving nothing but the joyous present. Suddenly he had so utterly surrendered himself to that passion. Already, completely it mastered his strong spirit, and as his first, his earliest feelings, directed themselves to this child-love, so now they stood on the verge of Memory—trembling with sweet Hope as we have been assured, up to the moment of the reunion of ever dangerous natures. Intense expectancy touched every feature, and the sad smile vanished perforce from Grita's face. Up to that moment, she had been uncertain of his existence. A name dead to hearing these many years. The only clew rejected, and she moulded to a strong selfish will. Ah, not even the common type was struck, when spurred on unconsciously to be directed to the path, which crossed in the same old streets. Without much relish Colonel Rutland smiled the exquisite smile that sprang from the noble and bright expression that elevated the character of his face. "Well, shopping for the bride all finished, Grita? Too late?" I saw the tear-drop starting as she answered: "No, no!" said Grita, trembling and turning very pale. "Is it of him you are speaking, Cousin Granville, of whom?" "Ah, letting all your pretty thoughts run on the handsome gentleman. What is his name, pretty cousin?" "I'll forgive you if you will only promise never to speak of him again," said Grita gravely; "I may not marry Mr. Oustan yet?" "But he will marry you, Grita, is it? Nolens volens." "It is true," she rejoined, "sub pœna! Never willingly shall I marry Mr. Oustan; "breathlessly she repeated, "Never! I do not and will not love him." "Are you sure of that, my pretty cousin?" Then the modesty, the instinct, the terror, all came before her filial affection tion! transformed in a moment with a propriety of collectedness, stately and innocent, that made her blush as she smiled, "It is true, mal-à-propos, my secret," she exclaimed. "My betrayal may come; he is a guardian only, I'll tell him, adopted." Indeed, the frantic rush of memory seemed to make her unconscious that she was speaking. Granville in deep pity spoke, "Don't say any more about. it, Grita; poor child, I will not betray your confidence. I shall come and see you, may I?" As these words were spoken, she clung there, to that one being, O God, to the changeless love of Granville, her birth-star; his heart was free to impress the first reflection, "Mine!" So came reveries with that early vow, and her misfortune moved his compassion toward the weak and wronged. Before the fine open grounds of a parvenu's mansion, they were slowly ascending the hill—Granville and Grita, on that hill-side, conjecturing—resolute, advance, serving as text to the scriptural and original of their lives, on this sea of ice and untrodden snow. Our hero and heroine were so engrossed in their own thoughts as to be oblivious of their regulators. The halt was called, at this certain spot by the judges of propriety. "What's the matter?" said Minho, conscious that Grita was improving her last touches at old tricks—and she felt called upon to make survey of their business. Colonel Rutland alluded to the circumstances, with the dignity of her principles, which deemed this accident improper. "Presumptuous, and such confab must be destroyed at once." Minho turned to our heroine, as she timorously stood by his side. "I shall, Miss Flirt, oversee and overpower the oscillations of your pendulum style, by saying you shall join us; any secrets?" she asked. "Why else this mystery? This conspiracy of yours and Colonel Rutland's is dangerous. Remember, I only devote myself to your interest in compliance with your mother's requests. You must and shall join our party, else I will report to mother your indiscretions. And hear me: you are wronging one whose claim you should defend, misinterpreting your actions to Cousin Granville." She glanced at his well-proportioned figure, as he stood before her. "This, sir, is a bride elect; it is too late for occultation now." Granville Rutland turned his eye on her, preserving the sacrifice, the hopes and fears in his soldier's breast. They little guessed what passed within. Yes, those secrets of united hearts hid themselves. "Alas! Cousin Minho, shall I lose her sweet society, even now, because she is to be married?" That struck like a dagger to his heart and hers. "Leave us," he said to the official lady; "you join your party; I have really something to tell Cousin Grita. Many years, you know, since we met. I am convinced of the dignity of the young thing. We will dispense with the bride." Her conversation ceased. Again she added, as if convinced to the contrary, "But, my mother's injunctions—sir, I took it in my hands—she must abide the laws of such restrictions." The little flirt not relishing to be sermonized, in a tone and manner perfectly conscious of that deep-laid suspicion of her mother's doubts, and the sister's reluctant conviction to the contrary, chose not to heed the restrictions. A sickening smile betrayed the counterfeit love. "Miss Minho, I have no particular wish," said the heroine, "to discourage mother's doubts, or any suspicions. Say what is most agreeable to her; I am not afraid now; I am not in love with that affair, and it is of no great importance to me, I assure you." "Grita Marlborough, you terrify me with such compromise. That interpretation, Cousin Granville will, I am convinced, understand as from the lips of the most heartless woman I know of. Shameful, dis-honourable sport! Every one knows your feeling are not educated to principle," said the angry Minho. "Not educated for anything at home," was the laconic reply. But in solemn assurance, Minho repeated "that her mother and Mr. Oustan should be informed of her behaviour." At last, wearied with her efforts, Minho drew aside from the grave conference. Our heroine scornfully rejoined, "I need not be of your staff: a field officer is my aid;" folding her shawl around her, she marched on exceedingly cool and indignant. "I assure you, cousin Minho, I will follow after you. We won't run off yet," said the officer. Affairs were tranquillizing somewhat, as Miss Marlborough turned on her heel and proceeded with Memmie and Mal. The Colonel walked at the side of our heroine. "My dear cousin," he said to Grita, "you are in chains, I see. My presence is objectionable. Grita, I love you, and am not satisfied to hear of your being a bride elect." "Hush! hush, no, no," and she too recoiled from the truth. "Alas, too true, I fear, Grita. Another's." Yes, young, thoroughly artless, she does like her own way too well to submit readily to control. "I should like to know myself more of this affair;" he spoke with a sad smile and an expression of curiosity mingled with admiration as he gazed on her in the bloom of life—but features clouded by misfortune, poor child, he felt it in silence. "Hang the girls!" he said, in a moment. "It does seem they have but little confidence in these circumstances. Are you a flirt, Grita?" "I am as innocent as a dove and harmless, Cousin Granville. They wronged me, but I will never love him. I never did, it's a sisterly and brotherly affiliation."
                  As they two walked on, they hardly knew how to blend their ideas. Grita felt her natural place was at his side. Her eyes and ears responded to his tones of love. "He came too late," she sighed. Attending closely to each other, Granville and Grita were far advanced in courtship. On this joyous occasion he asked for a private interview. That evening was appointed for the special meeting—to tell her he would die to win back what he conceived he was entitled to. The passive drug reddened by its connection, and as if in remonstrance or entreaty, she paused to listen horror-struck and bewildered. Her heart was on her lips; she faltered out, "The traitoress, perfidy! He cannot love." The speech died ere it was uttered. But in that awful moment, she had assented to the arrangement. True to first love, she felt relieved while they, the lovers, related their adventures, and again they halted before the gate of Ambleside. The footsteps of her staff had long gone in, previous to the loiterers' arrival. In the large back parlour, they stood leaning on the white marble slab. Something like joy again, as the lovers clasped hands. "All safe?" he asked. "I want to speak to you, my pretty child-love." Rutland drew a chair close to Grita's; still listening as they were painting in dreams the fairy-land of a happy future. The light of day stole in gleaming slips through the barred shutters. The draperies, gay and somewhat faded, threw a scarlet tinge around the room. The fire blazed upward, a flame most inviting in winter time; the soft golden light reflected on the two faces bending near. One so blooming and fresh, tinted by the nipping frosty wind, innocent woman smiling on the manly features of the warrior. Grita, with her dark bewitching eyes, soft and gentle, glanced to that commanding face. The calm depth of the soldier lay beneath the fire of his large blue eye, and strong will that spoke in the close thin lips. Her look upon him was undefined interest, between admiration and fear, love and pride. His gifted speech was eloquence of the man who had seen much and felt deeply. Scarcely prepared their plans so as to enable satisfaction when the door opened—Madame Marlborough and Lady Atholl. They had been informed of the probability of a Dean Swift affair, and the alarming intelligence conveyed a solemn assurance that the artless woman must be put in chains, to await the decision and abide the consequences of a formally announced engagement. "I will neither be trifled with, nor shall the best and kindest of men be insulted by her fickle deceit. I know her well," said the angered mother. "To trust her choice, to desecrate such a match—it is too late; no help for it. This new folly I shall attend to. "And from such a conference in that chamber, Lady Atholl and herself had come down to see the officer cousin; and important those steps that led to the bride elect, to recover her senses and send away that presuming tormentor. Granville still stood before the window. Her cousin was not at all surprised at his arrival in town, for they knew he was near. Now only a few moments was our heroine permitted to enjoy the society of the officer cousin, and a few moments he looked at her musingly. She understood at least. Just then her mother begged that Granville would excuse his fair cousin, if he would comprehend all that awaited the bride elect's arrangements. Very soon the ceremony would take place. Indeed, one week from that day, and Mr. Oustan was expected the next evening. Granville Rutland leaned against the corner of the mantel as he stood before Grita, listening to these words. With an air of assumed indifference he laughingly replied, "I have heard the formal announcement. And I think she is too young to be a bride." "Oh yes, but Mr. Oustan will surely come to-morrow; she must be ready." "I am sorry to hear it," were his words, and he looked grave. His cousin Kate said, "That is nothing more than we might expect from you, flirting with every woman you meet, heartless, dangerous man." "Go, my daughter," said Madame Marlborough. "They are ready for you up stairs." Lost in emotions, she was loath to go. As she was leaving, she wished him good morning. He raised her hand to his lips as he spoke, "I regret, Grita, that you are engaged. Cousin Minho, she was my old favourite, my little sweetheart. Married soon! Ah, farewell; I will see you again, Grita." His relations were very much surprised at such improper presumption. Granville added with a smile, "Not yet by law?" "Colonel Rutland, beware of any schemes and projects. Reflect, it is a dangerous business for you now." He carelessly glanced his eye at Lady Atholl. She was aware instantly there was a secret spring, and he boldly pretended machinations against their plans: he would steal the wild flower yet, convinced he was entitled to her." "Lose that lovely thing!—cousins? never." Madame looked at him with scornful surprise. "Granville Rutland, your nonsense is very disagreeable. I am candid; my daughter cannot entertain you, for her time is fully occupied, and to-morrow her betrothed will be here." "I will see her shortly," he replied—"only cousins, you know?" and walked gravely up, as after a social visit, and said, "Good morning, ladies;" and he managed not to let Grita leave the room before he went. He was gone, repeating his engagement for the evening of this very day. "I am to see her. She is mine.
                     
                        
                           "'I will not leave thee! no, by heaven I swear,
                           Although thy soul be stained with guilt and shame,
                           I will not leave thee, for by me it came.
                           Then cheer up, sweet one, shudder not with fear;
                           From my own side thy form they shall not tear;
                           I will not leave thee, one undying flame
                           Burns in my breast, will ever burn the same,
                           Where I UNWATCHED could wander by thy side,
                           Soothed by thy voice and gladdened by thy smile,
                           Rich in thy love so deeply tried.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  At the appointed hour, the evening of the same day, Colonel Rutland reëntered the old hall. From him no bolts nor bars can exclude her voice. In her visit of weeks at Ambleside, his name had never been mentioned, nor had he crossed that threshold in years before. "The fair encounter of two most rare affections."
                  Colonel Rutland passed into that front drawing-room significantly; and to break that contract he had resolved. Daring the danger, he advanced to her mother and Lady Atholl with a complacent smile and urbane, though the languid welcome of those ladies sufficed to assure him of the danger he had dared. The many members of the old family were there. Again stopped by a crowd, Colonel Rutland pushed by, as his eye fell on the girlish form. "Here you are, Grita!" as she approached him timidly. "Yes." "And you remember?" he spoke before all. The lovers withdrew to a step near by, on the broad piazza, for it was a soft, balmy Southern evening. The old porch was full of many members; a few seconds only were allowed them. He clearly perceived the ill feeling of the elders. "A villanous attempt to break off this contract." "A reprobate," was the loud whisper of that evening entertainment. Such conduct was furiously irritable to the distrustful mother. The morning of the next day, new laws were made, and Madame set on a new band of espionals. Madame Marlborough was amazed at this dereliction, and assured by the previous morning's tête-à-tête. One inch beyond that exposed point in our heroine's heart, the mother never saw; not one in her immediate family. A singular gulf of distance separated them, from the earliest years; now it widened. The main-spring of her mother's wishes had been fairly wound up. Forced into a training counsel, our heroine stood before the tribunal in that front chamber. Lady Atholl remarked, "The officer and the fiancée are certainly on good terms, Minho." "Yes, he thinks her an elegant girl." "Such unpalatable ideas will not digest without another diet." So the single-handed combat continued. Our heroine was brave, not courageous, bearing herself with firmness at such rebuke, her mood was perversity. "Oh, yes," said her sister Minho, "She only means to open her batteries on Cousin Granville." That touched a tender chord; and with a deep blush from her captured heart she replied, "Indeed! yes. He may change these scenes. I am inclined to prove faithful to old love." "But, indeed, he was but a recreant lover." "I understand his story, consecrated by our remembrances," rejoined our heroine. "A little time for reflection," she continued, "I am too well informed of Colonel Rutland's delay and treachery." "And so you think he is false. He is true to me;" clinging with significance to the dreary reminiscence, and repeated, "We may yet enliven these scenes. Are you not, and has he not been informed of your engagement, to terminate so soon in marriage to Mr. Oustan?" "Yes, he and I are sadly informed." That scene of rebuke created excitement and deepened emotions in our heroine's heart. "Colonel Rutland," said the mother, "is a villain and reprobate; ungentlemanly and dishonourable—his vanity presuming. I forbid again and again the slightest intercourse or mention of his name. Such intrigues, my daughter, will lead to unpleasant consequences. You shall not permit his smallest attention. He is selfish and cold. And his conduct is dishonourable. Dare not see him again. Not an interview. Understand, I forbid him this house, and under no roof that shelters me shall he be received. I had rather carry you to your grave, and heap clods of earth on your head, than see you the wife of that man. I repeat, dare not receive him under this roof, under none where I am. So alive as you are to flattery, I have great fears of your principles. Surely, if Mr. Oustan only knew as well as I do, I think he might be excused, and give you the slip." Our heroine was roused from her late apathy. Flavoured with bitter contempt, she said very calmly, "Mother, I resign my claim to the honour of your choice; you know and have known, I did not love him." "Gratitude is an obligation as well as happiness," said the mother to her child; "I forbid a broken engagement. So late! it is absurd. You must abide by your promise and mine; you are given to another, my child." "And as a child I was given to him; Cousin Granville asks his old love." The room full of members were amused at her vanity. As she had listened to the denunciation of her traits, she turned away to leave the chamber, saying as she passed, "We meet again." "I beg you, respect my voice, and not receive clandestine meetings with that abominable man," were the ringing words of her mother as she left. Our heroine's spirit had long been sinking, sorrowful indifference her seal. Tears sad enough flowed now. The rivals were to stand on the same soil next day. In haste, Granville's and Grita's star of hope shone suddenly. She had reassured him that morning, as well as she could, the outline of her case. He parted from her the evening of that day, with a confident air, to wait patiently as possible for the next attempt—the daring adventure. "The fiancé shall be for me to settle, be firm, be true," were the words sounded by whispers in her ear from the earnest depth of feeling. The great man with deep emotion consecrated his whole soul to be wrapped up in her love, and on that soil of early childhood it flashed across his plighted troth. The character of that young romance had not been lightly stamped on the fancy which once, if dimmed, were graven deep—on those tablets, where the writing, even when invisible, exists still. Grita was restlessly agitated to wait the daring adventure—the desperate leap. Over Granville she had thrown a fatal enchantment. Inadequate and powerful impression, she felt, had pierced his heart. 
                        
                           "And scenes long past, of joy and pain,
                           Come wildering thro' her childish brain."
                        
                     
                  
                  Colonel Rutland knew he had been forbidden the house in which she was guest; while the household were totally ignorant of the hopes and clandestine arrangements. In the midst of such domestic happiness Grita and the officer tried the foil and the gauntlet: knight of her tournament to crown his queen of love and beauty. The hero of two fields had succeeded in persuading the wild flower to make cautious moves and preclude the wedding. In the brief day and evening they were together, love was near betrothal. When she told him, leaning to his confidence with maidenly modesty, she held her rein and said "one fatal regret filled her heart." "What now?" On the next bright morning the snow had almost melted away—wind and sun dried the brick pavement. Luckily Grita was obliged to meet an engagement at madame the dress-maker's. A few articles were being finished under her eye, as most elegancies came from the North. Chance (do you think so small a thing as chance, so blasphemous a representation as chance?) opened the gate early after breakfast for our heroine. Ah no, friend reader. Destiny, God's ordained order let her out, and she stole away. "Very well—go," said the indignant parent; "you must; the young ladies can't waste time in the reception room of Madame Le Mode." Haste had wasted further cautions regarding improprieties. Besides, at such a place there was no danger, and so very early in the morning. Our heroine carefully avoided any allusion to her cousin officer. She had looked before she leaped. In a moment, tripping along, she contemplated the release, and resolved late events of the evening past. Having regained somewhat her elasticity of spirit, she passed along the street. At hazard of her own good name, she resolved to brave out her desperate adventure. "His truth!" Then came the tempter:—"Should she trust that base, black-hearted man, in defiance of highest laws, human and divine?" Her lofty, generous nature revolted from suspicion. Satisfied with a strong and profound feeling of the earnest and solemn assurance of Granville, she refused to doubt of his truth or his love. She, the unsophisticated girl, should test him. The wild stately fugitive, with her young beauty, and air of well-known pride, was agitated with this delicious secret of the old love. In half an hour from leaving Ambleside our heroine arrived at the house looked for 
                        "By the soft winds of whispering silks."
                     
                  
                  Her hand was on the bell, which rang out its answer, and she walked into the airy room. As usual, the premises wore the stamp of pretentious dressmakers: thronged with visitors. Carriages rolled up and away—and in this ark of refuge, our heroine sat before the window, leaning musingly on her hand. Beside her was the table, that held clouds of sunshine, joy or sorrow—from the softest rainbow tints to the heaviest black clouds of dresses. Dresses lay tossed here and there on chairs, and on tables, waiting for the flirt's or enchanter's wand to wake them to life. The butterfly of fashion and the unfledged brainless flirt already spread her raven wings, to be shrivelled and drooping under the snowy robes of bridal eve. After preliminaries of custom were arranged, our heroine started upon her wealth of love with a sigh of impatience—her brain shifting scenes and colours like a kaleidoscope. Walking deliberately on to the soldier's retreat, turning from the street on which Madam Lefonier lived—at a distance she saw a martial figure with a circular of army blue folded around him, and talking at the gate of her friend's garden. Caroline, the ladies' maid, was a tall, very handsome figure, a dark Creolish mulatto, the favourite among the slaves. Caroline of old was pointing in the direction from whence Grita came. It was a cross street, and the corner half hid by beautiful trees. Three gables jutted through; the front of that remarkably dear old house stood fronting the same grassy slope of Ambleside. Its chain and railing clasped the paling of Lady Atholl's residence. At last Grita moved on towards him, and he strolled off from Caroline. His path had wound through the stillness of the quiet streets. A few steps past, and the scene was not new. Where they parted, there they met. Granville Rutland walked rapidly up as sweet recollections and the image crowded on his mind. The greenness of those scenes! "Is it to be the garden or the grave of hopes? Those vows to be ratified or annulled?" And there he stopped before Grita—she blushed beneath the gaze and voice of joy. Grita was paralyzed to feeling and surprise at his arrival. His heart was too full for words. His silence said more than if all the eloquence of language had flowed from his tongue. And, oh, so touching his voice and manner! Putting his hand in hers with admiring compassion, "Be calm, Grita; where shall we go?" he asked, gazing yet on her dark brilliant eye liquid with emotion. The silvery small sweet accent of her voice made him more anxious to know what might befall him. That train of inexplicable ideas, henceforth recollections exquisitely tender. In another moment he turned to her side and passed along the same old streets, quiet and deserted at so early an hour of morning. By his side, hand in hand, she clung, and continued the way to find. Caroline shrank back in the half-closed gate, peering in rapture at the success; for Miss Grita was belated; her hour of appointment had passed some time; so nothing short of a love-chase would answer his doubts and anxieties. The story of her warrior is thus: Colonel Rutland had called at Ayo House, rung the bell several times, and, unconscious of espionage—for Grita said she would be there at a certain hour, under the roof of her best friend, Mrs. Alice Foubray—rung the bell again. At last Caroline came in the place of the servant-man, whose office it was to answer the visitors' bell. The man by accident happened to be absent on this occasion. At the first moment of Caroline's appearance and truthfully honest face, Colonel Rutland was satisfied of her comprehension; and he anxiously sought to know particulars of the young lady. Nothing could be better. Miss Grita was the most special of favourites among Caroline's young missuses, and she a few years older than our heroine. Colonel Rutland dwelt so much on the unexpected disappointment, that, as I said, nothing short of a love-chase would answer his doubts. He urged on the servant, the kind-hearted, bright Caroline, the necessity of providing careful instruction. The danger was an adventure; and haunted by a struggling association, he vigilantly consigned the trust, as well as he desired, and explained the peculiarities of Miss Grita's case; and Caroline befriended him. "Wait," she said, "Marse Granville, in de parlour;" and she opened the door to admit the soldier. Absorbed in his revery, he paused. "No; I will come again." "But, Lor, Marse Granville, Miss Grita is soon to be here. She tole me she was gwine to her mantua-maker's. I knows whar dat place is. You may 'pend on me, I will do all for you I can." Discretion flashed across the servant's mind. "Wait, and I will go and see dat no one watches you." She sprang to the window looking into the court. Looking around with hurried glance, she detected a clew to the path he had taken. Having closed the door after him, he judged rightly, and, with a significant look, stepped from the old stone-flight into the avenue. Whither should he go? The officer turned the corner; and there the servant stood. Ah! a happy thought. All that surrounded him was strangeness and repose. On the place—what cared he so he caught his robin as she passed?—it was a famous spot. He was hid in the recess of the half-opened gate. Colonel Rutland's look was melancholy and apprehensive. He watched with the faithful Caroline for her coming. The servant stood behind the officer. "We are to watch for her here." "Stay, Marse Granville—stay; no one is nigh." "Why, she tarries!" He spoke gravely; and in silence they waited. Granville's passionate burst of grief and tenderness rose to his heart; for fate was brightening his prospects. He said, breathlessly, "Caroline, I seek my life. I am pursued. Can you save her for me? Help us!" he said with unsteady dignity. Satisfied with her answer," You shall have her yet, Marse Granville," he proceeded to tell his sad and troubled story; applying this faithful aid to their assistance. "I will not leave her. No, by heavens, I swear—although her soul be stained with guilt and shame, I will not leave her. She is my own. From my side her form they shall not tear." Under the gables of Ayo House the lover communicated his delicious secrets of first-love to the negress's understanding. Thus some moments were consumed. "Oh, she comes!" and he went forth to meet the nimble-footed fairy, as she stepped gayly along. "Then, for my sake, Grita, have you come to this place?" And she placed her hand in his, and answered, falteringly, "Yes." Upon that hand he placed his own: "For life, Grita!" he exclaimed with compassionate admiration; yet recoiled: "Another's!" 
                        "Tuned with stops of gold their silver string."
                     
                  
                  So they continued their way. The sound of their voices brought Caroline to the assigned position; and closing the gate with a gentle slam, she received her treasures, inclosed her place selected for their interview, and most proud of her charge, with a laugh of delight, she said, "Now, Marse Granville, you and Miss Grita can talk over de pass. Dis de safess place in de neighbourhood. Lor, Miss Grita, you's all right; ain't nobody gwine to hear. I done look—nobody nigh." As the lovers turned to enter the front of the house, Granville started to see on the place, within their very foot-fall, where they parted. There they met—the memory graven to the child-love—"under the Lindens." "There, Grita, I remember—there—your radiant smile, when, in the parting hour, I said, 'Be faithful; I will return again.' It was a conditional troth. Yes, how lovely grew the stern face of ambition! How fame seemed a messenger from me to you, in the sound of applause in the land of flowers! I said they cannot shut out the air that will carry that sound to her ears. All that I could win shall be my marriage-gifts to my queenly bride. Your image never forsook me. But, Grita, you never loved me. Thrown into the gay world, intoxicated by the effect of your own loveliness, my figure gradually faded dim.' Illustrious fashion!—sycophants!—young ladies' envy—finest match in America, eh? 'I hear your mother scheming. Your mother professed for me loyal relationship, and gave me the sunlight of my life, brightened out of the face of this Grita of old." He paused, rapt from the present hour itself by the excess of that anguish, which is to woe what ecstasy is to joy.
                  And mournfully she said: 
                        
                           "Oh! bid me leap, rather than marry,
                           From off the battlements of yonder tower! "
                        
                     
                  
                  Their old story seemed impregnated at sweet Alice's door; often the subject of the singular attachment and encounter of two most rare affections had been the subject of comment spoken of by the mother at Mrs. Foubray's residence, in Petersburg, when they were most intimate as neighbours, and long before devoted friends. Again under her roof, unconscious of espials, Caroline had received and conducted our hero and heroine into the parlour. "Hush! hush!" she repeated, glancing around the room, and stood a moment to congratulate the smugglers with most respectful politeness and deep feeling. She had listened to the great man's pathos. "I don't care now," said Caroline. "Miss Grita, nobody shall come in dis depository, and Marse Granville done got you now, marry him, chile, de fust love is bess." "Yes, good Caroline, they are depriving me of the only wealth I ever coveted." "My fair, gentle Grita! I say she shall not be forced into a marriage at which I yet believe her heart rebels. My claim is first, I will win her with my blood—I must ask, will ask without her mother's consent. I will take her as a stolen treasure. Get her for me, Caroline." Turning to his wild flower, he said:" To resign you, Grita, is to resign my life, my hope of heaven. You are mine. She was made for me, Caroline. So natural to me, I have thought of her as my wife so long." "And," he groaned, "given to another man!" Agitated with such emotions, he joined the young thing who sat on the sofa. Then the officer talked first to her and then to Caroline, who again briefly looked round, stirred the fire in a muffled way, and dismissed herself with their thanks for her aid.
                  With a smile Grita met his full gaze of devotion, and yearned to him she loved best. His alluring ignis fatuus was drawing the soldier through brambles—Granville fixed one passionate and reproachful look on her. She had tossed herself into a soft circular seat, and pointed to a chair. The raven wing folded around her. The bonnet still on, was l'air piquant. Her glossy braids shone out of that bonnet which nearly set him wild over her appearance. The bewilderment of love rushed from his soul into her flashing eyes. "Artless beauty?" said Granville. "You unnerve a man. Those coral-sprayed lips, those dark tresses in contrast to rosy cheeks, add a haunting picture to your face." With great emotion he seated himself in the chair she assigned. "My bright, my beautiful Grita, to resign you to that man!—to another, will likewise hope of heaven. Affianced by your mother? I can settle the affiance in spite of all. Fly back to the past, and return to my love; you confess to feel for that past, and if you will say that you love me, do love me, not all the powers of earth shall sever you from me—not even your unscrupulous mother. It is not honour nor justice to oblige your resignation of self to sacrifice." And then with a gesture of despair pair, he recounted his love as he sank from his chair and knelt in reverence before his ideal woman of innocence and love. His excitement was painful in the extreme. His face leaned on her hands, and he burst into tears.
                  "She was the woman who may justify even a soldier's tears."
                  The fervour of his eloquence was brilliant, as she placed her hand in his, with a low, sweet voice, which echoed like a charm. Full toned and melodious, love and sorrow rang every note during that rehearsal. Her look was gentle and compassionate, as the bright scarlet mantled her pale cheek. Recognize, fair reader, the ordeal—a man of such fascinations. "Can you save?" Like the life-boat that cannot brave the monster waves, he manned a boat—hero of destiny. On this frantic sea, amid a fitful gale, he dared brave deeds of strife for his guiding star. The heroine of destiny—launched her helpless skiff, and over the blinding foam, whirled through the dark storm, on those wild waves tempest trod. They stand on treacherous sands—their errand love, their only guides their own true hearts and God. In the charm of a small wainscoted octagonal parlour, the bright sunlight peeped under the drapery of two windows. The scarlet curtains mingled their colouring with the fine fire-light burning in the chimney. A delightful snugness threw an air of repose upon the warmth of our lovers. Granville ville Rutland drew his child-love to him with close embrace, heaving a sigh: "Dearest child-love, fly with me; my soul's love, my fortune, all that untold wealth can give, shall be yours. All that can live in earthly love, more than you can share. The luxury is great. It is a mighty love, Grita; I am here to elope with you. Fly with me now, this very moment, love, unwatched and assisted. Caroline will go with us. Come quickly. Fly with me, I, who love you so. I, who have nothing in the world, but you—I am here to hear from you, if you are indeed to be—another's!" She looked at his mind bordering on frenzy. Softly flushed, her cheek dampened with glistening tears. "Granville, dear cousin, read your answer, peruse my heart, on which your love is written, was long hidden there." While she heard his speech of cruel tenderness, her breath almost forsook her. She laid her hand lightly upon his arm, and said calmly, "Yes, affianced by my mother—cousin, dear Cousin Granville, I will seek to break my vow with her consent only. I feel by right I am yours, in heart and feeling, I am. But you came too late. And now you will not, would not love a traitress; my word, my honour has passed." Turning her meek face touchingly to her lover, "How could you esteem me as a wife, if I could forget I am a daughter; and unfaithful to bonds not lightly taken. Would or could you marry me after such a trifling vow? I fear not. To be lacking in the respect due a wife! Your prepossessing manners and brilliant eloquence are never to be forgotten. The chivalric compliments you so lavishly. extend, and the honour of your proposals, I will not and do not reject. The memory of your love is dear, very dear. Should the garden of this fresh old soil be the grave of our hopes, do me the honour to believe——I will first delay the marriage, made in haste, to be repented of at leisure! I bow gratefully to your warm pathos. Let not this presence sadden your happiness. Let us look to the unconquerable hope." And Grita unconsciously stretched her hand over her brow, but her fingers turned to raise courage on the forehead of her lover. Dashing his hair from his brow, said Granville Rutland, "I will hope to break honourably the entangled chain by which I am bound." Half-incredulous, Grita almost fainted at the thought. "Grita, my dear child-love, if you do love me, fly now. The eloquence of your eyes has haunted me through long years, they madden me now." He raised her hand, his eye dropped on the jewelled finger. Tenderly and remorsefully he looked on her, pointing to her ring, sparkling with diamonds. His whole senses seemed absorbed in the one sight. He gazed in speechless agony a moment, and was at her feet, praying—praying, "O God, forgive! the love I bear her is great. O heaven, make her min —she loves me a little. That your love is another's, I see its betrothal. No, my lovely Grita, fly with me, I cannot give you up. 
                        
                           "'She for whom my heart is burning
                           With a love beyond control,
                           She alone, that love returning,
                           Can quell the TEMPEST of my soul.'
                        
                     
                  
                  "Grita! do you hear me? That man your husband!—my blood congeals at it. But my claim is first; he must renounce his, or win you with my blood. What then, will you not fly?" Recoiling the while at the thought of his rival, he stalked restlessly up and down the floor. At last he flung himself on the sofa, appalled by his own irresistible spell-bound impulse of the soul. He rose and rushed to the window, looked out from its casement with bitter feeling; looked forth upon the spot as morn and eve hallowed it. There, where they parted, there they met. Her thanks were mysterious and profound. Belonging not more to the lovely than sublime, silent and still she sat. He resumed, with a kiss that was indeed pure and holy as a brother's: "Our love," and tears rolled from his eyes leaving upon her face, not yet dried, some that were not her own. "This hour was sealed by our battle-storm ring, a gem that circled my dying hand. Grita, dear! did you ever hear the message. I sent you by a man, our kinsman? Had he not been, I should have spilled every drop of his blood at my feet, for I raised the weapon to slay him, as he asked most impertinently for your ring. I felt a dark deed was coiling on his heart and memory, and hurled him from me. But, I said, 'Tell it. I yet am mourning its loss with my love, and hope to see her soon.' Ah, then came a volley of reports that stung me like an asp. 'The belle of sixteen summers,' &c. I can say no more but this: I could not breathe on my girlish flower, when her aroma was given to every man she met. But our battle ring! I fell severely wounded, and was carried off the field to die. A good brother officer watched faithfully over me. A glass of cordial gave to me the elixir of life, yet while I felt clad in the white shrouds of death. Fettered by the icy chains on a foreign land, life was ebbing away, and my friends gave me up as a dead man. I carried to my grave your image. Your dark eyes sustained my dream of life. Flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone, embraced me there. They feared it was over, and so did I; they raised the dying officer amid the shock and confusion of battle; I was almost gone, but survived a moment in agony. Words failed me as I attempted to speak. I taxed my faint powers to recall every word, every look that animated the current of long affection in that holiest hour; my tomb seemed fenced away as I received strength from undying love, and through the dimness of dying hours my tortured frame struggled with groan and grasped that one hope: the sweet dream of my youth burst before me and life. Grita! the soul lived before the God who was calling me hence. I trusted and hoped He would save me if I died, and prayed that if He set me free, Grita might be my wife. And God spared me as life smiled to me in those dark eyes. I lost my sight almost in that battle-storm, but the talisman grew brighter and dazzled the light, hovering around my dying grass-plot—my eyes opened on your ring. 'Pure offering of her heart,' I said faintly. I held it—as I was nearly in the world of spirits, I thought to meet you there. Last words were gasped to your memory. When I fell, Grita, it was slipping from my finger, from the place on that same finger where it had rested ten years nearly. I was alive enough, with the aid of my dear friend, who sat still as my watcher, to lift that hand and kiss the ring. I kissed it again, and with my strength lifted my hand and kissed again. Holding the hand of my comrade, I said, 'Take this when I am gone, and find my beloved one, Grita Marlborough; tell her I changed but in death,—fail not,' I said feebly, 'to find her, and say all that I send is love in life even to immortality.' Grita, you came so in life to me then, I felt you were near; my eye rested jealously on the ring, and I pressed it there, never more to part with the little thing. I turned to thee, Grita, as I was turned to slumber on my camp bed. The sweet soft voice restored me in those midnight reveries. Day grew brighter; your smile a lethe for the woe-wrought dreams. The hospital memoranda admitted these horrible episodes. But my pain and suffering were passed now, and from its pages; and that regimental patient is here now. Some months later, Grita, I arrived in New Orleans. I wore it still on the same finger, and never parted from memories both will carry to their graves. In the battle-storm from Jalapa to the last crown of fortune and victory, I had worn it glittering in all my triumphs—glories of the garnet ring. I reached in peace the city of New Orleans, worn and emaciated in body. I was able one evening, some time after, to attend the opera, with a young lady and her parents, army friends, General Crittenden, his lovely wife and daughter. Crossing the threshold of La Scala, I drew my white kid glove from that hand; with it the ring fell. Unconscious of its echo, I searched at the next moment, for I felt it was gone. 'Too late! Lost!' I groaned. It is ominous. I felt a shock like its battle-storm. My pretty friend and her kind mother were deeply concerned at my anxiety and distress, mingling their interest and sympathy with my searching hunt. Alas! in vain; it was gone!—that talisman gone! It impressed a dark shadow—a cloud over your pathway and mine. The chain was not broken; it only dropped. Miss Crittenden's curiosity and her mother's were aroused at my melancholy reveries. Most exactly I explained the sweet story of old. The evening passed; we parted, with best wishes and their sympathy. From that hour to this we have never met.—Too late!" he whispered. "Be comforted, dear cousin," said Grita. "A waif in existence, not a loss, to your great honour." "If I can." She replied, with a half smile upon her lips and broken voice, tears leaving lines upon her cheek, "Granville, I speak to your soul in living language. Though crushed to earth, our love shall rise again. It is an honour due my only parent to abide her laws. This business of my marriage plight seems her command, and God's command with promise must be obeyed. Mr. Oustan is the idol of her heart's wish, and to see one of her daughters that man's wife. He has honoured me—less deserving—and I am unconscious of the charm that won him. Three years' idolatrous love has watched generously over my stainless name—a superior being. I am proud of his friendship, with eternal feelings of respect, admiration, and gratitude. This is the sum I have for the husband elect. All was woven to our great sorrow, and chained to the grave of my dear father's death and misfortune. In those long years of unceasing devotion, Mr. Oustan has won gratitude, but not love; and he seems as happy to win my respect and admiration, and as proud and more so than some men are of their wives. But I halt between two opinions. I am proud and rebellious. I feel it is wrong; and since I saw you, all—all—every feeling for him that bound me is gone—gone forever! I shudder at my post. I am sickened. Duty has commanded me to pay the gratitude I owe—we owe. It alone saves me from flying with you now. Again, if I know what it means, Granville, to elope with a man is a moral wrong—the broken covenant of a parent's law. Vengeance will fall swift and sure. It is painful and galling to say what I feel on so solemn a matter. Truth is my element. Let me consider before I can accept your proposal. I shrink from accepting it hurriedly. Only self-respect holds in check an unbridled desire to run away; while I deeply deplore the circumstance of our fate, I say, wait; the impetuosity of your noble love will calm a little, perhaps; then you may not willingly elope or love me more." "My own beautiful Grita, I can say no more than to have related the dying hour of my life. The hopes that were crushed by false hearts, whose vile natures, like wasps, could only leave their sting; such have, from green-eyed jealousy, hoped to blast our lives with their festering tongues. That you are pure I can have no doubt. The extremity of my agony has been exposed; the keenest edge of suffering lies bare before you. One fatal regret is my most humble apology for being too late. I saw you. All came back in torrents of love. The vile act you are about to execute is a crime—a dark crime—barter for gold. Fly with me, or you will do terrible wrong—you will be lost!" And Granville shuddered while he stroked down her hair, calling her pet names. His voice trembled. He asked, "Decide, child; break your intended marriage; better for him—better for yourself?" Granville Rutland was not revengeful, yet he had not meekness which never resents. 
                        
                           "The grave majestic knight approaching nigh,
                           His countenance fell."
                        
                     
                  
                  "My dear lost child-love, believe me that the highest, the deepest, strongest love, the love that suffers to agony, the love that endures unto death, is of the soul,"—pressing Grita to his bosom—"Grita! if man can weep like woman, believe me." She clung to his embrace like a frightened bird, and large tears fell from her eyes upon his hand. "I am to think on this, you know, if I can. Oh my marriage!" she almost screamed, burying her face on his bosom. They wept sore. Pressing his hands on his forehead, he was fearfully pale, and in those mighty heavings and surges, he implored and urged her to fly now. Throwing himself into a chair at her side, he said, "You are forcing yourself—beware of that slippery step—not mated—you can't love him, I see. And by heaven, I will forbid the, banns. And I will, on his arrival from the Northern train. This evening he comes, and we meet as rivals. Grita, I shall win you by my blood." He laughed in frantic, hideous misery. "Duty of filial obedience! Take, Grita, take my gifts of laurels, blood-stained on the battle-field. I fought for you, and cast my glorious trophies at your feet—trophies of Mexico. All my titles, all my fame, my life, I will bare again to win my soul's best love. All! all I offer you, and you shall forget in the abundance of my adoring love, that ever other mortal loved you. First mine, you shall be mine." He saw her tears. Their woven drops of sorrow and love glistened over all. "This is a mighty love, Grita; can you, will you cast it away? Let me pour into your ears 
                        
                           "How wildly I love thee, O Grita,
                           How madly I love thee, God only can know;
                           Thy fate hath covered my path with pain,
                           Thy fate hath shadowed my life with woe.
                           A fair, dark-hair'd bride with eyes so bright,
                           
                              I stand and worship thee from afar,
                           As oft in the hush of drowsy night
                           I have worshipped heaven's most distant star."
                        
                     
                  
                  Granville grasped her arm: in a wild frenzied state he led her across to the window. She leaned on the chair and rested there. "Obdurate child, do not drive me away without a word—more hope. I will not go till you say that you will be mine again." His eyes shot fire over the glimmering room. "The chain dropt when one ring fell, no broken. For you will love me, my wife! not another's." Before them stood a solitaire table—on it lay the family Bible; Granville dashed open the contents, and placed his hand on the page as it lay, looking closely at its peculiar conception. Solemnly, devoutly he kissed it, as he said, "Grita! this is my oath to love and keep you unto me, so long as we both shall live. Take it on this volume of sacred writ. On this, God's sacred word, purer and holier than any words of man, I make my solemn vow. I have taken it for you, and vow before God and this Bible, if I am spared, to marry you, if not till thirty years of your life have gone. If a widow, a widow! and you shall or will be mine." Looking at her still, and kindling every spark of enthusiam with the genuine poetry and sublimity of his soul, Granville opened the Bible again at random, glanced down on a page to find a new leaf, grasping her hand, pressed it upon the immortal source of our sacred spring, "Here, Grita, there, child, lay on your hand. Bible, book divine, take her seal to my pledge! Indulge me, Grita, in this dedication of my ceaseless tide of love. Insert your bending fingers, gently clasp my strong embrace. What can cause effect so great. The swelling torrent of my weak resistance to meet my shattered hopes, I could not. Smile upon me. Do not give fuel to the awful flame. Moved by your celestial power, I fan the incense by heaven's own and brightest glory, clustering around God's holy word. Now, Grita, these honours 'tis the time to approve."
                  Such, reader, were the lines inserted in that family Bible, as laid on the table with those hands placed one over the other; they stood side by side, and gave in the sight of God's secret eye their very profound love. Fire engraved their altar on the round table, near the window in that room. "Hush, dear Granville," said Grita, in that awful and pathetic scene, prostrated by the grandeur and dignity of her heroic confessor. "How very sorrowful, how terrible," said Grita, "are the instruments of my business, accumulating so rapidly. The action is more complicated. I cannot concisely sum up my floating belief. Supreme and beautiful my engrossing wish. Granville, I shall gladly continue our examination of these measured lines. To my mother, God confided my care and protection. She bade me scorn you; I o'ercome her opposing mound. Your eyes behold my evidence, as trophy of reliance and honour to you. Let us pause like our torrent, and struggle, the stronger for the delay." Fair reader, when you yourself become a wife, a mother, and daughter, I pray God you may not by such alchemy learn the lesson of truth, trust, self-reliance. But that alchemy of love, that alchemy of faith, had power in its poignant dart. It was to test both. Heaven's most purifying incens fanned their animating blaze—subdued the descending storm about to sweep over their young hearts with scorching blast. But out of that chaos, stupendous luck shall answer from celestial leaves. And a leafy crown from that green, young oak, shall make a garland for our lovers, entwining the lindens. Before her judge, Grita struggled with every emotion of her strong nature. All came out in battle array, while the cold coil of alienation's icy band widened the gulf parting the filial from maternal.
                  Granville was seated again at her side, on the sofa. From the fury of that storm the calm had come, and both were long silent. "Grita," he said, "have you only desired to achieve greatness as a fortune-seeker, or be the unwilling bride? God spare me such a fate." Watching with a burning gaze her pale face and quivering form, he continued, in a subdued and melancholy tone, "Speak the truth, haughty girl—you will not marry? But, another! the mercenary, making convenience a disagreeable duty—a bad debt." Her brow crimsoned, her eyes blazed; she arose to her feet to answer. "Colonel Rutland, believe me inflexibly firm. I can soothe your anguish, for you cannot regret, as I do, the one fatal step. An impulse strong as life impels me in one direction; a power inexorable as the grave holds me back—insufferably hard to stand on the narrow isthmus." He dashed his hand to his head and paced the room. "I am not faint hearted, Grita." She looked tearfully on the resistless petitioner. "All," he exclaimed, "you have promised all in your power except elopement; that promised, and you are saved. All is ready, fly now! I will bear you in my arms away." Turning around, his face lighted up. "But this is not all, we meet again." "When, and where?" "As soon, oh, as soon as possible. A full, a lasting severation. Give me hope that it shall be broken by my earlier contract. To-morrow, is it not, that he comes? Another's! My God, have pity on me; I love her like my life, and better." Drooping her head on his shoulder, he strained her to his breast. The passion-fraught man bowed to her celestial power. "Do I deserve it? be my wife!" He pressed his lips to hers. From that burning kiss the tide of eloquence found way in words like fire. Shuddering from the rival, dismayed at his love-test, half frantic, Granville Rutland sprang from her side, and fled from the room, never to cross that threshold again, never. Grita passed out of the room, mechanically pressing her hands to her temples, trying to awaken from the heart-sickening dream, and she staggered up stairs to her friend's chamber. Sweet Alice was there, her sister, and mother. Grita opened the door and stood before them half demented. They looked with wondering sadness into her eyes. "What is the matter, Grita?" asked Mrs. Foubray. Her tender, loving voice unsealed the spell-bound fount of tears, and she wildly gasped, "My marriage now is awful!" Sinking upon the floor she dropped her head into Mrs. Foubray's lap. The storm raged hysterically; when it passed she was exhausted, and only able to rise and tell what had happened. The grief of those words live yet—the burden of that sorrow under which Grita bent. She rushed to the door to escape with Granville. "I will go—elope. I fear not anything, but to be married to one I do not love." "O Grita, listen to me," cried sweet Alice; "be calm; I will speak to-morrow to Madame Marlborough. Grita, beware the false step. Mr. Oustan is your mother's dearest wish; grieve not her afflicted heart, your widowed mother. Her love, her faith, her care of you, says beware of disobeying filial love. To crush that yearning prayer of your mother's now, would be wrong, it would destroy her health and happiness for life; your sorrow would be a divine vengeance. Innocent Grita, believe I feel for you sorely and deeply. I sympathize with you and your cousin, Colonel Rutland. Think, though; he may be only idling his day to gratify man's vanity. Now he is flush with conceit of laurels. Report tells hard stories of his unprincipled conduct to ladies. He tries for victims; and deserts them. Beware how you trust him, of all men. I do not believe, have not believed you care for or love Mr. Oustan in the least; but your mother's life and comfort is in your hands. Remember the fifth commandment, with promise. Take my love, with advice; wait, be careful, and see which is best." Grita, heedless of such warning or advice, dashed off to follow Colonel Rutland. As she saw him pass the window, such strange effect caused reflective comment and wonderment from the aged Mrs. Ayo, who sat rocking in her chair. The same smile rested on her face, a placid being, ever ready to soothe and make happy. She was one who feasted on home love. These only daughters, Mrs. Hintly, the sister of sweet Alice, and her husband;—before these dear friends, Grita threw herself into violent excitement of weeping, and vowed she would fly with him she loved best. "There he is, near; let Caroline call him back to tell him I will go. I know he is waiting for me to think—and he will come. It is not just in my mother to marry me so falsely!" "Ah but, child, the pledge is solemn, so near to man and wife; and your mother believes Colonel Rutland a villain, inclined to evil actions. You look so pale and haggard, take something to compose yourself. Your nerves are shocked. Tomorrow I will reason with your mother. The sacrifice is not right." "I will not fetter my choice in woman's dearest privilege, and blast a love I waited to give. She has done this, blasting his name." "But see, child, he left you, contented neither to hear or see after you, and now on the eve of marriage he tries to destroy peace and happiness piness by breaking a solemn compact." "I think it not so bright as you think. I am proud of and satisfied with him; it is enough," said the raving Grita, as she gazed after him from the window, before which she stood. "Let me ring for Caroline," said the sobbing child-love. "May she go. He is waiting to take me now!" She flew to the door, her hand on the knob. "Hold," said sweet Alice, in a tone of such reproach that it startled the wild heart on which it fell. "I wish I had never seen Mr. Oustan. I feel he will release me." That moment Caroline came in, bringing cordials. "Lor, Miss Grita, what dees tears fur? It is mighty awful, I knows, but what would Marse Granville think?" "Caroline, you forget," said sweet Alice. "Caroline, cease!" said her mistress, rather surprised." Why, my Miss Alice, don't let Miss Grita be so miserable. Oh, don't let her marry dat North man. Fuss love de best, Miss Alice; I done tole Marse Granville so—wait, Miss Grita. Miss Minho ain't gwine to make you marry dat ar North man. He shan't come to dis house, sartain, for I'se jist gwine to 'form him you is for Marse Granville. Shan't nobody take you but him. Marse Granville done ask me to help. I'll go tell him, so don't cry any more, Miss Grita; poor chile!" Grita bent tremblingly on her knees, and fell on the low couch. Mrs. Ayo, in her stately dignity, looked transformed, while she watched the progress affairs were taking. "Alice, what does this mean? I cannot unravel it, it seems rather discreditable. Ymataca Marlborough, believe your mother to be right. You are soon to be married, are you not? It is most gratifying to her; doubt not, she knows best. Let the past be forgotten. Alice, had we not better send for Madame Marlborough. This is very singular." Mrs. Hintly left the room. She was one of those gentle, placid beings, purely good—a beautiful example of piety. She seemed fitted for gentler spheres, not such stormy scenes in life, and life so young—the grief so full and gentle—and sorrowful feeling evidently wished that Grita and Granville should be married. From the reaction of this storm of feeling Grita languidly arose from the couch. "Sweet Alice," she said, "I have no interest in the false descriptions of my life; its mystery I am brave enough to solve—but courage is the question. Sweet Alice, I cannot, nor will I see my mother again; never shall I go among them. I will leave Mr. Oustan to hear of me as best he can. Ah, he is the only true one, who has respect for me, and I dare not leave him till I say what duty must involve. Sad as it will be, they will not miss the half-demented, selfish creature from their happy circles. I will be excluded. I'll fly with my cousin Granville, I'll go to find him. I will seek, I believe I can find something to do, if I am ugly and deficient. I will go into the world and carve out my own way, the goddess of independence. will not compromise myself for charity: humiliating poverty shall not induce me to accept his bounty. That will not smooth my path nor assist my career. I shall live to endure, to remember with natural resentment the outrage. Heaven forbid, in righting others I wrong myself." Grita stood before the embers of a fire, suffered to go almost out in the fury of such a storm. Her lips were silent, not her heart. Absorption of self in self, which alone promised endurance, and devotion to that just love. Colonel Rutland's rare and singular feeling, with his strong and beautiful mind, and character of manliness and exquisite tenderness, was well calculated to awaken the utmost love. "To-night I will see whom I will marry. In truth, I am not inclined to a runaway match with my cousin Granville. At that I hesitate—hesitate, to recover myself, for I am, by God's law and human judgment, bound to retract honourably. I must never cease to honour the man I respect enough to call husband. Even the few hours before he claims me, he will reject if I decline, in justice to honour and banished love. I love Granville! to James Oustan I am grateful. This, sweet Alice, is a thorn in my path, a cloud on my fate. From the morning lesson I shall live to endure that remembrance as sacred, pure, sublime, within your walls, beloved friend, and the scene must ever live—forever inexplicably sad, a living sorrow, suppressed love. The ashes of that fire will kindle to some great matter, and old love spring like a phœnix divine. A golden love will entwine from the sacrifice, and I believe Granville's soul and mine are coeval, on earth and in heaven," she said, clasping her hands over that heaving breast. "Granville says we shall be married, even if not till I am a widow. A startling sound: well-purchased love through hot fires of the refiner! Outcasts, we are driven from the virtue of her presence. I love him, and he loves me; too late. Seeks at a dangerous hour this discharge of stern duty. My warning is coiled up before our eyes; be faithful! Few, if any living heroine ever passed through such a fire. It could not have been more terrible; young, fiery, loving and trusting; hoping against hope, and in his almost absolute power of fascination, that alone bewildering. This bright link in their golden chain only grew stronger as they waited impatiently the next meeting—soon. I reflected on the passionate lover; most dangerous, it leads to hasty steps, the flash is fire and smoke afterwards. Does it not shine forth to her greater glory, when we recall the beautiful legend of the Rhine, where Leoline's orphan love to her guardian is lost in giving up gratitude to passionate love? The paltry offer is swift destruction. Let us wonder over Grita's resistance, and her justice and truth become immortal. Grita had lingered long, and was very resolved not to go—but meet the worst in the presence of one, her defender, and under the roof made holy ground by God's own will, as directly marked. Mrs. Foubray was a brilliant talker, and possessed a remarkable charm: with warmth and brightness on her face, both happy and lovely, winning and cheerful the loved words of her friendship. That generous and beloved Christian, yearning over poor Grita with unutterable fondness, while pitying, insisted strongly on the respect due the great powers. Terror-stricken, Grita was desperate at her situation; she seemed to alternate between light and darkness. In the light she appeared to move. Grita's heart grew so bitter in the depth of her opinion and their uninterrupted conversation, that she resisted every move to leave that lovely chamber till night; then, where in the wide world could she go? The bell rang; Caroline came up in a few moments, followed by a messenger from Madame Marlborough. It is done! her long absence had caused alarm and suspicion. Espionage saw the Colonel emerging from a stranger's door. The business of the wedding arrangement seemed to have forgotten the old love and old vows. An unusual excitement of scandal stirred the neighbouring tongues—anxiety for the recherché wedding. At knowledge of the runaway, it was full time for the fugitive law to be put into execution. Caroline stood pale and sorrowful before Miss Grita; Mrs. Foubray rose from the depths of an easy chair, and comforted the startled Grita, as she placed her arm around the tottering form of the sickened girl: her blue eyes kindled as they rested in pity and love on the weeping heroine. The figure of sweet Alice was slender, yet her features expressed both gentleness and power. "We are interrupted, my dear," said the soothing friend. Woolsey, the errand girl from Lady Atholl's, came in with her message, and a certain grim satisfaction issued from the black thick lips as she looked wistfully on the trace of sad gloom in Miss Grita's face. "Shall I go, sweet Alice?" asked our heroine. Her reply in tearful tenderness said: "It might be as well to send for your mother here." Woolsey retorted at once. "La! no! marm: Missus, your mar dun say you must jist come along wid me." "I dare not come between you. Go, my poor child," said Mrs. Foubray. "It is all for the best; trust in Providence. You will find sufficient consolation from that still higher power." From the ghastly pain of Grita's face she had no more power to gainsay or resist. How bitter, how resentful she felt at the moment, God only can know, and his grace was sufficient to soften. "Grita, I pray you will find everything more prosperous and your compromise prove a brighter one. I will help you—let me fold your shawl." "No, I thank you, I am rested now. But, sweet Alice, promise you will feel for me, and help me to break the unnatural for the supernatural love." Reverting to those sacred walls she said: "Remember your promise to help us; we placed our love in trust within your wainscoted parlour. Let it never be forgotten. Ah! how my heart yearns over that dread trial with unutterable fondness! How inviting your looks! how kind your voice! your dear old fondness I shall affectionately treasure." Recovering somewhat from her grief, Grita stood on that threshold meditating. They then went on together as far as the first platform—with a kiss they parted, and with the promise in her heart our heroine left Ayo house forever.
                  Following Woolsey, according to orders she proceeded next door. Ymataca nerved herself to bear her mother's wrath. The trembling girl reached the old stairs at Ambleside. Her face, if pale, was calm; it was impossible to divert her mind from its one idea, and the pursuit in prospect. She entered under the old clock on the stairs—" Watcher! the ides of March, remember!" inscribed under its massive case of oak. Half-way up stairs, she first heard the storm of reproach. The thoughtful girl listened with her brown eyes lifted to her angry parent. Her heart swelled and throbbed with feelings to which she could give no utterance.
                  
                     
                        "Blow wind, come wrack!"
                     
                     Macbeth.
                  
                  "Come hither to me," shrieked the voice of Madame Marlborough." I am horrified at your disobedience, your want of respect for yourself. Shameful conduct to such a man as Mr. Oustan. Granville Rutland deserves not the name of gentleman. I command you to forbid his attentions. Unprincipled as he is, mean and base-hearted, impertinent to me, disgraceful, forbidden. Remember, Mr. Oustan will come this very evening." Leading the way after this brief reproof, Madame Marlborough passed into the back bed-room, Ymataca as prisoner. "You are to receive Mr. Oustan this evening, as your intended husband." "I may not, mother," was her daughter's reply; her head not lifted, but her words came low and firm through tears. "I have changed my mind since I saw you this morning. I have told how unwelcome this engagement has been and is. Yes—I am resolved to break it, and tell him your influence and his own attractions, misconstrued confidence, has, with the debt we owe to his benevolence, mastered a hollow heart. Mother," said Ymataca, "I pray yon welcome our friend, and tell him I feel it due his honour and mine, to excuse anything so rash as our betrothal. Tell him it is vain to marry him, now another has come whose earlier claim I incline to, as I reverence the old vow and old love; nor am I heartless amidst my excitement, nor do I intend to play with his noble heart. But dying hopes are reawakened, and I would wish to spare hi the sudden anguish of disappointment. He is too worthy for such an end. My heart's affection is discovered. Safely it has been hidden, and is now presented a splendid monument of fidelity. I confess it has gained superiority over the stool of repentance. I am convinced Mr. Oustan would prefer the venture of my discardure." "It is too late for such considerations," replied the husky voice of the mother. "But never too late to mend. Promise me quickly, Ymataca, if you wish to have me live or die in peace, that you will marry as you are obliged by every law to do." Madame raged to greater excitement. "I shall indeed speak with him: you are not worthy such a man. Disappointed hopes, blasted affections, etc. What for? Who for? That contemptible man? He will rob me, rob you of honour. A depraved enemy, I despise his impudence. A club should level his sword, were I in Mr. Oustan's place. I do not believe he will marry you; such a brainless, fickle, heartless creature. But I solemnly assert not a word shall pass between you and Granville Rutland, who cares only to win your love, if he has ever tried; but to reject your weakness on the eve of such a marriage. Turn away from that bond you shall not." That dart went deeper, and the wound will never heal. "'Twas cruel to be thus accused." "I comprehend no such sentiment as you express for that vain scamp." Madame Marlborough's face was pale, her haughty head was thrown back, immovable as if it had been carved in stone. 'Twas in this attitude, her proud and resolute gaze never flinching or wavering, her cold, unfeeling voice uttered her plea. "Ymataca, I am so astonished! I scarce know what to say. It is most strange. I don't understand the dislike to the alliance with a man who adds so much dignity to his many virtues. I request you, with a mother's wish and deep-felt interest, that you marry Mr. Oustan. Why wait to feel this so late, and denounce honour, and truth of promise? That infamous, unprincipled cousin is the cause. I denounce his relationship with intense contempt. I see no principle in the effeminate tradition of your presuming past. Absurd notions! See him if you dare! Indignant at his intrusions, if chains, if my authority holds good ever again, per force you must yield to my higher commands." "Mother," she pleaded, "withdraw your prohibitions, and let me go." Madame Marlborough questioned, and learned nothing decidedly of Ymataca's plans. She wilfully dared to assert that no power would cause her to acquiesce in such a prohibition—the proud, haughty child concealing Granville's devotion and her own faith, yet stunned by her mother's fatal decree, which was as hardening lava poured over a burning heart. The chance of danger was evident—chafing at the non-committal. The mother crossed the room with quick, but tottering steps. She, whose mind and actions for life were paralyzed, apathetic, depending for every move and counsel upon Minho and Mr. Oustan, now became restless and active—recovering her strength, sadly gone, pacing along, wringing her hands, and speaking rapidly to herself. She stopped. "Ymataca," she said, "will you leave me desolate? It is hard. Yes, you must!" she continued, while urging redress for this dimness of honour. "I am conscious of the misty morals of that man. I hope he will be made to suffer for coming between me and my object. Out of my sight your camp watchings! I loathe him—would as soon see a toad." Grita knew what he was suffering for her sake. "Yes, you multiply his chances—condescend to accompany him—a desperate game—you should ignore his proffered society. This morning the mystery comes out," said the breathless mother in astonishment. "The repository of business, plotting, concealed, transacted confidentially, I regret to find justified by our next-door neighbour, a friend I loved so well." That touch-stone aroused her most vehement claims to increased anger. Strange woman! "My old friend furnishing your private seclusion with the misty morals of one not worthy her acquaintance. Under her roof, aware as she is of your announced engagement, she interests herself in these unprincipled attachments. I relinquish all tie of friendship and acquaintance with Mrs. Foubray. It must ever be a rankle in my mind. It shall never be forgotten. She might have known better than insulting my dignity, and should have had greater knowledge of your wayward, vacillating professions. Without disguise further than privacy, you are allowed to conceal yourselves in her house! I am resolved to tell her how she has been acting, and at once withdraw my confidence. By appointment, under her confidence—I scarcely think it. Such friendship is impertinent," said Madame Marlborough, with a gesture of dislike, excited by infinite surprise. She resumed her chair by the window overlooking Ayo House. Bursting into a fit of crying, she asked, "Speak, my child; will you rob me of my claim? Robbed by a man I loathe! I say he is dangerous—a fatal involver of your honour in this step you have taken. You take the right! Where was his fidelity before he saw you? It is conceit, it is misty. He will leave you a tortured delinquent; beware the fifth commandment! Granville Rutland tramples on woman's love as an atom in his balance of selfishness and villany. I tell you from my deep agony, I would rather see you in your grave than his wife, or that you should ever see him again. Gladly would I seal your life in a prison-house, in a cave, sooner than he should see you, or ask another word from your lips. Dare you trample your widowed mother's wish in the dust?" A wild look came into her eyes as she set them full on her trembling child. Ymataca' face expressed but scorn and indifference. Almost froze into stony hate, in comparative silence, her white fingers clasped, as cold as a statue, in duty bound, expecting the incarceration; with all this came the dizzy weakness and keen anxiety pressing on her of the coming trial, the meeting of the rivals. Her perceptions became sensitive of anger and violence. From the beating of her heart came the roll of heavy artillery—drawn swords—serious injuries—the fall of one, perhaps the blood of both bathing her name. With an unutterable groan, she saw the gathering fever, and expression of pain adding to other distress at the sound of angry words. Disappointed hopes, the acute suffering of the present, dark apprehensions of the future. Disputing by inflamed blood. Frightened alike for herself and them, she hoped to intercept the catastrophe. In this darkness, that despairing look of Granville's came up. Her cousin loved her at the last as he had loved her at first—words of that old love from his breathing lips prompted her return. She loved him the first, she loved him the last. Her cousin should not die there on her behalf, nor would she see him in bloody danger on her account—the heavy club on that sword-arm, but pinioned by the stars and garter of woman's influence. Ymataca's eyelids slowly opened; at liberty to rise, she shook off the stupor, and began to defend, desperately defend the charge thrust at Mrs. Foubray. It was finished with deliberate candour and calm obligation toward the roof and the beloved occupants, while Ymataca was too proud to notice the implied aspersions on sweet Alice. She was ignorant as well as her mother of the visitors in the parlour. As it is, no blame shall be laid at her door. "Let us telegraph, mother, telling Mr. Oustan the worst; for I will save my cousin a bloody interview," were our heroine's remonstrances. "Never! child. I tell you my decision remains unalterable. Ymataca, reconsider your vehemence. A jail allowance, if you will attempt to divert my mind—my irrevocable duty! You forget a mother's heart: her curse falls on the disobedient. Will you harden in crime against my law and persuasions?" "But if it will make my whole life miserable, will you force me to marry him? I waive all honour due your widowed wish as mother; but, for mercy's sake, in justice to us three, let me write for a postponement or discardure. He will then admit it as truth and honour. Mother, I cannot think myself uncomprehended. This is a minute investigation. Examine. I am sure it is wrong," said the afflicted daughter. "Your balance is in favour of my demerits. Courted and flattered as I have been, I am yet scrupulous of retaining rights belonging to another." She started up from her seat, with a wildness almost of insanity. "It is hard!" said Ymataca. "What's hard?" asked the mother. "Spare me unnecessary annoyance by your mad vagaries." "Yes, hard for man to love woman, as he loves me, without hope; nor will he, nor I, submit to these consequences without a struggle. As strong as his love, so will mine be. He is waiting to take me away from your sight. The evil of my continuance lies on your shoulders. Let me go, and you shall be ignorant of your erring child. Other sisters and brothers will fill the place I am not worthy to occupy. My childish faults have always been exaggerated into evils. This the stumbling block: trained to respect you in word and deed, the highest of human influence; and to enforce your instruction is a feudal right. Your curse falls upon a hedge of memory. Sport at it as you will. That time has not, cannot chill. I cannot rest," said Ymataca. Her eyes dilated as they filled with tears; looking upon Madame Marlborough, her eyes heavy with late weeping—it was a picture never equalled;—sitting upright in a large easy chair, with commanding dignity and urbanity—faded, alas! to the face of her middle-aged parent, whose fine features were not unlike the man of history. Her hair now much silvered, and combed back to where her widow's cap rested, unmistakable determination, force, and indomitable will was shown in every lineament. But look, reader, upon the pallid cheek and trembling frame of her daughter, near by in another chair, or stool of repentance. "Just as you please, mother; I have asked a release. If I am obstinate, I cannot retract; for it suggests a remedy for an evil, of the existence of which I was unconscious till now. Will you shipwreck our three lives, by weaving forever fears and regrets? I am sure you will not force me into marriage." "Pooh, pooh! child," was the apprehensive mother's reply. "Pooh! You will find that you have been magnifying evils to yourself. You are, and naturally enough, in a nervous and agitated state. That impudent thief has robbed you of your reason. Your clever instrument is not sharp enough, Ymataca, to cut our Gordian knot. Go, go!" she said, "if you dare contend with God's commandment and highest human laws—my government—which no argument shall destroy. Yes, go!" and raising her hand, with scornful derision—a wild look from her eyes, almost exultation—"but I give you no blessing. God's curse on my disobedient, undutiful child! He will repay. Can you go under my curse?—while I pray the thorn of remorse might prick deep in your heart, and all sorrowful things befall you, if you cast away my long-desired object; that in the long years to come you may reap the harvest of wretchedness. I consider Granville Rutland the instrument of evil. His arrogant presumption and impertinent interference shall linger forever against any previous good opinion. My triumph, to oppose his abominable standar —my only fear, lest my utmost efforts will not punish his wrong upon Mr. Oustan and myself. It is all in vain, Ymataca, to contend against my advice. Filled with anger and power, by violence and chains you shall remember my wish is government. Authority as strong as his perseverance will settle our claim."
                  "I love, and shall I leave him?" "Ymataca," hear me." Madame Marlborough paused a moment, trying to steady her voice. "It is positively useless to grieve at my decision; you cannot doubt the disinterestedness of my counsel. And, too, while my own prospects are so brightened by your safe shelter. Honoured and wealthy you have it in your power to be, and your own home our rendezvous. Be reasonable, Ymataca. A little crown of riches and happiness, a home, a reunion of the widowed mother and your fatherless sisters and brothers. How can you change such paths of pleasantness"—"For peace," replied the tested woman. "Only look on me, your widowed mother; left with five penniless children, a small allowance, and few opportunities for another competency; no home. Can you be unwilling to shelter your afflicted family? It is not right that you should. I will have no hint at delay. So make up your mind to a speedy marriage, without another such stormy interview, or a solitary cell in the prison-house shall be your home."
                  Starting into action from her statelier bearing, the imperious mother felt her victory was complete. "Only obey my voice," she repeated with a gentle, compassionate tone; "Ymataca, child, only obey my voice." Adversity had been a fierce struggle—for the wealthy woman, as we can see too well, a death-blow. It left her, as it usually does its prey, somewhat chilled, somewhat hardened to affliction, passive, but bereft of hope. She was one, an exception from any rule, never resigned, yet ever looking for the worst. But now, to her benefit, not a day was to be lost upon her sheltering desire, to secure entirely the very man she had chosen for her simple-minded daughter. Let us remember to do him the credit to say he chose for himself. Surely the innocent girl was confused at her crimes. For she felt they could be nothing less, to excite such vengeance. Parental impression left its effect. Cassandra-like, her talk would have destroyed the courage of a brave man. While we think of the stately bearing of her parent, the troubled and embarrassed look of the child boded no happy future. The sacrifice kindling in a young heart, with Isaac-like belief she unflinchingly carried the fire; setting aside the selfish hope, the barbed arrow of that weighty heap pierced the warm soul to ask, Where is the gift—my very life? God will provide a blessing on the promising command.
                  The struggle in Ymataca's heart was fierce. The die cast, a look of joy came into the conqueror's queror's eye as she approached the bedside, and addressed the pale face which shrank from her keen and haughty look. "Ymataca, are you sleeping?" putting her hand on the cold statue of her child. Ymataca started from the bed erect, confronting the inquiry. Forcing back her tears, she listened. "Promise! say that you promise. It shall be. Quickly say that you strike a death-blow upon your only surviving parent—or shall we live together? I shall never believe that Granville Rutland loves you, or that you either love him or dislike Mr. Oustan. It is a fancy." Not for a long time did she answer. The cold clear eye kindled at suspense again." Rest on my word. All is well. "After a choking pause, a deathly agony swept over the fair young face. She promised: would that mother live to regret the victory she then achieved? The decision was sadly unnatural, she saw. "You make my life very happy, my child; my daughter, it is best." Looking into Ymataca's face she could not meet her eyes. Thus perilled her future! She lisped again: "Mother, can you forget I give a hollow heart?" "His love will fill it, my child." As the storm-fiend swept on, an echo rent her heart. "I'll try again to see him!" Still deeper and deeper she carved his name; 'twas done for an issue; it stood the rude waves and wild tempest's blast; on the rock he rises. The mother says, "God bless you, Ymataca! we shall all love each other, and find a home with you." The blessing whispered so faintly she hardly caught its meaning. "You have made my life happy." In rushed Lady Atholl, beginning to suspect something of the truth. "Well, to be sure, after all, I hope, Minho, Ymataca will escape this ridiculous misfortune, owing to the headlong artifice; for I know Granville's honour in love matters is desertion, his principles dim. He will drag you to want; and, child, your mother's word is justified, her resolution is for your good. Do not subject yourself to his daring intrusions: we know Granville Rutland to be a black-hearted man. Heed not his procrastination now, on the eve of marriage with one whose noble virtues adorn his dignity. Minho, I should hold in duty bound the right you have to exercise your power. I should have not a day's delay. For that atrocious libertine—it is senseless stuff, giddy, fickle girl, in a web with a venomous spider," laughed Lady Atholl. "Ymataca don't know where to find a brilliant match. She will pick up a broken stick, and both go to ruin together." Lady Atholl was a bustling and curious woman, and one who, in this momentous question, evidently flourished in to support her favourite cousin's claim as a mother with a daughter, who might naturally feel repugnance under similar circumstances. Lady Atholl and Madame Marlborough both indulged in endless expressions of wonder, surprise, and regret that Ymataca should be quite so foolish. Their unchanged minds determined she should avoid al appearance of concealment. "Minho, rest assured we can really restore this silly flirt. Come, cheer up, Ymataca; be gay. This is unreasonable, it is ungrateful. Do not submit to such heartless projects. Your mother is right to prevent your seeing that unprincipled cousin. You do not deserve God's providence nor care, if you reject such a prospect and deny your widowed mother's wish. You have exaggerated your fancy, and suppose that Granville is half in love with your irresistible charms. Oh! he tells every woman the same. Pretty vanity! It is a way of his. You craze your mother, child, with anxiety, clinging to such wilfulness. What would the world say? Pausing now to listen to imagined love, when almost married to another. I defend your mother's right." "I do not pretend to be very wise," Ymataca replied, without looking at either of her judge advocates. "At all events, we understand each other. I have, I know, promised with a condition." Lady Atholl began with something like wonder, at the possible terms of their slight acquaintance. "To accept his notice is treachery to your benefactor, a shock to your mother's power and influence; like a wild wintry blast, it will ruin you forever. Reflect, Ymataca, it is a solemn duty." She started from her seat in silence. So long had she endured her mother's sneers and snarls, and long-eared railings for misdemeanours, and borne up with a kind of meekness. This is mockery, felt Ymataca, and ceased to weep before such hardened hearts. The month had done its work of years on her young life. The buoyancy of her spirit sank beneath the cruelty of combined forces, to crush to earth by open contempt and ridicule her nature and hopes. 
                        
                           "Some by their word their thoughts reveal,
                           And some use speech but to conceal."
                        
                     
                  
                  Madame Marlborough thanked her cousin Kate Atholl for the pains she had taken to establish her cause. The questioning and cross-questioning as to the state of poor Ymataca's heart was butchery of inquisition. Ymataca's tearless eye glanced round the room with sudden wildness, marking each object. There all she had been accustomed to but—want of harmony! The lady advocates relieved our heroine's sorrowing silence, as well as it was possible, by words of courage and smiles of approbation at her dutiful behaviour. You may know, reader, our heroine came out of that room changed, sadly changed, changed for the future; the present was done—as the door is opened upon brighter scenes than those just witnessed. The warm admiration of their interest in the sad-looking bride elect excited a double share of flattery. Judge advocates, with their victim, joined the sewing party in the front chamber, where many were chatting in a gay and joyous strain. Her bridal robes were strewn around in rich abundance ance for inspection. The artless Ymataca was sold, to be claimed at the altar by the solemnization of marriage. Mr. Oustan would take possession of the beautiful picture on the 20th of January, her eighteenth birth-day;—the bill of lading to be signed by her parent, to whom she owed her life. In consequence of the late bereavement, a quiet sale was expected. The air of that chamber became oppressive to Ymataca, half conscious, half stunned. Every word cut as 'twere two-edged. Her spirit rose against their sympathy. Happily, she fled from the conspirators, as none of that company approved her conduct, and disliked, with undisguised agreement, the habits and fancies of the bold-faced intruder—such their term for our gallant Colonel. Ymataca was sinking into despondency, pining beneath the wrestling of her mind against her fate. Compelled by the power of acute sensitiveness, she moved like an automaton towards the hall door;—forgetting a moment that she was tied by strings, she turned, pleading fatigue and headache. Seeking the upper chamber, she passed on with a shudder, reached the hall, and approached the gable window at the bottom of the second flight of stairs. Her eye, glancing by, rested there. "There is Granville, now!" almost shrieked the half-mad girl. A startling distinctness for a few moments overpowered her. Unmindful of her, his drooping flower, at that window, Granville was lost in intoxicating dreams at variance with the hasty wedding. With a wistful smile, mingled with apprehensive looks, she was whispering to herself, "I will try again!" She lingered there, standing one foot on the stairs, ascending. The empty mockery of her bridal garments is there. She turned, and glancing round, as if very fearful of being pursued and attacked, speaking to him softly, looking at him timidly, watchful and waiting. But the terrible conviction—" Bound to the mother's feudal right, and to another! Did I promise too?"—with a shiver, "Apparently, yes. On this threshold of marriage, I stand looking forward with hope to my chances of joy. Ah, happiness! There, at the corner of that old house, so well known to childhood's days. And yet, no such charm was ever there so attractive before." Unable to escape, Granville was near; those eyes seemed to cry out, "Be mine! you were mine first." The soldier's tear fell mingled with her own. Oh, heaven, the morning lesson! and the room at Ayo House murmured like music; came with its martial air fresh from its birth-place, unhurt through the battle-storm. Nothing could exceed the delicious fragrance of that gladdening prospect. Prisoner in her gilded cage, the portionless girl soon to be the rich wife! Remember that corner, friend reader, it is an important annal of her history. Lightly Colonel Rutland rested his arm against the gray wall enclosing the ground of the triple residences on that one square. From corner to corner, the chain a cement. As I have noted, the officer was unmindful that his lily-bud bloomed in yon casement. For hours of suffering had passed into the decline of day. Detained by a nearness and by the promise of a post-ponement of her marriage, if not the immediate dissolution of her bonds—trusting for years of happiness in store for both, he paused there to remonstrate at the dread ceremony, the torture of his mind contending for the mastery. Keenly, suspiciously he eyed these premises, as if fearful of a sudden change. Shuddering at his, Mr. Oustan's, presence—it induced him to watch, beware—to have a bloody interview; one must fall to win the trophy. Granville waits impatiently to tell him that the disclosure must soon be made, rendering Mr. Oustan's further attendance useless. Selling her purity for gold? Never! his wild-flower was an exotic of priceless worth. Colonel Rutland's heart revolted at this, as we know. There he stood before her, with blanched cheek and haughty mien; the blue veins on his brow swelled, the curl of scorn upon his lip, as he spoke almost aloud, "I will not, cannot leave her, though she discard me now. I cannot calm myself, Grita; you have brought the past before me; no other ear has heard, no other ear shall hear my hoarded secret, so many years hushed to its echo. Grita! you stirred my very soul, from the first moment of our meeting. You are mine—the living image that soothed my lonely hours on the tented field, in the battle-storm, and in the bivouac around the camp-fire. Hear now, my dark-eyed love, hear my woes. Weep over them with me; you have recalled the past, you must hear its history. I will not think her a coquette; only a dear, warm-hearted, wayward child, sensible and generous. She is indifferent, but she is grateful to this firm friend, and has been urged and persuaded to accept his suit. She revolts at him, shuns his fine gold. Grita is unconsciously playing the coquette; feeling preference, yet pretending indifference; sowing the seeds of sorrow for herself and others. I may spare my eloquence," soliloquized the officer. "She tells me to have hope; I'll try, try again." Granville paused, whilst a sadder expression came over his face, proudly striving to master his emotion. "Grita, do not leave a doubt, next time we meet—soon? Is it—is this worthy of you? Will you for a punctilio throw away your happiness? It is a riddle to read." Starting from his reveries, he forced a smile while his heart wept. The slight accident revealed the danger. The secret confessed, "Here then, there! I am to see the husband of my love. I meet a mother's wrath! I see Grita before the altar, in a bridal robe, vowing to the living, falsehood. No! no," exclaimed Granville. "Mine she shall be. Young, gay, and beautiful, her fatal gift, those innocent charms. Was it my doing? In sight of my misery unmoved, wretched fate! Years of long suffering caused my delay. Consider the fastidous delicacy of maidenhood, and a new truth increases strength." The cousin officer, uttering a profound sigh, sank back against the cold railing, as he pressed his hand in silence to the swollen veins of his forehead, painfully sensitive, deciding it would be impossible to live without her. Was there not something too earnest in his manner for mere jest. But the amiable neighbours were surprised at the street show of affection. It awoke annoyance at the flirt's caprice, if nothing worse. Their scanty sympathy she was too proud to receive. At that window, Grita was gazing still and silently on Granville. He was looking like a monument of agony. Like Marc Antony, he bowed to the wild, loving, artless Cleopatra. The very earth on which he stood was cold and hard as frozen. The heavy gables cast their shadow on Granville's brow, and echoed the song of his heart's sweetest strain on the winds of the lindens. It bore the words, 
                        
                           "My dark-eyed love, be glad!
                           Has Granville's song no music now?
                           Is there no spell in Granville's smile?"
                        
                     
                  
                  Her answer rang its soft cadence to his heart, and his ear caught the notes:
                        
                           "There are wild roses in my hair,
                           And spring and morn are in their bloom,
                           But you have breathed their fragrant air
                           As some cold vapour from the tomb.
                           I took my lute for one sad song,
                           I sang it though my heart was wrung,
                           The wild sad notes we've heard so long;
                           You never smiled though Grita sung."
                           
                           "Nay, speak not now, it mocks my heart;
                           How can hope live when love is o'er?"
                        
                     
                  
                  Not the tempest, but the small sweet voice of her influence conquered his very pride, and bowed him to weakness.
                  "I love her, and shall I leave her?" A step was heard. Her hasty glance observed his course. A well-known voice approached, and his peculiar smile was very pleasing, and Harry Atholl leaned forward to raise the bending figure leaning against the palings. Turning to his cousin, he seemed to offer aid. Harry stopped, and joined hands with our hero. For a few moments they stood in a confidential manner. Mr. Atholl was coming up to dinner, at Ambleside, the young heir of several estates. He was a fair-haired, light-complexioned man—a slender form of three and twenty years. Granville's courage was reëstablished by the warm assurance of Harry, mingling sorrow and affection with his sympathy, understanding the sentiment. Granville clung to Harry's arm for support as they walked away, Harry listening ing to his words of ardent love and touching regret, as the officer confided the story of that morning's interview. Still leaning on Harry's arm, they walked up under the front window of Ambleside. They both raised their eyes in her direction, but Grita was gone. He had not seen her under the gable. "I am here," he said to Harry," agonized by the past. I am to see the husband of my own guiding angel, the only woman whose ear has ever heard my love, or ever shall. I cannot see the picture—it is horrible—her mother's wrath. And she, my lovely Grita, sold for gold! Never! Harry," he whispered hoarsely in his ear, "one must fall; do you hear that? A contest. I love tenderly—she loves me a little. I will, by the help of God, win her. But one memory, but one love." Harry listened to the tale so harrowing, and begged, urged that the officer would drive such thoughts away. He was overcome by sweet and mournful remembrances, for he felt life was deprived of half its hope and all its pleasures. He sighed, "Mine no more! I cannot, will not rest." The soldier groaned beneath his sorrows. Both hearts were painfully touched. The Colonel became silent and thoughtful. He reverted to the old story, with its beginning from her childhood—now ripened into passionate love for the woman. "She is not cold, nor is she calculating; she loves me, loves me the best. Will she, must she be another's? Unwind the puzzle for me, Harry, for mine she shall be."
                  Harry strove to dispel the shadow on his cousin's brow, as they passed the next two hours beneath her front window, where she usually sat. Arm in arm they stroll opposite, up, then down that square on Linden Avenue. "Relieve me of my heart's pain—O Harry Atholl, help me with my love!" He turned his majestic head to watch her coming in any way. 
                        
                           "Rail on—and I must bear;
                           The tongue of malice has no sting."
                        
                     
                  
                  "Let them discover our attachment," said Grita, her eyes resting on that object, leaning there, as she breathed the haunting sweetness, and his senses stealing along in floating fragrance to her—from her to him—still unconscious how closely her eye watched his position. There now, there again, hovering on the border streets; the hopes and fears, the dull pain settling there again. Again it trembled back as if it had not been—for an instant vanished, flickering across the leafless trees to the gloomy shadow seen on that spot of sunshine. An iron band seemed to bind across her brow, as her eyeballs ached with eager looking, to note its worth on memory. She looks on the garden, the lawn—the voice she loved to hear broke the spell, as he caught the sympathetic sound of Harry Atholl's desire to move on, his kindly spirit striving to soften the stroke. Then her wild star of destiny vanished from her sight. She bowed her face upon her hands and wept long and bitterly. 
                        
                           "And one replied,
                           But not the voice she pined to hear."
                        
                     
                  
                  "Beware of Granville!" said one, as the imperious Madame Marlborough gasped: "Here is Ymataca now standing at the window, watching for that insolent man. Do you dare to affect innocence of the presence of that man? I am not to be trifled with—breaking your promises just given. If I can ascertain this deception is to extend beyond another hour," said the mother, fixing her eyes straight on Ymataca, with a threatening look, "you shall be confined in a prison-house, else I take you both in subjection immediately. Do not be surprised at any force. I am disgusted. Either you are dreaming, or sudden dethronement of projects has disordered your brain." Our heroine's eyelids trembled, and her colour changed. Presently she raised her eyes, with a look of defiance and resentment: "Respectfully yet firmly I say I shall see him again, and shall leave the house to do so." Madame remonstrated against this unheard-of departure from her promise, and flight from her presence in the front room. "A deception! Your headache to enable you to meet him halfway." "I promised on conditions, mother. I am going," replied the tortured girl. "I must. have facts at once. I will not allow such proceedings," said her parent. Calling a servant who was passing through the hall, Madame asked Lady Atholl to speak with her a moment. She soon arrived at the fatal window-scene. The judge advocates looked at each other. "Kate, what do you think of this caper? This very window opens a clew to their villanous plot. My daughter is bewitched. This her excuse: an elopement from our company to give him surety for his swift return. There, he was waiting her signal." "Certainly," said the wise Lady Atholl. "I tell you what it is, Minho: I should set my mind at rest on this affair, by keeping her under a strong guard; for in a few hours she must decide, as Mr. Oustan will be here to claim her; and we shall soon witness the engagement, by marriage. I do hope, then, Ymataca, you will be cured of this dangerous habit of unscrupulous flirting." "Kate, he has just gone there, at the corner of the Windrows. He has been standing lurking around. What does he mean? "They entered the front room. They passed from the hall, into which two doors opened—one admitted through the bed-room. A loud clatter of tongues was chiming, and ringing laughter from the sewing party—at work in high spirits for the marriage. Our heroine raised her hand to her brow, feverish and cold, as if it might lighten the early pressure of sorrow; but she contrived trived to sink behind the curtained bed. Our heroine's spirit bowed beneath the hourly vexations to which she was exposed, and from which she saw no escape. At that moment several voices screamed, "There he is!—the man of misty morals—and she will throw herself into his arms, whether outstretched or not." "There is Granville Rutland, expressing his affection, and watching these windows." "She sees him!" chimed the chorus. "Secret for secret!" Our heroine's tears fell faster and faster. "Was he there passing, and she could give him no hope?" Her bold wanderer, leaning on Harry's arm, looked up, eagerly seeking to know if Grita's glance was upon him. All this gave much interest to the gossips among the neighbours. The post-captain, Harry, resolved to be aide-de-camp to the command of Granville. Anxiously that day elapsed to this hour of afternoon; and could he hope to achieve his object, weary from his trembling hopes? "I know," said the officer, "there is danger," and stood awhile opposite, with an air of anxious expectation, while the fair one peeped flashing looks through her barred window. The gentlemen looked for some time silently at each other. The strange coincidence of events made a deep impression on both. "Let them discover our attachment," said Granville. "Facts!" ejaculated Madame and Lady Atholl, as they suddenly found to their annoyance the silent figure bending on her chair, and that she had procured another situation to give answer to his call. He raised his head just then, with a look which seemed to have been gratified. "If you will exchange this confidence against confidence, Ymataca, an awful penalty awaits you. I cannot understand this," said the enraged mother; "he is here! opposite! they see each other. I am shocked, ashamed." They all said, "What scandal you will cause!" And this view was speedily conformed to their expression of arrangement. The roll was called, a file of bodies and heads, large and small, were placed in each open place, such as windows and doors. At the short range, their force was sufficient to impel the internal project. The barrier diminished. The opposite shafts were stilled by the white and black loop-holes. The sisters and cousins drooped their ports, as the man-of-war evaded the range, eternally putting an end to the heart and eye battery for that day.
                  Madame Marlborough pointed to the door by which they had entered this prison-room. Ymataca's strength was not equal to her will. She groped with her icy hand the path chalked for her to follow. The parent and daughter reached the upper bed-room, to which our heroine started some hours before. Our heroine sank on a chair, by the door that shut in a middle room, faint and trembling. Her unfeeling mother recovered from the shock a third time, and decided most determinedly minedly on her future. The tool of the bold-faced monster was left alone, as an erring child, to reflect on her crimes, as well as prepare in time for dinner. Whither could she flee? She knew too well the difficulty of procuring a situation, and she was the last one to remain under weight of obligation or burden to friends. "Ah, would Granville come again?" was her solitary question. The doors below, and of that room, were wide stretched; the watch on guard did faithful duty. Grita lay down to rest. The power of feudal right seemed almost restored, when the well-known step of Harry sounded on the stairs. He sent for his mother, and asked her where he could find Grita. He said he was aide-de-camp to the colonel, and must assist in the fair encounter." She is, beyond all doubt, in love with Cousin Granville, and I will not see the sacrifice for gold. I have promised to plan the interview with Granville and Grita. It is a sin of her mother's. Granville will fight for her. I hear from both, it is unlawful; and if it requires stealing, I am thief to catch the thief. It is our determination. Give me your permissive pass beyond the ports. Mother, do! then we shall distil good, not evil, from her gall of bitterness." "Harry! Harry! you trouble me, for you plead in vain. But I too see the growing attachment, and how unwilling she is for the consummation of her marriage with Mr. Oustan. Leave off strife, Harry, before it be meddled with. No, it is a good thing for that one, about to be sacrificed—a mother's right, my son." "Is it just or right that Cousin Minho should force her to marry a man she does not love? Must it be thus?" "She is not free by the law, Harry; our State will admit that. 
                        "Apices juris non sunt jura."
                      Harry smiled as he renewed his importunity, but in vain. "Well, mother, I am to obey orders from the commanding officer." Lady Atholl coloured at this provocation. "My anxiety is enough already," she told him. "A dangerous, if a fair charge. Think of the consequences," concluded his mother, "your worst enemy. Do pray reflect upon it, don't make bad worse. "I must fight to earn my epaulettes in this service." "I fear they would be dearly bought, Harry—your fair cousin is a sacred legacy. Should you dim the brightness of her young life by assuming a trust, I should never forgive myself; nor would you." "Oh," he continued impetuously, "yes, I may be proud of his confidence. Grita is a high-spirited and wilful, but affectionate creature, easily influenced withal," he replied. "This is a sad business, so young. She does not wish to marry, loving another; and I saw Granville's strong and powerful emotions this morning. It has made my heart ache." Harry's eyes moistened unusually as he recalled his profound interest in listening to the adventure. "Mother, I glory in the title of her soldier's friend. I will soften his anguish if it is in my power. I am to lower her from the back window. He will be there to grasp his pearl of great price, and fly with his jewel. I shall cord her out to him surely. Mother, take till to-morrow to think of it. For the present, I bid you good-by. God grant the next generation of mothers and daughters, men and women, may profit by this error." Harry's room was next to our heroine's. He called out "Grita," as he passed. The mother excused his cousin. Pretty soon all were ready for the drawing-room. Harry, with his cousin Minho, asked that he might speak a moment with our heroine. Fearing a new view of the offensive case, she replied gravely. "Oh, I am so glad you have come, Harry," said Grita, as she sprang from her mother's side. Madame left them for a moment. Grita stood, her eyes meeting his inquiringly, her cheek flushing, her eyes gleaming full of hope, so that they shone in the gray light of evening. "Grita," said Harry, "I most earnestly hope that you will smile your gracious affection and true on the marked demonstrations of the distinguished cousin officer. Snap your galling chain, and fly with Granville. I will lower you from the window in a basket, dark-eyed cousin. Do! do, Grita, fair cousin." She listened with her heart almost bursting to the balm of hope, but fear was hovering. "O Harry, kind Harry, I am so grateful to you, dear cousin, you seem to touch so pleasantly the late wounds. I rather know I am injured." She coloured in anger and shame. "My truth and principle woefully caught by the iron clasp of duty! Cousin and my mother see the brightness, while all to me is dark and terrible." "Don't listen to their cruel ways in this matter; I shall interfere, if you will consent. Granville is unstrung. He is a slave to your power; I fear a sad difficulty may ensue. His sorrow is deep. His grief is bitter. I saw him weep, Grita," said Harry. "I am almost as sorrowful as he." "At my suggestion, he will come this evening. I prepare you for a contest: you have engaged, he told me, to meet again. I know you both have been wronged, and indeed sympathize with you, wishing for your victory." They passed on to dinner, when the bell had rung three times. Her mother whispered, "I hope, for the rest of your unmarried days, you will regard your propriety and position as becomes a woman." "Perfectly I understand you," replied the daughter as a look of incredulity passed over her face. "Come, get on a brighter face," laughed Madame Marlborough. "He will soon be here—Mr. Oustan I mean; you must not let him see you so changed. A growing attachment will make you happy." Like a frightened bird our heroine started as if she was wandering.
                  The family had just gathered in the old back parlour ready for tea, when the long wished for and anxiously desired gentleman came. He was received and feasted at Lady Atholl's board as the stranger. A warmer cordiality of feeling was given him, standing in a nearer relationship than formerly. These sentiments of cordial hospitality in Southern hearts aroused James Oustan's attention to the delinquent one crouched under the red and gold drapery of the lower window opposite Ayo House. She, yet unmoved at his presence, wondering, with eyes resting full on the blazing fire. He started with a joyous step towards her, reminding her of his arrival. He approached her with a most deferential and graceful bow: he looked rather abstractedly on his fair and lovely bride in her simple dress of bombazine and black crape collar. He too quickly discerned the melancholy and pallor that seemed to have overswept her every feature. But he clasped her hand most affectionately when she rose from her chair to acknowledge the high tone of this attention. About to close a solemn 'one—forever'—let us leave the betrothed, so commonly nobody's company but their own. But here is one exception; on the side of our heroine at least. By right he had then delivered himself unto her till death should part them. Anxious eyes noted every feature of her tell-tale face—none interrupted their ideas of propriety. James sufficiently shows forth his name as the supplanter, defying a rival, he said. A general glance assumed that the bride elect would rather be elsewhere. Her welcome was cold and reserved; he traced upon her altered brow an incomprehensible mingling. Her conversation ever before rich and gay, the full flow of joyous spirits was frozen. She was scarcely able to bear the monstrous fatigue needed then to inspire converse. What a Babel of sounds! But the unclipped tongues were silenced, as all eyes turned on the announcement of Colonel Rutland's name. Discord in the camp was expected, only tranquillized by the dictates of his military trophies. James Oustan's dismissal at that hour would have been a blessing, and she scarce able to endure so much beyond the virtue of the case. Ah! impossible! a warm welcome of Colonel Rutland. Yes, reader, believe it. The warm welcome of his two-faced relatives only combined to crush her to earth. Our heroine saw the mockery. Her feeling heart nursed deeper emotions—the feeling was too deep for tears. A monster vomited from the lower regions of Pandemonium was no more equal to perfidy than these. That such a trifle could make a fiend friend seemed fiction, not logic, to our one-hearted, open-faced Grita. Fashion was proud of Colonel Rutland's untold wealth. Fame had crowned him. Aristocracy had cradled the gentleman. Yet these judges of propriety ranked him a hypocrite, swollen with envy; his laurel stained by blackness of heart, as they perchance see a misty idea of early love. His fascinating and unrivalled eloquence lightened his dark deeds just now. Colonel Rutland coloured and hesitated a moment as he passed forward to accept Lady Atholl's welcome, and bowed, with cool dignity and nonchalance, to Madame Marlborough, acknowledging the devoirs of all around him. The rivals met. They shook hands in a reserved manner, for the Colonel's feelings were not well disguised. Mr. Oustan had never seen or heard of him before in that family; and in perfect bliss 'twas folly to be wise. A moment's flash, and he glanced most kindly at Grita, as if to say, "Can you teach me to forget?" Granville had tossed himself on a chair in the centre of the room, assisting in general conversation, still exchanging glances at the dark-eyed one. Grita saw his assumed gayety, to disperse the gloom that cast its shadow on her brow. The smile of exchange was sickly—she turned from his keen gaze, and excused herself as an invalid. Granville's laughing blue eye turned on the traveller. The contrast could not have been better for the most fastidious artist. The warrior, elegantly proportioned in figure, with a haughty mien, was superbly easy, watching his wall-flower, plucked by another man; and he of perfect elegance. This trio separated, completely wrapt in their own thoughts, differing in feeling—Colonel Rutland filled with the romance of his life—a bitter regret—a fatal one to darken his future. His whole heart bent in slavery to her charms. His will was a command none dared to dispute. Riveted there before her, he could not tear himself away, while she had hoped and watched his coming. Mr. Oustan was beyond ordinary happiness. His love was extravagant, and profound deference marked his admiration. But he, too, had doubts and fears. In the words of a victim of her bondage, "Will any man ever comprehend you?" A heartless flirt was a name she well deserved in the opinion of Mr. Oustan; yet, with his fair experience and credulity, he was the most devoted to her service. A close examination for three years had found flaws; yet he loved her, and pledged himself to her for life. Grita was detained for a longer time than she had dared to sit before that tribunal. Her plea of illness was actual, and she withdrew from exciting difficulties. With a haughty indifference, she swept by, coldly resigning her betrothed to any of the society around him. Harry crossed the room, and smiled a meaning look at two of the party. Granville seized her hand as she passed him; and there she stood a moment, trembling at his grasp. He appealed to her civility. Alas! how could she—no longer could she—repress feelings?—whose eye touched his thought with the last look, as she hastened her adieux. And she lingered in the hall—a rest of a few seconds; and then her face fell on her hands, and tears flowed freely. She wiped them away, as she made a step in advance; for a voice called her attention to the shutting of that parlour-door. Her heart leaped with joy. "Could it be Granville? No, not the voice she loved to hear." She hoped without looking—sad enough to behold the anxious mother rushing after her weary daughter, alarmed by suspicion; and the sudden breach of decorum must be answered for on inquiry. Madame Marlborough desired her to return, unless she was too ill; but it did look very singular for her to leave so abruptly, and so early in the evening of her betrothed's return from two weeks' absence. It was indecorous. "Take some wine, child, and come immediately to the drawing-room." "I will not," replied the wounded girl. "I cannot enter that room again to-night. Excuse me." And the trembling frame tottered on to her chamber, where—alone—we will not disturb her sorrow. What a strong arm of resolution guarded her actions!
                  
                  The lover's chase began late in the afternoon of the 15th of January. She had gladly accepted an invitation to spend a day or so, for the last time as Miss Marlborough, in her bride-elect atmosphere, with the most kind of friends; and she moved to the elegant home of the Wisbons, who were entire strangers to her cousin-officer. These devoted and intimately beloved friends resided on Magnolia Avenue, miles from his hotel. Granville conducted himself to the spacious square by Grita's direction. The elegant area of pleasure-grounds was ornamented with shrubberies and walks, interspersed with fine statuary, enclosing the stately mansion of the family, descended from French ancestry, and celebrated for the enjoyment that one could find in their society. Before crossing the strange threshold, Rutland cast one lingering look on the shining river and the harbour view—the picturesque variety of seven hills stretching away from the basin, as its silvery slip swept along beside the beautiful rapids of the James. The moon stole out of the spongy clouds, and threw a radiance over the new scene. Passing on to the entrance, with trembling hand Colonel Rutland touched the bell. A negro threw back the door, and the officer stepped aside from a large hall to a side-balcony window, overhanging the moonlit garden, whilst the servant announced his arrival in the drawing-room. Miss Grita excused herself, and slipped out to prevent questioning or repetition of the well-known arrival. The slender figure fled to find her Romeo opposite the window of Ayo House. The young officer leaned forward as Grita approached—drew her to the sequestered spot, monopolizing his wild-flower once again. Plotting mischief, confidential arrangements were in progress. Granville and Grita stood aside under the leafless honey-suckle vines. A young man, tall, of dark complexion, with black hair, fine beard and moustache, and of fine manly proportions, left the drawing-room with a message, touching Grita very affectionately on the shoulder; for Leon Wisbon had loved and did love our heroine for years. He was really her warm friend and loving admirer. The dark-complexioned Leon stepped on the balcony with the lovers, and laying his hand on Grita's shoulder, called her by name. She introduced him at once to Colonel Rutland. He welcomed her new suitor, and the trio conversed awhile; he requested that the officer and our heroine should return with him to the drawing-room. Grita positively declared she would retire to her chamber before she would enter that room again, unless the Colonel would accompany her—desiring that he should know her charming friend, the lady hostess. Granville had settled on another plan of action, before Leon interrupted their interview. In compliment to the earnest welcome and request from Mr. Wisbon, the Colonel accepted, and they entered the crowded rooms. Most of the ladies were in full dress for an evening party in honour of au revoir to the bride elect. Madame Crouch Wisbon was entertaining her guests with ease and elegance; as Leon announced Colonel Rutland of the army, she cordially welcomed, and he acknowledged the compliment. The venerable father, Mr. Wisbon, extended his hand, heartily greeting the cousin of Minho. Lucie Wisbon, the eldest daughter, was introduced to the distinguished stranger. She was a lovely girl of eighteen, with delicately marked features, highly educated, and made herself vastly agreeable. The evening went on swiftly, varied with music, piano and guitar, in which "Walter" excelled. He sang gloriously with Lucie and Pembroke Beverley. Colonel Rutland had left his cousin's side to speak with other ladies, after the hostess and her attendants. But again he approached Grita, and asked for his favourite song. "If you will but sing, 'I pray for thee,' Grita, this night only, I will elope with you, if this crowd pursue: no being shall rob me of you." A silent moment under the crimson drapery, and she gave him a look almost relenting and consenting. Very dear that song was stored in her heart, but not sung that night; with strong resolution she argued best another plan. "Our private promise, Grita, is by engagement to be at Mrs. Westerling's, is it not, and early? "asked Granville. Mr. Oustan came up, and desired his fair Ymataca to sing. She declined, as Colonel Rutland turned aside sad and silent. Both hearts full of gloom, Granville Rutland was exasperated and listened in cold silence while she stood before his rival. The single object of the evening was to betray her into some act which was to outrage the rival beyond endurance, abhorred as he had made himself, apart from the great issue. Even in that slight conversation, Granville formally expressed a reason "why she should sing for him," and unhesitatingly challenged her affectionate sympathy for his sincerity which had suggested, "Say not this heart can alter," "I pray for thee!" The attempt was a dangerous one! the object palpable, the quarrel, and the subject not a light one. In the very height of his agitation, Colonel Rutland blandly discussed," Why not for me? You favoured me, Grita, with a partial promise that you would. Why not now?" Significantly the rival rather acknowledged his slight surprise and with a calm indifference, while our heroine hesitated. Granville urged on the secret with the condition, and would dexterously snatch his guardian angel from all earthly claim. He so abandoned himself to that infatuation that the strange meeting became intensely complicated. In Grita there was an evident struggle, as the inner drama interwove with outward events, in their mysterious Providence, which seemed as if trying to break the servitude in which she was held. Yet our heroine was forced to humour Mr. Oustan's claim, fearing lest there should be instant insurrection. Rutland watched her proceedings with an agony of indignation. And thus again their triple reflections were conflicted by thoughts. The remainder of the evening she was strictly guarded by the watchful eye of Mr. Oustan. Proud of the haughty creature, the profound dignity of ardent affection knew no resistance from her influence. On this memorable occasion James Oustan did not lecture his bride elect, but supported with his refined bearing his own pretensions. The supper concluded the evening entertainment.
                  Interregnum of the third day before the wedding had brought our heroine to the back-step progress, to prepare at Mrs. Westerling's for the caput mortuum of her love. 
                        
                           "Oh, sad are the moments that sever
                           The ties to the spirit most dear;
                           Their mem'ry shall linger forever,
                           To waken the sigh and the tear."
                        
                     
                  
                  What feeling so endearing, so ennobling as gratitude? Even love, though it may have more of beauty and of brightness, is not so generous or so pure! We shall find this answer our heroine's sad case. At the home of all that was dear and lovely, our heroine sat looking on the invalid figure of her cousin Clara lying on her bed. The cold dew stood on Grita's brow, as she heard the knocking at that chamber door. About dusk, the servant Richard announced, "Colonel Rutland has called on Miss Grita." She would strive to hope, and checked, as best she might, the awkwardness. She rose with quiet dignity and a haughty wave of the hand, saying, "Au revoir, ma chère cousine." This announcement was marvelled at; Mrs. Westerling had, at this unguarded hour, received the silly flirt, as earliest to arrive of the coming party. Therefore, under special promise of care to the charge, minute investigation was the more needful. Clara's high opinion of her aunt's judgment and established wish fully explained her taking command. Now, full of regret at the pompous, overbearing manner of the officer: "I ask a plain question, Ymataca? By what reason do you allow this visitor? Your mother's request seems forgotten, and you know it. I do not understand this, child; I think you should excuse yourself," said Mrs. Westerling. Our heroine, colouring, hesitated a moment, as she advanced to the door. Her grateful heart was chilled. She assumed a feeling of respect to so kind a benefactor. But she tossed her head as her lips curled, saying, "I shall receive a visitor I desire most affectionately to see, and by appointment he comes." Her dress swept its last fold through the door as it closed after her. Grita very soon reached the room. At the foot of the oak stairway, she met him in the entrance hall. He was restlessly striding to and fro. Granville warmly, hurriedly seized her hand, and led her into the parlour. The pictured walls of family beauties all were glancing at the living figures. Leaving the centre of the room, they seated themselves on the old sofa, aslant the hearth. To her face his eyes were riveted, her eyes and lips sparkling. Eloquently he poured into her living ear the power of his love, his blue eyes speaking inexpressible agony. "Ah, Grita! another's will you be! Resign such hopes? Never!" Sadly Grita argued the weighty matter, and with strong effort she controlled her feelings. The mother claiming love and duty, with a postscript of gratitude. Granville gazed vacantly into her expressive face. She said, with quivering lips and streaming eyes, "Granville, I suffer more than you will. My being is your existence, and a warmer, truer heart, sure never beat for thee; you are cruel to believe that I, too, have not struggled, while you must acknowledge the proper right of my strong foundation. Duty is your pass-word to glory, truth your policy, principle subordinate to reason. A catalogue would be inadequate to record my considerations. God only knows if it is duty; to Him I must commit." "Well, Grita, if so, you dash from my lips a cup of happiness, as I was about to taste it. You doom me to despair. Desolate and miserable, I shall quit this place, which I returned to light-hearted and happy, with honours for you. My heart's hopes alike are withered." The strong man shed tears, scalding tears. "My hope now is that, in my far-off post, in some skirmish with the red man of the forest, this miserable life will be ended. But, tell me once again—let me ask—and say, idol of my heart, will you fly with me? Love like mine can lavish, and wealth, gold shall crown you with luxuries." A breath of a moment consigned her thoughts to his eloquent persuasions. Her mind was fast unwinding the chain. Inclined to encourage, she shuddered at the command of a higher power—authority which said, "My curse be upon thee, if thou obeyest not my voice!" Yielding to reflections, Grita almost gave escape to her suppressed agony and strong emotion. He heard only the breath of a sigh. 
                        "Only read through her speech a tear."
                     
                  
                  "Hush!" said Granville, with a warning voice, glancing towards the door leading from the hall. It opened. Her eyes turned in that direction, and there was Cam Lalner leaning against the threshold, with pompous air, and the flashing keenness of her black round eye told she was on guard, authorized, and by higher authority. She was evidently ordered to duty over the slippery chance—our heroine. "And clinging to a scheming man!" said the family in unison, when they recognized his attentions. "Love he never felt, if his self-love ever admitted a rival. Proud, haughty, and exacting; jealous to a fearful extent. He loved others in proportion as they gratified his fancy. The irrevocable claim was but a broken bead on the chain." "Yes, I will! where'er thou goest, Granville, I will go!" Cam entered. Colonel Rutland, as he greeted her entrance, questioned her coming, at the same time slightly answering her inquiries, while she advanced to the window, greatly to their surprise. "I have come, sir, to clear up the mystery," she replied, as he passed by her, seated on the chair of justice—possibly, to give credit to what she saw and heard. Colonel Rutland spoke to this spirit of insolence—a notorious fault-finding, cross-grained woman: "Will you leave us awhile? I have something to say to cousin Grita." With a raging colour she replied, "No; content yourselves; I am privileged. Prisoners! I hope I shall not have to commit you both." With indignation, the insulted officer replied, "Wishing you every good, permit me a separate establishment from your claims." "Exactly so, most sagacious cousin," she rejoined. The small figure rose in anger, for she had no medium. Grita's heart beat fast; it wanted but a few minutes to the magic hour of their sad farewell. Our incensed heroine raised her head with an expression of bold contempt, and said to her cousin: "Cam Lalner, I think your interference very impertinent. I despise such nonsense." Granville looked at that fair brow earnestly. There were tears in bright eyes, while his own flashed fire at meddle-some Cam. The leveller of romance altered her manner; charged with a commission, a laugh fell mockingly on their ears: "Fudge!" she observed, "the same trick is once too much again. You well know Aunt Minho has not arrived, or you would not have dared such a thing. Indeed," remarked the haughty creature, with a withering look, a useless as water poured in the sea: "I shall remain here, and stay just where I am, miss. Your disgraceful flirting is most scandalous. The day almost before your wedding!" A volley of scathing resentment was poured on the icy statue. "How wrong! how impudent, Colonel Rutland, for you to come to annoy and perplex one, at best, flighty on the subject of love." The officer indignantly glanced upon her and rushed at her, seized her by the shoulder and attempted to dislodge the unwelcome intruder. No, authoress of daring impudence, a regiment of muskets could not have reduced her battery. That post was knowingly assigned to the most imperious and unscrupulous nature that ever breathed in woman's breast. No sentinel better—no body-guard stronger. Colonel Rutland tried again to eject her from their presence. They could never hope while that fiend remained there. The image of their past had nearly all resumed the active service; for Granville saw that Grita was wavering. Had they been permitted a moment longer to dream of the past, present, and future, they would soon have been one. Deeply tried, Granville groaned aloud in his agony. Scathingly fixing his eyes upon the fiend, for nothing less can we term her action or mission there on that occasion, "Fiend, or whatever you are, I suppose you are the destroyer to crush the full life of my joy forever. This only prize I would seek to win. You are brave. Bear in remembrance your power to keep apart all those pleasures which this world holds forth so temptingly to this young and beautiful Grita and myself. Surely it is sinful. A spy! a blight, to destroy and peril the hopes and lives of two. An early death would indeed be a blessing." At this terrible juncture, the deep-hoarded curiosity was untouched. Cam Lalner, the spy! the sentinel! tried to persuade Colonel Rutland 'twas best for him to go; Mr. Oustan's hour was at hand. "A change of scenes may effect your hateful cause, Sir Proud-foot," was added as assumed and real heartlessness. Rutland could not bear it, and taking up his cap again, dashed on in mockery of her jests and insults. He bent over Grita, and held a brief argument, painfully conscious of the first and happy meeting. A vanished light now only mingled with the hoarse tumult—the sickening dream of despair. That passionate under-current was an effort that caused a world of tears. The suddenness of his beloved hopes buried, but religiously registered in his heart. "It is God's will, Grita." She clung to his side and promised, with pleading eyes, "to hope again;" then lifted up her pale, earnest face to his. 
                        
                           "Ah, there are memories that will not vanish,
                           Thoughts of the past we'll not have power to banish."
                        
                     
                  
                  Colonel Rutland soon found it was impossible to endure this scene while Cam watched over and guarded them as prisoners. The unceasing vigilance of those flashing eyes was constant in attention to every action between the "delinquents." Grita looked timidly into Granville's face as he spoke, and his step acquired new firmness. The natural haughtiness of his spirit sent rich blood to his cheek, mingled with expressions of bitter loathing, which disappeared as he met the gentle glance of Grita's eyes. A deep flush passed over that noble brow. Such were his emotions, both dangerous and delightful. Grita tried to speak, but dared not. She struggled vainly with emotions. She loved Granville even better, and she began to see how necessary that love became to him. Half bewildered by the earnestness of his manner, a faint colour stole into the delicate cheek of the graceful creature. "How beautiful she looks!" thought the lover to himself. The mystery of that hoarded secret gained over him proudly a reverence of affectionate love, pure essence of the soul. Was Granville to be sufferer? He should remember their meetings. They heard a low, sneering laugh; these restraints seemed a dark cloud over their future, and a whole free life broken with its bitterness. "It seems almost like a dream, Grita! Only prolonged by present happiness," continued he musingly. An angry flush mounted to his very temples. With a throbbing heart all those natural passionate yearnings shrank before the blaze of her beauty. And oh, a terrible part of his existence was destined to live over again and again, with all its fears, its desolation and despair. Can we wonder, with such feelings, Granville and Grita became inexpressibly dear to each other? Striving for that clew to the deep and tender love of woman, yet wantonly thrown away. Grita bounded from her seat as Granville spoke of leave-taking. She knew the struggle it cost him to subdue emotion, while repressing her own tenderness, but alike gave way before the trial. "Don't go! do not leave me! Can you leave me?" she shrieked. "Not yet, cousin Granville." He patted her cheeks with the well-remembered soothing. Fixing his wild flashing eye upon her colourless face, "Grita, forget me not! Forget me not! Press it to your heart and think of Granville. My presence now contributes to your wretchedness." With its galling reality those last words flashed across his mind—to his proud sensitive spirit, which bestowed on her that memory of his attachment, hallowing the object, and venerated in the changeless depths of his own loving heart. The young girl was innocently happy—she saw no injudicious fondness as she pressed the cold hand that held her own so tightly. "Grita," said Granville, "I cannot live one other day as I feel now." Softly she whispered something, only for themselves; and advanced to hide under the heavy arched portal of the door leading out into the piazza. "It is enough, we shall not be interrupted." "Ah, yes! I know these thousand petty torturings they deem their duty! vile injustice of a perverted law and power!" he remarked in a low voice, very gently, and encouraged by the tender accents of her voice. She looked up with timid happiness that wrung his very soul. Parting back her glossy hair from the low sweet brow, pushing it back from her temples, he gazed eagerly and most wildly into her tearful face. With a calm smile Grita said: "Do not leave me." "Heaven forbid!" was his reply. "You will see him? The villain!" screamed the enraged voice of the sentinel, who, it seems, fell asleep at her post, or rather abstracted in her plotting duty, so as to be unconscious of her prisoner's escape. But a moment consigned this bliss, and lingered sadly on their memory. "Can I do anything for you, my cousin?" Granville asked coldly and sarcastically of Grita. "What actors you would make!" said Cam, as she hung to the oak banister to support her rage. Granville and Grita parted almost in silence as he closed the heavy front door, and passed rapidly down the familiar birth-place of such affection. Under its bursting clouds, he guarded her image as of old; and she strained to catch the last view of his departing form. There they parted, wrapped in the veil of destiny; its web spun threads woven into his hand; it dropped a mesh as they parted then. 
                        
                           "'Can Love forget?' I have asked the gale,

                              With the girdle—with the veil—

                  THE house was crowded with the joyous party just assembled at Mrs. Westerling's. The game was to be played out in a day or two. "Ymataca, you are not well. My dear, I fear you are not well," whispered Madame Marlborough a day or two before the wedding, observing Ymataca's increasing paleness. The bride elect turned reluctantly away, and passed with a light step into the east room. There she entered to pour forth the outgushings of her broken heart. Ymataca' face, wan and sad, gave evidence how severely she had been tried in the furnace. Her lip wore a meaning curve, as there, too, firmness marked the arch, and proved that her mind, once fixed in a path of duty, could not be moved. Our young heroine of eighteen vainly sought for a few moments of private reflection, while the rest laughed aloud in gleeful mockery. Languidly she sat in that own little sitting room, one foot resting on the balcony, her head bending to her hand. "Is he gone?" were the first words of that morning. Her heart swelled with pain and self-reproach. "Yes, it is very terrible! Dare I defy the judgement against me—the curse of the disobedient? He does not mean it, they say. I do not believe them. Oh, no! From these blighted, broken tendrils of hope, must I live to turn the filial language of a mother's love? She has darkened my whole life. She will destroy me." 
                        
                           "The little birds sang east, and the little birds sang west,
                           And who knoweth which is best?"
                        
                     
                  
                  Reader, if I dwell with strange pleasure on these our heroine's trials and temptations, it is but to set forth her rare gifts—her humility—her devotion to principle, misplaced, but still beautiful in its unchangeableness—her patience and gentleness; her crushed and broken, but still lovely spirit; conscious too, all the while, that there was something more than any of these still wanting to add a crowning grace to the character I am depicting for her. That something—sorrow, "the purifier." In the arms of faith and hope, methinks I hear her mingled sigh and whispered question, "Ah! when and where?" From her voiceless revery she was aroused by a footfall in the next apartment, and at once she recognized the tone of Madame Marlborough. "What! still here?" she said. "Dreaming, and with false hopes, I tell you, Ymataca. Up, rouse yourself; the time draws near when other wishes than obedience to his must interest you." Ymataca looked towards the door, half shrinking, yet resigned to follow the letter of that promise. Her eyes turned coldly from the look and flushed cheek of her interrogator. It was sad to see the poor girl taking this medicine prescribed. Madame Marlborough carefully closed the door, lest they might be overheard. The conscience-stricken mother said, "Ymataca, you see I was right; rise up, be strong; all life is alloyed." There was something in the drooping attitude, in the pale, sorrow-stricken countenance, that might have drawn tears, on witnessing that mother and daughter. The hour of reconciliation was passing rapidly away. Madame Marlborough half trembled as she watched the daughter's changeful countenance. The girl still sat there—hands locked convulsively together—no tears came now. Rigid in their deep agony—thoughts, though crushed—came whirling through her brain; her pride, her remorse, every word appropriated, as though carved out of marble. "And," proceeded the mother, "how often must I tell you, Ymataca, this pining is useless crying after spilt milk—Colonel Rutland, or any other of your unnumbered admirers, as you pretend to think you have, or had? It is useless, indeed; and it is high time to conceal such terrible gloom and woe-begone expressions, for Mr. Oustan's sake. Colonel Rutland is far away, my child, I am told, flirting all the same as if you were no more. Pshaw! rather exult and glory in the triumph you have achieved." Our heroine arose, tottering and feeble. "For your sake, mother, I have promised to link my strange destiny with that of Mr. Oustan. You have your triumph." Unable to command her voice sufficiently to give utterance, Ymataca paused a long while. Then in voiceless appeal, she lifted her eyes to the parent before whom she was seated.
                  It was a calm Southern winter; in those playful days lay a deep prophecy. The slow hand of time will survive to write its record touchingly. The memento of a broken vow! The voiceless messenger of that past is to immortalize the tender floweret, by youthful affection first whispered. It seems a holy hush, a well-timed silence. It illustrates an energy for future action, and there on the golden stop of those vibrations we harmonize the pause of their musi—cstirring depths to its holy hush. Unknown to the world, they weep over and lament when none see them. In tears she cries, "O Granville." But, the riddle-dealer, in mere waywardness of heart, raving wildly of the past, yet remembering her promise, she felt thankful to heaven for the shadowy outline of the noble manliness of that form of his, which conjured up a thousand hallowed recollections. She placed a thought in her bosom with a happy smile—his one imperishable flower, worth all others, his "forget me not." "Be it so," she began. "Honour him, whose name rivals one I love better?. No! no." She shook her head in defiance of her mother's oftrepeated commands. "Be it so," she continued. "I dared not take my own happiness upon myself. God knows if it ever would have been so henceforth. If aught of evil or misery fall upon us, the fault may not be mine for this day's act, mother," reiterated Ymataca softly again. "Do with me as you will, but remember, the future responsibility of this act is your own." "Trust all to me, child; God will bless you." "In a few hours more, you would have me plight, with false and lying lips, to love and honour. But, over the ruins of a heart that loved, and wished, and asked your permission to trust another—is it well?" And she answered: "It is well. Only obey my voice." Ymataca covered her face with her hands. "Your triumph," she sobbed aloud, "founded on the ruins of hearts loving and true." "Come! come, child, banish this nonsense; it is vain. Think of your noble and generous husband, to-morrow! Be calm, be calm." Madame Marlborough flung her arms around Ymataca's waist, as she slid from the touch: "Come with me. Be happy, "passing her hand caressingly over the daughter's head. "We cannot afford to lose time now," added the mother, hoping to engage her attention. Thus did that mother, in her affection, strive to colour over the unknown future. "O God, if it could be!" In this gloomy mood she passed on to meet the wedding arrangements. Mr. Oustan stood with the bright sun falling upon his uncovered head, as the gay to-morrow of his mind bore the rays of happiness quivering with the tide of sunbeams glancing from the open window. For Richard had forgotten Miss Ymataca's dislike to glare and tinsel of exposure. Mr. Oustan had marked with visible anxiety the chilliness of her manner; giving it no severer term. The anxieties of the previous day had much to do with the increasing indifference. Before him she stands, the intense crimson of excitement faded from her marble cheeks. He looked pale as he held the hand of his bride elect. 
                        
                           "And thus, dear one, it is with me,
                           Blest with thy love, I ask no more:
                           What phantom words are rich and poor!"
                        
                     
                  
                  Alone in the quiet drawing-room, the husband and wife elect stand present, with many doubts and misgivings.
                  "What has happened, Ymataca? you are so sad—and ill, I fear." A terrible faintness swept over her. She tried to smile, as he bent to kiss the icy brow, and caressingly flung back her hair from the burning temples. "As you like it! Mr. Oustan," she replied, assuming a playful manner; but soon fell back to her meditations, as though the curse was even then darkening over her happiness, which was to be founded upon the ruins of that of another. And, despite her efforts, that cloud hovered around her fate, and shadowed her brow. "Ymataca," said her friend and lover, "I always told you, you wore armour; your heart is encased with steel; confess, there is a joint composition. Come, my fair and lovely—wife, shake off this sad face. It ill becomes the beauty of your features." "Alas! I promise to be very obedient; is that the vow I must give you soon?" she asked incoherently, smiling through moistened eyes, and looked wonderingly into his face, as these last words were spoken with a calmness that sent a chill to her very heart. He caught her trembling hand, "Ymataca, dear girl, this is our closest link; forever it will make us one, till death us do part. The gift above all others man can give to her he loves. Our future lives circle around this wedding-ring, which must give strength to our faith and courage, dependent on the step we have taken. Will you prize it, and cherish my love, endless as its conductor?" She looked unsatisfied and incredulous. Her task of acceptance was performed in silence. Ymataca glanced at the gold ring, and almost fell from her seat. She tossed it from her slender finger into its circular box. Carelessly she admired it, with a share of gratefulness. The complimentary gifts and magnificant bridal presents were shown as a triumph by Mr. Oustan, to whom these several rich articles had been committed by his friends. Without a spark of pride or response, save a "Thank you," Ymataca passed from the ghastly bitterness of the parlour, so ornamented that morning with his tokens of love and the gifts from his dear and special friends. Mr. Oustan recalled the runaway Ymataca, to speak a few moments plainly of their affairs within the few remaining hours of their unmarried state. He then left her cold and cheerless. The ring lay where he left it. And he had gone, to see her no more till the hour of marriage.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XIII.
                  THE night arrived—the night of the farewell of old associates—the season of girlhood was over. "Would to God that I may not be the erring one yet." All night she had raved and tossed to be free; and they found her in the early morning, her wedding morning, pale and chilled, faint and weary. "What now?" In that darkened chamber she feigned to slumber. Hearing that hour strike, the jewelled hand clasped the icy right. The dry, burning eyes closed tightly, as if she tried to persuade herself that she was asleep. "Spare me!" Her lips moved convulsively, her whole frame shaking with emotion, struggling with the very depths of her soul. Even then she dared to build up a pyramid of brighter hopes, smothered to ashes, to relight at a touch of magic. The pale, sad face asked no questions. Not a word escaped her frozen lips. Her tears congealed, for that parent had entered just now, very softly, the darkened room. Madame Marlborough speedily rang the bell for the attendants to commence dressing the bride. 
                        "Stifled her heart with a mighty hunger."
                     
                  
                  By this time many were there; and she was at last aroused. She obeyed without a word but, "Save me!" That fearful mystery blighted hopes. As the door opened, Madame Marlborough reappeared—the sisters and the cousins. Mrs. Westerling had offered the kindest of attentions, and every choice thing needed was profusely thrown around for the family guest and bridal party. Clara's devoted attentions and affectionate interest told in every direction. One by one, each lovely article was tastefully arranged for the bride's dress. Dizzy and weak, feverish and excited, Ymataca moved about in this gloomy mood; and not a finger did she raise; not a smile passed over those rigid features. Cassie Niston arrived from the door or two before the Westerlings' residence, and, in her usual wondrous mirthfulness, dashed up the stairs at a very early hour, with her loud ringing laugh and great gray eyes starting wildly joyous. With her model of a hand she gave a touch to her frizzled brown locks. Shaking hands, in her philosophical style, with those who were creeping around at dawn, she plunged on into the bride's chamber, or dressing-room; came not to be bridesmaid, for there were to be only attendants. The passive gray cloud of dawn seemed to blend its desolate shade, as Ymataca wrapped herself in a travelling dress of a gray, heartless stone-colour, and a mantle, heavy and handsome, to match, with a bonnet of the same shade. In that dim apartment she crept back to the dressing-table, and before its large old plate glass she replaced his bridal gift. Again taking it from a casket, she clasped the brooch on her breast; taking it out, she held it before her eyes. The glittering diamonds formed to a faultless leaf—what its signification the reader must find out—a large, full peach-leaf, veined off with large and small diamonds enamelled in dark true blue. Cassie stood near in solemn earnest, regarding these very singular hesitations. Long and intimately had she known her friend Ymataca. She was called upon to act as first assistant and bridal attendant; while the sister, Mal, came in for a double share, for she was to accompany the bride and groom to the North immediately after the ceremony. Some had marvelled at the shadow on the young bride elect's brow while in the midst of such deep joy. They heard no words now; they saw no tear. That acute struggle was passed and pressed in the heart, as drops of agony at present stood like beads upon her forehead. No one seemed to suspect the truth. Only "usual regret at parting and usual nervousness," said Madame Marlborough, "that caused Ymataca to look changed." Ymataca stood before the plate-glass toilet, leaning her head on the ungloved hand, as tears fell in large drops down her cheek. "Why! what on earth can have happened, Ymataca?" exclaimed Cassie, as she sprang to her friend's side. "Lock the door, Cassie," faintly asked the bride elect. The Charleston friend, Cassie, was stunned." Ymataca! Ymataca! "she gasped," tell me: are you not happy, that you should weep so mournfully on your wedding morning? Is it possible that you do not know your own mind yet?" "It has never been my mind," Ymataca sobbed. Resting her fainting head on Cassie's shoulder, she wept piteously for several minutes. They were both breathless. "Alas! my friend, I have yielded after a great struggle. Now my feelings are too unalterable; they won't carry me to that holy altar. I cannot, oh, I cannot, marry so!" "Yes, dear Ymataca, don't, for heaven's sake, marry thus. It is never too late to mend; and I can and will make your excuses myself. I shall at once go and tell him it must not be. Mr. Oustan would not, if he knew the case." "I know I am false. It is no new thing my want of love to either him or my mother. You know all the rest; and shall I dare to break my vow almost sworn? But, Cassie, you may go. Say that I am ill, indeed too ill to leave this room. Late effects have produced the change I feared. Oh, go! I stand on dangerous grounds. But I listen! My conscience repeats the fifth commandment! Then, hold, hold! I obey her voice." Cassie led the poor, giddy, fainting bride to the chair by the open window. She revived by the pure air, and looked out on a long line of carriages, strung, as it were, from block to block, around that immediate neighbourhood. "Oh, awful! Is it not? How cold I am! How like a funeral procession are those. for my bridal train! What a gray and sad dawn! It is January 24th, 1850, is it not? Ah! five years." The two friends sat there heedless of the flight of time. Wrapped in her chilly robes of fine merino, she drew the mantle around her shoulders and stumbled up, as the third messenger desired Miss Marlborough to obey her husband elect's summons. Instantly her illness was given as reason for delay. It spread an alarm, and she fell back to her bed, while Cassie stepped into the hall to tell of these wondrous things, first to Mrs. Westerling. They conversed a moment together on the preliminaries. Mrs. Westerling was somewhat frightened at the red swollen eyes of her cousin, as she with Cassie turned into the dim chamber with its night-lamps still burning. In a flash, up came the mistress of ceremonies, with a wild eagerness, and harsh and careless words over this dangerous yielding to her. The mother ejaculated vehemently: "Is it possible that you are still so crazy, Ymataca? How foolishly you act! It is late; such detention must not be. The hour has come. Mr. Oustan is impatient. His groomsman is angered at the bride's tardiness. I said that you were ill last evening, but it must be over." At the verge of despair, Ymataca would soon have launched her frail barque to another port. "Now, now!" pleaded the mother; "quick! obey and follow me," as she approached hurriedly to the stairs. Ymataca shuddered at this unnatural part. Noiseless agony silenced her portion of the move; with her face averted she passed by a wondering group. Her face was as white as the fleecy veil she wore; her eyes were dark under the lids; an inky circle gave a glitter to her glaring balls. "You have been dreaming, my child," said that mother soothingly. "You are only nervous and excited now. The fresh cool air will soon revive and strengthen you. Think of your delightful tour." "Will those tones haunt me!" thought the grief-stricken girl. "Oh, how sad this marriage! It is gloom, my dress is gloomy; no brightness, no sun shines on me on our wedding day." Ymataca staggered to the stairs mechanically; suffered herself to be led along, supported by Cassie at one side, and Mrs. Westerling at the other, while her feet dragged on at snail's pace. Madame Marlborough's eyes lighted with triumph and shone over the distinguished few, as she advanced to meet the groom with his fair young bride, her gift. The task of her effort consigned her to his care, as the bride descended to the group waiting in the hall and at the foot of the broad stairs. James Oustan had welcomed and taken the bridal gift. Wild was the glance Ymataca fixed upon his face. He smiled his gentlest expression, and every feature lighted with joy wrapt in adoring admiration. Neither spoke; she leaned with a light touch on his arm, and they passed on rapidly. "Not a moment to lose," was uttered by one. A long string of carriages with the usual wedding indications was arrayed before Mr. Westerling's door. As Ymataca passed, she bowed her smile of adieux to the long list of devoted and faithful attendants. The slaves were of course at hand to see young missus off. "Poor thing!" No Caroline diffused her essential need to this affair. She would not see the sale. Mr. Oustan handed his bride into the carriage, and St. Clair Dalhousie followed. Then came a line of carriages filled with several beloved ones. Ymataca relapsed into silence, and sank back in the corner of the coach, her glance wandering and restless. The breath of morning appeared to stifle her, for she leaned to the window. Mr. Dalhousie's eyes met hers, as she turned them away. Looking on the groom next, he remarked, "James, I should feel as if I had done a terrible thing, if my bride looked as sad as our fair friend!" Mr. Oustan bowed coldly, while Ymataca shrank back with tearful, brimful eyes; a fond and anxious glance, which she felt riveted on her, said, "Beware!" Mr. Oustan replied, "Mr. Dalhousie, don't spoil our happiness by raising doubts. My lovely bride is not well; I shall hope, with devoted attention and new scenes, she will soon be herself again." Another instant and their carriage rolled up. At seven o'clock they reached St. Mark's Church, the handsomest edifice in the city. That carriage rolled off, and still they came. The bride and groom alighted on Aspen Avenue. The young fair thing leaned on the arm of the stately groom, and passed into the house of God, followed by Mr. Dalhousie and Cassie, Mal, and Minho, each attended by gentlemen. Madame Marlborough proudly touched the arm of her brother-in-law Mr. Don Ticethorpe. 
                        "A whisper to the bride."
                     
                  
                  "An angel watches over you, who are about to unite hearts and hands." The approach to the altar was stopped suddenly; a messenger to say the hour had not yet arrived by some minutes for the minister's coming. The bridal procession waited in the centre aisle. Again the line of march resumed its step forward as Mr. Oustan extended his hand to the guileless Ymataca. He looked steadily in her dark pensive eyes, saying, "Take my arm," in a whisper, and not a soft one: "Will you take my arm?" His heart sank. "Promise me that you will, my proudest, fondest wish. Ymataca, you are faint," and her cold limbs trembled. "Have no scenes, for my sake; are you willing? "Ymataca, self-subdued, and with maiden delicacy, forcibly repressed her emotion; she commands her self-respect, due the strong attachment of a faithful, noble benefactor—and it lessened her crime. It was sacrifice, no love; but God knows all. The scales were Truth and Justice balancing above, and had the Eternal Judge of all hearts demanded the cause of her shrinking, Heaven would have answered, Abiding by the unaltered vow. The crowd was hushed as the pair moved again towards the altar. The man of God stood before the communion rail. There on that altar she laid her heart's immolation, while the image of Granville rose fresh to her vision. 
                        
                           "Ah! there are memories that will not vanish,
                           Thoughts of the past we have no power to banish."
                        
                     
                  
                  They stood reverently before the man of God, in his priestly garments. And the books were opened, and a solemn charge was given them as unto "those who must answer at the dread day of judgement, when the secrets of all hearts are disclosed." The deep and earnest voice commenced: "Into this holy state these two people come now to be joined. If any man can show just reason," etc. In dead silence they watched. Ymataca hoped for an unexpected guest to forbid the banns. She sighed: "If he would come, oh, if Granville would come, on this holy altar I would tell my love aloud, and before the world respond to his daring." She hoped against hope. A longer pause at the sentence than usual; heard no advancing footsteps; the sigh after the shock. Its presentiment appeared to brood evil. It passed. Of him he demanded, "Wilt thou love her, comfort fort her, honour and keep her, in sickness and in health, and, forsaking all others, keep thee only unto her as long as ye both shall live?" Firm and fervent was the voice that answered, "I will." And to the bride he said concerning him who was to be her husband, "Wilt thou obey him and serve him, love, honour, and keep him in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others, keep thee only unto him as long as ye both shall live?" Firm was the voice that answered, "I will!" Her lips moved, like faint, far-off music, as she sighed the melody of promise! "Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?" Then came forth her uncle, Mr. Don Ticethorpe, and to another's care gave the fondly cherished niece; freely, with an approving bow, he made the gift. But who looked into her heart? The signet ring stamped its motto. "Ours no more." Then they put a ring upon the hand of the bride; and she bowed her head like a lily, as the blessing fell from priestly lips upon the two that were made one. Then there was a deep silence, for they knelt in prayer that hath no words: so they arose and went their way, to share earth's changeful lot until the grave openeth. "Methought vows so sacred and sublime, blending the tenderest hopes of this frail life with sanctities of religion, were most fitly spoken in the house of God." The echo of "death us do part," in its spirit, solemn and tender, lingered with a pleasant moisture in the holy temple. The youthful creature seemed on an isthmus between the child and the woman, where innocence and strength meet like morning blushing into day. Beside her stood that manly form, a prop to the slender reed. So the holy man who served at the altar bade them take each other by the hand, and exhorted them take each other by the hand, and exhorted them in the name of God to live together according to his law, and to love each other. So he pronounced them man and wife, and forbade that any should put them asunder. Then came the widowed mother and embraced the bride. It seemed but yesterday she was a babe upon her bosom. The spell was broken, the fatal step was taken—he did not stand among them. Ymataca awoke from the typhoon of her trials to religious principles solemnly taught in the holy temple.
                  The groom wore a most joyous expression, and his faultless marriage attire harmonized with a noble bearing. His deep blue eyes, full of thought, truth, and affection, were fixed on her—the unwilling bride. But say, reader, was she not even purer, ennobled by the sacrifice of gratitude? In a gentle submission she bowed to the rod of trial with smiling goodness of the soul, great indeed. Did it not conform to the nature of her life? She gave all; she could make no greater sacrifice of earthly comforts to a law she was bound to respect, to obey! Thus she calmly answered to the allegiance; justly meriting esteem teem. The world, incapable of justice or truth, brands hastily her bleeding heart as bartered for gold. Beautiful that gentle being in her simple robe—garment of humility—for that is the badge worn by angels. The snowy buds were gathered in a blonde bordering around her blushing cheek, amid her dark tresses, drawn a little from her brow, in her simple bonnet. Across its front a transparent veil floated like a Spanish scarf. Such was her costly attire. Mantled by truth, upon her breast the sparkling dewdrops of diamonds on the leaf was her only ornament. But all saw that a cloud lingered yet on the horizon of these joys. Now she has exchanged the haughty affection of her mother for the love of husband. "Thou shalt leave thy father and mother, and cleave unto thy husband as his helpmate." And as being of the new life, she could not change the fate. The robin that flitted across James Oustan's past rested now a broken and a drooping wing in the nest of his devoted care. Every face smiled upon the pair; lips of loving kindness and kindred breathed the benison of joy like a softened shadow over the landscape of dawn, and made its lights more subdued. Friends encircled her, flowers filled the air, as they passed on. With a kiss from Lady Atholl, Mrs. Foubray, and Mrs. Hinto, the bride bid them farewell. "This world is full of changes, but if ye fall, let blessed love raise ye up; when ye are sad, be each other's comforter. See that ye love each other in the fear of God." When I looked upon her, I thought of stronger love overshadowed—that hath its root with God. Let us think by comparison. How glares the tinsel ceremony of elopement, with this impressive sublimity of reason on the holy rite! I grant every case has its rule of exception. Conscience only makes cowards.
                  Immediately after the ceremony, the bridal party drove off for the Northern train. Mr. and Mrs. Westerling first and last with ample and rich goodness showered love and flowers on the departing pair.
                  Calmly she said farewell: this parting caused Ymataca not a pang. Change of scene, and change again, was needed to raise those drooping spirits. Mr. Oustan, the very personification of health and happiness, exchanged the cedar for the palm of the South. Mr. Oustan received with frank cordiality the last attentions, while impressed with the transcendent grace and beauty of his gentle bride above every other woman who ever existed. Ymataca acknowledged with a singular grace and dignity her new honors as Mrs. Oustan. We are to transfer our young heroine, still the lovely Mrs. Oustan, much altered, for she sat silent. Her expressive countenance carefully avoided shadows now. He thinks her long-sought love will come after marriage. Respect and honor she gave. Mal accompanies her brother and sister on their tour home to the gay metropolis of the North. "God bless you, my children," was spoken to the son-in-law. Prayers and injunctions, with love and wishes, consumed time to its last turning point. "Farewell, farewell is a lonely sound, and always brings a sigh," but good-by was sung to the bridal train as they swept off. The departure of the bride and groom with her sister was the signal for breaking up the merry party. And then he kissed her tears away—talked of the pleasant years which they should pass together. 
                        "Oh, hope is very eloquent!"
                     
                  
                  Mr. Oustan read her feelings in the eye and flushed cheek, cheering her on by loving praise, bright words of sincerity dreaming on his brow. His whole heart and soul, a watchful love, swallowed up in pride: his new wife, but the old love. The sister was but an uncongenial companion for Ymataca; but according to her need, Providence gave strength to the young wife. A tolling bell produced contemplation among passers-by on the river boat. Preoccupied with recollections of a tender and ever-wakeful nature, Ymataca's emotions seemed to have retired to the leafy recess of Mount Vernon's thick wild forest, holding communion with nature. The tone of the tolling bell gave rise to uplifted hats. In profound meditation, the two were standing under the awning of the boat, running along the shores of the Potomac. Mr. and Mrs. Oustan seated themselves soon after the tribute to immortality. They sat apart under the saloon windows near the stern. Mr. Oustan carelessly shook out a newspaper. "Excuse me, Ymataca, if I glance a moment on these sheets." "Certainly," replied his bride, looking up with her languid countenance. Her husband turned over a page; perhaps thought to please her quiet mood. And not long before he glanced from those sheets to her pale face wet with tears. He saw her mind was fixed on other things. Poor Ymataca! no wonder that thou shouldst so soon forget and weep, and tremble at thy fate, remembering only how fondly thou wert loved. God spare that pang from another! Married—not mated. Mr. Oustan smiled and looked at his wife. "Will you read, then? or pardon my. man-like ways; business after pleasure." "Not that," exclaimed his wife, turning away. "Well dearest, what then?" During this brief period his manner showed a playful tenderness that soothes without exciting. She wept: "I am very dreary, O God!"
                  Speaking in whispers, James Oustan drew her chair towards his own, trying to heal a wound, but not without a scar. With a vague look of disappointment, he gazed on her without daring to speak, only heaved out, "Be calm, Ymataca. Are you better now?" She was unconscious of his, but another voice she heard as she was lingering. Where, oh, where was the one she loved best? The scented forget-me-not was too powerful; her strength stole its inhaling memory. "Then why these tears, dear wife?" questioned the husband, very gently. The kind accents of his manly voice continued, "Heaven forbid!" Then, "O Ymataca Oustan, what am I to believe?" He dashed the journals to the wind and paced the deck. "Why strange? so strange! What but vain dreams on my part? Yet do not mock at me, wife." Mr. Oustan said, "Ymataca, Ymataca, what has happened? Were you sacrificed to my blind passion? my claim, to stand between you and happiness. Why not tell me now?" His brow crimsoned as he advanced a step nearer, laying his hand, cold as ice, on hers. "Surely this cannot be. Fear me not, for I have much to tell you." His look was one of sad reproach. Poor Ymataca averted her head. In spite of his pride he was bound to love on, "till death us do part." He saw the tears gathering and fast coursing each other down her colourless face. This reserve was not natural to him. She felt the mournful bitterness of his tone; her eyes rested timidly and anxiously on his sad countenance. "Promise not to be offended again, Ymataca." "I hope not." Her hand trembled in his, as he led her back to the camp-stool from which he started affrighted. "Hush! we must speak low; or, come away, now we will walk the upper deck. The wind is blowing fresh, and but few are there; draw your veil over your face; we shall pass on." Resting her trembling hand on his palsied arm, they strolled the broad promenade deck. She moved languidly at his side. "Was this a mere thread to snap asunder forever?" he said in a low, faltering voice. "Are you unhappy and dissatisfied?" With an earnest gaze, conscious of her power, he asked, "You do forgive me, then? You were not hurt at my thoughtless business mind. For you well know my life is bound up in yours, and a pledge no more solemn could be given. Nay, turn not from me! I ask but this, for I deem it my duty." Never alluding to her late affair, for of that he knew nothing but that the officer was his rival. Nor did Mr. Oustan ask any clew to this sudden change, for it had spoken before marriage. "Ymataca, tell me quickly. Was blindness one of my faults? What, still no answer, not a word? I was afraid of my blind passion. My whole life wrapt in your power, conscious slave that I was, I forgot, I deceived myself, and I deserve this; your dutiful obedience to your mother increased my wondrous love and respectful admiration; I mistook your innocent kindness for love, your gentleness for affection, your dutiful obedience for attachment toward myself." Mr. Oustan struggled vainly with emotions. Without venturing to look up, her burning cheek and downcast eye confirmed his suspicions. In the remote end of the deck they fixed themselves. She almost fainted away. "Spare me," murmured Ymataca. "Another moment," said James Oustan, "must decide this fatal step—my claims shall not burden your young years. Heaven forbid! Sacrificed to her blindness, and my own passionate, adoring love!" The husband took her pale fingers in his own frozen hand. "Ymataca, my bride! my wife! I cannot live thus. The duty that lays before me would be better for your happiness and mine—to give back the daughter—my wife—my bride—to her mother. O God!—ah, well I know my influence with that mother was very great. Do not weep so despairingly, dear wife. If we could make this another life, it would be my happiest honour. If riches constitute your future, it is yours lavishly. I am sure, too, your guileless heart scorns gold." Repeating his exalted hope to change the current of the time. The bride, the wife, replied in the spirit of her nature. "Gratitude and thanks bless you, Mr. Oustan, for the kindness you have shown so abundantly. Let the few sunny gleams yet linger around the wreck of my own bright hopes. But that is past. Spare me—oh, spare me. My mother! I care not to see her—never! Oh, God forbid that I shall ever return there, or be under her influence on earth! Not that, Mr. Oustan. The shock has restored me. It is all over. I can speak now, since we can dispense with all ceremony. You know as well as I, 'until death us do part,' we are bound by solemn vows to each other. Now to extend the olive branch—and where your future welfare is concerned, be assured of my most true attention. I feel deeply this strange and noble conduct; and after what has passed between us, whatever my faults may be, time and your love may eradicate. I shall seek to serve, honour, and obey." "And I, giving all that love and wishes can ask, make you the best reparation for my blind claim. Let this reconcile, if I wrong you: you cannot doubt my love," said the groom with tender reproach. Then seizing her hand affectionately, while tears rolled down his cheeks—"Ymataca, my bride, you have looked on my anguish; thank heaven you will not blight my life, my honour." She took his arm, and he conducted her to another point to see the receding woods of Mount Vernon. The fine steamboat ploughed on through the silvery waves; and instead of looking better, Mrs. Oustan looked worse. In spite of his success, she involuntarily clung to his arm, as her voice faltered, not entirely recovered from the sudden awakening, "Oh yes," she answered; "where is my sister?" Mal came across from the ladies' saloon to seek the loiterers. To play third to the bride and groom was rather uninteresting work. Together the bridal party were regaling themselves with nature's beauties, when the weary Ymataca retired to the ladies' cabin. Mr. Oustan stood ye in the centre of the dining saloon, his pale lips quivering with emotion, as he watched in grateful love her who replied, "I will soon join you," in tones as sad as sweet. He retreated to Mal, who sat alone on deck. Ymataca reached the sofa under the window on the right, and in languor fell down for repose, having with the aid of the stewardess thrown aside her bridal dress when she came on board, so that now she was comfortable to lie down for sleep if possible. Alas! sleep? No. Her eyes were riveted upon an oil engraving of the finest cast and school; before her couch exactly it was hung, on the cabin wall. "Elle aime" was inscribed on the canvas plate. In those burning letters Ymataca read the sentence, "Elle aime." In death's embrace, the pictured beauty had fallen asleep. A soft, tender smile seemed yet to live on the face. The winged angel appeared to have thrown over that graceful form of woman a shadowy veil, even to rest with it in this world of spirits. In loveliness of contrast, the brunette sister in life was bending in sorrow over the gold-haired maiden, all cold and still. The words seemed fingered on the picture as it was written burnished in letters. "Elle aime!" A thousand thoughts flashed in quick succession over the bride's speaking features, showing the tumult of the mind within. A stranger may have wondered at her study, "Elle aime"—a betrayal of surmise. It was some time before she made up her mind to return—until called for Washington. But "Elle aime" rang in her ears. They were to be absent quite a time, to enjoy the giddy whirl of fashion at the capital. On their arrival at Willard's, a large party greeted them, and grand dinners were given to the bride and groom by some distinguished heads of the Cabinet. She received and acknowledged with smiles and dignity her new honours. 
                        
                           "Old memories came on sorrow-burdened wings
                           With a tumultuous thronging."
                        
                     
                  
                  From that hour after her marriage, Ymataca strove against it, but it flowed from its source. In her bridal room, the bridal chamber, her first prayer was offered. The first prayer, kneeling, she asks God to hear, beseeching earnestly and imploring his divine mercy on the sacrifice to filial duty, and his blessing on the wounded heart. She prayed for its effect in eloquent, burning anguish. "Out of sight," she repeated, and offered her first supplication for the promise on those who waver not—then again, and there committing her cause to the supremest Judge. What a contrast to a young bride! But those mournful tones, and the bending figure of youth trusting herself to his care and justice, animated by justice! "Let the future repair the past, O God! I have not deceived, neither am I ingrate, nor hypocrite." Pressing her head in exhausted wrestling for grace and strength, fervently she asked to be prudent. But heaven knew her blighted hopes were recorded there. She prayed: "REGARD THIS PRAYER! Not treacherous, but in thy hands, in thine own time. Let our future repair the past." Through scalding tears she sobbed: "Pardon my sins, O God. Renew my heart and keep me from evil, fervently I ask. I beseech thee, give power to my influence over Granville. As he is exiled over the wide world, scatter wide the seeds of my love and influence in the garden of his heart. Soft and tremulous shelter my image round his leafy bower, winter it in his snow-capped tent-home. With bursting bud and flower, cluster its impress in skies of blue, and when the spring is past, and summer comes, and yet again when the wild storm wails its sullen mood. Let it be a pleasure drifting on the riven echo of our sad and sorrowful past. When the stream is stayed, let sweet prayers for his coming in breathings arise: 'Mine may he be.' Desire of the earth, speed fast on thy journey, till there thou arive, while the breath of affection still bears thee along; untempted by fairies, bear on! bear on my waftings, and the pressed essence of his perfumed forget-me-not. And in his soft bosom, still add something—a sweet music to the perfumed air. Strike a few chords of harmonic hearts. No matter what happens, love will never depart. Ah! the dearest of memories shall live. Spirit listener! enter his dwelling, and find where he sleepeth, alight on his pale cheek, nor leave it nor leave it! till time unwinks his eyes to make us one. Oh, I must and need believe such power. Truth, like a dream in true love, always lives. Charge the distance," said the earnest pleader, "to shield our names, affecting my influence unaltered, unrivalled, to master his forces. Having loved me, may he never marry, nor seek to love another! Save Granville, O merciful Providence; let the reality of this holy mystery seal forever affinity like ours. Let it brighten," the new wife prayed; "let his old love sweep over him in crushing memories to another's hope of semblance to his love. And grant, O Father of mercies, in after years, Granville may not abuse my confidence." 
                        
                           "It mutely bid Grita hope
                           That time and care would not sear,
                           Nor ravish it of Truth."
                        
                      That the soft, polar ray of her star would guide him as a fixed point, and place, domestic peace crown their home in future. Amen. That was her first, the last long prayer. That acute feeling numbed the chill towards her husband. But she asked wisdom from on high, prudence and truth to act well her part. "Ah!" said Mr. Oustan, as he opened softly the door of their chamber. At the bedside he saw the kneeling figure of his wife. She started, with a blush, no of guilt, nor shame, concealing such unworthy views by the purity of her heart—thus to repay his love and kindness. So well balanced was her scale of Justice and Truth, that no intrigues could find their weight in her shield of honour, while no effort of hers could remove the shadow. "Stay! stay, my husband," she answered with tears, trying to master her strong sensations. "You are yet feeble, Ymataca," said the groom. Turning away, he walked to the window, looking out on the broad Federal Avenue. "This ungenerous claim disturbs me," he spoke with affection; for a moment his livid lips moved not. Not with the same careless ease as before, he asked if she would speak with him seriously. "You are young, my dear girl, wisdom will come with years. While I have important things to say, forgive me if I seem over-curious with love for you; but your honour, nay, more, your safety in life must learn the value of this, your pledged promise. Not by wearing concerns and consultations, but trust and confidence, peace." Mr. Oustan sighed a sad, long sigh. "I know of nothing to cause this fearfully misapplied sadness and tears on this our wedding consummation. Consider you must the awful consequence attending such promise." He stood again with a melancholy face, and gazed out from the broad window, which he had thrown up. She replied more calmly, "This is most unfortunate; I am not well, and the fatigue of travel unnerves me." "Is there any truth in existence?" he said to her. "Let us bind stronger the pledge—forget and forgive, leaning unto each other with frailties—till—" Again his polished ease, as noble in private as in the drawing-room, smothered the ruffled claim. "Then, I suppose, I must go," her husband said with a smile. "Don't let me find you sad and troubled." "Ah, no," sighed Mrs. Oustan. To hide a blush she forced a smile, and archly replied, "We shall meet again, then, more cheerfully!" (Cruel mockery, cruel as the grave! ) And she rang the bell for the maid to assist her toilet, with Mal, and to be ready for dinner at six. But Granville—oh, where was he? Two little lines in that daily journal struck the hero of two fields. "Never!" he said. "In high life—the announced marriage—Mr. James Oustan, Grita Ymataca Marlborough"—vulgar, to the tritest romance! Young ladies are privileged to give hopes to one man, their hands to another. It is un-pardonable! That depends—" Colonel Rutland reflects to himself, and perhaps of small value. But what was that life to others? A thing full of warm beneficence, if of active uses, of hardy powers, fitted to good and great ends. In paralyzing that life as it was to others, there may be sin wider and broader, darker than mere infidelity to love, influenced as it was so basely. He deserves nothing; unfaithful first, let him answer the charge with other influence; but he loved. Speak not so lightly, we know both sides of the question. "You need not tell me," Colonel Rutland exclaimed, as he was handed the mockery—shameful mockery—insult to insult—"her wedding cards!" Waving his hand to Turp, his body-servant, "I am in no mood to receive that box." He spoke aloud to the faithful slave; aside he said, "Their truth—this robbery of my own—be it all for the best." Indeed, it was not time to urge a distasteful truth on the galled spirit. "Doubtless the evidence was too strong against us; writhing under the false intention, ill-executed effort at respect. Consolation!" he spurned the thought with burning indignity. "Not even a bare approval of relationship. I am in haste to return to the camp. At present bring forward the negro children." From their cabins they came. Among the sable tribe Granville distributed Grita's rich, black, fruited wedding-cake. The contents of exterior favours, such as a snow-flowered box, was tossed to the flames, and the cards—their truth—so delicate and stylish, were soon charred to ashes. "Let it be done then, but vex me not with the details," observed the Colonel, impatiently; "I shall not die for lack of gold." He loved her—how he loved her! and at the faint flushing of hope! His face grew wild and haggard. "You need not tell me," he repeated. "This is your doing! The mother!" "The innocent can be made right who trust in Him. Have patience! submissive trust and love to God. This very thing may be ordered to bring you to a better frame of mind, Colonel." He mused alone: "When I look on the woods, the days of boyhood come up again. But, things are changed now. The woods and the park, the stately old mansion never looked half so lovely as when I heard her robin-like voice singing among the leaves, and echoing on my walls. I have some papers to look over," he added, as if to account for his lines written on memory, seating himself for a revery, in his cheerful snuggery at home. "Yes," he began, 
                        
                           "I stood and worshipp'd thee: was it right?
                           Was it right to love thee, the pure, the young,
                           While cursed vows of thy marriage plight,
                           Like the dirges of hell, through my bosom rung?
                           No, it was sin. So the world hath said;
                           "A terrible sin," groan'd the mother, who sold
                           To a generous heart—but a man too staid—
                           The beautiful child—sold her for gold!
                        
                        
                           "I tenderly loved thee, my Grita!
                           Yet loved thee not more than thou lovedst me;
                           Thine eye followed mine 'twas plain to see;
                           'Twas hard to love him, at cold duty's call
                           And what to thee were the arabesque dome,
                           Or the fretted room, or the sculptur'd hall?
                           'Twas thy poor young heart sold to give thy mother a home.
                        
                        
                           "I knew it was hopeless—knew we must part—
                           Knew that thy being I was not to win;
                           
                           Yet I held thee once more to my panting heart,
                           And told thee my love—oh, was it a sin?"
                           
                        
                        
                           "Was it a sin? All the angels smiled,
                           The white stars smiled in the blue above;
                           But, the world, the world would have cursed thee, child,
                           Had it known of thy pausing to HEAR my love.
                           
                           Not knowing, it blamed, said thou wert cold,
                           Said such a one should never have wed;
                           Nor cared that the fresh young life was sold
                           To the generous heart and the man who led—
                        
                        
                           "Now I hear a voice that I understand,
                           A low sweet voice, when my heart is still;
                           I feel the light touch of a tremulous hand
                           Till my pulses leap with olden thrill;
                           I caught the gleam of thy dear face,
                           That fair young face that can never grow old.
                           I see a maiden's form of willowy grace,
                           See the shifting sheen, like a tress of gold!
                           My Grita—in deathless embrace
                           I enfold thee—our love can never grow old."
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  Thus they have proceeded on their road of travel, Mrs. Oustan scarce herself, pale and pensive; but he would rouse her from reveries, at the new scenes and social entertainment in the different cities, and she wished for the quiet of a chamber away from the din and intercourse. Not yet, young bride; duties call thee to thy husband's home. Their reception was first given by the most dear and noble of James Oustan's friends. Let us call them More. In that hotel home, the day of their arrival, let us remark upon the first meeting with his bride in the city of his birth. The complete arrangements of those noble dear ones, as first came one, acting in the devoted capacity of an affectionate mother, communicating everything about those choicely selected apartments as his mother would have done. Standing by her side was a consecrated picture of grandpa, breathing an air of reverent eloquence in age's most silvered profusion of hair; the privilege of his energy and time-toned urbanity rendered a completeness to the reception of James Oustan's bride—the rarest harmony of their devotedness was for him like a son and brother in that very renowned and most elegant family. They assumed now these honours with a peculiar charm, which at once exhibited an attraction of intimate confidence which was to greatly influence the events of Mrs. Oustan's peculiar career. This at least a part, opening her first page of married life. Among its first and choicest advantages, Ymataca was interested in that home, her husband's adopted own, and dearly loved communion of holiest friendship. The graceful attributes of that adopted mother's nature, and grandpa's generosity, assumed in Ymataca's heart a wondrous place. The occasion fitly rendered it lasting. She felt herself extracting their delicious kindness as that adopted mother-in-law and grandpa; her good, kin husband, called her their child, or part and parcel of their household, to fill a void in the double duty by a thousand interesting details that echoed sadly on their hearts at home. For James Oustan's most loved and honoured friend had died some few years past, leaving his best friend a young widower. Lorenzo loved James Oustan equally well; the language of their friendship was full of vivacity, and each incident of the new-found scenes added delight to the acquiring pleasures of the bride's hotel residence. A singular fulfilment of their wishes in James Oustan's marriage. The complimentary welcoming was presented in turns, on that day of arrival, by the little ones too, who had been so dearly petted, and clung to their father's most devoted friend, and friend of their sainted mother, an idolizing admirer. To her adopted brother they came now with gifts, and strewed flowers around his bridal apartments with their tiny hands. From the moment of arrival those several first hours contained sweetest sentiments of ennobling best friendship. The following reception introduces to our new bride Lorenzo De Mi, who employed all his charming adornments to give life to her new scenes. The masterly strokes of his heart surpassed the grand and delightful assembly of his five lovely children and grandpa and mother-in-law. His address and delicacy of grace won applause from his intimate, James Oustan, as he exerted himself beyond all others, in his usual way of doing things, to illume her pathway, concluding with their morrows at home. We close now those precious recollections which, reader, you will find, bear a strange relation to her circumstances. Adorned with Lorenzo's noble actions, and the lasting monument of friendship. You may imagine Ymataca could not live long without forming attachment to those around her?. Gratitude and generosity, justice and truth, her code, met together. His love, accomplished and rare dignity, added new lustre to the all-attentive and devoted friends and his few immediate relatives. But leaving all, even the loved and loving home at the adopted mother's, we shall find a thousand prepossessions by the way.
                  The sun rose in a clear sky, and gave promise of a hot day in early June. However, cool and refreshing breezes scattered the spray from the foaming ridges of the waves, the waters were sparkling with light in the merry sunshine. Ever and anon the breath of leafy June inhaled joy for all beholders. Shaking hands and parting were told off, which so often rests sadly on the memory. Adien! was spoken on one of the noblest of Collins's steamers. The craft of majesty steamed out from the pier of home, and was soon under way for the Old World. Passing out the Narrows, upon the placid ocean, to seek the far-off land of history, of art, of literature—the dream-land. Paddling on with steady pace, the beautiful shores of America faded from our view. Out of sight of land; familiar objects, home and country, were lost in the distance. Farewell to the Highlands of Neversink, a hopeful adieu to the mariner, just upon the horizon, and soon to disappear where sky and ocean meet. It spread out far before us like a shining mirror in all the brightness of a midsummer; the air pure and balmy. The ship moved on at the rate of eleven miles an hour, and nothing of existence but what was contained in our good steamer Pacific. Like a speck in immensity, to thoughtful ones, a sadness and a dread amid the awful and sublime romance of the ocean. On the surface of immensity and in the measurable relation of space is contained two beings known to the reader—Mr. and Mrs. Oustan. Among the passengers of the ship were various nations—Americans, French, Creoles, Germans, and English, and several Spaniards; forming in groups, the decks were cheerful and gay. Two hundred and fifty souls registered the ship's number on leaving port. The evening was anything but dull; around the tables gathered many ladies and gentlemen. A new leaf to study, forms of character, men of commixture, various characters thrown intimately together. Society of acquaintance and relatives became dear, inexpressibly drawn by kindly sentiments. Charmingly conspicuous, not a noisy worldling, the young and cheerful Mrs. Oustan reigned from the first step on the oceanic throne—"the Pacific bride"—so termed in the presentation of a superb bouquet by the distinguished manager of this United States mail line and sea line of steamers, which floated in palatial majesty, one of four, and named after the mighty oceans, to ride in grandeur on the Atlantic. Against the gunwale the bride leaned; Harry Atholl and Mr. Oustan, arm in arm, kept step, the watch-guard of a siren—dreamy Ymataca, like a child before the curtain, whose dreams would become reality of life; her speaking expressions were at play on the ocean. Mrs. Oustan brightened her sphere of action, virtually separated—now exclusively she belonged to conjugal advice. At her disposal wealth without stint, her wants were few; gewgaws she never coveted, intellectual intercourse seemed her native atmosphere. Dress became even more exquisite, without much ado about nothing. James Oustan taught her to honour him. She appreciated his intellect and refinement, and was touched by his chivalrous kindness. The greatest effort of his life, her training, his unfailing watchfulness—not a suspicious care, but freedom, wide, broad; and dangerous, his reliance on any but such as Ymataca. Too pure, too good, he knew her too well, he loved her idolatrously, ever to mistrust her promise, truth, or honour. Such high-toned respect drew supplies, and commanded a response: to which she accommodated herself to fidelity. The caged bird sang merry notes though bondage chained her wings. Committing herself to habitual courses, her pledge kept sacred, and skilfully proper for a person thrown so young into society of fashionable formalities. Not like the home guard, the wide, wide world. Her husband was all in whom she confided now; side by side they stand. What could bind souls so solemnly, sprayed together their leaf and branch of life, floating, drifting still on the surface of immensity? Only a memory after memory turned the chain. The pulse, the heart's artery, beat alone for one, the needle-point of hope. Soon the rich-toned peculiarities of mind and voice became the magnet of the ship's company; her husband's wit and polished address added a brilliancy to their prominent place on shipboard. The safe, well-managed vessel was superbly arranged; substantial luxuries of superior taste and elegance indulged the appetite and languor. The commander, of great sailor experience, was devoted to his duties, sometimes courteous when his passengers called his attention from the study of his chart. The ideal grandeur of Hercules was forged from the ship's engine-room, breathing the winged speed of coasting time, sailing on day and night undeviating, calculations on latitude and longitude reckoned. The log was watched eagerly, a point of necessity among the passengers to annoy the cross-grained commander; and up would come the sooty fireman from the regions of molten heat, dripping with steam water. "Stop a minute, Mrs. Oustan, if you please; I want to tell you something." said Harry Atholl, staying her steps, as she was mounting the gangway, to prepare for a walk. Her kinsman came bounding across to say something. "Something I don't like at all, Mr. Atholl." "Nonsense, cousin Ymataca; are you not in love with Neptune; come, let us watch for his trident." With her husband's permission, she flirted along with Harry, as of old; the delicate-minded woman concealed no action from her confidante, and he followed on the sunny side with Miss Ulie Tay; her soft, large, brown eyes were bright as the melting dew; true, as she was lovely. From Flushing, L. I., the blue sea was gleaming in the light of morning. The fresh breeze, together with our boundings and pitchings, had an exhilarating effect. The waves breaking over the bows, and her canvas filled to a flowing sheet, as she careered before it, leaping and plunging from wave to wave, numbers grouped, and promenaded at the seasonable hour on ship-deck. The fourth or fifth day, she ran along the barren banks of Newfoundland; looking in wonder on the perilous coast, among the imminent dangers of the icebergs; long-expected picture of the North. Their various and stupendous themes came down upon us grandly, displaying the icy dragons of the deep one of its foremost charms was infinitely significant—anxieties and excitements, written in its full glory of array. Majestically sublime, reflecting on its glistening bosom, its hues flecking the realms of its pathless sea. Passing away—passing away. In the dead silence of its descent, behold! the tall cliffs in ruins, piled ice-clad towers on rock snowed hills, rising from its ocean bed; passing away. Around, beneath, on high, the arch of refraction was Deity, while the blue waves roll like stars on the sea. At midday we view our path illumined, not often made so clear in the Icelandic region of longitude. Our captain said it was his second sight of Newfoundland banks in fair weather, for thirty years voyaging past. Their presence to all was the symbol of God, transcribed on the soul. Speed on, thou closing day! Passing away—passing away.
                  Our vesper hymns rang gladly with a thrill of careless mirth. The romantic prattlers seek the star-light's milder eye. Joy beamed in love. Friendship, youth, and beauty smiled. Foremost stood among the ship's company Captain Asky Wallader, of the Engineer Corps, U. S. Army. This very elegant and favourite officer was a noted célébrité, and particular friend of Mr. Oustan, and became, too, the social, intimate companion of himself and wife. On the voyage, he was remarkable for his elegant manners. The soldier shot among sea-birds and spray-wreaths— assigning the palm of superiority to the surpassing grandeur of Neptune's trident; and he too, uniformly gave preference to the sea-anemone, which seemed placed on these decks purposely to adorn. Sometimes she was overlooked, when faithfully reflecting to possess himself of opportunity to contemplate nature heightened by marine views—colouring his sterner mood, more deeply impressed with the more majestic attributes of her rival, the sea, the open sea. We find that the Captain became collector of marine pictures, making a considerable branch of his trade, engineering, for whales and sea-birds, when he had sufficiently recovered from the majestic grandeur and solemn reflection studied from the picture of the North, his never-ceasing theme, the icebergs, on which his famous measurement marks by eye dimensions of monster size, above and under the sea. He was fond of calling the Ocean Bride to watch with him for his school of fish, traversing the briny wake of our vessel. A renowned occupant of whaling district was often drawn by his eye to spout in honour of the occasion. 
                        
                           "Strange creatures round us sweep,
                           Strange things come up to look at us:
                           The monsters of the deep."
                        
                     
                  
                  We engaged in various amusements; social and literary gatherings, whist-tables, sea songs, flirting, and dancing but seldom. The days of rest, best of seven, were gladdened by remembering to keep holy the sabbath-day; all but the hospital invalids were hearers of the word. Ymataca did everything in her gay way; her favourite seat was with the singers hanging over the bulwarks, the surf thundering against the vessel's side, as she ascended and descended the wave-tossed mountains. Like sirens, they sang in the moonlight—Mrs. L.'s fine contralto, Ymataca's soft and powerful soprano, with a bass and an alto from the waves.
                  A choice selection was programmed almost every night, rocking in the cradle of the sea. 
                        
                           "How rapidly, how rapidly we ride along the sea!
                           The morning is all sunshine, the wind is blowing free;
                           The billows are sparkling and bounding in the light,
                           Like creatures in whose sunny veins the blood is running bright."
                        
                     
                  
                  Thousands of miles from home these loved ones were speeding, alone on the wide, wide ocean. It saddened her thoughts. In the sombre gray of dawn, one of the ship's company passed away. Committing the body of a mate to burial service at sea;" and to the deep, to be turned into corruption, looking for the resurrection of the body, when the sea shall give up her dead, and the life of the world to come!" The dropping line conveyed the lifeless remains cradled in its whitened canvas sheet to sleep 'neath the soundings; the plummet splash, and the rushing of mighty waters closed over the bottomless sepulchre—passing away, passing away. Singularly impressive that burial service; one registered on the book of ship-life was gone. The Pacific rolled on the shining ocean, but a gloom was spread around productive of serious meditations; we felt more in communion with the God of the seas. 
                        "God of the seas, thine awful voice!"
                     
                  
                  After some few dreary days, the sun came forth in his kingly garment. Captain L., among the watchers on duty, was first to announce the long-expected land! Down came the faithful stewardess to Mr. and Mrs. Oustan's bridal state-room, to say, with the compliments of Captain L., they must come quickly on deck; land ho! Ymataca had retired alone to her room to rest before dinner. The loud rapping terrified her when Nancy gave in the summons. Soon, however, her husband came rushing in, all excitement, to say, "Come, land ho!" Madame, arrayed in her trim travelling dress, swept up the gangway. Her buoyant spirit was roused at their anxious expectation. Her bright eyes beamed with joy in contrast with the sweet brightness of that evening. She begged to see land. "Yes! yes, cousin," said Harry Atholl—"land!" Suddenly the Captain came dashing by. "Where is Mrs. Oustan? I shall claim the first show; I sent for her." She appeared, accompanied by her husband, who consigned her to his friend. "I a resolved to raise the sea mists," said the Captain gayly. "Your sketch," she added archly, "landscape—your colouring oily." "Oh!" observed her friend, laughing with his well-known clinking notes," let us hasten, or my picture is gone, a panoramic view. Come to my studio, there is the masterpiece, 'Land ho!' I was right, madame; I am glad of this opportunity for exercising my art in drawing our singing bird in the picture." "Only a grim shadow, Captain—the stalking crane. I am sure you can't wish me on the canvas of your sketchings. I am not ungrateful; but where is land?" "Oh! pardon, I am content with your instructions. Je la vois!" "Vous avez bien étudié." "Oui, madame." "Vous ne cherchez pas bien." "Je la vois!" "Vraiment!" "Oui, vraiment!" "J'en suis enchantée. Mercie; vous? tes bien bon, mon bon ami." While they were chatting, Mr. Oustan joined them to extend an invitation from the commander to another point. "Our Pacific bride, I see her flirting along hither and thither, the privileged and spoilt pet of all." She was thoughtful and grateful, whose every look and tone gave power to her influence. If not called into life so gay and happy, she had gained strength, which was called into daily action by her effort to save him from further pain to whom she was bound by the strong tie of gratitude. She joined the circle to charm a large and glorious company on board. None dared dispute her sway, even the surly commander bowed to her power, courteously resuming the gentleman, as he liked. The remainder of the day was spent before the mast. Ymataca Oustan was drawn by persuasion to advance with the commander on the ground forbidden except on business; her husband, proudly conscious of her worth, never once felt jealous, nor was his freedom of trust ever misplaced; every action she guarded by his smile of approval. So she left him on the deck, as hand in hand with the commander she ascended to the summit, as if in the act of rolling downward. What a scene is here! Refreshing contrast doubled its varieties to them and to us, who looked upon the two figgures swaying with gracious bend to the ship's time. The stout-built commander's weather-beaten form dressed in his sailor's uniform, she in her simple travelling dress. He smiled with glad delight at her success—his ship's bird perched aloft on the arch of the paddle box, her slim form clung to his guidance, as tremulous she stood. She arrived below a moment after, cheered by the deck gazers. Even the sailors smiled in admiration when she came among them, as here and there she took a look on their crew. Her heart filled with kind respect as she looked on them with a smile of grateful appreciation for their wearisome nights and sleepless days. With intense interest she regarded their cheerful life, bold and free. From the poop deck she often sang for them. Accustomed tomed to admiration from the cradle, no wonder the ease of interest she felt in those appreciating her intentions. She made her appearance, proudly accepting her husband's attentions, and joined the social party on the deck so broad and white. A farewell spout from Captain L.'s whale threw up a torrent like spun glass, and disappeared. Cape Clear—Land's End—running along the coast and barren cliffs of Ireland. After a ten days' voyage, the Pacific has arrived at the haven safe from perils at sea. Next comes the leave-taking of new-made friends, severing intimate sentiments of the soul, which are more quickly made at sea than elsewhere.
                  Among the list of fashionable arrivals published from the Adelphi Hotel, Liverpool, were the names familiar to us, Mr. and Mrs. Oustan and party. The loveliest of the five ladies who compose our party was the wife of Senator Tay, of the Cabinet at Washington, a gentleman who had occupied that position for years with distinction, no less than being the attractive companion of refined society. This father and mother, with three lovely daughters, were with us—Ulie and her two young sisters. A short distance of time had brought the weary travellers staggering on their sea feet, from the bustle of leaving the noble steamer. Passing through the "muzzled dogs," officers of customs, they had arrived at night, and drove through the grim darkened atmosphere of English murk. The Oustans were received with cordiality among the first merchants of Liverpool, to whom they brought letters of introduction, as well as to our ministers abroad. James Oustan obtained when he felt so disposed the best society of every capital. But it did not suit his high principle often to do so. From an ex-Mayor to the American Consul they received most courteous hospitality. Mr. ——, Consul, was the cousin of Mrs. Oustan, worthy and beloved of his country. No more reliable party could have been found to intrust the charge of such dignities and responsibilities to than he. Their attentions to our party well deserve this passing tribute. His lovely, beautiful, and accomplished wife did honour to his office, in polite and charming entertainment. She was a crown beauty from America. Dinners, parties, were elegantly and extensively given to the bride and groom. The costly display of profuse entertainment could not exceed the superb dinners of American note, except the ancient servants in livery, which gave an air unmistakable. Ymataca quickly observed the sacredness in which other people's affairs were held. No neighbouring gossip seemed to disturb the equilibrium of refined society. Intercourse was carried on with a very marked dignity, not extending to cold formality, but with the proper restrictions of true etiquette. The seclusion, the holy rights of home, bore their true stamp of private rights. Between the old stone walls on which often grew the hawthorn, on hedge, it was Ymataca's delight to drive; down the picturesque lanes to Fulwood Park, there to see the perfection of rural picturesqueness. On its distant hills the countless windmills fanned their broad arms round and round, cutting the air with a whiz. First impressions were lasting, in. connection too, with an elegant suite of apartments, cosy with English comforts and luxury of corner rooms, for in those walls were planned their future journeyings. They expressed deep regrets at shortening so agreeable a visit. They parted to meet again many of their fellow voyagers in London, during the season. Reaching Morley's, it seemed a transition. Antiquated monuments of bygone ages, coronation ceremonies, the Tower, and Westminster rose loftily—historical lessons of the past. The new scenes which surrounded her, and their grandeur, would unfailingly strike power and admiration. The thaw continued slowly, not sullen—never was that word known to her index. Read in her deep, dark eyes, the secret of her pale, sad face, speaking its expression; not even the stranger doubted. Languidly she moved along, every step covered with ease and luxuries. I saw her sitting in the spacious, lofty chamber, arrayed in a flowing négligé a pensive smile pervaded her countenance, at times deepened as now almost to gloom. She sat on the luxurious couch, gazing out upon the splendour of age-touched edifices, together with the memorials of the past, collected around Trafalgar Square. The open windows gave in a soft air with a breeze, while she sat alone—all alone, listening to footsteps and the heavy tread of men, the Cold-stream Guards, emerging from their barracks, a most dazzling body of soldiers. She searched her unknown depths, and augmented the intensity of attraction to the rock-hollowed quadrangle of huge granite walls. Within its enormous limits a perfectly developed fountain was the central body. The contents of its moving basin were rising and falling in jets—while a trickle on the glistening, cold stone cooled the atmosphere. Her head aching from fatigue of visiting and driving, she rested it on her left hand. The emeralds and diamonds on her slender fingers were sparkling through her hair. Mr. Oustan just then came in upon her, as she sat alone. She shook off the outward shadow, and like the sun-flower raised her head, to gaze on him with honour and respect. Smouldering lay the ashes, to rekindle in the prayed-for time. Not really wishing death to remove the husband so good and kind; but one idea was the unceasing tide of memory. The flower of affinity forget-me-not, scented her breathings, yet calmly now she smothered that fragrance. The wish, that it might, it would be. "Might it not be?" she often soliloquized. Ah! how irrevocably separated. Yet why should it take such forcible possesion. It did, it would, should smuggle itself into the corner of her heart. Yes, irrevocable their paths by life. Continent on continent apart; thousands upon thousands of miles away from him. The wife of another man; and Granville thrown in the path of fame and beauty, garden flowers all around him. So rich in grace and wealth of personal charms; his way so brilliant. Her loss of him was almost sure. But her prayer she had not forgotten. The very first she ever kneeled to say was for Granville. She asked God that her influence might master his desire to love another; and to hold her power irresistible. She was a believer, therefore, and reposed in that covenant assurance. That sentence, "only believe," will be ratified and openly proclaimed before the world—whispering now and ever in her ear the astounding accents, "Thou art mine!" A sacrifice of love for duty, the great commandment, and gratitude, were symbols of heavenly attributes, and kept yet the pure motive true. We shall find the natural lustre of our jewel like that of the diamond. Shakspeare says "the course of true love never does run smooth." May it not be, because, where there are not obstacles, there are no tests to the truth of love? Where the course is smooth, the stream is covered with pleasure boats; where the wave swells and the shoals threaten, and the sky lowers, the pleasure sure boats have gone back into harbour; ships built for rough weather are those built and stored for long voyages, says Bulwer.
                  I pass over a thousand incidents of interest, but time runs on. Its heavy weight drags up the chain, and the old oaken bucket is full. Gliding through her elegant apartments richly dressed, Mrs. Oustan comes forth to greet first a soldier of the United States army, their friend so kind and agreeable, Captain Asky Lallelder, who had been to visit Kenilworth, whence he brought to our heroine a spray of ivy, the symbol of friendship and remembrance. The variegated veins like straws of gold threaded the three-sprayed slip that was plucked from the venerable branch of Queen Elizabeth's tree. Now the Captain was full of scenes and adventures, and handed to Mrs. Oustan this relic from those holly-hedged ivy-clad ruins, whose towers and iron-laced windows are to all beholders a monument of bygone ages. At dinner with the Pacific bride, over the rich old port wine, the three friends were much enlivened. According to ship agreement, there they parted—the Captain off to the Continent. Surrounded by the élite of fashion, the bridal feasts were continued during their career of London life. Dinners, operas, balls, continued with the shifting panorama of sight-seeing—adorning mind and intellect in quick succession, elevating and striking scenes; such charms were golden link by link, riveting sweet memories of London lives and social gleanings. Also the sumptuous receptions and elegant courtesies of high life, enfolding and blending the stately magnificence of lords and princely welcome. Associating such honours with American bankers and ministers at court, it more than added to their enjoyment and pleasure. The routine of daily occupations were ever varied; in the royal gardens on concert days, drives in Hyde Park and elsewhere, study of antiques, the rich collection of the British Museum, the ingatherings of Layard, remains from the dug-up past, guarded by huge winged bulls and lions with human heads; sphynxes and arrow-head characters, sculptured in bas relief on slabs of stone; reflections deep and hoary all are there; memorials of the great Ninus, brought to light after a burial of twenty-four centuries—how clear the predictions of Jonah! Though time-worn and mutilated, the Elgin marbles were exquisite; centuries seem needed almost to comprehend the richness of those monster walls and loaded shelves. Centuries have rolled on and away since they were wrought, but they speak of things that were. Weeks passed in those lofty rooms and elegant retirement at Morley's. Not exposed to the fuss of a table d'hôte, Ymataca found a happy relief, and served by English servants, better taught the distinction of respect due their masters. It is gospel truth; the boundaries of the same creatures were thus forcibly separated. The obedience of such should, according to Mrs. Oustan's judgment, be enforced with respect due them, but true to Bible language, that the servant should not be above his master. In England she finds the white servants in their places. In the quiet of their private suite of service much was remembered. Our fellow-voyagers were gathered and thickly grouped in the great city of London. Arts and sciences, paintings of classic masters, improved Mr. Oustan's fondness for the fine arts. The jovial reunions delighted by contrast and association. From this point of attraction, large numbers diverged; some to the Continent, and Harry Atholl to the Holy Land. Having accomplished great things, collected luggage and parcels, so indispensable to the tourist, we were off for the railway station, digesting well our London information, amid crowds of invitations to linger. But we proceeded on our travels, as advised by our engineering friend, along the coast of Wales; and through the garden land of England, we proceeded, retracing our steps to York. We passed the grand arch, and found ourselves enchained by the attractions of that quaint enclosure noted in ancient history; we took up quarters at the primitive hotel, the "Black Swan" with its sign swinging, not swimming, on its hatch and hinge, before the low narrow doorway. The Oustans and party actively mounted the green moss-thatched slope of the old walls of the antiquated city, to promenade in the afternoon, a famed resort of three miles circumference: one of our earliest visits, of course, was to the Minster of minsters, founded in 626—treading the mysterious labyrinth of its mighty and time-worn aisles, adapting its classic echoes of vaulted grandeur to the spiritual music rolling and pealing from its glorious organ, which was touched for us by the hands of a master, with a powerful impulse, and gave animation to the illustrious science of sublime music. Our party left its mammoth surroundings, with fitting remembrances of York. Leaving York, they proceeded by the great Northern Railway to the mountains and lakes, brightened by romance from the summits of Helvellyn, Skiddaw, and the Old Man. We crept along their beautiful sides, and from their lofty heights we discovered the extensive prospects. In two private carriages we pursued the route calmly, and entered minutely into the objects of interest in each city, and, surrounded by comforts, rambled everywhere. Ancient castles, fashionable watering-places, seabathing resorts, all were visited. Each day success attended our excursions to the mansions of dukes and saw their magnificent splendour—spacious and lofty palaces, where rooms where hung with tapestry, carvings, works of sculpture by Canova and Thorwaldsen, paintings abundant and rich with lore. Again, equally delightful, through the lake district we entered upon the circuit of Windermere. Our admiration was excited to wonder over its sunny scenery: mountains rose to great altitude; wooded margins, villas, and cottages were gleaming amidst its domestic beauty. Exploring this region, we were fully satisfied. Carried in the steamboat, which rested like a tiny butterfly on the misty waves, hazed in its mountain air, the party enjoyed this lovely sheet of water. During summer months, the little sailer makes daily voyages from one extremity of the lake to the other. Our tourists traversed a score of routes from Berwick, and were filled to overflowing with its charms. Few attractions could exceed those of Alnwick Castle and Wark-worth, and its monumental cenotaph. Passing back, we rested under the cool foliage of forest trees to decipher the inscription on the slab and table of granite with the British lion couchant, in memory of Richard the Lion-hearted. Ages gone by date the period. Visiting the immortal Alnwick with its inexhaustible greatness and treasure of contemplation. Purely ideal as to its surroundings, the mass of its outer walls seems indeed an accumulation of royalty. The vital examination of its specific elements composed a volume of gratification: the rocks that lie tossed and planted around are monuments of nature itself. The wide lawn of creative genius blends with the peculiar visage of the ever-varying landscape scape and leafy veiled silence of its retreat. A tropic sublimity of calm reigned around and a stillness pervaded its inner walls. The state-room for crowned heads, the room called George Third's, remained arranged as at the time of Napoleon's visit, when the most imperial of the royal staterooms were fitted up in palatial style for him. The bed had never been touched since its readjustment on the rising of his little corporeal body from its slumbers, except when the Duke of Northumberland reappeared on his favourite visit to this grandest palace. The coverlet, called velvet satin, was pure as the driven snow, and was spangled with gorgeous stars; in each corner was an embroidered gold eagle, and the octagonal medallion in the centre bore the arms and motto of Napoleon, curiously wrought in the rich colourings of France. A heavy gold fringe skirted the low bed, resting on gold burnished legs of lion-paws. At the head of the bed was the demicrown, hung from a white satin velvet canopy. That was permanent, but the coverlet only enlivened the room on the appearance of the most imperial visitor; and, too, the toilet arrangements beautiful in the extreme; a square table, well formed of ebony and of good height; over it fell a scarlet satin frill, over that a superb lace of rare texture; it was festooned in tunics; around the lace skirt was an edging of finer lace in a fluted frill, in each festoon a full rosette and streamers of red satin ribbon. A cheval mirror of unique size, and before it a dressing-case of inestimable value, of precious stones, and a service of solid gold. On each side stood candelabra of heavy gold, branched and ornamented with long white and red wax candles. All this was put on in its Napoleonic style and the gold service displayed, while a master of the bed-chamber kept his watch over the trinkets. This was done in honour of the Duke's expected arrival that day or the next. So fortunate were the Oustans and their party in gaining admission to inspect reliques of grand ages. No permission had been given to visitors for a long time, and then only with special writ. To-day the palace was even ready for its Duke in full state. But the Oustans and Tays loitered amid its royal grandeurs exteriorly under the elms' rich canopy of heaven-painted leaves, when the warder by some unknown attraction was induced to admit the Americans. He came himself with the housekeeper and politely invited the Americans to enter, and over every part most kindly extended the particular attention, showing the grand banqueting room, said to be the most unique in England; the grand drawing-room, with its frescoes to correspond, with an Axminster medallion carpet, which was fading by age. Around in silence stood the plain but rich furniture; chairs covered with embroidery, each seat and back representing a token and design sign to mate the walls and ceiling. Each chair was the needlework of some maid of honour to the reigning queen. So full of mute and speaking history and character, it was great to consider. From these favoured treasures we were hurried away, lest the herald might be disturbed by his master the Duke's arrival. So we left, and stood for contemplation once more under the arch of entrance, suggestive of the Tower. Leaving at last its ramifications, we proceeded to the inn; from thence to Kelso and Berwick, to Dryburgh, Abbotsford, and Melrose, associated with the name of Scott; westerly from Edinburgh, where time was full of instructive enjoyment, generally expressed in everything of that grand and beautiful city. Ah, friend! to the Trosachs! the Trosachs! the Trosachs incomparable! 
                        
                           "High on the south, huge Benvenue
                           Down on the lake in masses threw
                           Crags, knolls, and mounds, confusedly hurled,
                           The fragments of an unknown world.
                           A wildering forest feather'd o'er
                           His ruined sides and summit hoar;
                           While on the north through middle air
                           Benan heaved high his forehead bare."
                        
                     
                  
                  Our route leading to Loch Katrine exceeded all that we had seen. Suddenly emerging from the forest by a serpentine road with overhanging stupendous rock, the wooded eminence conducted along the verge of the enchanting sheet of water. The breath of morning's early dew was reflected on the shining drops on the heathy mountains. The leaves rustled to the wind. Enormous rocks darkened with their shaggy sides the margin of the placid water, over which was spread a magnificence which nothing could exceed. Sailing along in the tiny steamer Clan Alpine, she appeared to dip in harmony with the echo of centuries; uprising before us the Alps of Arrochar, and on either side of the winding loch were steep hills and shaggy banks. Rocks have their echo here and there. The water-eagle sat in majesty undisturbed in sight of his nest, on the tops of Benvenue. The heron stalked among the reeds, and ducks were gambolling in the water, and a goat was climbing on its narrow path; wild birds, perched in exalted trees, looked down with indifference on us. We pass over from Katrine's shore in donkey boxes, holding only a person and the boy driver, bouncing and dashing at donkey speed over the depths and elevations of the Highlands. Traversing on to Loch Lomond, we rested for hours at the Rapids—picturesquely wild and grand. The conception of nature on Lomond is heroic, and we regarded the luxuriance and variety of each particular object of development, and a sail on the Clyde brought us to the dusky city of Glasgow, where much was gained of interest and by attention. Again a subdivision, and we start for Stirling. Days were consumed with its examination, terminating in fullest observation of all interest there. We proceeded to other points which led from the Forth by a tunnelled railway to Coventry, diverging from there to the ivy-mantled ruin of Kenilworth and Amy Robsart's bower, with all the majestic impression extracted from its ruins, exciting astonishment on beholding the existing, the abstraction of old Kenilworth. Turning aside en route to Warwick Castle, we found on entrance its field of historical eloquence a composition of marvellous luxuriance. Its imposing and elongated structure, with the source of its peculiar scenery, was enticing and expansive. Already the Oustans have reached Guy's Cliff, and appropriate to themselves its romantic connections. The trailing fern and mosses embedded its noted roof; an isolated consequence seemed to impregnate its condition there. Agreeably to their wishes they move on to an object of primary importance and source of delicious wonder, collected at immortal Stratford, consecrated to the lustre of Shakspeare. We enter into the associations of the place most fully. At Stratford-on-Avon the closeted sanctum seemed lighted up by its name, and appearing on its walls, the room in which conception gave birth to immortality, from a low, darkened window. On descending the stair, when their names were registered in the visitors' book lying on an antique table, beside the entrance to the lower room, Ymataca taca saw a dried stem, on which rested a very tiny green leaf; it had grown from a common flowerpot; but she seized it as a sacred treasure. This mite from the sanctum of an immortal mind, Shakspeare, was given to Ulie and Netty by Ymataca. Everything settled to satisfaction, the Oustans set off for Coventry in their private carriage, and proceeded the same afternoon to London. Adding retirement to exclusiveness, they sought out the famed American house, Johnson's, on Cavendish Square. Rooms of ample dimensions were obtained, and a host of Americans welcomed their return. Letters from home and cards of invitation were piled in Mr. Oustan's office-box—among important letters, a polite and earnest invitation to visit Lieutenant-Colonel Leveland, of Her Majesty's Army, then commandant of the Island Guernsey. His beautiful villa was a charming resort; and, with hearts full of grateful appreciation, they acknowledged with thanks, and affectionately regretted their inability to accept. The Colonel was lavish in his kindness, and courteously insisted on a thousand attentions, and opened the doors of the great club-houses of that mammoth world for Mr. Oustan; which, be assured, reader, Mrs. Oustan very gratefully begged the Colonel to close against her husband. To his India wreath the social bloom of friendship blended another more costly charm—the society of his wife. From others equally flattering the Oustans received attention; but the Colonel was most valued as James Oustan's particular friend. He was ever constant to render pleasures. Sir T. P——, Baronet, having just heard of our return, sent cards of invitation to both Houses of Parliament. Availing ourselves of the opportunity, with appropriate acknowledgment we accepted the honour with thanks for the attention. Two weeks of such doings finished the London season; and the Oustans and Tays left for the Continent, as summer was growing into heat. Taking the special train for Dover, we arrived safely by lightning speed along the deep valley formed by an opening in the chalk hills. A few hours at Dover sufficed for rest and a sauntering look at the much-frequented place; and we then went up at once to the rising castle of 320 feet above the sea. Beholding there again the rolling surf of the German Ocean from the dizzy cliffs of Shakspeare, we looked down on the puny works of man and upon the far-stretching mountains of the sea. Our saunter was spoiled by a disagreeable and dangerous storm. A drenching rain opposed the loiterers; and they hastened to the inn, which was of a shabby description, with a mean little sitting room. We were in time for the last boat to Ostend.
                  Mrs. Oustan assumed the responsibility and dignity of intercourse which displayed the true woman. That innocent face! was it lively and gay? No: she saddened on land; she was changed. "Arouse thyself. Beware!" With admirable dexterity she eluded her debate, and continued to resume all the notabilities of the new old scenes. But even abroad, far from any but her husband and party as guides, her ideas could not be stereotyped. She gave a credit to jovial ramblers; but her high mettle kept bright. The gay company arranged the daily bulletin. I recollect now how she sat on a camp-stool under the awning of the steamer to Coblentz. Now we shall see the effect of different stages in life, the day-dream of youth crushing hopes. But a watchful conscience kept our heroine as honest in thought as she was irreproachable in conduct—in justice, too, to him who strove to alleviate his penetration of her growing melancholy. Oftentimes painful subjects were thrust upon them. which made forcible objections to their unfortunate alliance. On this occasion his manhood appealed to fortitude to soften the depression cast on her pale features. Our party were assembled on the Rhine boat, steaming from the quay at Bonn. The glorious sun stole through the opening of the mountain-side, and on the vessel as she lay under the cliff. The beauties of Creation around and above at the break of day appeared magnificent. The hour of chanting matinals aroused all earth and sky, now streaming with radiance. All around the birds flew, singing, among the trees. Flowerets erets hid their drowsy leaves as we passed them on the slope. Summer winds wafted our boat from the shore, freighted with offerings and spicy sweets. We began stealing into the sleeping waters, to spend the livelong day with new life, and by the tuneful dip of paddles. Dim tradition at an early hour breathes to the traveller's memory the song of Roland the Brave to Hildegund. Now the crumbling tower of Rolandseck looks sadly down upon the Kloster Nonneworth. On yonder mountain the castles of Liebienstien and Sternfels rose huge in the distance. We passed on before the towns shelving into sweeping plains from vine-scented hills of Drachenfels to Brohl, a village between the mountains. On the right the isle of Werth and house of Oberwinter were well remembered, down the swift-rushing Rhine— 
                        "Ah! has the busy world music like this?"
                      to point to the seven hills rearing their hoar heads from the haunts of memory; and here the spires of Unkle rise above a curve in the circuitous river. We saw beneath the waves the basaltic columns, like the needles of Wight, sharpening their points in the middle of the river, as the Rhine was low; above us rose the mouldering ruins of Stolgenfels. On that castle-shadowed river every rock and ruin echoed tales of yore. Over these classic lands, Ymataca studied poetry and history. Transported along, the imagination is excited by paintings the most panoramic—Nature's own pencillings, and the wonders of art mildewed in walls fast crumbling away. Skirting the inseparable vines, the echo, the echo sweetly blows over the vale, and the mountains reëcho. Farewell to ye all, valley, mountain, and plain!
                  The sun was sinking gorgeously, and daylight's lingering hours faded in the west. Lost to all light words or party sayings, her thoughts are sad. Sorrow had left its impress on her brow. "Ymataca!" called Mr. Oustan. "Ymataca! what are you thinking of? Here we are at Frankfort," continued the husband. She rose. The home of Goethe, the loved resort of Schiller, loomed in the distance. At Mayence the boat ran alongside her wharf. The officer keeping watch on deck ordered the ropes to be thrown, which the boatmen caught and fastened to the quays. In short, we were soon in the railway carriage for Frankfort itself. The hotel, a castle-shadowed relic of feudal times, was opened for visitors. A deep silence lay all around. Scarce a leaf stirred, so faint was the summer air, amid the stillness falling on the heart. Stirring sounds, steeping the senses in a dreamy joy, awoke the Oustans—the serenade from the garrison band. It entered, yes, pierced the heart of one, and all was silent.
                  Morning aroused the sleepers. Spending some time profitably among the tokens of Goethe, and contemplating the boy Schiller in a thunderstorm; studying the rich beauties of Ariadne and other statues; enjoying the beautiful drives around Frankfort, not a moment was lost. The Park was a delight. The broad-arched entrance, grim and hoary, appeared garrisoned to one whose eye ever rested on military men. Among such events, a braided beam was woven by our pensive bride. Sweeping over the plains, Wiesbaden is resorted to. There some time was passed most delightfully, drinking the tepid waters seasoned with medicinal qualities. Gay and glorious Wiesbaden! with long arcades of columns and wide. semicircular avenues overhung with broad arms of foliage, fountains and lawns of indescribable loveliness. Before the white gravelled avenue rose a most noble-looking building, a fair picture of the Coliseum at Rome in a state of perfection. At the entrance, in a large rotunda, a full orchestra performed daily. These delicious strains greeted and bid farewell to the Oustans.
                  Within a day our party reached the crested ruin of Heidelberg's imperial castle. A short time was passed in the neatest of inns, modestly resting at the foot of the grand and imperial eminence of that mountain. From the latticed windows, hung with purest draperies, old Heidelberg was seen towering aloft in the clouds. A never-to-be-forgotten visit was made within those primitive walls, and above and beyond to the crested castle. Our pensive bride stopped to pull the "old man's beard," and into her book of plants the herbalist pressed the hoary hairs of its ages.
                  We rest for a season at Baden. All that is ideal of romance appears embosomed in its Black Forest. All the world was there. Among fashion lists, the Hotel de I'Europe was overburdened. We are seven, and where to be stored was the question. Turning from the horde of slaves, we watch the evening shadows trailing over the grassy ridges, and kissed by the lip-tossed Ous, as its silvery waves flowed near. Only a step from the hotels, a watery belt of purity was the demarcation, from Conversations-Haus and the Trinkhalle. From rooms in the laundry, our party were fortunate to gain the best rooms by waiting several hours. The curtain of the Oustans' window was partly drawn to display a vase of beautiful flowers on the broad-seated window. High above them the moon rose, and threw in her pale shadows. The waters were running with radiant face, looking like the vault of heaven studded with stars. From the rural wonders of Baden, countless musicians held sway over the senses. The German terrestrial magnetism of bands inflamed the ardour of the soul with a secret charm, which imparted an exalted. and solemn character to the surface of the wooded valleys and the scenes of its mountain region, carrying the thoughts homeward—if the life of Baden could be magnetized to the thought of a fireside. The weary soldier marched from deadly strife to peace again. The waltzes and polkas of Trinkhalle Pagoda remain to the world unrivalled still. Crowds were in ceaseless tide, pouring from the pump-room, or Trinkhalle. The Haus entertained gamblers. Rouge et noir and roulette tables, everything to intoxicate the senses, was in full play at the Baden Conversations-Haus. I blush to own—women! women of the world, as gay peacocks of hollow fashion, trailed their feathery plumes around these tables. Fair faces and delicate hands were raking gold, clutching with glowing features the root of all evil. Mrs. Oustan saw this once, once only, with a shudder, with a silent contempt, after an invitation to join a very distinguished party, just entering the list. With a blush of scorn she fled, alarmed at the voice both of men and women, whose seductive, satanic majesties were as astonished that she could resist. Both Mr. Oustan and herself left, never to return; for the fascinations of nature were too enticing to gainsay, and exhilarated from the very breath of the heaven-refreshed atmosphere, they were inspired to ramble and examine for reflective records—leaving the mistress of the Haus in her feathered garments, with the poison of asps under her wings. She was, indeed, a renowned duchess of Austrian blood, or some such line, who was the ceremonial attaché of the roulette table, and of years' standing.
                  Early next morning we ascended to the ruins on donkey backs. Ymataca rode the celebrity, called "Whitey," a well-known sulky. The white charger, not Elizabethan in dignity, tossed off his fair rider to the roadside. It was an accustomed prank, at the favourite turn of the road, to relieve himself of his burden by a tumble, and lay the rider prostrate, while he coolly walked off to nip a breakfast of herbs. A loud crack and touch from the guide's whip soon started the donkey to his right mind. Mr. Oustan had passed with Mrs. Tay, and Ulie and her father, while Ymataca and the other daughters were following leisurely along. There she was thrown, but not hurt, and leaping from the gully in a moment, enjoyed the fall. Her husband came dashing back at her absence. As they and others saw the gathering, passing pedestrians, each wanted to know if the pretty rider was hurt. This famous white donkey of Black Forest was an accomplished sportsman; but slashing stripes brought out his stars, and started him on his way. The saddle was readjusted, and she mounted on the back of his stubborn majesty. He paced on with a turn of the head, and by-and-by we joined the party at the summit. They all alighted by an old arch, moss hidden and almost buried in the ruins. There, on the remains of a curious ruin, are mute records of the middle ages—the seat of the old Dukes of Baden; solid masonry joins the still more solid rocks—terrace after terrace rises above. By stone steps we reached the loftiest battlement. On its unbristling ridge we seated ourselves on an embrasure, gazing beyond on the magnificent landscape. There lay the town, with its spires and villas dotted around the New Castle. Here, too, the stream of harmony rushed up, and dreamy, hazy music wafted its last touches to our little isolated fort. Rousing notes ascend from Trinkhalle as the orchestra play the operas; sweeter and softer they come again into the buried forest. Above, we seemed to be on the very tree-tops; "rocking in the wind." A crumbling precipice yawned below; and over the rock, shelving from the battlement, hung a wild flower, with leaves of varied hue, and covered with the rosy tear of morn. Ymataca watched the flower with desire, yet dared not reach to pluck it. Mr. Oustan, ever ready to gratify her smallest wish, leaped the precipice, risking his life for a tiny flower: but her wish he would ever gratify. Bold and heroic in every action of his nature, he smiled on the attempt, and gathered the fragrant flower, and leaped again to her rock. The flowery emblem was received with honours due the achievement by our party assembled on the scene of ancient victory; and from the peaceful breastwork of the remarkable battlement they rose to cheer the venture by congratulations. He presented his wild-flower, the mountain bell, to the influence of woman—a token of faith, a ruined relique of the Black Forest. Ymataca gratefully accepted the compliment, and pressed its perfume among her herbalized collections.
                  Returning from the embrasure, our party assembled at the mouth of the moss-hidden arch. Instantly an old fortune-teller crept out beside them—rather a startling surprise. She stepped forward without a word from any, and seized Mrs. Oustan's hand, who had turned a little aside. Her husband looked smiling on the withered old hag, as she touched so weirdly that beloved hand. She did not regard him, but spoke to her: "Viens ici, m'enfant. Je suis contente de toi; y entrez vous être la bien-venue." "J'ai peur," thought Ymataca; and only with her party would she consent to move as the woman touched her again and said, "Viens ici, m'enfant." Trembling with surprise, she accompanied the rest to the door of the weird cave, asking for water. The decrepit and toothless woman stooped in and stooped out, bringing a small glass of very cold water, and observed that it was her all; she had lived alone so many years—she forgot; and only ate herbs and nuts of the forest. No further remarks passed, and, with thanks for the water, we waited but a moment till the donkeys were brought up; then mounting, Queen Elizabeth rode off on the white charger, leading the way towards the wooded road, broad and elegantly kept, winding like curl around the mountain. An arch of leafy green interlaced the span above our heads, making almost an impervious shade. "Whitey" donkeyed on, and at the identical slope was about to toss up, when the guide's whip awakened his long-eared reason. Mr. Oustan, riding at her side on a fine bay horse, took the right and squared off his donkey propensities by a line of march. So on he never ceased a quick step till he was brought to the foot of the Black Forest mountains. There he was taken in hand by the valet d'écurie.
                  
                  Far below the ruins we stopped to visit the New Castle, one of the residences of the grand duke, and built in the 15th century. Underneath the palace are dungeons, to which we were conducted by a spiral stone flight, and then passed through from the room of torture into the final place of execution. Over a well the trap-door was lightly hinged, and on it prisoners—the poor wretches!—were made to kneel before a niche in which a figure of the Virgin was placed. They kissed it, and in the act were precipitated below several hundred feet, to be mangled and minced up by spikes and knives arranged for mutilating them. Our very blood froze at such horrors; even the bare reflection was hellish in appearance. The reality must have been in the hands of Beelzebub. From the echoes of the dungeon and its blackness of darkness one could readily believe such deeds were done. The door, of enormous thickness, was a solid block of granite, moved on pivots of monstrous iron. It only opened wide enough to admit one person at a time. Our valet held in this cave of perdition a dim light. Our heads were only poked in, but the half of a second sufficed to tell all above its depths. The niche was without the Virgin. The cold black stone revealed the image truly of sin and crime, impenetrably hard and dark. Shriek upon shriek seemed to echo up as the stone was hurled by strong men over the mouth of its sepulchre. That pit of perdition was left in all its gulf-like darkness, compassed by hell itself. In our hearts we prayed never to see its like on earth. Above its polluted ground we stood—arose to corroborate the Scripture record, God is light! and very God of very God, a being not made, but eternal with the heavens. On this Ararat of Faith we rested, to appeal to God's mighty works for breath, and clasp on to his own seal affixed, our Bible! to hope for the salvation of Christ our Saviour, and by his blood, sacrificed for our sins, give worthiness, alone bestowed by his all-glorious redemption. "God over all, blessed for ever." Was not the very belief of Christians a book of judgment against the crime and religion of that pit of perdition? Ah! yes, Christian friend, it was, indeed it was. We returned to the apartments, which were simple but elegant; above all, comfortable. Another singular incident: everything was in readiness for his Highness the Grand Duke of Baden. The gentleman in waiting most courteously proffered his attentions; and from its grand deserted banquet-hall, we proceeded on our return to the Hotel de I'Europe. On the road we proceeded from city, town, and village, enjoying the classic land in our way. At Basle we approached the grandeur of Switzerland. Above and around, beyond Switzer's Mountains, Alps over Alps rise covered with ice and snow. Journeying along the fern-edged road in our open barouche with postilions, we first skirted a dense forest, then merged into glades, wild gorges, vineclad hills, and matted underbrush, trailing its various flowers amidst the thickening shrubs. Rich-painted flowers sprinkled the copse, and dewy sparkles glistened in the early sheen. Berne is before us, and far away in the distance the "Glaciers." On we rode, exhilarated beyond expression; a foretaste of glaciers, of grand things in nature, was matured at Basle, that noble site on the rushing Rhine. On the Aar, far, far beneath the high bridge at Berne, we saw mere specks of large vessels plying its broad and silvery rapids. On the bold structure of the stone-arched bridge, a half mile across, we were rattled over the pave-stone of that quaintest of cities.
                  We drove up through a thickly shaded boulevard. On either side the houses were low, very low-roofed, and thatched. It seemed almost like a tunnel; and into this narrow street the dwellings above and shops beneath appeared to bend. Poles from house to house supporting the Dutch roofs, thatched sides and quaint painted edgings are characteristics of Berne. In a little, low-roofed, two-storied house, we took up our abode; after a prelude, we started upon our sight-seeing. We visited first the minster. Visitors in limited numbers were admitted at special hours, and ourselves among the few at the hour so specified. The organ of the minster has no equal; it is the grandest instrument in the world. Its power is terrific. The representation of a thunderstorm by the organist was admirable. We shrank at imaginary lightning and trembled at his thunder. The effect was sublimity in the extreme. It rolled in wondrous peals over the minster, tingling the darkly-figured, time-stained windows. But the moment after the organ-storm, the sun lighted up each miniature painting, and streamed along with the reverberating sounds of the vaulted abbey, filling the loftiness of its roof with awful solemnity. The noble range of pillars appeared as mute disciples, forming a throne on which the whole structure was supported, attired in the consecrated robes of solemn sanctity. The organist gave us selections from oratorios, displaying the summit of his power by producing through the wild and wonderful mechanism of his instrument the voices of human nature. His beautiful description brought out distinctly each part, in pathos so true that the words seemed spoken, and held us spell-bound, vibrating in sounds of softest emotions on the breast. Presently the soul was liberated from its seraphic dominion, and we made our exit from the vaulted abbey, the warden inviting visitors to retire.
                  With a breeze rising from the bright blue lake, we waft onwards and upwards. The colouring of the sublimest nature, lights and shadows, conveyed bright and picturesque reflections—not only form, but life. Thought resembled living fragrance, and we inhaled the pure air passing along the shores of the sea of lakes, The sublime softened a nature like Ymataca's, and she became at times very sad and melancholy; but ever mindful of a duty before her, she roused up, and at times was gay: but the canker preyed for a long time visibly. She gathered flowers of rare loveliness, and rambled in the mountain-paths. Our summit terminated at the waters of Zurich, leaving the high peaks of Albis to our right. The very gem of lakes formed its girdle with magnificent order. Pictorial riches were scattered profusely upon its sloping plains; castings like bronze were wrought on its mountain steeps, tower-like and fair.
                  From Zurich our course was directed to the Rhigi and the Lake of the Four Cantons. We were conducted in all the luxury of a charmingly easy carriage, procured at Basle; a low barouche, fine horses, with a postilion who spoke eight or nine languages. He gained by his tongue many little conveniences for our party. Jacques was a Swede, of no little position, one might imagine from his having travelled as valet over various parts of the world. He was wonderfully well pleased with his service as postilion to the Ous tans. During their leisurely travel he never spoke except when necessary, and most faithful was his guidance.
                  The Oustans slept that night at the court of mountains—at Lucerne, on its throne of 1426 feet, crowned by the Righi, 5902 feet, so interesting to the traveller from the associations connected with Tell. Here were the figures of vintagers and shepherdesses trimming up the mountain-sides; afterwards the bosom of Lucerne itself, whose feminine beauties of feature wore a regalia of charms. The subject of Lucerne was replete with interest, and we stopped to gaze on the glistening waves of the blue waters of this Lake of the Four Cantons. Ymataca's parlour and chamber balconies, at the hotel, hung over and above its stone-terraced shore. The broad face of the hotel was unrolled, a picture nowhere equalled. The grandeur of its prospect was unlimited. On this plateau, arranged as I have said, stood the hotel. To the left rose the imperial majesty of mountains; before us, a long, broad sweep of the lake. Starting off in a barge, our party scoured the lake and reached the footstool of his majesty as old Boreas and Mars hurled out their wind-harped thunder, and blasted all hopes of seeing the crown-point of Righi. Pressing on through the darksome afternoon, amid the crashing thunder of Jove and the sharp flashes of his lightning, after some difficulty, and wet with rain, the Oustans and Tays were safely sheltered at L'Allemande Hotel. Watching for the smiling sun to give passport on high, they are determined to linger for his all-ruling command; but alas, time having been wasted in its centred expectation, they abandon the thought, and move off in high spirits to the remarkable apple of its eye—the old wooden rafters which form a singular roofed bridge over the river rushing out to the lake. Its walled sides were strung with paintings of the masters. Continuing their road through Switerzland, they find themselves next at the Signal—the Jungfrau—13,775 feet altitude uprising before us. Descending the Albis and Jura to Vevay, the fairest, the most warrior-like wonders of creation seemed modelled there. Lake Leman, with its Byronic associations, lay sleeping in his storm-thundering spot. And Chillon with its isles stood impregnable to the beating, lashing surf of Geneva's storm-tossed waves, and held bound the image of Bonnivard graven to its dungeon walls. On the passway to the Castle, our Ymataca leaned, as the setting sun cast his gorgeous colourings upon God's masterpiece of nature. From Trois Couronnes they stepped into a barge manned by four oars, and made for the lake boat on her way to the city of Geneva. Boarding the steamer L'Aigle, our party arrived at that fine old city, still bearing traces of Bonnivard. There they linger long at Hotel de Bergue across on the island side of the city. They proceed next to the fastnesses of Mont Blanc. Attended by a retinue of Americans, they are ensconced at dinner in the small eating-room at the beautiful village opposite St. Martin's. Not another nation was represented at that hour of mealtime but America—most welcome enjoyment to each. With infinite pleasure they complete the move over that grand chain, and arrive at Chamouni. The glory of nature's chef-d'œuvre was fully appreciated in mighty majesty before the gates of Chamouni. It was in vain they searched for rooms, for an unusual number of visitors crowded the inns and chalêts; so that encampments had to be erected in the valley. At this juncture they must pay the penalty of tourists, and the Oustans had to take lodgings in the loft of a stable. The Tays were separated in so disagreeable a manner at Hotel de I'Europe that they left Chamouni next morning for Geneva. The Oustans were encumbered with obnoxious chums, and especially heads of cattle, now and then uplifting a plank or two of the sleeping-room. In consternation they heard swarms of drinking men and women carousing below them, all in one apartment—horses and cows, pigs and chickens, all lodged wellnigh in the identical room. Turning in their narrow beds, the Oustans viewed aghast these scenes, which they were to endure all night. "Impossible!" felt the refined veins of our sleepless travellers. The morning dawned, and the night without precedent passed. Conforming as best they might to toilet operations, it was laughable to find the basin a dish, the pitcher a mug, the table a pine board, the towels hemp rags. Through crevices of wide openings they looked down and in upon a motley set of beings sunk to the level of brutes. It was a scene such as they never saw before—thence the Oustans proceeded to find their accustomed position—at least respectable restoration to decency and peace—which assumed a hopeful form about midday. In spite of everything, the tourists lost no time in reaching the Flegére, and at sunrise a large party was seen mounting the Alpine horses and mules to make the ascent. Seven gentlemen on horseback, together with Mr. Oustan and his wife, advanced slowly along the gorge, conducted by the guides following in order. With a unamimity of feeling very profound, the riders bared their heads in salutation of the icy dragon which lay before us. "The flakes of his flesh are joined together; the arrows cannot make him flee; sharp stones are under him; surely these mountains are his food. The water is hid, but his face is frozen: the range of these are his pasture." Dark forest pines edged the gorges, with wild roaring chasms; fleecy mists unveiled the snowy sides of the mammoth monster, sleeping in his power. "When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves; and he maketh a path to shine after him," and sharp needles lie bare, glittering in the sun. The terror-named glaciers, crushing down his shaggy sides, swept by us, and we were turned another way by its obstruction. 
                        
                           "'Beware the pine-tree's withered branch,
                           Beware the awful avalanche;
                           Try not the pass,' the old man said."
                        
                     
                  
                  More calmly we rode on to the Avignon, leaping with a rush from its icy bed. Ascending to Le Chalet sur la Flegére, our tourists were regaled with wild strawberries and goat's milk, distributed by the little mountain belles or shepherdesses of the Alps. In fantastic rusticity they sprinkle the sides of its panorama with their gay colourings and figure. Now and then, under a clump of shrubs on a hanging rock, we saw them milking the goats.
                  Days passed in these dazzling and dangerous regions of snow and ice. The Oustans never tired of ascending and descending the Alps. The seven gentlemen were mostly Americans, and never parted from our friends, the Oustans, during their sojourn at Chamouni. Mr. Oustan's delight was skating on the Mer-de-Glace with his guide. Ymataca trembled at the sight, her nature, ever trusting but not bold, dared not to venture on its glazing plains.
                  From the realms of snow and ice, our travellers descend to the village, the queen of villages, Chamouni. In the lonely shades of evening, the Tyrol echoes from peak to peak, ringing the notes of Ranz des vaches: over the mountains they come again. Lost in bewilderment, we listen. The soul dilates with intoxicating delirium; the senses are bound in speechless adoration. I watched at even that pearly dome, tinged with the sun's last rays and dressed in its Tyrian purple. The resplendent sapphire skies were floating above and around, through the cold sunset air. It seemed a glance of heaven, opening from the far west; my fancy sped on to a rare home resting in that cloud-pillared palace afar. 
                        
                           "Methought some stray seraph had broken a bar
                           From the golden gates of Eden, and left them ajar."
                        
                     
                  
                  Then rose the chain of the snow-mantled Alps. The tide of night let drop a tremulous star, and the silver moon came up in reverence.
                  Returning to Geneva, our travellers pursued the rocky cliffs with the freedom of foresters, chasing the chamois, watching his spiral leaps as he bounded the rifted abysses and cliffs of the Alps. As if to quicken the remembrance of Switzer, the peasants cluster on the precipices, and beautifully sound the notes of their zitta among the forest shades, which cast a witchery over recollections of Switzerland.
                  We are united again, and set out on a fine day, on our return to France, obliged to relinquish a visit further into Italy; dreading the ravaging malaria, which spread its venom on the confines. We hoped to visit it in winter; and so passed out of Switzerland, spending a few days at Aix-les-Bains, a pretty watering place of note. From the south of France, we advanced leisurely up the Rhone to Lyons, leaving its picturesque tracings of castles on the banks. The vines and foliage were peculiarly glossy on the border of its rolling rapids. Only at this finest point of scenery could the sluggish nature of the Rhone be moved to such action. At Lyons, many very agreeable notes were taken of its statuesque surroundings. Amidst the royal line of monarchs and men who shook the world, Luther, in all his fastings, macerations, and watchings—watchings which were to shake the world—was not forgotten as we passed. From Chalons to the palace of Dijon, we hired a private carriage, and passing the long row of poplars, we rest at Champagne and Tonnerre, à Paris. The train stopped; the carriage-doors unlocked; we were set free at Paris. At length, after a long hot ride, we found grand suites of apartments at Meurice's. The seven weary travellers were soon at home, on a firmer foundation than as tourists. Ymataca was ever noted for much luggage. It was safely handed, and here we really feel at home. Hundreds of Americans were, as usual, among the guests of Hotel Meurice, and the reunions were agreeable indeed. Here we met and parted with Harry Atholl, who journeyed off to the Holy Land, and Captain L. No sooner were we established and arrangements completed, than receptions began. These were given on the most convenient day to prevent disturbance of their ramblings among the galleries of fine arts. Immediately thrown into the élite circles, our heroine received kind honours, as well as from old and distinguished friends of James Oustan. These elegant friends had prepared to receive him and his wife, as their bridal cards had already preceded them, in various foreign cities. And here they met the warm kindness and sumptuous reception of lovely Mrs. ——, the banker's wife, admired for her very charming personal attractions, and her attentions to the Oustans and countless others from her native home. Now at the summit of gayety, dinners, parties, balls, and operas, seasoned with theatres, profusely amused and entertained the Oustans. Their national pride was flattered by conquests; and abundantly furnished with every luxury, they saw and enjoyed Paris—Sundays excepted, for our ladies would, in reverence, lose sight of fashionable things, and even of Catholic celebrations, to commune and worship God, in the simple mode of their Church at the American Chapel, where they faithfully attended, taking tickets for morning and afternoon service, as was the custom.
                  Amidst bewildering mazes of fashion, of things innumerable to be looked at, Ymataca garnished her mind with striking sermons, and made material acquaintance with the master-pieces of painting, sculpture, and architecture, music and epic poems. Where so much genius was visible, 'twas difficult to digest or comprehend illustrations so remarkable and grand. Ymataca's eye kept curious care over originals, as if to anticipate her own nature, and mitigate ungracious submission to an alliance by a symbol of language expressed in faith.
                  A singular circumstance introduced the Oustans to the Rothschilds. Visiting a jeweller one day, to find something to suit Mrs. Oustan's idea of a unique bracelet, they found M. Rothschild there, selecting a cane of rare value and other articles. The variety extensively shown had not reached the idea to please her wish. Le Monsieur du magasin gathered an unusual assortment for the American lady. "No plaisir? non! ah bien, I have one which Her Majesty, Victoria, Queen of England, has designed, the most superb gem, for our workmanship for a favourite friend
                     la Duchesse. We have already made two for her majesty, and one as a model for ourselves. Ah bien, madame, je vois. You are worthy the counterpart." At the price Mr. Oustan became alarmed—too much, he feared, even for his well filled and liberal purse. But enough; her wish should be gratified, cost what it may. She was the first to gain the prize of something she had not seen in all the vast storehouses abroad and at home. The workman sent it warm from its molten gold, accompanied by the words: "Monsieur du magasin, ah bien. Si, I have nothing, among a superb collection of jewels, approximating to the recent addition of an object so worthy the circumstance. I am satisfied this will; permettez moi," and her husband assigned the illustrious case and its bracelet to Ymataca Oustan. The cross erected to Faith was placed on her arm, a royal trophy from its birth, proclaiming a descriptive restoration of the will of heaven, and its divinity of inscription, prayers perpetuated to a memory, investing its very warmth with a sanctity. Imagine the expression on those faces as she held up the jewel—an oval band of heavy yellow and pinkish gold. Upon it rested the cross, like the stem of a branch, solid and round. As true as nature's vine the leaves of ivy, clustered the rare old plant upon its pure form. Fresh, emerald-shaped, life-like those leaves appear, and the very tiniest lay close around the cross, transcribing its beauty in a spray upon the hand. The exquisitely wrought standard elevated its instituted divinity by representing I. H. S., in three valuable stones of pink lustre, while the whole setting was a model of beautiful ornament, and the royal features of its certified caste crowned its worth. Any artist might be justly proud of the design. This seemed the acme of Ymataca's wish—a bracelet. Other valuables were purchased of the same artist, and they took a hasty farewell of the Rothschild jeweller. From the routine of visiting, shopping, and seeing, the Oustans treasure recollections of this.
                  On the morrow of a sunny afternoon, they drove to the Bois de Bologne. Returning from beyond L'Arc de Triomphe, they visited a secluded spot, seldom spoken of in France—La Chapelle de Ferdinand—erected to the memory of the Duc d'Orleans, who was killed by his horse running away, and who died where he fell. 
                        
                           "Tread softly! all is holy here!
                           The air, as it was charmed with fear,
                           Hangs tremulous with the excess
                           Of Death's surpassing loveliness.
                           Two angels whisper face to face,
                           
                           While beneath her wings of air
                           Holds both within her tender care.
                           Eternal Beauty unto Fame
                           Proclaims the sculptor's deathless name."
                        
                     
                  
                  Over the spot where he fell is a miniature chapel; opposite, on the lovely grounds at the entrance, is the lodge. One room composes the building of graystone and marble. In that room are mantels placed opposite, and on each stand two clocks of black marble and gold. One, on the left, ceased to move at the moment the Duke fell; and so significant is that mark of time, that it reads out the sounding of his life's last beat. The feelers never move, and the arrows are broken off as the hand stopped at ten minutes to twelve. The other, on the right, ceased with the last throb of his heart, and its finger points to ten minutes past four, when he died. On this clock, above its face, is a representation of France, weeping. The figure of a female, sculptured in bronze, bends over a broken column, with one hand bearing an inverted torch, the other lifting almost to the eyes a handkerchief. The pure monument stands in the form of an oval-roofed building about seventy feet high, and of faultless marble, white as the driven snow. The exterior has a solemn and affecting beauty, with its chaste, ornate architecture contrasting well with its long painted windows, three on either side. The interior is approached by a vestibule of diminutive proportions and symmetrically imposing. The walls and altar are draped with deepest mourning; a pall of black cloth is spread over the communion-table, and in the recess is hung a painting about the dimensions of Leutze's "Washington ington Crossing the Delaware"—"The Last Hour of the Duke of Orleans." The canvas figures are speaking and life-like. The whole wears the costliest appearance. His friends are supporting his head as he lays prostrate and dying on a mattress. They are kneeling in different postures around the expiring form stretched on the bed of death. His cloak of martial bearing is falling from his half-raised shoulder. Tears are falling upon him, from drooping loved ones assuaging his pain by silent sympathy. His expression is a holy calm. The mysterious sleep is stealing over each loved feature, as the weeping friends gaze in horror and agony on the sufferer passing away. Around the chancel is a deeper recess from the high altar. In the distance, 'neath a model sepulchre, is a statue to his memory carved by the hand of his sister, Mary of Orleans. The graceful, most graceful type of statuary reveals the solemnity even more truly than its painting. The purity of its celestial conception of art is twice told, in the selection and the material of its snow-clad sheet. Here again he is in full-length, stretched on a mattress, most faultlessly carved. He is wrapped in his martial cloak, folded as it were with its last touch. Cold and serene is his death-bedewed face. The mattress is supposed to be his grave, above which is kneeling an angel on the grassy sod of marble made on a table of some height, and on the slab this spirit guardian kneels, the hands of the angel uplifting the head of the dead man. So sainted, so calm, so holy that atmosphere, that its idea hallows the soul, and tears are falling from those who live around the dead man's tomb.
                  Leaving the vaulted monument with its effective "peace on earth, good will towards men," we turned away, our hearts throbbing with thoughts of fair paradise and Mary of Orleans. From one scene to another we passed, until we came to several views of Prince Nepaul and his very handsome brother. Both sat in coats of mail spangled over with diamonds. Diamonds blazed, glared, dazzled from their imperial turbans. On a spray was perched a noble bird of paradise, its sweeping train of gold falling almost upon the shoulders of the prince, who, in that blazing, dazzling dress, attracted the greatest attention at the king's Opera. All the court were there, to hear Alboni sing in the Puritani.
                  
                  The later days of Paris time were finished leisurely by visits to the Luxembourg, the gallery of paintings and its noble garden, adorned with statues of queens of France. The Notre Dame was ever looked upon as a monument of coronations. The Louvre—the charming, charming gallery was literally absorbing. The Tuileries, and its grand imperial garden, was an every-day affair for Ymataca. After visiting it, she looked out from her balcony, morning and evening, upon that grandest of panoramas, over the gardens, upon the palace, to the obelisk of Luxor beyond, still beyond, upon L'Arc de Triomphe. All was Paris.
                  The last glorious day came, and we left our grand apartment at Meurice's to ramble at Versailles. The last dinner-party was there, in the richest entertainment given by the banker and his wife. Her charms, her kindness, and attentions, were well remembered. We had before passed days at Le Grand Trianon and Le Petit Trianon, or rather in quest of their glorious treasure. Crumbled to earth, dust to dust, ashes to ashes, their fame! Gorgeous despotism of France, farewell!
                  Pass on, weary reader, to follow our travellers home by the way of Boulogne-sur-la-Mer, to England, cruising again among the same brilliant throng. After a while they return, and Ymataca reigns queen bird-of-passage in her old nest, but of new-formed leaves. On board the steamship Atlantic she makes her first voyage home, from east to western shores. 
                        
                           "Know thou, that I have
                           Supported her pretensions to your hands
                           In the way best suited to her character."
                        
                     
                  
                  January, 1851, closes her reign of ten years, since we met by chance to introduce the heroine of my novel. Back she has come again with Mr. Oustan to Hotel du Nord. Her circle reopens, our lady resumes home, or rather, the sobering tie of domestic duties. Virtue is her sceptre, overruling her gay and lively manners. Some said she was colder than before; that her husband was ungenial—she a false-hearted wife. What cared she?—not the snap of her finger! Justice and truth, if not love, led her to do exactly right. Irreproachable her wifedom!—an ordeal few women could pass untarnished. So she yet waved her colours of independence triumphantly. 
                        
                           "Ah! paint her soul-illumined eyes,
                           The sweet expression of her pensive face,
                           The lightning smile, the animated grace;
                           The portrait well the lover's voice supplies:
                        
                        
                           "Speaks all his heart must feel, his tongue would say;
                           Yet, ah, not all his heart must sadly feel:
                           How oft the floweret's silken leaves conceal
                           The drug that steals the vital spark away!"
                        
                     
                  
                  It was on one of her excursions from the drawing-room to the ladies, ordinary at the Hotel du Nord, some weeks after her return from Europe, that Mrs. Oustan concluded to view the table d'hôte, as it was game-day, and grand ornaments were expected. Musing in silence, she passed along the dark carpeted corridor to the ladies' ordinary, lighted at one end by a glimmering light through the pictured panes of glass placed in the door of entrance to the more select dining-saloon. Before the arch she stood a moment, and continued to look with surprise and delight at the specialities of hotel service. As she leaned against the arched entrance with an artless grace, the rays of light fell strongly upon her. Dressed with great taste, she wore her favourite colour, Coburg blue, a charming shade. The poult de soie was a wellknown length and breadth, and lay in folds around her figure. The waist was grace itself—thrown open on the bust, disclosing an exquisite chemisette of point d'appliqué, extremely becoming, with its collar attached by a gauze ribbonbow, sprinkled with embroidered gold sovereigns on a blue ground. Flowing sleeves, trimmed with a rich ribbon, displayed undersleeves of frilled point d'appliqué. On the bare wrist was placed her cross of faith. The heavy roll of pink gold lay loosely on her arm; as if illuminated, the gallery, tinted with pale ashes of rose, gave out a new light. On this corridor, and immediately confronting the spot where Grita leaned, stood Granville, under the open pass to the ladies' entrance from the side street. He gazed earnestly and tenderly upon this portrait, for he had hardly known till now how he loved her, or valued the lost treasure; and with a look so solemn, which she had seen him assume, mingled with a certain wild expression, he still continued to observe her in silence; and, too, with a mixture of curiosity and tenderness, as her image crowded to his mind, unmolested by any notice—for she was really ignorant of her fate. The faint glimmer of his star was unmarked by any occurrence, since she sealed his flower to her tablet and pressed his forget-me-not. She had obtained no information of his past. But the foolish fancy assembled its vague thoughts, and hopes had overspread her soul's intelligence, as in the scenes of hoary past; and each romantic vale was tuneful, every tongue lisped a hoping. She was hoping, she scarce knew why, but hoping that they should meet again, and soon. Climbing the Alps and the Odenwald's tremendous steeps—skirting the pathless precipices where throng wild forms of danger—what sudden transports to her bosom came of Granville! They met on level ground.
                  Granville Rutland knew Grita had returned; whisperings of the old current—Where? murmuring from the ocean circlet, side by side—Here! At an early hour he was awakened, not by reveillé, but by the chiming of a bell in the distance—religion's voice from the cloudless height of Trinity's tall spire, to call down the blessing. His tutored mind rose to the adoration of Deity, in his goodness and power, wafting to his open casement the blessing. It seemed to expand his noble nature, and gradually he yielded to delightful impressions. The officer abruptly rose from his breakfast, to proceed to the neighbouring city, the gay metropolis. The bell had now ceased, and the deep repose of the island was undisturbed. Somewhat fatigued by drill-practice, he rested on the rocks. The full rays of a midday sun threw a gorgeous light over the path, glancing up the winding cliff, gleaming with its battlements, and soldiers in their military dress distinguished at their posts. The officer looked across the bay; the snowy points of houses reflected a rosy hue in the sun. So it was he aspired then, above all things, to reach the city of gay wealth. He reached the hedge of granite that screened the barren point, and immediately crossed the bridge thrown from its shore to the boat-house. The Colonel seemed to have forgotten he had any farther to go, until summoned to depart. Descending the steps, he stepped lightly into the barge. At once they debark, and by the measured sound of oars dashed into the sparkling tide. The echoing rowlocks kept time to the music of the fortress band, until the waves hushed up the sweeter sounds, as they floated over the swelling current and passed away towards the opposite shore. Indulging in pleasing sadness that had stolen upon his spirits, and which time had mellowed into traces of musical memory, Granville listened to hear the murmur of a shell. Upon the mighty stream, and within the mountain-wooded bay, a single note, softly, sweetly in the distance, painted a vision bright. The potent voice he loved so well seemed to entrance him, and, half afraid— 
                        
                           "Down, down a thousand fathom deep
                           Among the sounding seas, I go."
                        
                     
                  
                  
                  He sought to join her shore; at the coxswain's call the well-poised oars were raised, and the barge stopped before the staircase. Granville walked up, and stood on the balcony opening on the bay. Again, he turned into a house, fitted up in soldier-fashion; adorned with historical paintings, charts, maps, and couches. On his return to one of the finest cities in the world, a confusion of noises recalled the same old tale, more gay and animated than ever. With a light grace Colonel Rutland passed on—restless. The disappointed heart amused itself with scenes that were brightest, and a charming sadness seemed to bind the spell joined by the current. Where art thou? the Old World whispered; and the New World murmured, "Here!"
                  Colonel Rutland at length approached her walls, surrounded by the busy hum of mingling sounds. After walking some time, he remembered the list of fashionable arrivals at the Hotel du Nord had not been searched, and concluded the hour with its accomplishment, indulging himself with imagining what might be there. The pressure of his own misfortune advanced to meet the magic spell. He passed the ladies' entrance, and went through the suite of noble rooms, with lofty frescoed walls and saffron-coloured curtains. As he turned hastily to follow the corridor, and was about to descend and leave, his eye turned to a handsome painted glass door, which was ever inviting. More than usual its light reflected, and he started and fell back against the pillar as he observed Grita in her musing mood. Granville pursued his way softly, as memory awakened a pang of affection. He saw it, and pressed his hand to his eyes, fixed upon her countenance. His fortitude almost forsook him. Each step he lingered, and supported himself against the wall, scarce recovered from the shock it gave him—her living picture, a painful truth. His heart swelled with a convulsive sigh. In a few moments he recovered himself from a sudden faintness that had come over him. Struggling with tenderness and grief, he checked the agony, commanded his voice, and gazed at her for a moment with unutterable anguish, strongly interested concerning her fate. Such an instance almost surpassed his belief. She leaned yet pensively there. Never before had she stood there, often passing and repassing. Now her eyes were fixed on the carpet in deep thought. No one was near. The hasty step coming up through the long gallery startled her. Surprised to hear the footfall, not unfamiliar, she was shocked, as if shot by a rifle—the salutation so sudden—that speaking voice her heart cherished so sacredly, was it he? She moved as if in stupor, but again saw that it was Granville. She tried to calm herself, but her spirit was greatly agitated. Former memories lived, glowed in her heart. Her lips spoke, but in a melancholy tone. Rutland was gay, yet with a shade of thought upon his countenance. The graceful and commanding form exhibited the majesty of the hero, and he never appeared to more advantage. She well observed his usual spirit and dignity.
                  "I need not ask: your looks, cousin Grita, tell me how well you are—the splendid French beauty."
                  "It is a very fine tale, indeed," said Grita, colouring highly, pride and sorrow struggling in her breast.
                  "I fear my curiosity has led me to a troublesome task," said the officer—"to find out why you were standing in this dark and silent place, alone, and so pensive."
                  "Occupied by melancholy reflections, and by anticipations as sad," was her reply.
                  They retired from the doorway, and passing along, she warmly pressed her cousin to remain with her and dine with them at four o'clock. He bowed, and gallantly declared his desire to avail himself of a compliment from her, which he more than valued; but an engagement obliged his return to attend to his military duties. Granville looked at her with all the depths of his soul, and she grasped his hand affectionately. Hand in hand they passed on, glad to feel they were friends once more; warm, loving cousins. They were earnestly rejoiced to speak voice to voice. After the shock they continued to promenade the corridor, side by side. His declared partiality for her was blended with every look and action. Returning slowly to the spacious drawing-room, Grita offered her cousin a chair, and seated herself in the recess. There he looked once more on his favourite flower. Her charmful power enwrapt his senses with eternal love. Melancholy imagination suggested that he ought to see her no more; but Granville Rutland remained till night. Her husband came at the appointed time, and found his lovely wife arrayed to his highest fancy; and proudly he smiled on her as Colonel Rutland rose to receive his warm and friendly welcome. Mr. Oustan urged that the Colonel should honour his fair cousin by accepting her invitation, and gratify his, Mr. Oustan's, high appreciation of the pleasure. Again she repeated her invitation, and he stayed. Thought had of late been wooing the weary man; and dare he risk the encounter again with one whom it convulsed his whole being to remember was another's wife? Could he escape! Her name at least would be continually in his ears. Ah! can language exaggerate the eloquence when a great and torturing spirit speaks out to a soul that comprehends? Crushed heart, ravished existence, bared before her at a glance! Hopeless! Ah! alas, from that fatal beauty Granville Rutland could no more escape than from the sun. Nor did he. Yielding to her charmful power, each day or two he would find it necessary to cross over to see her. The oars dipped to the rowing barge, and ramparts, cannon, military tactics, all faded before her genial smile. Yet, reader, see for yourself that the circumstances were powerful and dangerous. Soothed into sunbeams of happy enchantment, earnest imagination played over his diffused and refreshing spirit. Granville thus impressed upon these present pleasures faint lines of hope. That cheerful blaze once more animated the enthusiastic, ravishing existence of her love. Like a madman, he rushed on to conquer or perish midst the glorious slain. 
                        
                           "As, waving fresh their gladsome wing,
                           My weary soul they seem to soothe."
                        
                     
                  
                  Vengeance of love stood willing to sacrifice the contested conscience, without considering the enormity of such guilt. Enormous guilt! Not a day was lost in urging the painful old topic. Extraordinary results attended his persuasions. Grita was seriously alarmed, and fully sensible of every cruel mortification on his first allusion to things past, things present and future. In his tremulous voice he revived a severe reflection; the impression on her senses was indescribably terrible. Instantly she put aside the demand, and affectionately turned to other scenes. But this wild, dark page of life's history affected her extremely. Her thoughts dwelt on darksome deeds. "O God! Thou knowest all. I trust, and bear my cross erected to faith."
                  No day passed without his waiting upon Grita—another's! She was returning one morning from a visit to a neighbouring city. On leaving the omnibus, she slipped on the broad way where vehicles were ceaselessly passing. She had a severe fall, but Colonel Rutland was the first to rush out in the mêlée to assist the lady, supposed to be badly injured. The Colonel was lifting the almost senseless form as she recognized her cousin, who bore her in his arms to the Hotel du Nord.
                  "Let all mankind hear my voice of tribulation, Grita," he whispered in her ear, when they had reached the drawing-room; "my desolation on earth is complete. O God! what a crime to love another's wife as I love you."
                  She raised her hand to check his distempered imagination, with a frank simplicity of conversation, and promptly expressed no preference, no sign of consequence. Her manner inclined to—absolutely, she refused—his warm attentions, acting on her rock-foundation, Honor, Justice, Truth. But in truth and justice she loved him—love growing stronger each hour of their existence; and indulging in useless sorrow, she had pointed out to herself the necessity for fortitude and patience. This had strengthened the faculties of her mind, nerving her affliction to triumph by exertion. Indignant complaint of such treatment only exasperated his representations of her wrongs; and with lover-like contempt, he hurled down the penalty of her rashness as plausible excuse for declaring open hostilities against the husband. There was a fierce struggle for supremacy between the lovers, which at last ended in the discharge of her wifely duty. Colonel Rutland succeeded in obtaining ascendency over her conduct, so far as knowledge was concerned. New Year's day was to be observed with the usual brilliant receptions, on which occasion Mrs. Oustan would mingle her friendship with her cousins. With their universal goodness of heart, the Calbys had urged upon the Oustans the necessity of spending that day with them, and there she was. The mild dejection of Grita's countenance rendered her very interesting among the many styles of beauty. She was blushing beside the classic features of her cousin's lovely face, gracing home dignities with her usual air, and in the same parlour from which Mr. Oustan had taken the young ladies South, Ymataca as his bride. On that same day came another she had known before—young Thetford, who in less than two years after, died from intemperance.
                  Late in the day the ladies were alone, when the commanding figure of Colonel Rutland walked in to wish "a happy New Year." Grita was before him in never-to-be-forgotten splendour. Granville was struck by the richness of her appearance. She attracted notice from all who came in. What particularly deceived him, representing her love as calculating and cold, was the air of constant gayety and good spirits she displayed, and which were produced really by the animation displayed by every visitor, and the excitement often exhibited at large parties. But the gentleness and sweetness of her manner encouraged him to talk, while the vigour of his soul sparkled through every feature. At first he indulged in sallies of wit, but now and then assumed an air of tenderness. To strangers Grita possessed all the sprightliness of a Frenchwoman; yet, with all her coquetry, she conversed on general topics with freedom. In a quiet, mild dejection, which still shaded her face, she said aside to Granville, feelingly, that she lamented the hopeless love he still cherished; and amidst the conflict of emotions that assailed her, the wife's fidelity stood proof—affording thus a strong conviction of her blameless conduct.
                  How Granville tried to subdue this first and fatal love! Alas, how vain! The old passion regained its profound influence. Thus that day, the anniversary of prayers, they met, and as days came again, they met again. He followed her shadow like the sun. Overwhelmed with paroxysms of suffering, he became reserved and thoughtful in her presence. When requested at the Calbys' to sing Spargi d'amor, "I pray for thee," he immediately ly left on her refusal. She afterwards excluded herself almost entirely from his calls, without exciting in but one instance the husband's jealousy, so freely liberal was he to her views and conduct. She had too much honour to tempt it. A day came in which James Oustan thought best, and he calmly desired, Mrs. Oustan to decline the attentions of Colonel Rutland. Fate drew the threads from his hands, and by chance—ah! no, by destiny—one day Granville came again, towards the close of January, as if to inscribe and perpetuate her anniversary prayer. The officer sauntered into the Hotel du Nord, the fashionable rendezvous for officers of the army. Grita was accidentally in the drawing-room. She rose to leave, remembering the request of her husband and Mrs. Calby's advice, but a short time previous, when she took from a little box several of the Colonel's cards, and condemned them to the flames—all but one perished; only one she had saved, unknown to any but the "Father who seeth in secret."
                  "Wife as you are, beware," were the counselling words of Mrs. Calby.
                  "Once more," Grita said—once more she was resolved to see him. That day she was obliged by Mrs. Calby's entreaties to refuse the lover. That passed—it came once again. Maddened, he had lingered at his bay post to freshen the old and fatal love. Along his island-turf the aroma of forget-me-not fringed the rocks that echoed from the old world, and its ocean-wave, mingling its currents, to sway and thrill with loving fear. "Where art thou?" the Old World whispered; the New World answered, "Here." On that island he came by order of the Government, under whose flag he served—as he said, selected by a temptation to indulge the love he bore to another man's wife!—to be near, to frequent the presence of Grita, his child-love. That pensive melancholy, toned by her power, made a strong feature in his character. On a lofty terrace, formed by a granite bank around the shores of Eola, rose the soldier's home, under the ample canopy of trees. Here too he watched, beneath their foliage, the setting sun and the mild splendour of its light, fading on the distant landscape till the shadows of twilight melted its various features into one tint. He had hurried himself away from wainscoted remembrances, in which her name appeared written with an iron pen and graven on that rock forever. In the darkness of the storm he found delight to engage his attention near by the presence of his child-love; and if a sigh would sometimes intervene, and down his cheek a tear would roll, a beacon shone to cheer the mariner on life's rough sea. On the island of the bay Colonel Rutland resigned himself to the influence of these sweet and ever-attendant affections. He loved the soothing hour when her star trembled through the blue ether and reflected on the dark mirror of the waters. Colonel Rutland rendered interesting to visitors his island-home. Adapted to the rank of an officer's life, all was neat and conspicuous for simplicity. A few ornaments characterized his taste. The front of his quarters opened on the ground-floor by a rustic hall; while from his window the eye caught a pleasing landscape of hills and islands. The American Isle of Wight swept back towards the sea, but beautifully adorning the bosom of the wooded bay lay the twin isle, veiling to the east the pastoral simplicity of another post. Gliding out and around, white sails sauntered along with a breeze to the broad expanse of ocean.
                  Reader, I am meditative. At this point of my reflections the story heightens by the chain of Twin Isles. Let us delineate the mists of distance, bounded by the waters of creation. It must remain to us and our story historically an unshaken descendant from the younger branch of Eola. Voices echo along the margin of Twin Isles, on the pathless plain fringed with green and gold, and depending from its chain-drops. We forge the link.
                  The young wife, with tears in her eyes, exclaimed to Mrs. Calby, "I must see him once again." The agony, the fear she suffered was intolerable; but it was as mighty to him she loved. And the ONCE has come, as we find her in that room, and on the point of leaving. Granville walked firmly by her side. An expression of mournfulness overspread his every feature.
                  "Hold!" he said; "surely we are not separated forever! Time nor absence has effaced your image. Listen, for God and heaven's sake!"
                  She sternly reproached him. "Never! Let us part. I must before heaven bid you fly. We must not live thus;" and she fled to the anteroom on her way to the passage that led to her chamber. He strode after and clutched her hand. She stood petrified, listening to his desperate sentiment, terrified for the consequences. He held her hand as if in a vice, and led her thither. "Grita, you cannot leave me. Our lives are one, our souls united. From each other we never can be parted. God has bound us together, and no man shall put asunder the bond. I shall speak. Good God!" he almost shrieked, "has it come to this? You, you indeed so willing to resign me! Let me entreat your attention, if only a few moments. I was wretched enough when I came hither," continued Granville vehemently. "Grita! Grita! I say, do not increase my misery by this coldness, this cruel refusal."
                  The despondency with which he spoke almost affected her to tears, while persisting to refuse his entreaties brought out her unutterable affection; but with prudence and dignity, on this most severe occasion of her life, and standing in the clear light of her danger, she must listen. She did listen to his entreaties with attention, and replied only by endeavouring to soothe him with affectionate assurances of her proud esteem; that unalterable memory, she ventured to tell him innocently, would live. The accents of that voice thrilled his heart, while her look of dignified displeasure shocked his pride. The torturing conversation became desperate. With quicker steps he advanced to join her at the window.
                  "Grita!" he cried, "Grita! I have much to say."
                  She was thoroughly alarmed at his countenance and the keen desperation of his bearing. He besought that she would grant him permission to remain with her, and to fix on a future life; and there, that day, he would communicate the intentions of their hope to her husband.
                  "I know there is no love to be lost on your side for the man you have married—he you call husband, and—my wife! How it maddens me! I am a maniac when I see it so! His life, Grita, is in danger while I feel thus. Ah! no, it cannot be; you are mine!"
                  Ah! reader, was not our heroine's mind conflicted with emotions of nearer interest to Granville? Would not such a tremendous circumstance bind or loose virtue to lowest depravity, murder, crime upon crime? "While equal to virtue only," her memory was suffered to dwell on fortitude; and she declined the confidence. That meeting was terrible in the extreme—an ingenuous confession under embarrassing difficulties with its strength and tenderness. Both were virtually nearer to each other than before. They had braved the storm with all the might of souls arraigned to meet their God. Colonel Rutland added, in a solemn voice, "Yet why, Grita, should I torture myself with remembrances? Why do I linger here? Am I not ruined? Would it not be madness to involve you in my misfortunes, while I believe—is it not so—that your heart is still my own? But, child-love, my fortitude is gone!" said he sadly; "I cannot leave you, I cannot now bid you an eternal farewell. Say, Grita, that at least you will see me again—once! I am going—I am—going," he stammered, "going to leave you—to—leave—you—forever!" As these last words were spoken his voice trembled hoarsely; he threw himself in the chair again, and was utterly unable to leave the room, or to say farewell. Losing her self-command, Grita found it impossible to chill his feelings.
                  "O Granville!" she rejoined, "do not lead me to shake a resolution difficult of conquest, and render your present sufferings more severe by pointing out the barrier which separates us. Abandon your distempered resentments, and I shall never be able to thank you enough for this proof of your love. Silence, now, must be interpreter preter to my soul's hidden secret." Thus she strove to release his mind from the horrible abyss of guilt and despair. "I shall never be insensible to the present nor the past," she said. He replied, "Ah! Grita, come weep with me, past cure, past help! I must intrude no longer," he continued, in great agitation. With a convulsive sigh he made an effort to recover his composure, and stood trembling before the idol of his heart.
                  "Grita, will you promise always to think of your unhappy Granville? Wretch that I am, to seek to entangle you in a connection that would ruin you! But I have loved—I do love you better than my life. I could not now attain strength of mind to surrender you, if your prudence had not demanded it. The sacrifice is not due my merit. I will no longer implore you, or endeavour to shake your resolution by the pleadings of a selfish passion. I resign you, miserable that I am. What is this whole world without my Grita of old? Yet again, before I go, let me tell you that, whatever may be my destiny, whatever I may be doomed to suffer, I must, I shall always love you, most fondly love you."
                  Once more he bade Grita adieu—pressed her hand—looked at her with one long eager gaze, for the last time; then in deepest misery he left the parlour. Grita remained where he left her, listening to his departing footsteps, sounding fainter and fainter. as he crossed the narrow hall. The first object she looked on was the chair on which he had sat. Tears which had been repressed came to her relief. She was at length sufficiently composed to return to her chamber, the loveless wife—struggling between affection and reason. She rose the next morning with a weak and trembling frame. The walls of that small but lofty room may speak, the great mirrors reflect the pain and expression they bore, never to be wiped from its surface. Cold and dark the billows closed over those wild looks and clasped hands, when a voice from above whispered, "Woman! wife! beware!" From thence came the power of resistance, for Granville had staked the whole weight of his mighty nature on the hopeless love. The adieu—"a long adieu"—that was the severest test of the woman. Now she wended her way by the side of him she called husband, a saddened, changed being. Granville's lonely spirit, with an almost unsettled intellect, suffered desperately. Frenzy, at times deep remorse, seized his mind; and Providence in wisdom only saved him from destruction—the wine-cup and fatal horrors. Reassurance of Grita's innocence and noble worth increased his delirium. A heavy, deep dejection and melancholy hung over his sad spirit, and he hurried at once from his island-home to the colder climate of Boston. For a short time he remained at Fort Warren; then he asked leave of the Department to be sent to the wide forest and plains. Wandering and reckless, he strove to soothe his spirit in those vast solitudes. Even there currents whispered again, and sighed in the vesper breathing from a darkened sky, that her star led him with trembling eye, and conducted his footsteps over the plains. And there it was darting between the swelling leaves and dirge-like from the foaming waves. On the frontier he would sit alone in his camp, in conjunction with her star and with the tempered wind. Then he would pause to listen to a sound lulling in gentle sadness their songs of the mournful past. The remembrances these awakened were too powerful for his heart. Tears fell with his words. 
                        
                           "In heaven above, where all is love,
                           We shall have no sorrow there."
                        
                     
                  
                  Launched on a treacherous sea, Ymataca must transmit her name. Her ambition for excellence seemed the motive-power of her soul. Naturally her faith solemnized a promise; but a tide rolled over her character, showing that an impression was still there, and graven on a rock. No language can exaggerate the torture of her endurance, when soon after her return from Europe, she was compelled by her husband's promise and her mother's entreaties to visit Virginia. Oh, Granville! Where was he? Could that past die? Never! Once in the busy camp, Grita imagined that the memory of his child-love would be to him an idle vision; but she prayed not so.
                  Accordingly, late in the winter the Oustans arrived in Richmond, apparently joyous. Ymataca's pride had an interest at stake which required a well-studied part. As I have said, her love for her selfish parent was cold. The young wife looked in terror at her crushed hopes, annihilated by her action. And, too, her own consummate vanity was severely censured in society for uncongenial intercourse. Mr. Oustan's inability to soften her feelings at Richmond disturbed his peace for a time, and with expressions of love and tenderness he appealed to her worth and his own heart; for at times vehement reproaches changed their placid stream of domestic life. "And must I return to the haunts of those days? Ah! those lights flare vividly before me. But yield must I? Yes! I must now, to the respect due my family in the eyes of the world; but concession mailed in adamant."
                  Favourable opportunities presented themselves for the Oustans among friends and the society of the Virginia capital. In March the delicious coolness of the evening air gave life to the returning party. They reached Templeton Hotel after night gathered in. Ymataca prepared for rest, and did not permit any to see her. How to avoid insight into the past, reflecting so directly and drearily upon her, was an undecided question. With reluctance she mingled in collisions: recognized the original hearth-rug, with its seat, the last step from which the form of Granville had vanished. There the mainspring of force formed, in the well-known house of the Westerlings. Not a sound answered her thoughts. His name was never heard. 
                        
                           "They told him she was happy now,
                           The gayest of the gay;
                           
                              They hint that she forgets him now—
                           But heed not what they say.
                           Like him, perhaps, she struggles with
                           Each feeling of regret;
                           But if she loves as he has loved,
                           She never can forget."
                        
                     
                  
                  Mechanically formal, Mrs. Oustan sallied forth among familiar scenes, waiting her opportunity impatiently to be in the home of another clime. A few days' reception at the drawing-room of the Templeton sufficed her. Conscious of cruel shame, that darkened her pride of him she loved so well, so innocently, the injuries soured against the goodness of her nature. But her brave spirit steeled itself against influence of a word or a wish of Madame Marlborough, unless gratified by her husband's own liberal will. She then smiled her gratitude on his feeling heart, and no more. Could it be that her blasted and deformed existence was unknown? Ah! no, she recognized in the mother's plea a betrayal of her self-esteem— selfish, calculating obedience to filial law. The outlaw of childhood was conscious of a large-hearted lot. Her resentment was attached to painful, repugnant remembrances—not vengeance or disdain—but pain, a wound inflicted which was mortal. The worthless weed, despised by the envious few or many, if flung away as the corrupt branch, the stem withered from the household vine, she is nothing! Pass away from the giddy, frivolous flirt—the married belle! they say. Immense pretensions! She has neither heart nor conscience! say they. Mrs. Oustan shocked the prude relations and friends with her airs! To us, reader, she has not sounded a false note, nor harped on fashionable keys. This one-eyed monster was regarded as a phenomenon of heartless fashion, not even respected by some! a wife surrounded with lovers in hotels! From that life she might suffer; but, if lawful evidence had been required by her accusers, they could have placed in the hands of the world a noble use of her authority, cited as Justice and Truth. Ymataca Oustan was among the few women whose brow could bear the halo of guiding power, when swayed to such circumstances as her life unfolds. She laughed at their suspicions; for had her actions been as gay as opportunities presented, her name, her character might truly have been ruined. Other women have done well; but Ymataca Oustan excelled them all. Her love was the sacrifice—principle and truth must sustain her promise. Was it a trifle, that any woman would, or could do? Never! By nature formed to Truth and Justice, faith led her on and upwards. Yet only human was she. Living as she lived, constantly exposed to the glare of worldliness, to her credit let us believe she lived nobly, as on the scroll before God. In secret she made her confessions to Him. He promised to reward openly; and those embers were left burning, under His eye of divine compassion, and the sacred truth of its nature was a combination of feeling which excited to resolution. That mother's influence was perverted over every child, and carried her case out to an obstinate resolve; for she never lost hold of an object on which she had set her heart. However, it was not in the heart of her child to judge her withal, the worldly, egotistical, scheming woman—if she was such. The heartless stroke could bind no claim now, even to still the harsh exposures of hotel life. The check-rein was unfastened, and no home with her child. Home? ah! no. James Oustan knew well how to guard her as his treasure. He dared not to venture on domestic life with his wife and her family. It seemed a part of his promise to keep her ever free from that mother's influence. And in the city of the South, poor child! she reaped reproaches; heaped-up contempt was thrown in her face, as if it was no matter after wrestling with a former attachment. What she suffered, God only can know. Such was the mighty contrast which Ymataca presented when suddenly thrown into the great world. It is no stern picture that is thus portrayed by a truthful hand. Credulously confident of a future union with him she loved best, her guileless virtues developed a new principle, gentle and submissive. She became companionable in conjugal duties, regardless of the inability of others to estimate her faculties or capabilities. Talent is talent, mind is mind, was the practical application she made of her laws turned to purposes: it was the great question of the day, in view of the wrongs poured in wrath upon her. "Why, if she loved Colonel Rutland, did she marry another!" was the chime reverberating sadly on her heart. Not one believed he loved her. The sting of a cobra would not have been more poisonous, nor the pang worse, but "truth, though crushed to earth, will rise again." Others have yielded to more and been redeemed. Was it a crime? Let her equals in refinement and position be the judges!
                  Thank heaven, our hero was indeed the gentleman—to her the great and good man. Without seeming sensible that Ymataca had been wronged, they laughed at the untold love. What valour has weapons against a jest? Several instances were mentioned by friends and relatives, in her absence, of the treasured memory in the presence of the officer. He as often evaded the torture by a smile, whilst pain rankled at the vitals of his own hoarded secret. He had met in other houses, among the hills and in the city, Madame Marlborough; and it is remarkable to say, Colonel Rutland never allowed the occasion to pass without observing the analysis of his feeling, impressing in words connected with application of reason the responsible weight of her opinion, and briefly brought forward the testimony he had endured; adding that had it not been for her, Grita would have been his wife. Repeatedly he accused her of the guilty step. She could not deny it. "Then do you not think her sentence hard?" he would gravely ask; "another's wife! she was for me,"—endeavouring to conceal his pain and chagrin under show of gallantry, half demurely, half coquettishly looking at Madame Marlborough with an inquisitive gaze—then and there she heard his words of love, unbeliever as she was, and his presence was most unwelcome—that alone being a reproach, whether she alluded to the past or not. Was not that daughter too pure to plead for a traitor! The mocking and sarcastic manner sternly overshadowed her face. What frail defences!—with cruel words on her lips, Minho Marlborough hates, scorns, and loathes the passionate appeal which crossed but did not hinder her resolve. At other places besides the hills this occurred. Colonel Rutland was seldom at the South in Grita's absence, but business obliged his return to Arthur Seat, and he had passed over to visit Pine Lawn, cousin Doctor's familiar haunt. It is well for the reader to make cognizance of the connection for future purposes. Colonel Rutland was there, and leaned against the pillar of the porch, with his arms folded, watching and rejoicing in the effect his words produced, with a mocking laugh at Madame Marlborough's incredulity and disregard for truth. She paused for an instant, then drew back from his unwelcome presence, displeased at his long-continued admiration, and recoiling from the ashy paleness of his cheek and the look of agony that came over his moody countenance. A sudden flush crimsoned her cheek as his voice thrilled with earnest energy, "Love requited—requited!"
                  "You love her still," said a whisper of the mother's heart, almost a year after their hopes had been crossed; no trifle his errand of love.
                  "The idol of my worship," he continued." Grita, the fair, the beautiful, my star by night, my sun by day—the idol of my worship."
                  Showing not a shade of respect, Madame Marlborough paused to gather courage, and then proceeded, with a scowling brow, with her remarks. Granville Rutland, the high-born gentleman, smiled carelessly, but was silent, yet not without feeling, as he coupled its eloquence with his manner. They were struck with wonder at his boldness, as he still continued talking with many persons, and some belles of Midlothian, anon staring with a smile on Madame Marlborough's execution and passion. But a less decided tone ended her fury, as she coloured more and assumed an air of command that he should leave and never approach her presence again. Her unmarried daughters had even then again changed to admiration for Colonel Rutland's honours. The officer refused the entreaties of the Doctor's wife, who entered the same room under the beams of the old porch. She loved the cousin—urged the distinguished hero to spend the evening with them. Colonel Rutland could not spare the moment, and sauntering carelessly down the gravel walk leading to the road, passed on beneath the projecting branches of Pine Forest. Not an inch farther were they to read his hoarded secret; it was held too sacred, too deep.
                  During the visit we now record, the ceremony of dignified dislike was accompanied with no chivalrous interest in the kinsman's bride. Not a seat was offered by a special invitation to the hospitality of their complimentary board. Ah! no; profound aversion could not ask "the fashionable, heartless phenomenon" to join even a social gathering. Such department was in powerful contrast with the splendid entertainments lavishly bestowed in Liverpool, London, and various cities of Scotland and the Continent. Not a home-circle, but the choicest few welcomed the bride's return—as freely as the large number of friends, acquaintances, and relatives disposed of her merits, and as affably as they sought the reception of her fashion-plates from Paris. Life it was without its spark of conscience. Happily their visit was not a lengthy one. Days and weeks passed. Mrs. Oustan assumed her indifference admirably, dressed most tastefully, as one who scarce ever studied the art. It was so naturally arranged as to affect her mind lightly. She could seldom remember what she wore.
                  We must proceed, almost believing our hero and heroine are to be made old lovers and true. They are satiating their appetites with evil tongues croaking and hissing the sprinkling venom on her fair young name. After some pleasing but painful reunions, Mr. and Mrs. Oustan finished their calls of etiquette, and social bonds were severed once again. She gladly flew from the walls of that past. The next morning our friends were far on their way—Astrea encircling her fate, and revolving around the orbit—moving North. Reaching Hotel du Nord, they were soon settled in rich apartments, but too late for any further excursions than a run up to the Academy grounds at West Point. There they found only a few, being too early for the season; but, rusticating in the retreat of imperial scenery, they much enjoyed the landscape. From her chamber of the Flag Staff, the hills of the Highlands stretch a blue chain in the background, and a splendid view is obtained from their summit. The extensive hotel grounds form a series of interesting places around the camp. The military road passes over one of the steep sides of Hudson river, rising perpendicularly a height of fifty feet. Beneath might rightly be termed "Mad Leap." The edge of the precipice is spanned by a fine new bridge, railed on the riverside. The water beating below against the rocks produces intermingled voices like a mill in motion. To this famous resort of world-wide celebrities and butterfly fashion congregated in the hotels, the Oustans have come. It is a very interesting visit. Surrounding the plain, the pretty villas and officers' homes, with the departments of administration, give a remarkably village-like aspect to West Point. In the immediate vicinity are the encampments, which spring gradually up in routine, and strongly fortified with cadets, forming an area calculated to contain five thousand men. A little beyond the ancient chapel, and in full view, are the richly endowed institutions of the Academy; and look, reader! on the east side, at the long low building, was our lady's chamber, delightfully located. Our tourists are at home, among most of the distinguished, at the post of Captain Asky Lallelder, and many of their friends and acquaintances. This movement recalled to her painful memories, by lifting the sable curtain that concealed Granville's boyhood as from that drill-room and school of science he had gone out to his chosen path, and from those precincts had come with his West Point honours. There it was the soldier's spirit mounted to his breast from those very halls. Masters had built up his wealth by high spirit and ambition. Ah! those joyous sensations of early youth and vigour had attracted him to deeds of fame. There, too, admiring smiles and cordial hands had whispered "Distinction!" There she is, on his inspiration grounds, spending a few days wandering over the dawning scenes of Granville's blighted life. All that past glided before her—grief intolerable. Grita listening to Granville's practised tread, his early exploits. The striding ghost sounded in her ears a drop of his voice, uttering, "Can earth give back such love as you lost in mine?" but she never wounded the coronet of his great and mighty feelings; she was there only to collect the jewels of their crown of love to wear in the shrine of her heart.
                  But these stolen moments were dimmed by the morning's mists creeping down from the blue chain of the Highlands to her window-seat. Now she is interrupted; a hurried messenger announces visitors. Joining the friends in the hotel drawing-room, Mrs. Oustan's Spanish brilliancy was in contrast with her light drapery. She cordially accepted the polite invitation for a carriage-drive. Mr. and Mrs. Oustan, in a handsome phaeton and drawn by splendid bays, rapidly skirted the plain, and swept up hills and over dales, for breathing the air of early summer. It was a lovely evening when they reached the Flag Staff. Suddenly they drove past the frontier, and conversation as suddenly hushed. The familiar tones of the regiment band came upon their ear in full harmony, reverberating through the gorge and over the Highlands. Some days passed, varying from each other. Thus would Grita go back to dreams, looking from her seat on the small portion of the fashionable world, scattered in various directions. At a rehearsal she hears the lines of an early friend, a young officer, in his soft, full tenor, singing the first verses of a West Point song: 
                        
                           "Benny Havens, oh!
                           So we'll sigh o'er reminiscences
                           Of Benny Havens, oh!"
                        
                     
                  
                  And so she did. Melancholy was the sympathetic tone of Lieutenant U—d's grand voice. The good music continued: 
                        "And sufficient to the bridal day is the evil of it."
                     
                  
                  That eloquent influence withered her spirit. Reflecting from the land of sun-flowers, heavily, most heavily those cast-back thoughts pressed on her now. Those words with fervent earnestness carried instant truth to her heart. It was the last echo that inflamed her soul.
                  The Oustans were progressing to the stage-road to resume the duties of life. At the inhospitable rock, which brought back Old Stirling overhanging the field of Bannockburn, she repeated the romantic lines— 
                        
                           "And soon the bulwark of the North,
                           Gray Stirling, with her towers, look'd down."
                        
                     
                  
                  "True, true," replied Mr. Oustan, as they pushed off in the superb day-boat or floating palace of the Hudson.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XIV.
                  TIME is up; and the Oustans set sail for the British Isles on the 6th of July, on their return to the Old World, on board of the steamship Pacific. Ymataca Oustan had just such a career of noted and flattering attentions, called by change of incidents Lady Patroness of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. Many old fellow-travellers went out with them, including several ladies who were for long years her attached friends. After a joyous passage, with bad and fine weather mingled, the Oustans arrived at Liverpool. A delightful visit of a few days is brought to a close, that they might visit and extend their route to new scenes, returning in time for the Great London Exhibition.
                  The Oustans commenced their sight-seeing with Windsor Castle, the venerable seat of royalty, replete with collections of interest both to the antiquary and man of taste. From its round tower they examined with wild delight the vast proportions of this royal domain. The state apartment; the queen's private, most private reception drawing-room, where Prince Albert and herself enjoyed the unrivalled landscape from the broad bay-window of the Castle steep upon the esplanade; flower-gardens and terraces stretching far away over the Thames, and in the distance the classic towers of Eton, dedicated to learning. Every nook was great and of imposing grandeur—through each apartment royalty gave birth to royalty—the favourite gallery of the royal consort's armoury, with the jewelled throne-chairs and crowns and sceptres of the heathen kings, and swords and spears glittering with precious stones. Much time was engaged in that superb gallery, where each article was arranged in its place by Prince Albert. The throne-room was more gorgeous than any description from my pen could be. They pass from its snowy trimmings and gold-dazzling presence, by the royal stairs, more than grand from their age-born splendour. They pass to the gold pantries, the walls of which are groaning with the weight of accumulated wealth. Millions upon millions are formed into royal plate, and within its glass-cased sides shine in wonderful display the gold pantries. Many rich services of plate are arranged in Windsor vault, in memory of departed splendour, and in keeping with royal greatness. A large excavation had been made on the side of one of the casements, where, the armed man on duty informed us, the queen's favourite set had been taken, as she never used any for her private table but a special legacy; and that immense service was ever a part of her treasure from palace to palace. Before the centre-table, covered with glass, stood the baptismal font, used since time was remembered by royalty. Each birth was consecrated from its waters of redemption, and its age was as precious as its great value. A large vase of precious gems, supported by a porphyry column of inestimable worth, adorned the pedestal; flowers of gold and jewels bedecked its beautiful perfection; gems of rare brilliancy edged its top. Altogether it was regarded the gem of the gold pantries. From those perishable mementos of royal grandeur and powerful wealth a lesson was learned, never to be forgotten, of the time when crowns not made with hands shall be the portion of God's redeemed ones. Crownless on earth, they shall wear crowns of life in the heavens. What contrast! yet what dignity conferred ferred by God on a righteous kingdom—crowns and sceptres consecrated to goodness and greatness by His reign over mortals!
                  Another advance to the instructive remembrance, and the Oustans stand under the sublimity of St. George's Chapel; accommodating their language to its scared solemnity, they feel a union in that royal temple to one God. "Our Father, hallowed be Thy name!" cordially repeating thanks to God for such a queen, and glorious believer in God Almighty, and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord. It was enough to feel themselves Christians, to be on equality with Queen Victoria.
                  From thence, we proceeded to admire God's handiwork, in the noble stud of horses in Windsor stables. "The Wanderer" was a specimen of the purest Arab, fleet-footed, and white as the snows of Zembla—the most beautiful animal of horse-breed that could possibly be. He was a present just sent to the queen by the sultan.
                  More than can be told was seen at Windsor, and the Oustans left through the park in a private carriage for Richmond and Virginia Waters. In every way that was enjoyable we jaunted on. Again we took up our residence in London, at Morley's. Old Trafalgar Square presented the usual objects of interest. From place to place we skirted the coast-range, and crossed from Southampton to the Isle of Wight. Ymataca looked a rustic to perfection, at the quiet little inn on the Chine. We whiled away the summer hours, visiting the curious ravine of Shanklin. From below it appeared as if the solid cliff had been rent in twain from top to bottom. The sides of the chasms are in striking contrast, almost perpendicular, with comparatively little vegetation. The more shelving side is shaded with tall trees and wild brushwood; enlivened above and below the coast-range with cottages picturesquely situated. The descent to the Chine is by a rude winding path in the sea-cliff, which is indeed grand and impressive, beautiful and romantic, sublime and terrific, interpersed with a succession of exquisite lands.
                  At Cliff Lodge Hotel the Oustans are sheltered under the myrtles which envelop the gothic walls. This charming marine residence commands a magnificent prospect. Our route lay on the carriage-road along the under cliff; above, how startling and grand! below, the waves of the English Channel lave the beach. Sea-bathing machines, like Old Brighton carriages, add a singular feature to the coast. At every spot new pleasures greet our travellers. Stopping at Ventnor, and at Niton we visit the tower of St. Catharine's Light-house. A stone tower rises above Niton, one hundred feet from the ground; the lantern is thirty feet higher. It is erected on the cliff between Buckaster Cove and Sanrock Spring. These waters have a larger proportion of the iron alumine than any other mineral water yet discovered. In memory of the wreck of the Clarendon in 1836, a magnificent column rises from its great altitude in beautiful grandeur. We reached the termination of the under cliff at Black Gang Chine Hotel—the very ideal of sweet comfort. Neatness pervades everything. But it is an inauspicious spot, 
                        "Since nature here no happy feature wears."
                     
                  
                  Our route thence lay along hedgerows and narrow defiles. The entrance to this savage magnificence was impressive. 
                        
                           "O'er the dark waves the wind tempestuous howls;
                           The screaming sea-bird quits the troubled sea;
                           But the wild gloomy scene has charms for me.
                           On some rude fragment of the rocky shore,
                           Where, on the fractured cliff, the billows break,
                           Musing, my solitary walk I take,
                           And listen to their deep and solemn roar."
                        
                     
                  
                  Such were her sentiments on the coast of the Isle of Wight. There too she culled rose-tinted geraniums and beautiful flower-gems from the grounds of her majesty's favourite residence, at Osborne. Yes, reader, sweetly Ymataca looked in her flowing summer silk, mistress of a private table covered with the whitest cloth, on which was spread their simple yet dainty fare—South-down mutton chops, most delicious strawberries, laid on huge green leaves, and London port to invite the appetite. Turning inland we found the drives delightful, the roads hard and smooth, flanked by hawthorn hedges, and ornamented with the quintessence of picturesqueness. Sunday the party rested at the Downs on Freshwater Cliff. The prospect is unrivalled in sublimity. Beneath the beautiful range of its impending precipices, at least a hundred feet higher than the loftiest spire in Europe, Ymataca felt emotions mingled with terror and admiration. She ascended to the fine hotel overhanging the chine of Freshwater Bay. Against her balcony roses were trained, and hung in clusters over the entrance to her parlour. The enchantment was heightened by flowery beds and borders. There her very heart reposed in the sublime picturesqueness of its overwhelming impressions and diversity of features. The day was resplendent when we proceeded around the Needle Rock to Alum Bay. The prominent beauties of the bay are two remarkable isolated rocks of large dimensions; one being of a pyramidal form, the other a bold rugged arch. 
                        
                           "With terrible irruption bursting o'er
                           The chalky cliffs, tremendous surges roar;
                           Hoarse thro' each winding creek the tempest raves,
                           And hollow rocks repeat the groan of waves,
                           Monuments of nature."
                        
                     
                  
                  Inland again, the Oustans reach old Caris-broke. The interesting ruins stand in the centre of the Island, built it is said, when Britain was first invaded by the Romans. Ymataca passed the bridge and entered the gateway. Above she saw the initials of Elizabeth, and the date 1598. She had repaired the portico, and the ancient name of Woodville was placed over the arch, and on either side were the white roses of the house of York. How soundless the tread of those mailed knights and armed men on the very pavement on which she stood! Ivy grew luxuriantly over the walls, and above all the donjon keep, the interior all decaying. We ascended seventy-three stone steps, and nine more to the parapet. Returning, our guide led us to the Roman Well. It is three hundred feet deep, two hundred feet cut through solid rock. A meek little donkey stepped into a huge wheel-like tread-mill, and drew up for us a bucket of ice-cold water. A portion was thrown back, and in about four seconds it struck below distinctly. Then a lamp was lowered to the bottom to show the awful depth. Gathering flowers from the broad old battlement, our rustic heroine pressed them in her herbarium. From thence they left, after scouring the island in search of all that was to be seen, and departed from the British Madeira for Portsmouth and Canterbury, thence to London, to prepare for a tour over Europe. A short sojourn of days well accounted for found our travellers going up the Thames to the North Sea. After a boisterous passage they arrived at Ostend and revisited the Hotel Fontaine. A day or more, and they enjoy Le Digne, broader than the parapet of the China wall. Le Digne is said to be the finest walk in Europe, a mile long, and at low water the sea is forty feet below. It is paved with Dutch brick, and arranged with seats for loiterers.
                  From Ostend the Oustans proceeded to Ghent, a fine old city standing on 27 islands, which possesses 300 bridges. Again they revisit Brussels. In the mean time Mrs. Oustan's health was extremely frail. When she left America, her faithful old physician, Dr. Lidale, had almost given her up as hopelessly in a decline. Her strength had since improved, but she looked delicate, and among strangers, was taken for an invalid. She was conveyed from Cologne in a delicate condition, and thence to Brussels. They were accompanied by a lovely and accomplished woman from London—Miss Calthorpe, niece and heiress of a most distinguished nobleman of England. Miss Calthorpe was a charming companion for Mrs. Oustan; and added her high attainments to the comfort and pleasure of our party—mistress as she was of six languages. They arranged a plan and revisited Brussels, with a party of German ladies and gentlemen. Most agreeable additions were made to reminiscences of the famed and grand city of Germany. Proceeding on their way with high ideas of the sublime, the Oustans visited the field of Waterloo. We traversed the historical district to headquarters, constantly recurring to the monuments of its period. We observed the real importance of its influence; and, as indispensable to the completion of the picture, we stood around the old council-table preserved as headquarters. At Hougoumont, Ymataca looked on the battered slab of oak. It bore the face of age and strength—upon it she wrote a line in memory of—, and lifting from it a copy of a catalogue, selected the most exquisite lines in honour to Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Fox Canning, who fell on the bloodiest night, and was buried where he died, over which spot a tablet is erected. Delighted with its woodland wildness and the solemnity of the classic soil, she preserved a memento of Waterloo. Probably few spots are more solemn or worthy of being visited.
                  We returned in our open carriage over a road winding through the Forest of Ardennes, past a sweeping avenue of grand trees blasted by the cannon of Waterloo. The parish church in the neighbourhood was an object to look at, seared by bullets—now a mutilated relique of that battle-ground. Rustic cottages were sprinkled on the road-side, and buried 'mid orchard trees with children playing under them. Jacques was our spokesman, an actor in the scenes, who saw "glory 'mid the glorious slain," and had been on the field at Quatre Bras. Onward our fine gray horses scampered, passing a number of parties on the road to Waterloo. The horses charged among the dirty herd of beggars surrounding the carriage and dashed through obstructions; then plunged with proud step into the long road forming a continuous level to Ardennes. The branches of these trees meet and span the road with an emerald canopy, which forms a vista, unequalled in Europe, miles on miles away. It seems unending to the eye, a level strip, tunnelled, as it were, through the fastness of the forest. A lower arch also spans, with the same significant glory, the narrow equestrian road. Only now and then a sunbeam finds its way through the bough-roofed vistas.
                  At points diverging from the main entrance, we advanced into heathery hills and narrow dells. To the right a sequestered castle stands in one of the finest parts of Ardennes. Countless red squirrels scampered away across the road and jumped into fern-beds.
                  The many delights of the drive were rehearsed at the Hotel de l'Europe at Brussels, next to the Emperor's grand white marble palace. In the cool of the evening the Oustans held their last reception in Brussels, and spent the last evening in the deep recesses of the Pare de Marie Thérèse. The illumination of the wild and deliciously cool dell was fine and effective. The best band of the city poured forth their strains to a delighted multitude. We left in the early train via the Spas for Antwerp, where we found innumerable things for comment. We rested at the hotel opposite the Grand Platz. Above our window rose the grandest of spires in its exquisite workmanship, compared by Napoleon to Mechlin lace. There too we examined the great chef-d'œuvre of Rubens, "The Ascent and Descent from the Cross." Solemn and holy thoughts were suggested as they gazed on the canvas whereon is depicted that scene, so awful in its fidelity. Leaving the grand cathedral of Notre Dame, we were held in silent reflection at the great entrance, gazing upon brass-head nails driven into the flag pavement, marking 35 bright dots, in memory of an artist-workman who fell from the pinnacle of the spire of Notre Dame, and whose body broke into as many pieces as the nails indicate. Opposite the nail-tomb is a most exquisite iron monument, cast in spiral threads and filagree figures, the work of a blacksmith, who exercised his art upon it to gain the love of a woman, the daughter of Master Vandyck, the great painter. Insulted by the painter, he dropped his tools and stopped his bellows, blew out the fire on the anvil, and became an artist himself. So well did his genius display itself, as to rival the father and gain the daughter. His masterpiece is hung in reverence on the walls of Notre Dame. His original work is in statu quo, in the sublime presence of Notre Dame.
                  From Antwerp to Aix-la-Chapelle: thence we passed on to Cologne. So summer months passed away in making preparations and continuing our rambles. Ymataca was one to feel grateful for all the advantages which her station and wealth procured; but she could take no pleasure in culling the roses within her reach without a sigh. Consolation was only found in conscience, and inborn pride to act well her part. Miss Calthorpe was in her element, and with her inspiring conversation deep and agreeable impressions were formed.
                  It was past midnight when our guests arrived at the ancient city of Cologne. We drove through the long, quaint streets, and arrived at Hotel Dische. Ascending a broad, grand staircase, the door closed on our group of travellers. Everything was ready. We collected around the midnight meal, hungry and thirsty for tea. A little time was consumed in the brilliantly lighted rooms, and from their elegant parlour the Oustans retired to a richly attired chamber; Miss Calthorpe to a complete boudoir of comfort adjoining.
                  Early next morning, our travellers assembled in the drawing-room, and inquiries were made as to the day's proceedings. A few Americans here joined the party. The programme was agreed upon, after a sumptuous breakfast, such as one might expect to find at Hotel Dische. They started first to visit the grandest cathedral in the world, as every enlightened person knows. Six hundred years have been consumed in its erection, each successive century adding to its fair proportions. An interesting story is attached to the altar-piece, the work of Rubens, which is a masterpiece, representing the martyrdom of the Apostle Peter, which was carried away by the French, in 1805. A painter of that city made a copy of it from recollection, and so perfect was his memory, that the copy bears the minutest resemblance to the original. O memory, thou wakener of the dead!
                  All points of interest were visited, and after sufficient rest and knowledge of that blackened relic of cities, we left for Düsseldorf. All necessary arrangements settled, luggage packed and placed over our carriage-top, with a few words of direction, we drove to the bridge of boats, and crossed the Rhine to the railway station. The view was beautiful. Beneath the swift-rustling current, the waves lashed their waters with hollow sound and plashed from boat to boat. On shore, across the Rhine, trees and grassy banks were fresh with summer flowers. The bridged boats at the end of the street led to the Bureau. 
                        
                           "Thus on they pass with lightsome tread,
                           Nor think the way too long."
                        
                     
                  
                  Having landed, and in time for the train to Düsseldorf, our ladies were seated in the grand saloon of the splendid station. A large and mixed crowd was assembled at the starting point. Some were pacing along the broad platform, puffing the curling smoke from fragrant Havanas; others listlessly lolling on luxurious sofas; and again others gathering travelling encumbrances, shawls, bags, and hand-guides. All were striving to wear time away. A slight event disturbed the current of affairs, creating some sensation! Among the promiscuous groups there was an arrival of quite a distinguished character—that of an old man, who came from the carriage-way. He was very handsome. The crowd was a large one, and more than filled the reception room. The infirm old gentleman stood feebly as his numerous retinue searched in vain for a chair. At last some of the party remonstrated with a number of foreigners, for their want of civility, and especially for their disrespect to gray hairs; but they selfishly clung to their seats. From a remote corner there came a fine-looking young American, as was evident from his appearance. He had not heard the complaint, but he saw the want of urbanity, and offered a comfortable arm-chair procured from the office of the Bureau. Our gallant cavalier, Mr. Oustan, was far off attending to tickets, and only came in time to see the old man sink down quite fatigued into the large chair. Smiling on the young gentleman, the old man said, "Sir, young as you are, this is a severe comment on the gallantry of those supposed to be gentlemen. thank you, and can say nothing more appreciative of your kind attention and the regard you have shown me, than to welcome you to this my native land, as an American. I have always heard much of their gallantry." "Young America" was embarrassed, but very courteously acknowledged the compliment. Gracefully bowing a retreat, he strolled to the outer platform and lighted his cigar.
                  In silence, all waited the summons of the bell for starting. Alas! another commotion. We gazed on a spectacle few will ever forget. Universal attention was fixed on a lady who was being conducted to the window of the public reception room by a noble-looking man. He coloured, hesitated, and excused himself for not advancing another step towards the old gentleman who was seated near that window. The hour arrived, years apparently having rolled away. Then the lady approached with earnest embarrassment. The officer shrank back from the responsibility of influencing a decision. The superbly beautiful woman dashed through the crowd and stood before the old man, almost kneeling to ask forgiveness. He evaded the request by rising, utterly confounded at seeing her. He led her at once to the adjoining room. Grasping his arm, they stood before us. Her fair hand rested on the shoulder of her father! The tapering fingers were glittering with diamond rings and an emerald ald solitaire. Her brow was pale and intellectual, her hair and eyes dark as the raven's wing, features of Grecian cast, and graceful without affectation. The urgent and earnest negotiation was concluded behind the curtain of an ante-room. The interval after the first act excited expressions in regard to the performance. At last they both appeared. The old man had suffered from her displeasure and the importunity of her imperious manner. He endeavoured to free himself by preporation for departure. Treating the obstacle with silence, he passed on with folded arms, and, irritated by delay, he crossed over to the outer platform, where our party were standing, for whom he manifested a decided interest. We were much annoyed to find our coupé tickets were for common carriages. In this dilemma we were stepping into the carriage, Mr. Oustan holding against the door, remonstrating with the conductor.
                  "Seulement un coupé aujourd'hui pour Monsieur le Grand Duc, monsieur."
                  At the very moment His Highness walked forward, with bearing calculated to command respect—travelling in the disguise of simple dignity, not surrounded with royal etiquette. His Highness was concerned at seeing much discussion about the coupé. Their tickets did not refer to the dingy carriages of the train. Observing the nobility and grace of Mr. Oustan, so fairly a copy of Prince Albert, as was often remarked abroad, he approached and discussed the imposition. At the same time he proposed a plan that he should be allowed to offer us the luxury of his travelling coach, and accompany him, as our route lay in the same direction. Fearing we might interrupt him on his journey, we questioned the propriety of accepting his invitation. He kindly urged his offer. The frank honour and flattering compliment, characteristic of royalty, not glittering, hollow show, marked his real worthiness to fill a high station—the real gentleman, ready to treat others as his equals under such circumstances—obliging us to submit to his excessive courtesy—we three "must accompany him to fill up an otherwise empty coach." The Grand Duke told Mr. Oustan "it must be so"—offering with royal courtesy the next seat, after he had seated himself, "à cette demoiselle-là, la jeune chose," waving his hand to Mrs. Oustan: "May this Spanish girl sit by me, sir?" Mr. Oustan smiled with a glance of pride at his lovely wife, and bowing his grateful thanks, accepted the honour, introducing the Spanish girl as his wife! "Est-ce possible! Non!" he ejaculated. Their friend, Miss Calthorpe, was also introduced. Mr. Oustan sat on one side of his wife, Miss Calthorpe by the window at the opposite side, and next to His Highness our heroine. The train was not punctual. The nobleman chafed at the delay so unusual. The magnificent beauty dashed madly on the stage-platform, and stood at the carriage-door, emblazoned with heraldry. Alas! what a picture; her lustrous eyes weeping, beseeching the recognition. There was much character, force, and truthfulness in her distracted, disappointed, woe-be-gone countenance, her eyes starting wildly, regardless of everything around—that beautiful woman, the disobedient child. It unstrung the key-note of Ymataca's heart. The ill-placed circumstances dethroned her self-control; yet she concealed her emotion. The shadow and substance became real; the image haunted her. That disobedient woman, then, retains the deep sorrow! The incident was perfectly afflicting. That awful punishment merged every feeling into comparison. That painful recollection, the failure of her first attempts, seemed only to excite a paroxysm of hope, and the erring creature acquired strength for the conflict; and the strange secret revealed a deepening contempt as the presence of the father brought back her recollections. The Frenchwoman approached him again and again. She tried to take his hand as she cried, "Spare me!" A smile vanished from her face as she turned towards him. Their eyes met. The Duke recoiled. Recovering himself as one who suffered without sympathy, cold drops stood upon the rigid brow. His lips wreathed as if from bodily torture. His eyes rested coldly desperate on her again—the father and the child. In a calmer state of mind he listened, and in deep attention, as the look of penitence and remorse unveiled to his sight. "The double curse she reaps." "Mon père," she sobbed, and burst into passionate tears. Straining her beautiful jewelled hand, and placing it on the door of his coach, she muttered her prayer. He shunned that parting kiss, as the graceful head pressed forward to imprint a proof of forgiveness. This discomposed, half-frantic woman, so interesting, so beautiful and unconscious, gathered the shawl of rare and costly quality around her shoulders. A sudden thought struck her fallen pride. Awakening from her frenzy, altered and subdued, her colour faded; a sad shade dimpled from her lips; she looked away. "Come! Viens!" she said, "Viens! follow." With noiseless step, pale and breathless, she drew him to the door, the erring son, husband, matured in years. As if his senses had deserted him, he moved not nor spoke. Once more fixing her dark eyes upon her father, they stood before each other face to face. She laid her hand on his arm, and burning tears fell upon her cheek. "I have been faithful to thee!" With hurried vehemence she sprang forward to the coach-door. Pointing to the husband, she prayed for pardon and blessings on the heart she had betrayed. Her form shook violently. In vain she cried, "Mon père! mon cher père! parlez un mot à lui, mon mari! Notre père, nous te prions!" There was exquisite feeling in her cries. He seemed a person of rank, not her equal perhaps. Time had lightly pressed its signet on his brow. Fiery youth had not been quenched; a will to do and dare he yet possessed; his limbs were cast in manly mould. He was dressed in a gay uniform. The formality of this engagement had no precedence—this stately air and martial pride; but the contest conquered him. Disobedient to her sovereign, she must yield submission to the consequences. Whatever had been done was necessary. Firm and undaunted, yet respectful, she appeared before the tribunal, evidently struggling with strong emotions, conscious of the solemnity of the occasion and the circumstance of the scene in the grand hall before the world. Her lofty eloquence gave animation to energy in the presence of her sovereign, whom she was accustomed to look upon as the greatest personage on earth. The torrent flowed from a reservoir which had been accumulating for many years. They had kept this proceeding a profound secret to this time, filling it up to prepare for the scene of trial. The French officer awoke displeasure by interposition. The old man was hardened to stone. That man had subverted the law of a sovereign—was convicted, guilty of depriving him of personal rights, and the most sacred government dissolved. Their course of conduct he could no longer arrest, and refused to sign their plea, or change his dissolution of them forever. Deep and strong as was the torrent of influence which surrounded him, the sovereign announced with firmness his decision, and the last seemed consecrated to youthful recollections. But the woman managed to take leave, and kissed the gray-haired man's hand as it lay lifeless and cold on the sill of the window. The husband and wife withdraw. She swooned as the officer's arm encircled her waist. In an instant the train dashed off and away, speeding through the towns and hamlets into level, green country.
                  Memories freshened by that trial. The old man gave way a moment to tears, which poured down his sad face. He breathed a sigh, and passed his hand over his majestic brow, seeming to recover gradually, as he wrapped his cloak around him and bent his head out of the coach window. By this time, seated in the splendour of royal comfort, ceremonies of court yielded readily to conversation natural to social rank. Formal etiquette was set aside, and soon they began to feel at home. His face was now calmer, but rigid paleness overspread every feature. He turned his attention to his Spanish favourite Ymataca. The mists rolled from his eyes with all the glory of his intellect and soft address, speaking in French as sufficient excuse for the mystery of that gloomy tale respecting the birth and marriage of Countess Carlotte Kelm Holstein Fredriche. The Duke looked on her pale face rather inquisitively, and said:
                  "Vous êtes Espagnole, n'est-ce pas?"
                  "Non, Monsieur le Duc."
                  "Vous l'êtes, je le sais."
                  "Je suis de l'Amérique."
                  "Je ne le crois pas! Vous êtes Espagnole, Anglaise, on Francaise."
                  He could not satisfy himself she was an American, so adherent were the mixed ingredients of her nature. Few even in America regarded her as any other than Spanish, Indian, and oftener English than American. Her cousin, the Consul to Caraccas, very truly called her a South American, save as to its native tongue. Her conversation amused him. Mingled with the dignity of simple style, she absorbed his moments. The wife of nineteen admired the imposing novelty of his brilliant majesty, so kind and affectionate toward her. Her simplicity had genius, yet scarcely developed. Conversing with the comparative stranger, she was a little more distrait than usual. The old man felt the gleam of her sweet face—a light, so young and cheerful, trustful—woman's patience. He recounted his difficulties and sorrows to her grave, listening ear. The association of freshness and hope stole over the half girl, half woman, as he connected her with a circumstance so painful. At the soft melancholy of her face he wondered, and the old man clung mournfully to the young creature. It seemed a soothing influence, transferring his heart, his sorrows to the youthful stranger. That image was accusing the page of the past. It rose before her eyes, now wrapt in irresistible thoughts. She recalled the sacrificing Ymataca, his companion in peace. The new and last blow shattered the old man's spirit; while it strengthened his honour and conscience, as sorrowing over the grave of a lost child, who had made barren his heart. 
                        
                           "Heard'st thou that?
                           What prodigy of horrors it disclosed,
                           *  *  *  Misery!
                           And must at last overwhelm me!"
                        
                     
                  
                  "Yes," he said, "we shall never part again; the barrier cannot be broken—dissolved." His countenance bore traces of emotion. His cheek was flushed, but he seemed to rally at the sight of a daughter beside him, and her husband, who seemed to have chosen her from the world. Fastidous as he was, he reposed without a doubt on the security of her faith. Mr. Oustan, watching every evidence of her generous nature, felt assured he had found at last a beautiful serenity of temper, cheerful yet never fitful. Basking in the sunshine of her youthful innocence, the old man confided to them, the trio, a life's care.
                  "It matters not," said he, after a pause, touching the chord of memory. "Will you listen to me, while I disclose the chain of accident you were suddenly made acquainted with, while I was unprepared for such an interview—the meeting between the Countess Carlotte and myself—the unfortunate child and her unhappy father?" while he spoke in a calmer frame of mind, his eye fixed on Ymataca. They listened with deep attention and veneration. He leaned heavily back in the richly cushioned chair. Long was it before his judgment could gain the victory over feeling. The lips of the great man moved as he began to relate the gloomy tale, and gazed with deep feeling on the beautiful face whose dark eyes were fixed on him with awe and mournful sweetness.
                  "That affliction," he said, "came upon me clear and scorching, like a blaze. I saw no escape. My reason forbids alleviation. You saw that beautiful woman kiss my hand: you saw the penalty, my contempt and scorn. Long since it had passed into silence, forgotten. Ah!" he sighed, "that wrung the tenderest chord of my soul. She married a person much beneath her in rank. 
                        
                           "'Dost thou feel
                           The solemn whispering influence of the scene
                           Oppressing thy young heart, that thou dost draw
                           More closely to my side?'
                        
                     
                  
                  "Elle est ma fille—ma belle fille. I am a changed man now. Years since she married an officer of the French army, who ranked high in Napoleon's command. I remember him very well—a handsome, thoughtful face, fine eyes, with luxuriant dark hair, and commanding figure—nothing more. His nature—bah! his name, mon gendre! Cet homme qui me cherche. Ils cherchent pourquoi? La tâche. Il est hardi comme un lion. Avant qu'elle était aimée—mais ma jolie papillon. She understood the gentleman—happy in a garret, bright visions flashed. Yes, just as the beautiful girl alighted from her chariot, I drew her aside under the stained-glass windows of her father's library, subdued by heaviness of stone-work, beside the, armorial bearings. The young enthusiast impatiently turned away. She understood the sentiment, and tried to make the old man deaf by entreaty. The devoted father shook his head gravely. They strolled through winding paths and flower-gardens overshadowed by giant trees of her castle-grounds. The proud estate lay stretched in boundless domains, and over the greensward her companion made himself at home. In spite of all efforts he entrenched himself. The beautiful countess had formidable admirers complicated in her web; but he did not care three straws for distinction. Statesmen, diplomatists, hereditary politicians, excited no admiration. The formality of court etiquette she thwarted, defeated them all—dangerous ambition in such a countess. A promised kingdom gained no victory—childish folly governed by a romantic enterprise! Heir apparent to the throne, she closed her eyes to the royal character of her life, greatness, and splendour. Her womanhood and youth were exposed to undignified conduct; noble bearing was stript of purity, and high character tarnished—circumstances which changed entirely her prospects in life. The eyes of the whole kingdom, England, and Europe rested on the future sovereign. Without pomp or ceremony the spoiled child assumed a new position. Titles and honours were dimmed by her exploits, the divine right crushed by a heavy blow. Carlotte took affairs into her own hands. The court etiquette, punctilious attention to royal marriage, and glittering ceremonies, were subdued to her extraordinary element of adventure. The prime minister admitted to her cabinet was a monster, of new-fangled policy, and gave only this love-intrigue as proof of his diplomatic ability. In solution of these mysteries, playing gallant, she treated with contempt experience and power. Court etiquette was blackened by his treachery. The vigour of his championship hurled down defiance upon courage and scorn—the gorgeous bribe, a gilded garret and a practised cheat. Ah! yes, he realized his splendid prize. No longer suited to the official fashion of peerage, they played their game, involving fatal indiscretion. He was incapable of comprehending his purpose. They signed the treaty, and he conducted her, in monastic privacy, from splendour and sumptuous, magnificent luxury ury. They travelled toward France, escaping all dangers, and arrived safely on the southern shores. All hopes of recovery passed, after communication of the event, an interview with the runaway could not be admitted, the laws of the realm excluded negotiations. They walked together from under the great canopy of state; under it again they never should return.
                  "I told her it would kill me. Rather than see her the wife of that man, I would willingly have buried her in the cold grave. She baffled my power. Now, an outcast, I shudder at the double curse fallen on Carlotte—mine no more! Her husband won fame; but it is only concentrated in a commanding figure and fascinating nonsense. My unfortunate child, my youngest, is a discarded idol. I did believe my command would be respected and obeyed. Her lonely father returns to her castle more sad and desolate than ever. By a circumstance unknown to me, they came to Cologne on hearing of my arrival. I have just passed a few days in the city, and am returning now to Düsseldorf. They were just in time for the trial, knowing we never would be reconciled. And there I left her, my own child, in her over-whelming repentance, cast away—a covenant broken. Cet homme, mon fils, I abhor. You saw me drive him off with insult: he dared not resent. Like a whipped brute he slid away with my lovely daughter."
                  The old man brushed away tears from his eyes, for his emotions could not be suppressed any longer.
                  "I turned from her, fearing weakness might master my reason, and make me relent, and recognize ma chère fille. His wife! Had he not approached, the coil of venom could not have been more fatal. He lost all—it is over. The parent's blessing they will never receive. I loved her idolatrously. I had but two and a son. My eldest daughter is now, and has been for years, the pet and royal beauty of St. Petersburg. She married the son of the Czar; he is now Emperor of Russia. She is caressed and loved by all—the universal object of attention—a beautiful, exemplary woman. I see her very seldom, as I live in perfect retirement—am fond of being alone."
                  Addressing himself especially to Ymataca, he said, "You, madame, señora, interest me. You are spirituelle. My melancholy confidence has saddened your face more. Your pensive cast is Spanish."
                  He turned to Mr. Oustan, and a sad smile lighted his face as he said, "I shall carry off the young thing; but I invite you and our mistress of German, Miss Calthorpe, all to come and visit my old castle. I will offer sumptuous entertainment and great enjoyment; I think I have such in my power. It is lovely and very retired where I live, among gigantic trees, far from the din of cities.
                  
                  Nothing gives me more delight than to entertain those I like. Completely won by your appearance, I should do my best. The deserted home is rich with luxuries: grooms and horses stand idle now; hot houses, with strawberries abundant; choicest fruit to reap; interior attractions vast; an elegant collection of fine arts and statues, and a grand royal library, where I spend much time. Weary hours glide by pleasantly under the casement."
                  Such lordly hospitality was more than gratefully acknowledged. The feelings of the good old man were softened; his proud spirit and lonely heart seemed to enter into active sociabilities of domestic peace. We expressed our gracious regret that the compliment could not be received and accepted; but affairs hurried us on our way. He desired we would indeed visit him shortly—certainly before we returned to England or America. Venerating as we all did the majesty of his own brilliant power, his condescending compliment was estimated by a true and full appreciation. It was a sympathy of hearts and minds rarely united on a railway among those who had met as strangers. The recollections of that journey are never to be effaced.
                  "If you will but stop at Düsseldorf, "continued the old man," carriages are there, and my attendants ready to convey my suite back to the haunts of seclusion. For often I induce stragglers to see me. My favourite! "he laughed," I will wed Miss Calthorpe to my large arm-chair, my library-throne, as mistress of all she surveys; but her Persian greyhound will often intrude, the friend of his master. You can refresh your minds with modern literature and the classics. From the bay-window you can look out on solitude; fine shadowy hedges; melancholy ghosts of joy springing from flower-beds, and stalking in statues down the avenues. Come and see the castle, and much you may learn from a stranger."
                  Travelling on, ancient towns and rustic villages were lost in the distance, so engrossed were our travellers in conversation. The deep and gloomy story excited more than the hills and vales of the flatland. The old man laid aside all marks of rank. In dress that few persons of such position would wear, the great man, the sovereign, was expressed in dignity, through his modest air and elegant manner. Yet, stopping at the different stations by the way, ceremonies of honour and respect for royalty were often displayed to his highness, the people en masse raising their hats and bowing in silence to "Your Highness" with reverence throughout the kingdom.
                  Time was rapidly winding up the wheels for separation, when conversation reached its zenith. Approaching a small town, a village church rose from the neighbourhood, and he gave sketches of different landscapes. Obtruding the vital subject again, he asked, "Is it to be settled? will you not raise my hopes that you will stop, and stay awhile with me at my castle, at my earnest request?"
                  No language can here express their feelings of indebted appreciation, sincerely, most graciously regretting even the wish of their hearts could not accept this chivalrous courtesy. They in turn offered and asked His Highness to receive their admiring and profound gratitude, consoled by the memory without measurement, locked up as a bright and elevating association which time should never dim. Topics changed to rural reference. He said, "Being fond of sports, I live much in the forest. So I'll train her—your wife—to the chase. Sir, Mr. Oustan, you can be keeper of the great seal."
                  "Your Highness, I am sensible of the highborn preference conferred in consideration of friendship. The prodigal congeniality of your atmosphere would contribute, were it possible, to the harmony of your refulgent honours. Profoundly I thank you, most gracious sir."
                  Mr. Oustan's conversational graces embellished his wit, which enabled him to mingle on equal terms with the most eminent. Resuming a thread of mournful recollection, in that mirror of solitude, the old gentleman remarked:
                  "My only son cheers a lonely hour at long intervals. His mother, my wife, the most beautiful and brilliant woman of our realm, died long years ago, et beaucoup aimé. Hélas! bien, mon
                     cher fils. He is in the army. His rank is very distinguished. He is unrivalled, and very handsome. Rarely he comes home now, but soon will obtain his furlough. My idol gone, life is a weary thing."
                  Mr. Oustan took a gold piece from his pocket, in value about five dollars, asking as he handed it to him, if it were his own likeness, or superscription. His Highness laughed as he held it in his fingers, looking earnestly on its face. "No, no; it is the true image of my old favourite and special friend, the king. It is as often, I am told, taken for my likeness as that of Louis Philippe." And he observed, "For years I was a social and constant visitor and guest at his court in Paris; but, since his downfall, I have avoided society—especially trained to such experience, and the stern lesson just disclosed."
                  Arriving at last, about six o'clock the train stopped before the cast-iron gate. In a few seconds, a splendid chariot and four swept by, reining up at a short distance from the entrance—his body-guard, in full attendance, with a retinue who accompanied his Highness in other carriages by the same train. They advanced with watchful care. After partings and regrets, the old man, expressing his good wishes for our journey—the solemn ceremonial of clouds and sunshine turned once more to bright memories—the great admirer said—
                  
                  "Mes compagnons du voyage, I shall always cherish recollections of you and your interest in my grief. Remember, I am always at home, and you can find me easily—mon château. May I hope you will come to see me on your return? I will heartily welcome you as guests; and you shall tell me of your travels when you have finished your tour. I am and have been subjected to orders, so that I have not travelled beyond a trite distance—to Paris often, to England never. Young, dark-eyed, Spanish girl, I must say that you"—laughing, and speaking to Ymataca—"you have seen more of the world than I. Mon anglais est très mauvais. Vous parlez français aussi bien que I'anglais, et mieux que moi. Je préfère I'allemand. Votre anglais est très parfait. Before you leave our dominions to return to your fair country, which I have longed to see, you must come to my castle and tell me good-by." Bending on his knee, he said to our heroine, "Ma petite fille! m'amie étrangère, God bless you. Adieu!" Lifting her hand, he pressed a kiss of friendship there; with emotion kissed again the ungloved hand of the Spanish girl, wife of nineteen. Other reflections arise, as adieux fell from his lips, sad and mournful. His moist eyes turned upon the daughter—"God bless you! "He raised himself from his bending attitude with Mr. Oustan's assistance, who felt proudly the high honour and flattering token of regard which he had conferred on his pretty little wife. The old gentleman was undisturbed by time, and had incorporated his feeling so effectually that he rendered his social system a mark to the citizens collected around the platform. His Highness was still kneeling. One foot rested on the coach-step, his knee bent at her feet, on the carpet of his heralded coupé, which must be allowed to remain on the train, with his distinguished acquaintance. Mr. Oustan jumped from the train to render his assistance as a complimentary return to so distinguished a man. He waved his hat: "Bon jour! Adieu, mesdames!" A footman at that moment, with a profusion of bows, approached to say a particular word to His Highness. The chariot in waiting drove up. The infirm old gentleman reached back towards the open door of her travelling coupé, and took the last look. His arrival was celebrated with great yet quiet rejoicings; and the chariot and four swept past the archway to Bois le Duc beyond Düsseldorf. In that eventful year the spell was dissolved forever. The lonely Duc and his beautiful idol, shattered—gone.
                  A few moments' rest, and our companions were rolling over the same road. With compliments and bows, they whirled over the ground to Hanover; passed a few days in this most quiet city, the birthplace of Herschel— 
                        "A course of days composing happy months."
                     
                  
                  
                  No sounds disturb the serene repose of the approaching evening, except the distant rumble issuing from le chemin de fer, like a current tradition, a hollow from the cave, winding its passage in the vicinity of an old square. Immediately after quitting the dinner-table, the two ladies returned to the drawing-room, and then made arrangements for departure by the evening train. Within a few minutes Mrs. Oustan returned, accompanied by Miss Calthorpe. The ladies presently stood, arm in arm, gazing through the open window in earnest admiration, dilating upon the fine prospect. The evening shadows were deep-cast by lofty trees around the old square, but scarce a form of life was visible. A subdued radiance of departing sunset stole over the landscape with tender, pensive air. Hanover looked desolate. The journey was continued through many interesting places, some more or less beautiful. Mr. Oustan had become an accomplished traveller. With calmness and energy he transacted all duties devolving upon him. He had completed all the business which required his attention, before quitting, at a late hour in the evening. The various accounts were in readiness, and when he withdrew from his investigations, he closed the door after him, and in about an hour after his important arrangements joined the ladies in the parlour. We had recovered in a tolerable degree from the sultriness of the day, and were enjoying the cool breeze of evening. He walked through the apartments, and seated himself by his wife and their friend, in the Hall of Zuyder Zee. Ymataca had esconced herself in a great arm-chair, listening to the encomiums pronounced by her husband on their customary care of things.
                  "It gives me pleasure, ladies, to see you so punctual in your arrangements."
                  Suddenly recollecting they had no time to lose, he plunged into excitement as a servant announced the carriage was at the door. They stepped quickly down the broad stone flight and reached the landing. Drawing aside her veil, Miss Calthorpe entered the airy voiture, followed soon after by Mrs. Oustan and her husband. The attendants were unusually civil. With his easy grace Mr. Oustan felt in his pockets for some loose change, and as usual gave an unnecessary sum. From his liberal nature money freely flowed. Bowing almost to the ground, the servant closed the door, communicating to the coachman, "Leherte Station." Off rumbled the carriage across to the railway. A few streets, a few turns, and they drove up to the huge building of the chemin de fer. Under the spacious gallery the vast crowd and tumult gathered, as usual on great routes. Hurriedly glancing at the luggage lying piled by our railway carriage, it was soon deposited overhead. In a moment we congratulated ourselves on safety and comfort. In la première classe, we piled up our shawls and extra articles gleaned for the journey. The Continental Guide-Book at hand, "Bradshaw," was very interesting. At nine o'clock the express train swept from under the arch. Bursting through stone hedges, it passed over an open country by moonlight. Bremen was our first destination, and peculiarly qualified for rest. Within three days we merged from heat and dust to renew our travel by steam-packet, in connection with the train. We embarked from the station, and had a pleasant trip from Stade down the Elbe. Our party of three succeeded in getting on the craft, a miserable and dirty boat. We finally gained, after a battle on quarter-deck, some camp-stools. An unusually large number of passengers crowded the deck, there being no other accommodations on board. We go away from foreign turmoil and Dutch dirt, with the smoke of meerschaums quietly floating away at the stern. After proceeding some distance a fresh breeze sprang up, which afforded but few studies of the picturesque. We arrived at Hamburg, the classic or architectural city of the Germans, distinguished for its antiquity. The gay metropolis commenced from the shallow Elbe. Through dusky, gloomy alleys stored with filth and dirt, we encountered houses tumbling apart, props of neighbourly poles rendering an uncomely assistance. Taking a carriage, we rattled over rock-pavement, rough and unclean, till we entered upon the elegant points of the quaint city. The beautiful Venice led out into broad avenues and pleasant plateaus, the beauties of Hamburg proper. Elegant buildings, venerable and picturesque, decked the broad streets and avenues, full of attractiveness to the antiquary and the artist. In the rear of the avenue, canals wound about the city, running at the base of baronial houses, and over the silvery water suspension arches were thrown. The general appearance of the main street is particularly elegant. Proud, lofty, and graceful architecture overlooks the broad aisle of nature, and the lofty spires of antiquated cathedrals rise in beautiful, solemn contrast. The most ancient and conspicuous is an object perfect in preservation and almost overgrown with ivy; but not an equal to the spire of Notre Dame. Its height is 403 feet; 616 steps lead to the summit at Antwerp. Day and night ninety and nine bells chime variations at short intervals—sweet, clear music mingling its rapturous tones in vesper air. How sublimely affecting those aspirations by night and day at Hotel St. Antoine! Lingering there, we recur to such, as we stand before the works of the master's hand, canvas and marble. "A genuine perception of beauty is the highest degree of education, the ultimate polish of man, the masterkey of the mind!"
                  It is again time to place before the reader due order and connection of incident. Our part selected the principal hotel, facing the Kursaal, a square basin leading into the canals. A fine boulevard enclosed the margin, and cafés with painted windows adorned the promenade. Under the trees a variety of gay flower-girls and fruit-women flitted hither and thither, in gaudy costumes. The entrance to the stately De I'Europe was in front of the rippling basin, our apartments distinguishable in this magnificent part of the city. Several hours of the day were spent by our travellers in quiet repose and preparation for table d'hôte. Half an hour before, Mr. Oustan and the ladies sat in our parlour, ready to mingle with the rest at the beat of the gong. At length it sounded, and we entered an insignificant room. Dinner was soon over. The next morning we rose fresh and equal to the task of sight-seeing; but Mr. Oustan was taken suddenly ill with a fever, that detained us longer than we wished to stay. Notwithstanding the kindness received, it was valued, but all acceptations denied—so anxious were we to mingle in the Berlin gayety, as, too, the new prima donna was to make her début at the King's Opera. Refusing all invitations, we rested from the social courtesies extended by the élite of that fine old city. Our invalid, Mr. Oustan, nursed by night and day with care, under her watchful attendance, and with skilful treatment, soon recovered. Well do I remember the expression of his handsome face and manly voice, as he reclined on a couch by the window, on the balcony, Miss Calthorpe and Mrs. Oustan bathing the temples of his aching head with "Jean Farina." At length he was sufficiently well to enable us to go on our way to Berlin; but another slight cause prevented. Towards evening, some days after, as twilight was deepening in the room, we were suddenly attracted to Mrs. Oustan, sitting in her fancied place by the balcony, overhanging the Kursaal. She seemed sad and languid—evidently avoided conversation. Hardly moving, but absorbed in this state of half consciousness, she slipped from her chair, her head falling back against the cushion. Mr. Oustan's first glimpse of the empty chair, and his wife's fainting figure, terrified the devoted husband. With hasty strides he darted quickly to her side. Slowly lifting her in his arms, he placed her slender form on a sofa. Brushing her heavy tresses from her deathly brow, he wiped an aromatic fragrance across her temples. She seemed to revive. Then he gave her a liquid which she swallowed, but sank back in another swoon. The livid features and form so lifeless seemed to baffle our restoratives. Yet once more he tried his best energies, which produced some effect. Suspended life became conscious; she rose and smiled, but had to be taken to her bedroom quite an invalid. Next morning she was much better; and after a few days strength came, and we were on our way to the sad, gloomy, and peculiar city of Berlin. The gay seat of royalty bears the signs of a violent tumult, having subsided into quiet by force, hushed almost to a dead silence. We reside at Hotel du Nord, No.35, Unter den Linden. We enjoyed hearing the king's new favourite singer, Mademoiselle Vagtner (Wagner). Her début was in Robert, toi que j'aime, and her success was immense.
                  The Oustans continued their route to Wittenberg, crossing the Erz-Gebirge to Prague. The scenery was grand and beautiful down the gorges, on the shores of the Elbe, and down the Moldau to the quaint city of the Pagans and Jews. At the foot of the Platz, not far from the Bridge Nepomuk, a hotel of most singular structure was erected. We attempted to scale the heights of Hradschin, where pagan fire-worshippers offered their heathen rites. The grand antiquity of bridges was erected by Charles IV., and built of stone—very superannuated in appearance, and stretching over the Moldau, 1,572 feet long. Another circumstance worthy great note, was the Minster and the room of Marie Thérèse.
                  Leaving behind us Prague, and its Jewish den, which in horror we fled from, we sought for grand charms at Dresden, most comfortably German. We found the first hotel, and not a great distance from the Royal Picture Gallery of Dresden notoriety. The very first day we were invited to join a party, especially to visit the Green Vaults. The grand old mansion bears a castellated form—a sumptuous monument to crown jewels, nature's precious gems—a dowry of Austrian and Prussian ornaments. These most beautiful and interesting relics are preserved from time immemorial in the vast walls of the Castle of Dresden. The monumental stones are garrisoned. The large chambers appear excavated. Standing in the vaulted caverns, damp and chill, with its feudal aspect, to the right a fine prospect is before the eye; and again the winding passages lead to the different assortments. Enclosed in a gemmed apartment is a specimen of statuary, sculptured from a fragment of bronze, the rarest ever found. It is cut with massive strength—a gladiator, finished by hand—an effort of the boldest and finest art yet represented. So much is its value, in solemn earnest it is approached by all; and, too, the history of its value is enhanced to enormity, as the beautiful inspiration of its master's touch has covered the eyes of its sculptor with eternal darkness—so tedious, so tremendous the bold effort, which cost years of untold labour to produce. This form of perfection is about twelve inches high. The artist has now become the child of night.
                  Again, in the dimensions set aside for works of solid art, a singular relic has been obtained—a mandarin's palace, in the most transparent ivory, resembling exactly the finest Honiton lace. The magnitude and superlative greatness of their Chinese court was exquisitely beautiful; the exterior, every acre of land, fitted out with its most magnificent proportions in spacious gardens and flowers of ivory scenting the ivory pots. The period of its formation is involved in great obscurity, so long has it been immured within the vaults of royal Austria and Prussia. Innumerable other objects of astonishing interest were presented to our view. Ymataca was stimulated to marvel over these wonders. She ranged her fabric of reminiscences, all standing proudly aloft in testimony of her knowledge of the imperial crown-pieces of royal Austria and the Green Vaults of Dresden. The pearl of night is there seen, the largest particle ever gained—the stones of every hue, name, and quality—as first known in nature, then as it passes through the process of invention, then gradually into some gorgeous crown-piece and birthday gift among the imperial heads of the crown. The diadem, the coronation crown, worn by every known sovereign connected with the imperial domains, is there. There every preëminent gift of royal family is deposited.
                  Our travellers passed from Dresden to Austerlitz, thence to the south in Vienna, where we quickly took possession of rooms at Hotel Archduke Charles—extremely commodious, but full. For an hour or more we waited, but at last in the fine vestige of an old castle we are settled, among the elements of the Austrian Empire. We select each day a novelty, awakening each time a significant characteristic of feudal times, and formed our possessions into prominent figures, commencing with the strength and importance of St. Stephen's, built in 1114. The largest clock ever cast was its own mighty timepiece; moulded from 180 Turkish cannon, it weighs 357 hundred-weight. Beneath its hoary walls, impressive with greatness, Ymataca saddened under its influence, so majestic when a divine key-note of music pealed from the celestial pipes of its famed organ aloft, on which Haydn touched the first tone to reverberate his fame over the wide, wide world. Under the colossal eaves of its entrance lodge, she purchased a fine engraving of the blackened wonders of its taper spire, sharpening its very workmanship into the frothy blue of the heavens. That token of St. Stephen's is most carefully preserved as a choice relique of the past. The Oustans saunter out with a valet into a remote part of Vienna to the pillared chapel of St. Augustin, examining the royal vaults of death. In the death-chapel of Leopold II., the heart of Marie Thérèse is embalmed—the largest of the whole royal family in keeping. The young Duke of Reichstadt is on the same shelf near by. Most singular the view, through a kind of port, into the grimmest of dungeon darkness, unbroken save from a still remote cell-window, which gives light upon the shelf on which these immense yet small-sized sized urns of solid silver are arranged. Turning in mute sickening from the haunts of the dead, we are solemnly called to reflect on the most magnificent of monuments—Canova's masterpiece, the tomb of the Duchess Christina of Saxe-Teschen. The noble structure is situated on the east side of the Grecian-modelled church. The tomb is gabled on the wall, high; and is about a man's height from the pedestal of the columns. Its representations are the highest degree of superlative idealism, portraying the ages of life, Infancy to Maturity, to fresh Womanhood; again, Childhood, held by the hand of Old Age, creeping towards the tomb. The marble is carved into life-size; a wreath of heavy marble flowers are touched by each hand; finally, Womanhood bears a vase of splendour. The little Child, who seems a part of Old Age, holds the torch lighting up the tomb. Over the pall of white marble, thrown lightly over the throne-steps, you can almost see the tread give way to the soft texture of the marble, and hear the noiseless footfall as the group approach the tomb. Such holiness, such exalted power, sure were never more idealized by inspiration. Before the right side of the gabled tomb is a lion couchant. The Genii are sprung upon his maned back; the roar is hushed, but life seems to live beneath the hide, and shake up the shaggy mane of the extraordinary sculpture. Ymataca obtained a fine engraving of it. From such holy relies they learned choicest idealisms. Pleasures and delights were fully realized in the capital of the empire of Austria.
                  The long-lost stragglers—here they are! Hosts of Americans meet at Vienna. All things incline to their advantage, and they leave Vienna for Linz. On through the watery waves of Danube they ascend. An incident occurred under the high walls of the Benedictine Convent, the largest building in Austria—a massive stronghold perched high on the stupendous cliff. From the grated windows, in slave-like bondage worse than African fetters, many monks stared out, down from the iron gratings looked at the steam-packet. Below their precipitous height, gay peasants, stepping off and on with their produce and striking costumes, added rare loveliness to the scene. We passengers wondered with amazement at those walls, white as milk—the interior all dark as night. From the mere ports which admitted the light of day, we thought of the little that might penetrate upon its inmates, ninety monks, and its thousand rooms, or accommodation for a thousand souls. We looked, and then turned away to brighter hopes and scenes, passant.
                  
                  Ymataca was alone, seated in the stern, on the bench; Miss Calthorpe had not ascended to the upper deck. A gentleman in undress uniform was promenading with Mr. Oustan. He approached madame, with her husband, and sought the acquaintance of the party by introduction. Mrs. Oustan felt no interest in the fine-looking stranger; he caught her eye only as "birds of a feather will flock together." He was a distinguished traveller, an officer of the Austrian army, on his way from Norway and Sweden, where he had been rambling on furlough. The follower of the double-faced banner remarked Mrs. Oustan, and spoke his sentiments to Miss Calthorpe.
                  "I was so interested in this young lady, I asked your friend, Mr. Oustan, to introduce me to the pretty creature. He seemed very much amused at my earnest gaze and anxiety to know the lady. 'She is my wife, and I will make you acquainted with her,' was his reply. I was amazed. I find her so young to be married. Our young ladies are yet in school years after her age."
                  Miss Calthorpe laughed, saying, "She does look young. In England, young ladies are not permitted to marry till they are advanced in years."
                  "Do all American ladies marry so young, madame?" he asked.
                  Ymataca was amused; for she felt old, having been a wife now nearly two years.
                  "I was attracted by her pensive cast, so purely Spanish—yet so feeble she looks! I fear you are an invalid," to Mrs. Oustan. "Does not ill health cause you to travel? for, if you will pardon, I see you take so little interest in this grand and classic scenery—not such an enthusiast as your friend and myself."
                  A sadder mood Mrs. Oustan had not indulged in for some time; the chord, the undress uniform, painted a resemblance, which was a sickening recollection, so much so that she walked away as Miss Calthorpe recalled her strength to action, alarmed at such an outburst from the font of feeling before the stranger. She was exceedingly annoyed. Could she—did those strangers know her history? did they read the secret—the new wife and old love? The Major-General of the Austrian army watched her, and said—
                  "You are feeble. I have unintentionally unnerved your delicate health. Pardonnez, je vous prie!" She smiled a sickly smile. "Indeed, you looked so pale just now, that we were alarmed. Madame, let me tell you of these grand scenes above and around us, so interesting, imposing, and inspiring."
                  The last rays of the setting sun were shining in luminous reflections on the river. We curved the bend, and pointed bows to welcome Milch Castle. Its fine ruins of a fortress made a beautiful and lofty picture. Near by the shelving hill side, a crumbling prison wall is all alone in its glory of tradition, keeping yet the spell of the melodious guitar which echoed hard by to charm the crusader Richard Cœur de Lion. Thus another lesson, another past rung over her roving spirit another spell woven by the stars of her nativity. From that iron gate, back rushed the past on the sad-faced woman, like a dark, primal gloom—spreading its pall wherever she roamed. She began her lesson of sorrow young. The memory of another freshened as the officer stood before her. On Danube's foreign surface she dropped a silent tear for him she loved best.
                  "Madame," said the stranger, "permit me to allude to our meeting under the convent walls. It will in future enhance my recollections of the tourist, bringing to mind sympathy of our mortal life. A fellow-pilgrim, a stranger, relishes the appropriate elevation of thought which blends with the picture of life and scenery. Your sad face will tell me the tale, casting its shadows 'neath the mountain's brow. I shall regret to prefix to my valuable reflections of yon setting sun, the thousand hues of the Danube, the undermining touch of the consumptive, or invalid. However, the auxiliary creation of the beautiful portrait of the American wife will heighten the deeper feeling of the picturesque incident. J'espère que vous vous portez mieux, madame?" The officer seemed so concerned, it amused her ladyship. She smiled: "Merci, monsieur, je suis un peu fatiguée, et je ne me porte pas très bien."
                  The boat passed on slowly down for a long time; then toiling to the circuitous bends in the river, the earthly beams were quenched for aye. The little packet steered to the shore. The officer regretted their companionship was shortened so soon. Mr. Oustan, Ymataca, and Miss Calthorpe stood at the wheel to say "bon soir." Again the vessel yielded to the force of its steam-power, which bore it from the margin on, with the tide in favour. The officer followed its course with his eye. It was late. The stranger's footstep stole on the silence of that evening air, as he stretched on to the summit of a precipice. The military connection awakened a slumbering idol in her heart no dews could blighten. Bitter tears the poor girl shed that night, roving on a foreign strand, by nought sustained but dreams of Granville. She trembled in those reveries; for what could make a new wife sad, but the old love? Ah! how often her kind husband chid gently, and urged her on to brighter days, as startling melancholy would arrest his knowledge of facts. Thank heaven! a higher power sustained her right from wrong. But should she, as once in Paris——It threatened to lay its icy touch of alienation on the thread—"until death us do part." Then she would have been the woman to sink, like a fallen angel, lower than hell. Yet a struggle saved her abroad, an effort at home. The lesson was studied as difficult. Logical precision, highly finished combination of powers, mastered its problem—to have faith in God—completely assuming her ascendant weights to Truth and Justice.
                  
                  The next evening our travellers were resting in a very beautiful part of Austria, between tower-like hills shelving downward to the beach. Reposing in large, well-furnished apartments of the hotel, they looked from above on the waves of the Danube's swelling tide. A light gleamed on the water from the mainmast of the packet as she lay moored to the wharf or embankment rich with grass and flowers along the shore. Ropes and sails, too, were strewn around, an indication of ship building, to gratify the first sight at Linz. From the terrace cliff the Oustans left their hotel, and strolled athwart the opposite steeps. This feat of exercise was a triumph for Ymataca. On that lovely summer morning Mrs. Oustan was seated on a low wooden bench in garrison walls, in front of the great gates of the fortress, remarkable for its peculiarity, having been built after a new plan, by Prince Maximilian of Este. Over the adjoining plain is Mathias Kirche, with the tomb of Montecuculi—1681. Entering the shade that spread over the extensive ramparts, Ymataca was concealed by sweeping branches of the luxuriant trees. Towers gray and hoary rose above the drapery of ivy; yet feeling lurked in every object of the scene. A restless, torturing remembrance seemed to have taken possession of her delicate frame. The constant control she exercised, for fear she should increase her unnatural position or add disobedience to an altar-vow, by ingratitude for his indulgent love; the pain of endurance, combined with extreme delicacy of constitution, had so weakened her as to render the slightest exertion an effort. She bent forward to embrace the loveliness of the plain. The splendour of the sun illumined objects, heightened by the valley and the breakers of the Danube below. Her senses seemed to have left her. Her eyes were riveted on the army band which gave enchantment to the scene. Her countenance was profoundly melancholy, as she listened to the clarion notes reëchoing over the steeps, whose wild forms were reflected in the deep clear waters below. Long and anxiously had Mr. Oustan searched into the object of these changes, using all his energy to concentrate her naturally enthusiastic feelings, once so inspiriting to him. In all that eloquent novelty Ymataca looked intently and silently out from the rustic lodge. Miss Calthorpe, with Mr. Oustan, sauntered off a few steps toward the band, then playing under the awning. His wife thought to hide a tear that trembled in her eye. He left Miss Calthorpe alone to enjoy the many-flowered hedges and grassy banks, when his watchful eye remarked the additional gloom on the loved features of his wife. Mr. Oustan noticed her excessive paleness, engrossed with deep emotion while she gazed on the flowers smiling at her feet. James Oustan in terror flung himself on his knees, imploring her not to look so pale and exhausted. "I am sure you want fresh air; come, dearest! let us proceed to complete these fresh beauties." His eyes sparkled; his cheeks glowed as if all sad retrospect had died away. His voice, yet more than the proffered remedies, probably, recalled her to responsible duties, for which her high character well fitted her.
                  The Oustans step over a stile, after leaving the fortress, and find an expressive picture in the old churchyard, with its picturesque spire and crumbling brick walls, resembling the oldest church in England, at Berwick on the Tweed. Upon the crest of the hill at Linz's relique, flowers were planted by loving hands over many grass-green graves, marked by head-stones old and worn. The tourists directed their coachman to drive over the fairest road returning to Linz, the capital of Upper Austria. Our party set off next morning for Uttendorf, in an open carriage. The rapid tread of their horses' hoofs speedily whirled them along the grand highway, over the steeps of Danube's glittering waves. We pushed on to Inn river, a branch of the Danube; without grandeur, but beautiful and broad. We reached Uttendorf that night with great ease in our fine carriage. From the dark simplicity of its Inn, the Oustans take staging to Hohenlinden, being desirous of visiting all scenes celebrated in history as battle-fields. Winding with a short turn, we pursue the road to Munich, the original feature of which was a grand Hotel Royal. We extracted rich selections for the days and nights at Munich. "All silent as in ages past," we are within the Jesuit church, visiting the tomb of Prince Eugène Beauharnais, by Thorwaldsen—"led by the mighty genius of the place." Attuning our steps, we are beneath the Basilica of Holy Boniface in the Carlstrasse—I remember perfectly the most beautiful in Byzantine, without exception. The frescoes which adorn the interior surpass, both as to beauty of design and richness of colour, all other works of living artist. At the Pinakothek, or painting gallery, one of the most beautiful buildings in Europe, we spent some time; and finished that series of dazzling sights by a visit to the Glyptothek, a sculpture gallery, full of vigorous, florid conceptions. For days and days, they unfolded volumes entitled, most justly, the classics. Another reputation was added to their favoured essays by consulting the sumptuous entertainment of the Royal Library. The rooms were large enough to hold two millions of volumes—the Odeon, famous for its musical soirées, but, above all the notes of operatic or martial music, Ymataca could enjoy none more than Le Kockbrunnen at Wiesbaden, echoing over to the Taunus mountains. But the poetical conception of analyzing genius was only realized at Munich—in music, in glorious thought, in marvellous statues, in her antiquarian and modern fancies, in that renowned city. As a last delight, they visited the temple to Fame, then not quite finished, but grandeur personified. Turning from these exquisite compositions, the Oustans leave Munich for Augsburg, the oldest city of Europe, adding antiquity to antiquity. We stop at Drei Mohren (Three Moors), of which mention was made in the year 1364; according to authority, one of the oldest in the world. Also they visit the Alfra church, with its many monuments of Fugger, so called from the inn of the Drei Mohren. An object Ymataca delighted in was the Maximilian street, with its bronze fountains, by Adrian de Keis, 1599; and, too, the town hall, where she climbed to its uppermost opening, and visited the room in which Charles V. resided when the Augsburg Confession was presented to him, 1635. From the dark crumbling walls festoons and draperies were mouldering away, just as they were hung in honour to the occasion. After an almost endless series of sight-seeing at that quaintest of models, they withdrew to Ulm, by staging, enjoying the tussle of travellers. Ymataca's unselfish nature, so open to conviction and to all good impressions, with sweetness of temper, gave way to another caste, which seemed to have spiritualized instead of betraying confidence. Days glided by in such varied and delightful employment that domestic happiness, so long threatened, appeared again. They took apartments ments at Hotel Ducale, a house all first-class travellers will remember, with its dark, dingy portals. At midnight Ymataca and her party came out on their balcony, in robes de nuit and ample shawling, to listen to an honouring serenade on their arrival. The finest band of Bavaria poured out enchanting strains. Nothing could more completely unstring the soul's emotions than that full-toned orchestra, as it came marching down the immensely broad vista into the widest of avenues, playing in full force a quickstep as they passed Ymataca's balcony. It was indeed a token of the antiquarian elements of that place. Passing by its overshadowing roofs and multifarious chimneys successively, they reach Stuttgart, on the beauty-renowned Neckar. The aspect of the surrounding region was a rich, level country embosomed amidst "old contemporary trees." The venerable first glimpse is full of inviting allusions to the pretty city and capital of Wirtemberg. Through its infatuating streets and characteristics, we are ensconced at Hotel Grand Royal. Undisturbed tranquillity is the order of the day. They next breathe the congenial joy of Baden at Carlsruhe. In the shades of silence, balmy from its banks of flowers, we pass some time disciplining our abilities at Carlsruhe—relax the vigour of our pursuit of the fine arts by the degree of knowledge carried to romantic excess, traditioned in the Black Forest; and examine its histories to Baden. Favourable circumstances accompany our progress to France from Keil on the Rhine. Our final exit from Austria into France was at Strasbourg. They procured delightful rooms at the Hotel de la Fleur. The acutely learned dissertation on the classics and feudals refined again the Oustans' notions, and inspired extravagance. As leader of the chivalrous city of Strasbourg, they pursued their examination of great things by a laborious attention to the Minster, with its spire 474 feet above the pavement, 112 feet higher than St. Paul's, and 24 feet higher than the great Pyramid; terminating in spiral lace-work built of hewn stone, cut with such precision as to rival the master's art. They had no time for other mentionables, but hasten to reach Paris. Crossing the Vosges mountains, they visit Nancy, Chalons, Rheims. Again they congregate among the ton of le beau monde; where, truly, teachings might have lessened the after effects of her beautiful fruition of labours. Here, too, our model of excellence was made a target of reproach. To seem or to be, that's our question. Ah! she was irritated at sustaining the desperate struggle, which made her often incapable of acting with vigour or judgment. Inexperienced as she was, and regardless of the world, Ymataca's steady application of truth and honour always elicited her individuality, and confirmed her ideas of self-government, while it enabled her to signify the nothingness of earthly honours. From her introduction into society, at eighteen, she had been initiated into all the mysteries of an ultra-fashionable life, and she very speedily levelled against its coteries her superior sanctity of holy feelings and spiritual principles, which were to become part of her very being. With a calm dignity, and uncompromising independence, she declared neither claim nor heirship to the prevailing topics of scandal, frivolity, and esprit, diversified with superficial opinion of politics of the day. Ymataca was extremely fond of social companionship, literally termed society. She had learned to love music from infancy; as wife, passionately. She was fond of dancing; yet never once could her husband induce her to join the waltz or fashionable dances. Her own exalted idea beautifully blended with a conscientious spirit. He never urged or invited to its temptation. Such unrivalled trust in his wife was refined by its association with her name. No whirl of such independence was ever spun out from her theory into the arms of any man. The coquette, the married belle (as they termed her), invariably selected shelter under the soundness of principle and simplicity of nature. Grace, wit, talents, and refinement she readily penetrated, as congenial to her higher feelings; but she renounced the dazzling, blinding effect of its glittering tinsel, false-hood, and vanity. Her cheerful, lively manner in general society scarce told how deeply she felt and pondered upon the serious, solemn subject which formed the labour of her life. But a serious observer, and some we remember, detected the hold that the sacred, holy principle ever exercised over her lightest act and gayest hour. Separating the ideal from the real, she was proof against the all-dangerous haunts of extravagance. She went in and passed by, but never allowed a wish to be gratified without exact need, and then referred its weight to the generous husband. Not a caprice was indulged nor a jewel taken in the mania-exploring marts. Her husband's taste in jewelry fancied small show of costly gems. Only the choicest selections were her delight to get.
                  Months had passed in an uninterrupted stream of enjoyment. By mutual consent, our trio had now made every preparation to return. They were to separate at Paris, Miss Calthorpe to sojourn on the Continent, first returning to visit her mother, who was now living with her German husband in Poland. No words could express how intensely they felt at parting. The supremely fashionable woman left the giddy vortex of Parisian life, but not a regret was felt over the heavily loaded trunks and French boxes, with costly dresses, and pretty things, so indispensable to a lady's taste. It was a glorious morning, the last of November, when the Oustans bade farewell to Paris. A few days more they loiter at Boulogne-sur-la-Mer, commemorating their interest by enjoyable privileges leges in this exceedingly ancient port of France—expanding their notes, to chisel down a rest near the Baths and the Tintelleries. They grew acquainted with Les Promenades des Petites Arbres and the Jetty. Time, the inexorable, bade the Oustans leave the shores of France. Two hours accomplished the voyage across the Straits to Folk-stone. Our travellers took up their abode for a short rest at the Pavilion. Transported with the bold bluff, they stroll up its chalky height, and sniff the free, bracing air most widely tossing on the sea. Performing their trip to London through Tunbridge, they found a pleasant recollection, and journeyed on to the great city of the world. At Johnson's, Cavendish Square, once again the Oustans are settled among the gayeties and fascinations of the spacious wing of London.
                  One fine cool morning, before the small and early blaze of autumn sat a lovely woman, extremely low in health. She was verging with a calm heavenly hope towards a stranger's grave. The soft, beautifully formed black eye looked too large for her pale, consumptive face. From exhaustion she had fallen almost asleep in the great arm-chair rolled close in the corner of the elegant room. Devoted attendance and carefulness idolized every moment of watchfulness of the widowed mother and sister, clinging to trust, with earnest tenderness soothing the last days on earth of the beautiful invalid.
                  
                  Her weakness had increased so rapidly that Lettie Unden had to be moved about in the arms of an able-bodied nurse. Here, too, for a new change, she had been placed in her walled couch for a sunny variety. In painful contrast to her lovely sister, the fashionable Cally, of New York, the soft-eyed, brilliant blonde was indeed beautiful. These New York heiresses were among others of celebrity at Cavendish Square when the Oustans arrived. Ymataca had been requested by the consumptive to sing her a morning song, on the occasion of finding the lovely olive-cheeked beauty there in a large easy-chair of the elegant drawing-room. All others had been politely excluded when Mrs. Oustan entered. She was invited to remain, and tell of other days. They had met before—she and Cally, with her sparkling black-eyed cousin, young Lornden, the star of notoriety in those days of Ymataca's school-term at the Professor's. Quietly Lettie had thrown herself into the luxurious chair, in the best position for listening and enjoying the piano. After some hesitation Ymataca sat down to her most loved instrument. She was naturally gifted with a splendid voice, and her husband ever indulged, by costly encouragement, her love and passion for melody. At first Mrs. Oustan's beautiful soprano trembled audibly, but her tones were so well modulated as to permit the favourite invalid to hear in the long, large room. Firmer and more earnest she continued, till she forgot everything but the song and its subject. A past favourite, with more than usual feeling, heart-appealing, as our reader may imagine, she made an effort to control an unspoken sorrow, while with a colourless cheek she sang— 
                        "Say not this heart can alter,"—
                      the very last note the essence of all, concluding the strain with peculiar feeling and great power.
                  They were interrupted by the appearance of the royal surgeon. In the sunshine of his immortal light stood Sir ——, comprehending at once their individuality of character. Courteously, with noble bearing, he addressed his lovely patient. She gladly welcomed the kind, distinguished friend, most faithful in his rich professional services. As Mrs. Oustan rose to leave the room, he requested Miss Unden to introduce her to him. Her pale, slender finger was raised to beckon the singer towards her. Cally rose and presented Mrs. Oustan to Sir ——, Her Majesty's physician. That morning he hoped his patient was convalescent. The warm blood mantled her olive cheek with a more life-like tint. 
                        
                           "There is the leaf reserved for me,
                           From those sweet memorials free:
                           And there her simple song might tell
                           The feeling thou might'st guess too well.
                           I would thus within my mind
                           One little vacant corner find,
                           To write his name and hers forever there!"
                        
                     
                  
                  
                  So good, so utterly unassuming this great man, that he at once interested our young traveller. He bore the impress of a person of court rank, with soft English features, smooth, fine dark hair. He was extremely pleasing. With partial earnestness he still observed the American lady. Colour rushed into her face as he delightfully drew her into conversation, exclaiming with surprise at such music:
                  "I am quite curious to know what that beautiful song was; I beg to ask its repetition."
                  "How can I thank you, kind sir. It was sung by me, it is true, but I am very sure unworthy of your most flattering honour as listener."
                  "I am also glad," rejoined the courtly old gentleman, "that you permitted me the indulgence of my desire to form your acquaintance; as music is a passport anywhere to the harmony of souls. Such was the effect of your like knowledge of its heavenly power, I do wish you would sing it over."
                  "If I might be sure you would bear it with fortitude," she said, laughing. He replied, "It shall, madam, sink deeper into my soul in memory of a secret rapture." (It was for him she prayed.) There was something awe-inspiring in the spirit that possessed her. It was truly a beautiful, mysterious expression. He added, with calm enthusiam, "I felt an interest in the strange being who arrested my attention, with something worthy of life—'I pray for thee.' It made me think of angels' music. I waited for the voice to cease, and satisfy myself, by emerging into the spirit-presence of Miss Lettie, to find, like the voice of angels, sweet recollections of another American lady."
                  At breakfast time, or rather early in the morning, when he had finished the papers, both London and American, Mr. Oustan joined his wife in the usual circle. He apologized for his intrusion, noticing the stranger, and the shadowy form, in painful contrast, who had chosen the weary pillow of ease. Finding, however, that his softening tread was not necessary, Miss Cally insisted he should come in and make the bird sing. The royal surgeon told Mr. Oustan how gratified he had been a few moments before, stealing the tones of the lady whose notes had thrilled him through.
                  "Why, sir, I was really about to run off with the young creature, when my pretty friend and patient told me she was the wife of an American gentleman! Now I congratulate you on the prize. Having been altogether satisfied, I wish for its valued repetition, and have taken the liberty to ask your wife to repeat the beautiful song."
                  "She decline?" I am sorry. Having such reverence and admiration for you, Sir Surgeon, I desire to retain the exalted compliment and approval you bestow so generously on my wife. Mrs. Oustan— I regret to feel it is impossible to urge her; for her feeble health will not admit of her doing justice to your desire." Bowing adieu, they left the royal surgeon with his patient. This converse, brief as it was, they never ceased to retain in their memories.
                  Leaving all the glories of great London, we next record the names of Mr. and Mrs. Oustan at Liverpool, participating in the profusely superb farewell parties and dinners of the charming élite of murky Liverpool; residing in the same apartments, looking two ways down Raneleagh Place to Lord street, athwart the fine avenue to Town Hall Square. Grand preparations were making to receive the first crowned heads that ever visited Liverpool. Cards of invitation were presented by a limited number of the élite circle and from a nobleman's family. The Oustans were honoured to receive special admission to Prince's Dock, to appear in full dress at the court end on Her Majesty's arrival. Their Royal Highnesses were to approach from the Mersey. Gorgeous wealth decorated every avenue in and out of the city, almost within twelve miles of the palace, where the royal guests intended to pass the night and some days, thence to visit Manchester. Returning to our privileged part, we saw the greatest display ever witnessed in that old city, inscribed in letters of brilliant jets, initialed V. R. A. R. All night previous Her Majesty's body-guard, mounted on magnificent steeds, kept watch immediately under the five broad windows of Ymataca's apartment. By a very singular coincidence it happened they selected the right corner, supposing so much space covered guard to the crown apartments.
                  Next morning, at dawn, Ymataca saw the body-guard had moved on, and down came the heaviest torrents ever known to fall in that city of the North. It was remarkable, not to say unparalleled; as Her Majesty's good fortune as to weather is almost proverbial—"It never rains, or reigns on our Queen!" The wind was unusually high, the day dark and rainy; but bright were the anticipations of home—America! They cleared their way through a driving storm along the coast of Wales and the Irish shore to the immortal eternity of Ocean. The Oustans had sailed again on the stanch steamship Pacific.
                  The rapid succession of enjoyment now ceased its foreign aspect, as our voyagers became inmates of their front room at the Hotel du Nord. In the latter part of December they were at home. Their late visit in London had increased Mrs. Oustan's anxiety as to the already delicate health of her husband, which, in connection with her own ill health, carried them back some months earlier than they had originally intended. Several weeks before this, their medical attendant thought that the voyage might restore to health the visible illness ness of Mr. Oustan. He found everything happy and flourishing on his return, and so resumed his usual engagements. Hope gradually improved his undermined constitution. The kind, watchful wife animated his progress to rally, so that pain and exhaustion were unfelt. Swiftly, gladly, intently, she showed the secret spring of her proud and remarkable nature, which carried more weight than all the rest. Resolution sufficiently sincere redeemed them refreshingly—so excessive had been her throbbing pain, with the unforgotten agony subsided into lethargic stupor, alternating with quiet submission and gentle words. In compliance with her now greater responsibility, a second trial, it depended entirely upon herself to become truly worthy of noble service, which her strong mind and good heart urged to right justice. Thus she devoted herself successfully, with gentle sympathy and tender feelings, towards his conviction of her first assailed danger, without one word unduly introduced on the painful subject. James Oustan evidently looked to her society as comfort and hope. Her eloquent conduct encouraged and astonished the greater effect of tender nursing; for, young and lovely as she was, she could not imagine what she had done to deserve such commendation, however miserable she might be. Perceiving this fervour of delight from one older and wiser than herself, she introduced in general her unassuming but heart-breathing ing piety. It intuitively encouraged her to go on firmly and proudly. Judiciously she enforced her laws to satisfy her doting husband's command. A naturally submissive character, combined now with physical weakness, caused her to obey, and not attempt to think any more; at least, forcibly to suppress all that she was enduring, which had been written on every line of her expressive face; when in deep repose it showed still clearer traces of care and anxiety. The fatal concealment! but for him, and her trying to rise from the painfully engrossing thought, its banishment depended on dissolving the mountain of lead. The system of self-sacrifice alone can solve its mystery.
                  Their happiness became apparently secure from that day. Mr. Oustan's sufferings recalled its remembrance, by extreme exhaustion caused on board the Pacific, induced by a heavy sea rolling over the ship, which threw him a great distance, leaving its mark on a hand broken, but not disfigured. Three bones were snapped across his left hand; from it he suffered much. On land, his strength and the usual spirits of his excessive fascinations returned. All hoped improvement was indeed effectual. Torturing were Mrs. Oustan's feelings, when she recalled the request to acquiesce in the proffered emphatic invitation to become an inmate of her mother's home at the South. Madame Marlborough had fears: she confided many excellent principles, full of good intentions to her son-in-law. James Oustan yielded to the mother's influence, with the bond of mutual sympathy, to endeavour to lessen his wife's sorrows; one of his dearest pleasures associated with her sisters and family—no small happiness for both, he imagined; unfortunately, only increasing the discomfort of good intentions. And suddenly Mr. Oustan resolved to return to the home influence. Ah! what change will remove the torture of neglect in home influence? And Ymataca, friend reader, did not pursue this conduct without pain. Never could she visit Richmond without bitter regret tortured by grief. Recollection haunted her hours of preparation to return there. It was indeed a difficult and painful task, though her husband would spend weeks and months from his business engagements to be with her. The conviction alone of her sojourn, at her mother's request, at her home, almost caused Ymataca a fit of illness. Her imagination, already too morbid, dwelt again and again upon the minutest particular of that field of horror. Her heart, wrapt in him, stood tranquillized to his last words, never, ah! never to be forgotten. And could Ymataca, wife as she was, and soon to be mother, have overcome the reserve which years of estrangement had engendered, and given vent to the warmth of her nature? The family might have learned to know, and knowing, to love her; but it was then too late—fruitless the effort to succour her. That summons caused almost disrespect and unkindness to the confidence and love of her husband. Again, it was so torturing; but she bore the trial with her true spirit. The fragile frame and gentle obedience seldom failed, with her submissiveness and natural dignity, which enabled her to struggle on. With these acute thoughts, no wonder she was more silent, looked paler. The single-hearted individual, with trembling, tearful eyes, returned to the disagreeable home of childhood. As the days passed while on their way South, each was followed by a sleepless night. She conquered her tears and tried to converse cheerfully.
                  At midday, on a bright morning in January, '52, our heroine stood in the cosey parlour of her mother's home. For a moment an expression of bitter feeling clouded her pale face. Her husband almost involuntarily drew his arm around her, at the same time throwing off her travelling cloak and bonnet. He was struck with the expression of her countenance, which made a desperate effort to send back her tears. He tried to cheer her regretful bewilderment, even surrounded by a warm, affectionate welcome, which she but calmly appreciated, from her mother and family. Her uncomplaining endurance shielded her first sorrow. The appeals of the loved ones at home lessened the outward struggle to a calm. Onerous task! Amidst the resurgent flood, the mother smiled, while fond imagination viewed the weakness of her powers. In earnest conversation they remained for some hours, Ymataca conquering, for the sake of others, a pang so keenly felt. But she was irritated, almost to rebellion, and announced her determination to return the very next day, with Mr. Oustan, back to the Hotel du Nord. He must go; his engagements were urgent; in another week he would return and be with her. His accents soothing came: ah, me!
                  At an early hour after her arrival there, the mother and sister, with a triumphant smile, said, "Well, Ymataca, it is fortunate that you have come later than expected, else you would have met your cousin, who just dropped by a half-hour ago to say 'adieu,' as he, Colonel Rutland, is now on his way to the frontier post."
                  Reader, do you hear this? What are your feelings? Under her wild excitement—"such foolish fancies"—she ventured casually to ask the sister how the officer looked;—only a lisp—for she rigidly retained her first principle never to mention his name in her mother's presence; but at that moment of inquiry she was absent. Unshaken as a rock, she did not allude to the bitter disappointment; but—a shade paler, stranger than her wont—words were interchanged, in language of her own force of contrast, evidently meant to be courteous, on this provocation, fixed and true. Her turn of expression was more excited in manner ner, as if she feared to wake the giant form of memory; and with concern shielded before Mr. Oustan her utmost astonishment at such news, for the consequence of its envious cloud had declined. This fierce extreme unchanged her look and unlocked the wanton breeze. Long did James Ous-ton gaze, and silently, on the mother elect—his dream of love and beauty. The lustre of her majesty and power were realized. Mr. Oustan left, to meet some gentleman friend at the hotel. The family gathered in her cosey chamber to entertain the wife in the husband's absence of a few hours. Madame Marlborough introduced a topic not altogether congenial to the feelings of Mrs. Oustan.
                  "Colonel Rutland," she said, "mentioned your name, Ymataca, rather affectionately, I thought, and made inquiries as a matter of old fancy, I imagine; soberly teased to get your miniature. He sprang from his seat to get it, but I grasped it first. He still loves," laughed the mother, with heartless jest; "but he was forced to replace your picture, and put it where he found it, on the table. He had the impudence to say, 'This day she should be mine—my wife! had it not been for you!' He left; not a moment did he stay; within this half hour he has gone."
                  "Ye gathering clouds and icy gales, chill the bosom of my discontent!" sighed Grita. "Even now I feel its dewy freshness on my soul.
                     
                        
                           "'Art thou a thing of mortal birth,
                           To trace my steps o'er all the earth?'
                        
                     
                  
                  "I feel a pride to name thy name. Thus I love thee on."
                  She started up mechanically; her lips moved not, but she distinctly uttered in her heart a thanksgiving. Her tongue clove to the roof of her mouth. Poor Grita! aching under the solemnly impressive silence of Granville's voice. Where they parted, there they met. God, their destiny, commands!
                  Within the same embosomed remembrances, near to Ambleside, opposite Windrows' corner, a door or two below, stood Madame Marlborough's new residence, on the cross street. How indeed she was to act, she knew not; she only knew "the fatal concealment" could not be given up. The very strengthened hope, the anticipation, seemed too terrible to bear. Alone, on that hidden path, she burst into an agony of tears. The well-remembered voice—his last words—the favourite flower pressed in her bosom, "forget-me-not"—all so near—the very spot remarked. Granville yet unmarried, and loved her still! In her physical state of weakness, too, it appeared as if submission had departed from her. She wellnigh rebelled in spirit again at the decree. But time softened the reopened wound, and gave strength to endure by a realization of submissiveness to a Father's will, which could not fail to recall her to a sense of her duty. Well we know Ymataca's respect for her husband, and the warm gratitude with which she accomplished actually incomprehensible things; and now commenced a new series of exertions aided by his sympathy, his strength. The startling connections of her romance changed quarters, and turned into active service as she really became an inmate of the family at her mother's house. 
                        
                           TO A FIRST-BORN CHILD.
                           "Just out of heaven, grace from on high
                           Around thy forehead clings,
                           And fancy gazes till her eye
                           Can almost see thy wings.
                           The rose upon thy check still wears
                           The colour of its birth,"
                        
                     
                  
                  Introducing my reader to her story, as a near neighbour we are permitted to be in her bedroom. Now cast your eyes over the white waves of fleecy difficulties; with new ideas catch a glimpse of Ymataca's new species of contemplation, excitement, and pleasure. Cradled in her French bed lies the noble boy—her first-born child. The curtains were drawn close. The cheerful fire blazed in the grate; for the evening was sufficiently cool in April, and it added greatly to the aspect of true English comfort. In her snug little chamber, with a flowered carpet, new red curtains, the shadowy firelight streamed on the smooth white walls, and proclaimed the apartment carefully kept. Chattering voices and noisy silk dresses shared the nursing of the convalescent. Sufficiently near, on the hearth-rug, stood the very faithful night-watcher, good old Aunt Marvel, a mulatto. With a caressing protectiveness she fixed her eye in earnest on her "man," as she called our baby; asserting to the extent of her opinion and learned abilities, "'Twant no sich baby ever borned like dis." Her faultless management of the first grandchild, delighted her employment. She pronounced his extravagant wardrobe de Paris "beautiful for her man." The "little splendour" lay smilingly happy in his grandmother's lap, having acquired the venerable age of one month from his birth-night, the second of March.
                  Madame Marlborough watched with eager pleasure the first grandchild. Proudly she hid his round, rosy face in her lap. The family might well be proud of that cherub babe. As he opened his great brown eyes, round and dazzling even in the old blank way, the expression of his countenance was remarked by every one as rarely seen in such a myth of existence; but the most beautiful was a head of noble cast and shape, Aunt Marvel's highest pride; most lovely mouth; features, a very strong picture of his fond and proud father, who went almost crazy over his boy. Just then the door opened. Mr. Oustan came in to lavish his unbounded caresses on the distinguished present his lovely wife had given him. This atom of creature, the soul of earth's purity, turned instinctively to the light, his glance wandering, but perfectly rational. The promised sweetness expanded into perfect life, robed in fleecy embroidery, his infant train dipping the bowers and flowers of his white robe about his mother's dress of white cashmere. In sweet disorder she blushed consent as the enraptured father approached the affectionate picture.
                  "White-mantled Innocence! 
                        
                           "'My child! with love's best treasure fraught,
                           My first-born and my pride,
                           To whom I turn in every thought,
                           With every hope allied;
                        
                        
                           "'Sweet be thy slumbers, soft and deep,
                           While life no sorrow feels;
                           A mother lulls thine eyes to sleep,
                           A father's blessing seals.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  As neighbours, we entered Ymataca's pretty chamber to congratulate the young and lovely mother. The light, joyous voices seemed yet to overpower the gentle convalescent. Loving care and most faithful attentions laid profusely gifts at her door. Domestic enjoyment of home, helping to entrance the new-made happiness, decorated the New-Year's gift with taste and care. Fondly, idolatrously preëminent was the treasured love and tender kindness for Master Crittenden Oustan!
                  Our heroine was half revealed, half hid in the capacious ease of the arm-chair. In paler paleness, our invalid appears changed. And what an immortal change! "White-mantled Innocence!" the purest essence of the soul. Can any woman reading this page believe it less than an immortality of exalted change? A mother! What a feeling! The new mother, noble and generous, treated every one passing by with affectionate gratitude.
                  "You had better let me have the baby," said the mother's mother.
                  "Never mind," she answered proudly, "I shall make a capital nurse, I declare."
                  A throb of pride beamed from the grandmother's sorrow-worn face, as she looked on the fine, manly boy-babe—as the nurse declares, "No sich chile as 'my man.'" Ymataca tenderly handled the little snowberry, and carefully placed the fellow on her lap, aspiring to the character of an excellent nurse. In came the oldest uncle, to ridicule and laugh over the idea of nephew in such a marvellous branch; but her brother Jenyns promised great respect to his title of uncle. Ymataca fully entered in to the spirit of their gentle attentions, while Will, the youngest boy, was very seriously supposing anybody to be mother of that great fellow rather than his fragile sister. Minho and Mal both found it very difficult to prove their auntships, but realized the intensity of their pleasure, loving and tossing the noble young creature from lap to lap. Ymataca was much gratified with the unbounded and universal admiration for her first-born. Her smile brightened at the praises bestowed on the great boy, and by the kindness and devotion of her equally satisfied physician. His medical attendance had given improvement to her delicate health, and she clung with warm affection to her kinsman and friend, the skilful Dr. Calby. His knock was always welcomed, when he entered with his peculiar easy grace. Always a voice of tender care hushed any misgiving, by sympathy and his feeling touch. Strikingly a polished, ceremonious man, he understood always his high class as a gentleman and scholar. She had learned to love the kind-hearted physician in days of girlhood; frolicking in gleeful pleasure in his house, filled with pretty girls verging on their teens, but kept moderate in their overflow of young life by the before-mentioned cousin, as well as his sister, Miss Calby, who presided in those days as mistress of the house of her widowed father. And now he caressed the pretty convalescent and his favourite boy.
                  It was at the close of an afternoon in May, when the little mother became utterly exhausted. Mr. Oustan's eye had grown daily prouder of his charming wife. They were together in the same English room, he leaning fondly on his wife's chair, soothing her entreaties to return home. A complete change stole over her features as she heard the spoiling answer in the affirmative. The parents now have assumed their new dignities. A more rigid discipline must remain to guard "the fatal concealment." And now she compels the alternative to a new sense of her second trial. Her future did seem peopled with the pleasant shadows of reality; and another look at the sleeping babe brought back the parents' evening happiness. again. Mr. and Mrs. Oustan lingered in their room to watch the only one in his dreamy slumber. 
                        
                           "My child! how strange that name appears
                           To lips unused as mine!
                           How thrilling to my listening ear
                           Those infant cries of thine.
                        
                        
                           "How many a thought mysterious burns
                           Within my heart and brain!
                           As still my frequent glance returns
                           To gaze on thee again."
                        
                     
                  
                  The sun looked gorgeously down on the new house. A large and admiring circle of friends suggested many little pleasures for the returning strength and health of the little mother. Lady Atholl's kindness and devoted attentions exceeded her usual goodness to sick neighbours. Neighbourly kind indeed, and well fitted to enliven her sick hours, was the watchful devotion of Mrs. Foubray and her sister to the "old child-love." These lengthened interviews gave opportunity for a thousand pleasures, but not comfort to her still unhealed wound. Not even the high and joyous companionship, the watchful affections, and sisterly love of the devoted cousin Clara Westerling could rouse Ymataca beyond the usual high-mindedness of her purpose. Professing her gratitude for household pleasures and home indulgences, Mrs. Oustan felt now obliged to seek her own home. Her very frail health could no longer endure the oppressive heat of the warm climate; and while trying to repay the displeased mother with gentle but calm words, she never once alluded to an invitation of the family or a member to visit her at the North. No! never could she have borne their influence in her home. So Ymataca bore the storm of discontent with increasing perseverance, for her own conscience perfectly acquitted her. The "unnatural" decision was canvassed again in the circles of fashion and at home, and considered as a move sudden and unnecessary, her thankless feelings inducing her to leave before her actual strength permitted; for she recovered but slowly from her illness. They assigned to her anxious move the desire of fashionable amusements, with her usual worldliness. But she obeyed her command to take care of herself, nestling her broken wing under her husband's guidance. A length they yielded all rising hopes of her reform, and she left with many thanks for her comforts, above all, the restoration of her threatened life. The home circle could not blame her cold, inanimate exterior, which they had never tried to warm. Madame Marlborough held Crit, the baby-boy, to her heart, in silent but tearful embrace, and wept on his little shoulder like a child, for she could restrain herself no longer, naturally distressed to give up the first and only grandchild. The parting with mother, sisters, and brothers, all were calmly told. The carriage rolled away with our travellers. Mr. Oustan felt in his heart he had done all in his power to repay their kindness.
                  Thus they parted. Brightly, placidly, they pursued their way down the river on the splendid ocean-steamer. They ride on to the haven of smiling earth. God approving, they reach Hotel du Nord, mingling once again in the busy scenes of the world. She let the cup of fashion pass. The sobering tie of matrimony gave habits of contentment; the young wife and mother clung to the charm of home-tunes transformed to lullabies. Natural and unguarded as the mountain-maid, cordial to those she loved, distant and reserved to comparative strangers, Ymataca was the same conscientious woman, but indifferent to the opinion others might place on her conduct. Immersed in baby things, contented with her approving mind, and treasuring up the materials of technical life, she wisely contracted the scope of daily joys, the sunbeams of her happiness. Mingling her girlish figure with the cultivated and refined, her accomplishments are confined to a series of musical lessons, still continued as the pupil of Maestro Tonio. In connection with this she enjoyed the retirement, with her babe and husband, to a summer cottage, her favourite haunt, beside the ocean. Among the green pastures she found another attraction in an elegant carriage, to extend her admirable life with harmony of a quiet home.
                  In the course of time Granville came back, to gaze upon the picture of a mother and her child! He found himself face to face with Grita at the Hotel du Nord. The passing tribute seemed to have entered their realm of dreams. "Not ours!" was the solitary reflection of his desperate calmness. He resolved thenceforward to start upon an endless journey. Forevermore the current of his thoughts was to be changed: the magic syllable of her name murmured through their channels. She was resigned, and had made the heroic sacrifice of leaving that sorrow, her bridal prayer, to the Great Physician. But Granville was yet irresolute, longing to depart upon his sterile path, yet lingering on her maternal threshold. Ah! reader, could you have seen the perplexity on her face as they met. There the lovers are, hand in hand, at the Hotel du Nord. Neither had need of speech. To his vivid imagination the spiritual world became real in her presence. His guardian angel still led him by the hand. He wished to die, that he might return no more to his weak and weary body. "What art thou, that hast weighed upon me, as if I had borne the whole world on my shoulders?" As he advanced and saw Grita's child, he bent to the blast like a reed. He was hardly aware of the words he spoke when he kissed its forehead, saying, "Call—him—Granville!" Ah! how indescribably sweet the perfuming of his celestial fragrance imbued with that embalmed air! Did that act speak of safety or companionship, friend reader? It inspired completely and filled her soul with a melancholy delight, creating longings for what lay beyond the horizon of their hopes. This unappeasable desire of their serious hopes, the freshening and overflowing of the old fountain of love, appeared stronger and more beautiful.
                  "This must be stopped," said Grita to the tumult of her swelling heart, as Granville said, "You are so beautiful; I love to stand and look only on you."
                  "Full of faith and good works," rejoined Grita.
                  "Your invisible presence will fill the chambers of my soul, and give me my only solace and delight. Resigning my throne-queen is an anguish most gigantic; but a place in your memory, dearest, is all that I ask. When you enter your realm of dreams, may I come?"
                  Her feverish hand he held, as the beautiful boy was taken to her room. She was overwhelmed by the suddenness and violence of her emotions. 
                        
                           "Yet, yet weep not so, my love;
                           Let me kiss that falling tear;
                           Though my body must remove,
                           All my soul will still be here.
                        
                        
                           "All my soul, and all my heart,
                           And every wish shall pant for you;
                           One kind kiss, then, ere we part,
                           Drop a tear and bid adieu."
                        
                     
                  
                  A few hurried words, apparently uncertain, folded the last touching superscription of Granville's sensations on Grita's dream of joy and wonder. Standing in the selected place against the broad banister of the ladies' stairway, opposite the anteroom, and behind the support of one of those great white Grecian columns, every word was a pulsation of their hearts, resting side by side. 
                        
                           "I have seen my bride another's bride,
                           Have seen her seated by his side;
                           Have seen the infant which she bore,
                           Wear the sweet smile the mother wore
                           When she and I in youth have smiled,
                           As fond, as faultless, as her child,
                           Have seen her eyes in cold disdain
                           Ask if I felt no secret pain.
                           
                           And I have acted well my part,
                           And made my cheek belie my heart,
                           Returned the freezing glance she gave,
                           Yet felt the while that woman's slave;
                           Have kiss'd, as if without design,
                           The babe that ought to have been mine,
                           And showed, alas! in each caress,
                           Time had not made me love her less."
                        
                     
                  
                  With silent souls they parted. A mysterious look in the solitudes of their faith shone upon Granville and Grita with infinite tenderness. It filled the heart of those two, and throbbed in the veins of their golden threads with a motion and a whisper, as he engraved that picture—a volume full of wondrous thought. Would it not be difficult to say which felt the most as they passed to their respective homes? 
                        
                           "At last a soft and solemn breathing sound
                           Rose like a stream of rich distill'd perfumes
                           And stole upon the air;
                           That silence, even silence,
                           Was took ere she was 'ware."
                        
                     
                  
                  Mr. and Mrs. Oustan travelled among the hills, and visited Fort Ezile again. In the summer of '53 they passed weeks on Rockaway's sea-girt shore, and later in the season exchanged the ocean coast for the mountain air. Winding the rugged and bold perpendiculars at West Point crag, they ascend to the Flag-Staff Hotel. On its frizzled steep design, surpassing loveliness launched its magnificent background, with the sweep of its level around to the mastiff form of Putnam Highlands. In the midst the flag-staff lifts aloft its head. At this extreme residence of fashion, Ymataca did not attempt the preposterous conceits of its cup of dross. A little incident thus withdrawn is enough to attract our notice. From that day Ymataca's courteous manners became proudly solitary, as she passed on to the third period of her married life. Mr. Oustan, seeing her lost in thought, and desirous to be alone, questioned her of her wishings and seekings, rather making a natural jest of her dreams. With quickness she retorted; and it seemed as if they entirely misunderstood each other. Ymataca endeavoured to restrain resentment. For a time explanation, and the respect she owed herself, somewhat soothed her. His conciliating care prevented any fatal indignation; it only served to rouse her pride and indifference. "Ah! the spirit of life dwelt in the most secret chambers of her heart." She strove to examine eagerly the full extent of its written characters. Her thoughts, with a painful interest, rendered this a terrible return of "the fatal concealment." The deep workings of her mind were more than ever abstracted to these aspects of the past. She tracked the footprints of Granville when she turned her eyes on the trooped cadets. Other sounds awakened her attention—army notes! She listened, and caught their sound. Her tears flowed silently. In fancy she was borne away to Granville. With extreme regret she saw constantly his brother officers.
                  On the following morning Dr. Percy, U. S. Army Surgeon, was summoned to attend a child lying very ill at Flag-Staff Hotel, some mile and a half from the post garrison. Ymataca had watched for days her beautiful baby-boy in his sick-chamber. He was suddenly seized with a violent ague—the rosy-faced, bright-eyed fellow of seven months. His eyelids were closed, and he lay slumbering. The young, inexperienced, but watchful and idolizing mother was alarmed. She hung over the fierce fever that prostrated his splendid form. Only a few hours before and he was well. The father had left for the city on a matter of great importance. It was the first time in their week's stay that he had left either wife or boy for business. Ymataca was alone. The cousin, Calby, had gone too, for the season was passing into autumn. The mantling crags were tinted with scarlet foliage. Our little mother was gratified with this retirement, being almost the last guest at the hotel. This solitude she enjoyed, after successive dissipations and gayeties at the watering places for months. We find her on this painful occasion nursing anxiously her sick babe. She had kept up good spirits for several days till now, when she sent in haste for their most kind and noble-hearted friend, the surgeon. Her unquiet mind sought to renounce the improper attachment, while its remembrances pressed heavily on her heart. She tried to dismiss the double sorrow which crowded her mind, indulging in distress and anxiety concerning the future of her child. Dr. Percy calmed her oppressed foreboding of imaginary evil. Indeed, little Master Crit was bright and out of doors, smiling languidly in his fond nurse's arms. Mater had him, wrapped in his little French dressing-gown, walking on the corridor. In the meanwhile Ymataca was recalled from a kind of slumber which she had at length sunk into, after intense anxiety and watching, by the presence of the most gentle and noble-hearted physician, who encouraged her hopes regarding his little patient. He promised to drop in after noon, when garrison duties were over. By appointment, he reached the door on the upper corridor, where he found his little invalid almost convalescent. Ymataca started up suddenly, as if alarmed at the quick rapping at her chamber-door. Recognizing the voice, she opened the door with her peculiar grace and gentle welcome. Mrs. Oustan rose feebly from her bed to welcome the physician. Dr. Percy entered, in rich uniform, which harmonized with his figure, and was in unison with his gay and gallant manners. His soft, flashing eye bespoke the goodness of exalted nature. The officer conversed for old acquaintance ance' sake with Mrs. Oustan, and rejoiced over the improvement of the baby. Ymataca sat at her window in a flowing white robe. She looked upon the Hudson river, lighted by a morning sun. Her pale cheek became flushed with a bright scarlet. The next moment she dismissed her weary, anxious thoughts, and thanked him again with her grateful heart for the relief of her late fears. At that soft hour a faint strain of martial music stole from the plains. The finest emotions of her soul were wrapt in that scene, and these reflections brought to her remembrance an unutterable load of anguish. She mused upon it long in uneasiness and doubt, hesitating whether to trust herself. She leaned pensively on the open casement in profound thought. The still air seemed to breathe upon the woods; the sound of the army-band broke on the silence, and she listened still in agitated rapture, as tears filled her eyes and fell down her cheeks. She looked around with anxious inquiry, and turned hastily from the object that awakened the spell, saying to herself, "How long may it be ere I see you, Granville? How much must happen to make miserable the interval? Five years! will it be? Oh, could I now be certain that I should ever return to you, and find that you still live for me! The past, the present, is now before me in one of its visible and dreadful forms. The dust beneath answers to Grita's cry, casting the shadow of Granville's invisible presence around me. O mighty Spirit of the past! I will look in memory now—ook on the extracts of love. Is this the time to expose a mournful phenomenon? But this national music chants amid the mountains, and the concert of its union is so striking, it conspires to produce this translation even far away!"
                  She struggled for composure, and was for some time diverted by the doctor's agreeable conversation. But, hardly hearing the sound of her voice, he was forced to observe her dissatisfied and restless manner. She rose from the window, crossed the floor, stood a moment before the toilet-glass, gathered up a cologne bottle, and tossed herself again on the chair opposite the surgeon. For a time the distracted dejection of his little friend, as he called her, alarmed him. He saw no eye sparkle with her smile, nor a countenance that reflected her happiness. She was spiritless and discontented.
                  "Come, come!" said her friend. "Why! what has happened to cause you such grief?"
                  Grita turned from his kind look and inquiring glance, to hide the powerful pressure on her reflections. He smiled at first, as if to warn her of her weakness in her very prostrated health.
                  "Nerves unstrung at intense watching over the babe," remarked the surgeon. So much benevolence blended with his manner, it lent a charm to his friendliness. Grita was conscious that her new friend united to his extreme caution of manner, simplicity of refinement rarely equalled. She hoped for fortitude enough to attempt that moment to trust, yielding to her first impressions thus readily expanded in confidence to the stranger of short acquaintance.
                  "Ah," said Surgeon Percy, in his courteous way, "I beg, madam, you will allow me to understand the case." Observing the excessive paleness of her countenance, he inquired if she were ill. The clouds of grief, mingled with a faint expression of horror, gathered on her brow. She felt that she was relapsing into faintness, and instantly averted her looks. Poor Grita! She resembled one of those marble statues bent in hopeless sorrow over the ashes of the dead.
                  "Madam," he calmly continued, "I am surprised at your state of melancholy. You certainly have no apprehension for your beautiful boy's health now? I have pronounced him out of danger, and doing well."
                  She sat sobbing aloud.
                  "Madam," said he, "this is an important duty. Your tears betray you into fearful melancholy; I reproach you as your physician, for having increased it, and I protest against it. Avoid looking at your distress."
                  Grita tried to smile, but was unable to speak.
                  "Remember, madam, I am here your physician and your friend; and, in your husband's absence, will do anything in my power to befriend you, and one in whom I feel such interest; especially to encourage your fortitude, to overcome this untold melancholy, that appears to have such power. I beseech you, release your thoughts from such desperate wanderings."
                  She felt more gratitude than she was able to express. His esteem and kindness were strongly expressed in his manner, which to all and every one possessed greatness. To Surgeon Percy's worth Grita had been inclined to yield her confidence, almost from the first moment in which she had seen him. She felt a soothing sadness encouraging her blameless life:
                  "Let us sit down by the window, for it's excessively warm," said the surgeon, moving their chairs from the centre-table. The feverish excitement was increasing. She shook her head, breathing languor of that submissive homage, which was due the sweet-voiced herald of the mighty past. A long pause, and his eyes were fixed inquiringly on her.
                  "You will promise first," said Grita, raising her head, her eyes glistening with tears, as the kind surgeon's filled, practised as his manly skill had been amid the horrors of war, to deal with suffering. This unnerved the soldier and the surgeon, beyond what he had seen. Dr. Percy wiped away the tears drawn from a great and sympathetic heart. She began:
                  
                  "I will tell you the secret of my melancholy, but you must promise me solemnly never, never to reveal my trust. My reliance on you is honour. The noblest contribution you have given is feeling. And now I must tell you. Here we are alone; none are near me to scoff; and to you alone I look for relief. "
                  Her manner was tempered with inseparable dignity, and that elegant languor she so generally practised. Awhile in admiration paused the doctor.
                  "Can't you forget?" asked the surgeon.
                  "Would that I could!" was her answer.
                  "Madam, believe me that nothing but a strong interest in your welfare induces me to receive a confidence you so urgently, earnestly desire. I will befriend you."
                  Grita acknowledged the truth of his assertion, but insisted that he should at all hazards possess the dreadful secret.
                  "If I can comfort your anguish, doubt not my steadiness for your friendship." She perceived his countenance was altered to great calmness and dignity. He endeavoured to soften her unpleasant circumstances, as he listened to her proposal, dictated by hopeless love and despair. Convulsive sobs again interrupted her words. Recollecting the danger of being discovered, and, too, the impropriety of her secret, she exerted great efforts to recover calm dignity of mind necessary to support her subject.
                  "Doctor, I must reconsider; yet I feel you are a brave man of truth. I ask and repeat the desire for a promise, a solemn one, which I must obtain from you. When this is done I shall be easier."
                  Struck by her last words, as if for the first time with a conviction of her danger, the surgeon gazed at her, full of greatness and grief, and begged her to weigh well the concealment.
                  "Madam, I see your looks plead for you. I have particular reasons for observing the most profound silence. First, it is no curiosity to learn for my own satisfaction, but from a deep, heartfelt sympathy and friendliness; and as a physician, it belongs to my profession to bury its sacred treasures. Remember, I solemnly promise never to unfold what you mean to confide to me. Let the confidence in my honour persuade you to the same reliance."
                  "It is a hope, doctor, which I shall never resign."
                  Now she speaks clearly; no longer stifles the anguish of her heart.
                  "It is an echo, kind doctor, that you awaken, veiled from my eyes. Faith and hope are my guides concerning it, to restore the soul of power. I have a cousin in the army, for whom, you may imagine, I have a fatal attachment; and, if you can indulge my pride without compelling a compromise of your dignity, I beg you will seek his address. A thousand painful pangs imbitter our separation. This is a dead secret from my family. My intention is to hear of his post, and fly to him by letter first. I wish earnestly to reconcile our separation—at his request, to soften our delicate affection to the sincerity of friendship, thrilling from our hearts with tenderness and hope. If nothing more, let that exist in communication between us; by your hands conceal the tie. Ay, doctor, lost in remembrance of those moments, it is that which overcomes me; and to write to him seems to alleviate our bitter absence from each other. It would be a consolation indeed—the only employment that can withdraw me from my fatal melancholy. I mention this to you, his brother officer."
                  Her words referred some what to a touch of her past, but gave no name. As the surgeon refused his assistance, her heroic heart held right on. She begged to know the regiment, and hinted minutely without mention of the splendid cousin's name. This great satisfaction particularly relieved her, as he cankered not the wound with scoff nor jeers. She besought him most earnestly to aid her, telling him in tears how her loveless heart played its part, to laugh with a sigh. Surgeon Percy started aghast.
                  "My good friend," said he, "I am amazed, astonished—astonished with amazement at your suffering. Your words startle me. I feel deeply for you, insufficient as my consolation must be, on this serious, awfully serious subject. I can only mourn with you, for I cannot doubt the source of your tears. Would to God I were mistaken!"
                  Grita burst into incontrollable grief again, and asked his confidence. This was the first lisping of her sorrow since her marriage to any living being but Granville.
                  "Rest assured, madam, that you have buried this as dead as the grave in my honour. Now comes my advice," said the officer-surgeon; "true and honest, take these words from me. I, as a friend, as your physician, his brother officer, tell you thus. It is a vital thing. Turn from it at once to duty. You are a wife and mother. Try not the past. Roll the stone over the sepulchre of memory. Ah! I see the shadow of your pale face. It tells what your lips refuse to speak. Let me solemnly convince you. In flying to him, you make a false step—a step to ruin—unlawful, ungenerous, a monstrosity of an evil. Stop! do not reject your better judgment and reason. Regret, if you cannot drive that away; lament you may do a marriage of indifference—mated not, only married. It is in itself misery enough. Do not increase it by clandestine interviews and correspondence—never! Justify your pretensions. You have pride enough to conquer. I want to teach you plain sense and judgment in this matter. You hope for impossibilities. I hope, from your silence, that you are convicted of your error. Perceive with me, my good little friend, the consequences of so huge a design. Commit no such mistake. Resume your station, as holily bound, without apprehension. Tempt not to ruin your fortune by this policy; the very suggestion increases my fears. Conclude your present state of torture by its execution; shroud it from every human eye. Never again let temptation have this mighty power over you to seduce to evil. Be exalted by the recollection of yourself—wife! mother! Be comforted by the assurance. Breathe a pure happiness. Remember, you would render your lives desperate, and ruin the name of your family. The one you sigh for may be happy, as he is—perhaps married?"
                  She started forward as if to throw new light upon the state of her heroic romance.
                  "I am fully conscious of the adventure; or rather the evil and crime of the case."
                  With a burst of feeling she groaned out, "Doctor, if prayers can be heard, mine will be. Married!" she ejaculated, amid the anguish of her sufferings. "If prayers can be heard, mine will be ceaseless to keep watch over that deep impression, and reign over his path, that the old love may sweep over him. Crush to dust the feeling? I would like rather to hear of his death."
                  In this thrilling reflection she was greatly affected.
                  "Madam! madam! let this die, for your own peace and the lives of those intrusted to you. Silence—courage! I steadily refuse to tell you his post, or address, even if you gave me his name. Let distance overshadow the eternal love, and let the sweet dreams of time scatter the rays of peace around these more rightful ties."
                  Grita's desperate spirits were roused to astonishment as she heard the authority of superior knowledge denounce the bold act as unjustifiable. She was regardful of the sympathy of his countenance as he firmly disdained her proceeding. Again he sternly bade her remove the extraordinary affair—to investigate the solemnity of its crime. Meanwhile Mrs. Oustan's agitation did not prevent her replying. Alternately her countenance varied from livid paleness to a scarlet flush. She trembled from fear and indignation. Her emotion can scarcely be imagined. Thus passed the melancholy day in the chamber. At this recital our dear, good, noble physician healed bodily suffering, and saved her soul from eminent danger. Think you, my reader, she could ever forget Doctor Percy? His tender compassion proved effectual; and, environed in her labyrinth of misfortune, she shuddered with evident sensation at this confessional. His great mind was deeply impressed with her unhappy fate. Ah! did he not indulge her strange, devoted memory with compassion more than reproach, and strengthen en her mind to struggle with the activity which her duty required? He watched over the violent change of that tempest, and the effect which the storm had produced on the exhausted frame of his little friend. The surgeon sank in the chair from which he had risen, and was led by strong impulses to soothe and reassure her. He returned to the conversation after looking at his watch, to give her all the time duty would allow.
                  "Promise me, Mrs. Oustan, that you will not shut yourself from the gayeties below. Awaken from such sickening dreams. Let me implore you. I cannot, will not aid you, but I will do all in my power to save you," observed the good, great man. Grita did not repent the rashness that gave confidence to the power of such a brave being. Again he sat down by her side, at the window's open casement, and sternly urged her to promise not to indulge this dreadful melancholy.
                  "Endeavour," said he, "to strengthen your mind to bear patiently what is now an impossibility, a thing beyond question. You must strive to remember your position as woman. I feel, dear madam, I cannot withdraw from this chamber without exacting my authority, with which you have invested me. In the high honour of friend and confidant, my word is spoken—beware!" His open declaration that he would not protect her design, determined her to obey his summons and entreaties. For a considerable siderable time she was unable to yield. In her compliance she seemed about to resign the happiness of future years, and from him she had looked for some hope to support her fainting spirits. Prudence, or rather fear, had saved her from mentioning the name of Rutland.
                  The doctor stood looking on the beauties of the view—the grass-shaven lawn, sloping to the precipitous cliff and very margin of the Hudson. A soft shadow overspread the scene within and without.
                  "Oh, my young friend," said the confidant, "I should be glad to dissipate the gloom which reflection has cast upon your buoyant youth. Look from this high prospect on gloomy scenes. Be cheered by living nature. Resign all future happiness with such folly. Dare not His power, and recollect my former promise: I determine to protect you and your secret."
                  Grita looked piteously at the surgeon, as he turned to leave the room, saying as he stepped to the door, "I shall see you again. Your nerves are exhausted, and need watching."
                  His compassion called a smile upon the face of misery, so sepulchral, it pierced his heart with sickening remembrance. Her depressed nature and oppressed spirits were never dead to politeness. It was a remarkable fact, and noted by other medical men, that she would rise in the face of agony to welcome or take leave of a visitor. Now, almost with the airy lightness of sixteen, she eloquently wished him "good morning." With unutterable, unending thanks she warmly clasped his kind hand, and with true dignity he bowed his best wishes. Au revoir!
                  
                  Surgeon Percy closed the door with painful emotions. "I tremble for you," were his thoughts. Crossing the passage, no voice was heard beyond her walls; not even Master Crit, in his Mater's arms, was to be seen. Ah! returning to approach his post, he did indeed repeat, as he followed down the terrace, "Was I right, madam, in this?" "A singular conversation," thought he. "Should such a commission of crime circulate? If strictly true, her conscience must decide. Its mysterious history is a surprising circumstance;" and instantly he quitted the place, resolved to protect her fatal secret.
                  Ymataca was too much affected by the narrative which had passed to awaken to cheerful objects—she could not. She continued at the window, depressed by severe disappointment, and yielded to her melancholy inclination. If imprudently unfortunate, no virtue of her own could have taught her to avoid the disastrous story she disclosed. She repeated to herself—but 'twas unfolded, that scroll, to the care of a great man, brave, full of goodness—"I believe it safe!" Neither words nor tears indulged her thrilling emotions. In her lonely hours she trembled at the awful expectation of her husband's return. The stillness remained long unbroken, except by the murmuring sounds of the woods. The leaves waving in the breeze and the rippling plash of water against the rocks were in melancholy unison with the sad story which had been related. It so much shocked her system that she sank under it, and retired to her cottage-bed to seek forgetfulness in sleep. In the first horrors of remorse and despair, Ymataca felt inclined to deliver herself with a moment's infidelity to the completion of the unutterable feeling. The unavailing, unresisted passion of memory was dreadful. A slow poison seemed to prostrate her energies. She yearned to regain her influence over one she loved. Awakening in her mind the jealousy of pride, her sacrificed honour and love, she felt tempted almost to stain her blameless conscience with crime. Overwhelmed with her wound, she stood appalled, aghast. Unaccountably, at that moment, she was reassured of her innocence, and felt suddenly the barrier to impede the horrible act. Thus she writhed as she renounced the deep degree, amidst the tumult which she suffered in sense of her intimate surmise. Soothed in some measure by her only child—a beautiful blessing!—she wept over the babe in her silent, secluded room; for she entirely refused to mingle with the fashionable bevy below. She then formed the dangerous resolve again to strengthen her weakness in the tenderness ness of a mother; and the returning fondness of infancy awoke music over field and flood, like a rainbow on her way—"My sweet and only child!" Upon her soul's divinest part grief had laid an icy hand, and her shrinking heart, like a wounded, singing bird, was wailing unto sighs, all flowing to memory's gloomy river.
                  Several weeks passed, during which she appeared at intervals the phœnix of despair, resisting by prudence to put to proof a wife's fidelity. Her conduct afflicted her more, because, in obedience to the command of her mother, she had accepted the hand of one, loving and engaged to another.
                  Soon Ymataca perceived, with extreme grief, the alteration in Mr. Oustan's manners. He became austere, sometimes almost rude, on his return a few days after the disclosures so very profound in the presence of the superior friend and brave man. Mr. Oustan had yet no new reason to doubt her. Her inquietude had not betrayed her insupportable symptoms of remorse and regret; while, too, goodness and simplicity of heart rendered her beauty more enchanting, if possible, to his fancy, than it had ever yet appeared. The young and girlish mother, Ymataca wished to forget the sacrifice, as his love was deserving a noble reward. She carefully concealed the late explained mystery. She had at first thought to reveal it to the husband; but no, it was too sacred, too bitter; her proclaimed infidelity would be ruin, destruction.
                  Ymataca's health gave way to terrible illness. Surgeon Percy had been again and again summoned to her bedside, contesting an alarming attack on the brain. With his accomplished science and skill he strove to abate its force, while he, with Mrs. Oustan, mused on the vein of its heaviness. Sometimes he hesitated, on reflection, whether to confide to her husband his uneasiness and doubt. Her case was a complicated one, from over-taxed care. He imagined her boy's illness had shocked her naturally delicate frame, and he had desired, for the best, that she should leave the Point immediately, and at once return home, to be watched by a professed and skilful oculist or aurist; for both blind and deaf she might become, so rapid and violent was the attack. The old physician and friend, Dr. Lidale, was the one upon whom must be thrown the first consultation and responsibility of her nearly fatal disease. Her spirits recovered composure, and her very feeble strength came sufficiently to start away very unexpectedly the next Monday morning. Surgeon Percy kindly watched his "little friend" to the last, and expressed to her husband serious apprehensions. From the gate which led out of the grounds, the road wound its way beneath the tints of autumnal leaves to its terminating banks. The driver approached, and stopped under the huge precipice to deliver up the travellers to the river-boat. There she bid farewell to the great and good man, having, as she imagined, looked her last on the brave friend to whom she owed unfathomable obligation. Taking an adieu of the dark, precipitous, and lovely scenery, soon they swept past the Palisades, to reach the rooms of the past at the Hotel du Nord. Very alarmingly ill our poor Ymataca lay for days. Her kind husband's anxiety can be imagined. Her physician thought death would ensue, or else the loss of sight and hearing. God gave him power to arrest a fatal result, and she slowly recovered. The winter passed away, and within death's grasp her beautiful babe's life was almost taken. James Oustan and his wife were then taking first lessons in sickness and sorrow.
                  As I stand lost amid the scene of years succeeding the events of her past life, we may now give room for wise reflection, and conclude her path of duty was unequalled, as the watchful, devoted, and loving wife of him to whom gratitude had made sacred a pure, very pure. feeling of honour. Variety of delightful associations occupied her life, adhering to domestic care, but not domestic enjoyment. Her constitution never recovered from that fatal attack, but the dignity insinuated its superiority of power.
                  In the autumn Ymataca gave birth to a daughter, on the 4th of September, 1854, her next and last child. We will observe of the pensive babe, whom early experience had taught a singular melancholy, that she seemed clothed with a sunshine of benevolence and reason united. That sweet infant-flower lifted its tender head to the light, its bright eye glowing with a tear. Her voice of music floated on the sweet breath of morning. Sleeping 'neath the canopy of purity, the little one spread her incense to the genial air, and bid the mother live. Little Vasiva pursued her noble birth through dark and fearful hours. On that day, the morning of her birth, that father and husband was thought by physicians to be breathing his last hours of life. All was silent and forsaken. The whisperings abroad to the unconsciously undermined constitution was added to a malignant disease, protracted in itself. The seeds of desperate suffering with the mortal complaint were planted then, which in the four years of their marriage obtained fatal, irremediable ascendency, occasioning sufferings almost to death, as at the hour of his little daughter's birth his life passed nearly away. Ymataca felt more depressed than ever at the succeeding shock, and it was perceptible that sorrow had seized upon her weakened nerves. Herself ill when told of the dying husband. she could not see him. What a painful contrast to earlier remembrances of his care over her sick-bed! Now he had been all the time unconscious of her agony, in the hands of care. He was attended by two faithful surgical nurses, and five physicians passed in constant attendance from his dying-bed to that of his ill and suffering wife. The gloom of dying notes came near to her second child, but the fairy wand of fate foiled the spell.
                  His disease was incurable. The agony lurking in those weak veins defied medical advice. His patient suffering, so heroically concealed from beloved ones around him, gave a touching singularity to his life. James Oustan's constitution, worn with exertion, seemed now to render the physicians' conquest impossible. And he was prepared for the event, while all supposed death approaching.
                  A few days more, and Ymataca with her little family recovered. Upon her face was an expression of grief and tenderness, as if she anticipated the sorrow that awaited her. Through the most desperate illness, from weeks to months confined to his bed by harrowing agony, Mr. Oustan's towering patience and humble piety had triumphed completely, by the most sublime resignation, under the horrors of a cancered stomach. These chilling draughts strewed the wife's path with their last yellow leaves, the circling blast foretelling the death in five years. It gave an image of desolation to her mind, feeling unable to calm her afflictions and vicissitudes, portraying in feeling images the strong and irrevocable presentiment ment of his departure. While she walked mournfully on, gazing at the tempestuous clouds, she would have accused herself. In life all had been done for him by honour and affection. While he reposed, as the sufferer more intensely again, under another's roof, and in the ravings of delirium for the last two months of that illness, he visited by request the threshold of grandpa's home. A memorial paints that scene. Fondest feelings entwine with attention, and deep sorrow, from smiling care of those adult spirits following the smallest wish of those early trainings, to the sainted mother's idol-friend; while now, in his last communion he appeared as if held in converse with her holy presence, as a guiding angel to the spirit-land. The valedictory of his life was excessively affecting. In the presence of a thousand tender reflections, the tears of those dearest ones were shed in solemn silence around the agonizing pain of departure. His serene countenance would at times rouse to the prospect of futurity, and then lispingly express firm hope. Oh the bliss of dying! Devoid of consciousness awhile— 
                        
                           "Trembling, lingering, hoping, flying,
                           Oh the pain, the bliss of dying!"
                        
                     
                  
                  The calm resignation was, to all around that death-bed, a powerful lesson of faith.
                     
                        
                           "The world recedes, it disappears.
                           Lend, lend your wings; I mount, I fly!
                           
                           O Grave, where is thy victory?
                           O Death, where is thy sting?"
                        
                     
                  
                  And the wandering leaf of his existence floated silently on and settled in the grave. On the fifth of August, 1855, James Oustan passed from life to immortality. His disease was the scirrhus cancer of the stomach, like Napoleon's, with the same symptoms.
                  "Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live, and is full of misery." The beloved pastor met the corpse at the entrance of the gothic church, and going before it, said, "I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord." And at the tomb was said the husband's favourite quotation, "Man that is born of a woman."
                  Mr. Oustan was interred in Ocean Land Cemetery, attended to his long home by a train of distinguished friends, who were very sincere mourners. The great and noble Lorenzo, first and most devoted in his attentions during all the drear hours of his friend's illness, was last to leave the beloved body of that nearest friend in brothership to the sad darkness of the tomb. Again, we find his great feeling heart turned to his friend's bereaved widow and fatherless. The strange series of circumstances had translated Ymataca Oustan, the young widow, into the hands of his devoted brother-friend. As guardian dian he received the young thing. From those last hours of James Oustan's life, she was committed to Lorenzo's care; and under his roof, days and years had descended down to night, when death parted them. Yes, then the husband's fellowship with her had shared mutual woes, "till death us do part." No weakness nor ingratitude accused her in suffering the sense of various blessings she possessed. The now grim skeleton in gaunt and mournful accents seemed to say, "Remember the companion, true and devoted, for short years." With that expression oft repeated, she lamented his death. And tears of compassion mingled with those of regret. Never had Ymataca felt the importance of a lesson of life before this. Now, in the desolation of widowhood, she gleaned the promise to find Him, Father of thy fatherless ones. Not a shadow rested on the sorrow-worn heart; conscience calmly acquitted her. She remembered how he rested upon her shoulder with his skeleton hands, and with dying lips recalled. the charms of his life united to hers; he blessed the virtues of her blameless conduct and devoted attentions. Instinctively his illustrious example chronicled the solemn event through those short years; and, in the presence of his wife, he died! but away from his little ones. Not one of her family stood there, or saw their noble benefactor passing away. James Oustan was no longer their aid, since illness and failure in business had robbed him of a great fortune. In this melancholy, solemn hour, the family once so sorrow-stricken forgot him.
               
            
            
               THE FOURTH ERA.
               FIVE YEARS.
               1855.
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XV.
                  AS the five years within five months have been comparatively happy, we have now closed her history as daughter, wife, and mother—woman, we say, faithful to herself and her vows. A few days following that on which Mr. Oustan died, his widow was compelled to return to the lake, where his little orphans, the son and daughter he loved so idolatrously in life, had been left, among the hills of Putnam. There the father and mother had been, season after season; and from that lovely home of summer-scenes he had gone to the city, never more to see the darling babes in the woods. Mr. and Mrs. Calby and their children had a kind care and special attention over the fatherless, and the nurse, who was mother to Vasiva. To that retirement she hastened, almost insensible from contending emotions, rejoicing to clasp the children, now fatherless, to their mother's heart. To the shelter of a hotel she was carried, we remember, as the bride to her home. The world protects her as its own, in the hour of widowhood. Circumstances, we know, obliged her to remain there among those who loved her and opened great, huge hearts to comfort and bestow noble acts on her. The Calbys were affectionately kind and generous, as a feeling tribute to the past; they having disposed of her as the bride and received her as the widow. By a curious coincidence they happened to be at that hotel. Left independent by his will, the supposed mistress of a large fortune, she might reasonably, after a decent season of retirement, have been the gay widow; but her nature, prone to principle and goodness, made her seclude herself, acknowledging the rich esteem and lavish kindness from friends so abundantly consoling her lonely hours. She conducted herself with patient perseverance, and the eloquent grace of her distinguished dignity won the respect of all.
                  When Ymataca had recovered from the weary, intense anxiety and distress, she remained sunk in pensive tranquillity, full of sweet tenderness. She had awakened to her responsibility in the care of her orphan children. Her heart swelled with affectionate sympathy, as tears fell to the mournful consideration, how should her young experience, unskilled in art, fulfil so important a trust as training her children, deprived as she was of her good husband's aid? This seemed to heighten her faculties, now called into direct action for good or evil. Here then she contemplated the stupendous charge, at the age of twenty-two. Her disposition and talents, with her philosophic inquiry, apparently fitted her for the gleam of light in darkness. Her perceptions were clear and feelings just, from which she determined to carve the expansive models full of ardour; highly susceptible of what was grand in man and beautiful in woman. To the five talents assigned she must add five more. The faithful servant must remember the germ of evil, in exercising the correction of children, to train the twig interwoven in their very nature, and to promote the endowments given in infancy, to befit them for more than mortal birth. Amid the wonders of childhood's dower, filled with its vast mysteries, they, like woman's faith, must endure through time and place for high wisdom, glory, and power. This dizzy stair our young widow must climb to guard her cherubs. Thus she began the duties of the faithful, tender, but resolved mother.
                  Go with me, my good reader, to look on the widow seated in her apartment of peace. Resignation steals on the lines of sorrow, as she lifts her eyes toward heaven. She sits alone, her senses refreshed by the cool and balmy air, as the last rays of sunlight shot behind the hills. The landscape glowed with tinges of sweet effect, and she listens to the excited scenes below. From morn till eve kind friends fill her room with their abundant goodness. Her innocent loveliness reflects a new feature to the singular repose in the beauty of solitude. Charmingly she looks, robed in heavy crape, which mournfully clad her deep gloom. But Ymataca Oustan by fate had been placed under circumstances fitted to ripen into genial development all the exquisite forces of her soul. At her husband's death her nature grew expanded and exalted by her responsibility. She had wisely accepted the purity of her grief, and submitted to solitude. Here, too, let us place the high scale of notable incident which engraves first on the list of friends formed by affliction's hour the name of Von Coburg. The Von Coburgs had arrived at Hemlock Hotel in her absence with the father of her children. The model creation of love arose in the adopted home of Vasiva's infancy. Young Tuyve Von Coburg, the noble specimen of a son, arrived from a three-years' travel in Europe, and met his beloved family at the lake. A few steps from the door of his room he observed a superior-looking nurse, in her arms a babe nine months old. Tuyve seized the little one, whose tiny foot had not ventured on this cold earth of ours. The robe of beautiful embroidery was the first short dress; a tiny foot, slippered, budded below the dress. Her broad English sash and pink ribbons accorded well with her baby appearance. Little curls frizzled up toward each fair temple, giving a piquant air. Vasiva was not lovely, but pensively attractive. The late-arrived, dusty traveller first saw the babe at his door, on his way to the mother's room. Tuyve Von Coburg took the babe in his arms, and said to the nurse:
                  "Can I have this lovely child? Whose is she? Where is the mother of the pensive babe?"
                  "Sir," she replied, "madam is sitting at the bed-side of her dying husband, far away. This little one will soon be fatherless."
                  "Give her to me," said the gentleman. "Why, little darling, so sad?" was his caress; and he went with her in his arms to that darling mother of his. She, too, clasped the sad baby to her breast on hearing the tale of affliction and sorrow. She said:
                  "Yes, my son, we shall take care of the fatherless."
                  Most true her noble utterance—words spoken from the stranger's heart—"God bless them! each one." The child soon learned to love that eye of man. Her cherub notes would offer their welcome at his sight, and cling to his shoulder as if she was formed to love and be loved. Often he left the society of the belles, and took his baby-love, to stroll along the fair surface of lake border. her little fingers stretched down his shoulder as he walked hour after hour along the beach, caressing and teaching her to prattle to his questions. Her cry was always loudest for him. She learned to love. Mother and darling brother were soon rejected by her outstretching arms for Tuyve. Master Crit would wrestle to get her away for his mother; but no, there she clung to his fond embrace.
                  The hazel hair of her beautiful boy was admired, and he was idolized by all around. Two years and a half had gone over his long ringlets and curly head. He was a gay fellow, with the grave dignity of a courtier, and, Hamlet-like, clothed all in black. One would hardly realize in his young form the high aspirations and proud, beautiful nature inherited from one of the noblest of men. The boy is strong, and seems fitted to ride over the stage of life. An incident of Vasiva's bud-like creation was that she wound her way into the heart of man. She was never seen to laugh or smile, by any means ever tried. The pensive babe was his sweetest care.
                  Madame Von Coburg's feelings and kindness were entirely devoted to the faithful young mother and her fatherless children. Presiding like a fond and doting mother, she most nobly adopted the melancholy charge. Their tender sympathy and unostentatious kindness created an attachment of profoundest friendship. Mornings and evenings at the lake were treasured by the silvery gleam upon the countenance of this most elegant woman. They struck the chords with the finger of harmony to the lovely daughters, Hortense and Ulrique. Madame Von Coburg's countenance was somewhat faded; yet the ineffable tenderness strikingly contrasted with the superiority of her decisive and haughty air, tempered with such feeling as to be esteemed her glory, diffused with Christian graces. Her silken hair no frost had sprinkled. The brow was high. Care and sorrow had left their touch upon the Northern heiress. Scrupulously jealous of her charms, though the blush of modest youth were gone, still in her face and figure it survived. Her proudly aristocratic birth hallowed the influence which presided over the lovely daughters, as scrupulous of modesty as their fond mother. The husband was a man of gay and distinguished rank, loving power more than ostentation, generous and indefatigable in doing good; a gentleman of imagination, which contrasted with his sullen countenance, and gave a stern cast to his features; a father in devoted kindness, like his family, to the afflicted ones. He introduced his lovely family on this occasion at Hemlock Hotel. They of course, justly attained distinction at once in the best society. The beauty, modesty, and fascinating manners of the eldest daughter, Hortense, reflected new glories on their acquaintance, and the confirmed expression of character and refined enthusiam of Ulrique's sweet simplicity at once marked her peculiar attractions; and too, young Tuyve added his attributes of gentleman to their high position in society. Sweet and graceful emotions reflected Ymataca's enthusiasm over a thousand interesting recollections of the firmly made and faithful friends to her fatherless ones and herself. As dearest parents, brothers, and sisters, the three sons, two daughters, the father and mother, watched over them to the last hours of their stay at the lake, and attended the lonely ones to their city residence.
                  Winterwood has every emblem of delight and comfort to make a most desirable residence with the new-made acquaintances. A lovely woman, mistress of its pure and attractive charms, supplies the home with its comforts, with the assistance of a still more delightful associate in the younger sister of the Torkays. We have thus found a blessing, the first gifts from God to his widow and fatherless. They devoutly recognized the hand of Providence directing them to winter there, among quiet comfort and refinement.
                  In the month of December, 1855, our widow-friend was (an unusual thing with her) passing the day with her cousins, the Calbys. Early in the day she was surprised to meet a young, gay, and pretty girl, whom she had known in Petersburgh—the lately arrived guest of her cousins. Mrs. Calby just entered with the sprightly Miss Fenning, who rushed into the most reserved quiet of the widow-cousin, and dashed out in a moment the great pleasure she had just enjoyed with a new acquaintance Mrs. Calby had introduced her to, "Colonel Rutland of the army," who had that day returned from the Rocky Mountains. The young stranger was regardless of the wound she had given, or the blushing face of our fair heroine. Grita started and rose up at the name of Rutland. She became restless, and made the proposition of leave-taking.
                  "No, not yet," they all insisted.
                  Without any consciousness of her action, she resumed her seat. What could relieve her melancholy situation, or enable her to bear with fortitude the magic of that name, rendered so oppressive by sorrow? To her alone the secret of a blasted career existed. The time had been long, with the torture of his name in every society. Again she hears the accusing sound of Granville's name; and free once more, she dares examine her own heart, convinced she had preserved her old and earliest affection of childhood, free from the strong growth of that warm love which came near becoming guilt. Again, sorrow, flowing from excess of tenderness and regret, increased to so alarming a degree that it was utterly unendurable.
                  Grita, not appearing to notice the remark, sat aside from the rest, entertaining herself with a caged canary. She looked out of the window trying to avoid notice, if possible. Mrs. Calby's eyes glanced full and searchingly into the widow's agitated face. Miss Fenning, in her liveliest mood, proceeded with a large amount of praises in honour of the great fascination and elegant manners of the gallant officer.
                  "Oh! Mrs. Oustan," she exclaimed, "he is so delightful. But, he was so anxious about you; scarce spoke to us, cousin Ness and I, before he asked a thousand questions of you, and made the most particular inquiries. He says he will call immediately at your house to see you—he is very anxious."
                  An involuntary air of surprise appeared on Miss Fenning's countenance as she observed the flash of excitement on Mrs. Oustan's face. Grita only blamed herself for suffering her romantic imagination to carry her so far beyond the bounds of probability, and she endeavoured to check the convulsions of her exquisite feelings. At the instant recollecting Granville's manner at the Hotel du Nord, she shuddered at her weakness, fearing it might now be malignant triumph. She shrank from the thought of meeting, as her terrible suspense of fathoming his love had been so undecided. Ah! how impatiently eager she was to hear that voice, and to speak again face to face. Vague fears darted through her tortured mind—a sleeping fancy, prompted by an awakening truth which gave strength to a resolve. In her heart she agreed to palliate the agony of the past by sending her address first to his hotel, for she had long known the Calbys' dislike, nay, prejudice. Mrs. Calby requested that Mrs. Oustan would think nothing of the giddy, thoughtless Miss Fenning's insinuations—so indiscreet to say anything about that person, at such a moment, too; concerning which Mrs. Calby deemed it proper to lead the widow to another room. Aside, she heaped reproaches and contempt on her for even listening with such strange indiscretion to the nonsensical stuff of Miss Fenning.
                  "Your anxiety," said Mrs. Calby, "seemed a design that is quite intolerable, and I am much surprised at your giving way to emotions, considering how you should mourn for your late husband. I shall enforce my advice, and am assured most positively that Mr. Calby would scorn such daring on his part or yours. Dare not to see that man. He is a faithless, dangerous, unprincipled person. Your cousin would indeed be horrified at your receiving his visit, even once. I charge you, in the name of friends whom you love and respect, if you do not yourself, dare not to see that man. It's only a bold intrusion, daring impudence of his unparalleled conceit. If you would believe me, I feel you are preparing for yourself a load of remorse and misery. Remember your position. He will, he is the man to spurn your acknowledgments. I warn you against Colonel Rutland's attentions. None think too well of his honour. A traitor to honour, artful curiosity leads him to seek you. Absolutely refuse to permit his first call. He is treacherous and revengeful, if he ever loved you. He plays deceit to every woman he fancies. Mr. Calby will be angry. I warn you to reflect, if you still persist in this absurd folly, we shall deny your presence here, and denounce your conduct as justly open to censure. Why not remember the high opinion Mr. Calby has felt for you? Do not tarnish your early widowhood by exposing yourself to his daring and flattery. He shall not find your address from this house, I assure you. Your friends and relatives would be indignant at such unbecoming improprieties so soon."
                  Grita paused at such recollections; and, made almost desperate, she was inclined to risk her name and prospects, everything, to meet him face to face. Unless the crime with which he was so unjustly charged was proved, Grita saw no reason for her to deny "the cousin." How little they knew of his ideal love. The holy emotions of his soul were not commonly given; ah, no! to one only. Thus she met that indignant glance with her look of surprise, and determined to receive him if he called; she doubted if he would. She begged Mrs. Calby would dismiss the painful suspicions, and turn her anxiety elsewhere. Our heroine sat a moment longer in silent, mournful reflections.
                  "There was no danger of anything now, beyond cousinship interests."
                  "It is not to be depended on," said the enraged cousin. "I am anxious to obtain your solemn promise that you will decline to see Colonel Rutland. Even as your 'cousin,' it is wrong. Do not be so hardened to indecency. If you do, remember you stake our interest and friendship in you and your affairs."
                  She spoke in a tone of unrestrained vehemence, then retreated, leaving the widow alone. Our heroine rose as suddenly and left. As Mrs. Calby joined her on the stairs, "I shall and will see cousin Granville," she said firmly as she passed on to her lovely home near by.
                  Within a week she had returned from an excursion on business; when the dialogue between Hortense Von Coburg, the loved friend, and herself, was interrupted by a card—"Colonel Rutland." The magic name touched the fountain of her heart, and she thought of the warnings and entreaties, with the denouncement as traitor. But she concealed as well as she could her emotions. A strong interest impelled her to receive the favourite admirer. She felt she deserved his esteem; the innocent and elegant delights entreated their meeting. Hortense smiled a sweet encouragement on the desire of her friend, who hesitated whether to go or stay. She, of course, felt a lively interest in preserving the friendship of the Calbys, as bound by a peculiar debt of obligation to their kindness. She declined, however, seeing him, under existing circumstances—the trial was too painful; and she sent her little cherub-guard to communicate her regrets to Colonel Rutland. The Colonel calmly smiled on her children.
                  "Well enough," said the officer to her splendid boy; "tell your mother, if she refuses to see me, I must force my way, for I shall renew my assault. As the cousin, I am here; and if roused to desperation, I will storm the walls and triumph."
                  Master page, little Crit, tripped up to the widow's pretty chamber and delivered the message.
                  "I will meet him, as in duty bound," replied Grita to Hortense. She arrayed her dress with more speed and less firm steps, with fear and delight. Curiosity became active—she feebly succeeded in recalling her more scattered senses. Thus again, in the fifth month of her widowhood they met. She had stepped across the mysterious threshold bound by the solemn event of five years. Granville stretched out his hand reverently as Grita stood in the parlour before him. He uttered not a word. The chords of her gloomy, expressive voice replied to his profound feeling.
                  "I am very glad to see you, cousin Granville. It is so kind in you to make me this visit."
                  While yet she spoke, a deeper shade of sadness stole over his countenance.
                  "My beautiful cousin, do you think that of me?" A few preliminaries, and they were seated side by side in honour and in grief. He beholds her in affliction—the young, but still beautiful widow, with two sweet children. Her loveliness had gained one attribute, if it had lost another—it commanded less and excited more. The deep crape threw a pale shade over the complexion, and in brilliant, almost dazzling contrast, she had a singular bloom. Granville gazed on her unveiled. As of old, he watched her eyes, more sunken beneath the brow, larger and soft, with that expression of fatigue which accompanies impaired health, or a mental struggle and disquietude. Her coldness was gone. In her widowhood humility prevailed over majestic tranquillity; yet the while bearing a nervous tremour and blush of confusion, which, as Granville looked upon her, lighted up her fair features and quivering lips.
                  Time nor the life of the camps had made change in Granville's face. The fair hair deepened its shade, and a scar disclosed the heroism depicted in his profile. Had he conquered that love, so early blighted? No! love cannot forget. The harmony of their hearts, fidelity of remembrance, made Grita dearer to him than others.
                  "Ever of thee I have been fondly dreaming," said Granville. "Like a bird, the robin of Arthur Seat, you have flown to me, wandering afar; and true as the stars have my steps turned to thee."
                  
                  The cousins had resumed old companionship; but, ah! how soon they looked back on the mirror of the past. Oh, could it have reflected the same freshness of their life's early love! Again, his lore was richer; the contemplative mind of Granville had drunk of the fountain in the melancholy wanderings on the frontier.
                  Reader, we inform you that morning was afternoon before their cousinly conference terminated; and the superior delicacy of her art immediately accepted this courtesy, for morning mingled with evening when he left each day successively. Under the influence of emotion she felt the danger of being overpowered. Granville entered her walls on one occasion to add only fury to his flame. He beheld her as unrivalled before, but with an air of pride, mingled with a warmth of gratitude approaching to more tender feeling; now, her eyes more sparkling, and the blaze of bloom enriching her countenance. She had selected her heaviest robe, with two deep and spacious folds of English crape. Over the dress a shawl of the finest bombazine fell in folds, with a broad, deep band of crape. The charming witchery of the widow's cap gave a piquant finish to her elegant appearance. "'Twixt night and morn" he is all devouring in his gaze, and sat in bewildered admiration. The warrior could not restrain his transport. With a sudden impulse, and manly earnest, he spoke in a tone of firmness and pride.
                  "Angel of my hidden path! Grita! let us look to another contract. After this interval of years, let me hope, ere we part again, to possess myself of your hand and being. Honoured and adored image of the past, which has at the expiration of these five years inspired me with a newness of hope and reality that now, in your comparative freedom, my devoted earnestness and fidelity may give to your sentiments a more tender warmth than they now express. Tell me, beautiful Grita, when will you encourage or accept my plighted faith and constancy anew?" Recovering from her dejection, and deeply grateful for his tender, increasing devotion, she spoke with all the soul of woman in reply to his ill-timed proposal. She plead her total inability to encourage his distinguished honours.
                  "To you, Granville, already my obligations are such as never to be discharged; nor yet do I resign voluntarily the hopes I am forced to decline, owing to the respect due my unhappy position, Such, so much, you will approve as prudence. Another, I hear, has already a fair expectation—your joint application is sufficient to win."
                  "It is false as unfounded! that slanderous motive from Mrs. Calby's foul lips of sarcasm and falsehood. She has raised that report for your ears, in order to benefit her maiden sister. Anything to calumniate our love for each other is a blood-tainted inheritance of our curious and gossiping ing family, believe it." The haughty Grita received this with dignity. Her ample black robe appeared to swell out in yet prouder folds as she heard the shortsighted human policy; for she had in the few days previous made Granville acquainted with the circumstances. Granville saw it was displeasing to her, and he was silent. She very decidedly appealed to hope. With some embarrassment she rather challenged the officer.
                  "Granville," she said, "I tell you now, as side by side we sit together with hands and hearts united, believe me to be true as long as life lasts. If we never meet again till seven years, you will find me indissolubly free from any contract."
                  They rose to promenade the two parlours. Leaning on his arm, she entered the snuggery of her fortunate home, among ladies of social refinement. She richly enjoyed the full appreciation of two lovely sisters—Queb and Mary. Queb, a spicy intellectual creature, on short acquaintance, named the Spanish widow Heroine, from the character most admired of a very wide-famed novel. So the heroine of that dear home—Winterwood—was doubly privileged to enjoy her heroineship with a most celebrated hero. Secluded in the quiet and lovely furnished parlour, Grita and Granville continued to walk, arm and arm. Amidst natural signs of distress and uncertainty, there was an air of profound resignation—a resolution to discharge her duty in every emergency; and it was displayed in the solemn expression of her eyebrow, showing her prepared to govern the agitation which she could not entirely subdue. So well the opposing qualities of timidity and resolution mingled on her cheek, that Grita never looked more fascinating than at that instant.
                  But the privacy of a beloved visit was disturbed by the announcement of sleigh-bells at the door. The most lovely wife of her valued physician, the young and distinguished Mrs. Keraldine, and her handsome brother, came for Mrs. Oustan. She was assisted into the elegantly robed sleigh by Colonel Rutland, indignant beyond madness that she would not first go with him and have her picture taken in her veiled dress. The fine bays plunged over the deep, smooth snow, and the hundred chimes of bells were far away from the officer, soon to reunite with his love. The day after came, bringing the officer to her post. The valourous kinsman with patience repeated his fond looks upon her, as a being of-a higher sphere, from whose doom he was to receive happiness or misery, life or death. The visit of sympathy, the cousin's call, was done. He grasped eagerly each hour of converse with his love.
                  "Tell me then, my old love, after the shadowy gloom has passed away and your natural buoyancy comes back when I am gone, tell me one word of encouragement from your lips now. I am yours forever. Let me leave with you as my bride. If you will permit, I will wait the length of my furlough to gain my wish. Tell me, my beloved Grita, will you say that you will ever love me, or give me hope to believe you can love me one half, one third as much as I have loved, and do love you?"
                  "Ah! we shall meet in the old place," said Grita; "there I will proclaim all that I might, all you know not, how much more than yours."
                  "Ah! child-love, how cold, indifferent! Do you demand me to resign hope again? the dearest which my bosom ever entertained since the time my blood warmed it from the cradle of our love? In Richmond we shall meet then. You promise? be mine! God grant it may be so—mine forever! Arthur Seat must be your home; its large chambers must be occupied by you; your children can play on my grounds. Be sure to meet me there. Ellen has awaited you as her mistress for three times five years. I am forced to leave this city of the North. It has no charm, as you deny me another such visit as we wish; but I will see you there. And now, make me open promise, that which is within your power. Dear Grita, will you write me? I have your little treasure of a note sent to my hotel. It is here in my breast-pocket; but write me when I am gone. Perhaps I may be off on the border before you and I meet in our birth-place. I shall make an official visit in a hurry to Fort Leavenworth. Write me to that address, and in May revisit Richmond."
                  Her heart-strings vibrated to the touching wish.
                  "I will, indeed I will," was her response. The exquisite degree of happiness was much to encourage hope to expectation. They parted. The chord which seemed so strained was destined for its purpose. Are not light pledges sometimes thought unworthy to be redeemed?
                  In the spring-time Mrs. Oustan, with softer feelings than ever before in long years, returned to the South. In the gloom of widowhood she mingled her first grief with her family since Mr. Oustan died. There among them she never heard an allusion to his name or circumstances. Nor did she permit it: they had been callous to his sufferings. Her gratitude in early years lingered affectionately and respectfully over his worth and memory. Among the family, she resentfully steeled herself to icy feelings. There was a virulent atmosphere she could not breathe. The night of her arrival, in April, was observed at her mother's house as a gloomy meeting. In an hour she called her youngest brother to her room, and in confidence desired him to go at once and leave her card for Colonel Rutland, if he had come to Acropolis Hotel. The brother returned. Arthur Seat was closed, and his brother, Mr. Rutland, was at Hotel Acropolis. He informed young Marlborough that his brother, Colonel Rutland, had left that very morning for his post at Leaven-worth. In this midnight of distress she was hardly to be expected to be satisfied to see the only brother of Granville. It was sadly agreeable to enjoy the society of so polished a gentleman, but the likeness sickened her. He told her, in curious admiration, he came to see the only woman his dear brother ever loved. It placed them on a nearer kinship, and Grita's brain felt scorched. Her limbs were utterly powerless. Every word seemed to write itself in letters of fire on her heart. She could almost have screamed with agony. Her visit to Richmond was considerably shorter than they all expected.
                  Early in May the widow, her lovely children, and servant, retraced their way, to spend the summer months at the loved and enchanted lake. There she appears to us, reader, as "the widow of the lake." A gentleman of fair complexion, very much like Colonel Rutland, followed her steps to the hills of Putnam, and proudly devoted his flattering attentions. The light-haired friend had been long a resident of Europe, and a guest at courts—a person of elegant suavity. He was a pathetic friend, and fancied the misanthropic Spanish widow. Under the clustering foliage of the lake shore, a seat is pointed out as the widow's rock. The rustic admirers and friends were silently enjoying the shadowy woodlands and cornfields basking in the sun. A lone cupola rose from the opposite shore, filling in the lovely landscape around. The moss-foliaged isle rested like a great round basket mounded with leaves and anchored in the lake. The Arcadian reveries were stolen upon by sailless crafts. Fair hands as oarsmen rowed along the strand. Around the isle of leaves came the lady of the lake, singing to the stroke of their oars, 
                        "Row, sisters, row, the stream runs fast."
                     
                  
                  In all this the widow was unroused. Her friend smiled. "Why so sad, my friend? What a picture of despondency! Come, my young friend, this is terrible. Be cheerful; you have no right to shut yourself in a shell, like the pearl of great price, to be hunted for—gently forced to reflect on society the brilliancy of your endowments," said Mr. Van Schwarzenberg. "Ah! yes, your friends, Mrs. Oustan, must claim such manners, attractions, accomplishments as you possess. But who can't see that you are a singular being! I see you have Southern points of natural spirit, fraught with an indescribable 'all your own way.' You only shed your smiles where you choose to favour, preferring independent solitude. A fair daughter of Eve—no common nature yours."
                  Our heroine replied, "My good friend, there is yet no interpreter to my despondency."
                  
                  She then grappled with thought—was entranced with wonder—sickened over his long delay. In the month following the officer's departure to Leaven-worth, according to his address given her, she had written her letter; yet no tidings from him she loved more than well.
                  "Mr. Van Schwarzenberg, my happiness rests on army moves; can you get me the Blue Book? 'That memory'—ay, it preys on me like a slow fever. Nothing amuses, nothing beyond my jewels, as you kindly call your pets, Crit and Siva; nothing beyond them and my duty."
                  About a mile from the hotel was the widow's rock. These friends were constantly attentive to strolls, and the fancied resort of all that was lovely at Katlin concentrated there. That afternoon passed in the pleasant elegance of his society, and the harmless mirth of her beloved friends and watchers, at the hotel. Still, under the eminent charm of refined society, and the special guidance of the Calbys and the dear Von Coburgs, the widow's conduct was considered blameless. From the vassal waves of Katlin a letter comes. All hail the sovereign signal! "Thou hope, orator of silent awe!" The long-watched-for sheet from Granville is in her hands, given by the sweet consoler, Madame Von Coburg, whose husband had received it from a gentleman, and brought it from the city across the lake, in his boat, La Favorite. Her own tiny atom of communication, enveloped to his address, had reached him after journeying fifteen hundred miles. Here is his reply, traced by his hand, drawn from his soul—the first tie that ever bound with its seal their distance. Pages of sweet memories, lined with recollections of the ring he wore in Mexico, haunted him yet! Her "boy" he liked because he was so like his lovely mother. "Encourage him to call me uncle," were his words; "the girl, Grita, I do not think half as pretty as your daughter ought to have been"—and so on—the door reopened, lightly touched. The delight was intoxicating, but years of absence—could she hope for the return of such pleasure once again? Ah! how long! Responsive pages were speedily despatched to the prairies.
                  The widow returned to another winter residence, below Winterwood, and on a street of fashionable notoriety she found new friends. All are left by the cosmopolite as she makes off in a new direction, where the ocean-waves beat hoarsely against the cliffs of ——. In June she had a dream, so startling, so strangely life-like, that no Abercrombie could resolve greater science of the mind's truth, transcribed from her soul. Dead ones were there, and all around her, when Grita dreamed of the officer, on the mountain height, sleeping by a dim fire, and had listened to old ocean roar. From that far-off land a sigh was borne, and at the dead hour of night all was hushed, save the sentinel on his lonely round chanting "All's well." No sound broke the deep silence save ever and anon the howl of some solitary wolf, or other wild animal. Granville sat alone in his tent. All was hushed to sleep. His two faithful dogs lay sleeping at his feet. "Grita," the faithful pet, lay nearest. These were his words: "Loved one, I thought of thee! thinkest thou of me?" echo said, "Yes." A voice still asked, "Fair one, I dreamed of thee! dreamedst thou of me?" and heart answered, "Ever." It told this back far o'er the Western Sea, and in that life-like, startling dream he clasped her as his wife. They met as never before. The dead ones departed seemed around in the presence of the dream, not even in spectral forms, but breathing the sepulchral air. These all were gathered in a grand vestibule. Arched halls, telling of imposing grandeur, appeared resplendent. Silver chandeliers stretched forth their arms with lights over the gallery. The dead ones departed looked on with a supernatural smile, saying in one voice, "God made you for his wife. It will be so!" they said softly, "It will be so." In that hall, adorned so beautifully, she parted from the guardian's care, with his benediction and caress. At once free, she flew aside into a large conservatory. There she saw her warrior-husband leaning against a gold-rimmed fountain. He approached majestically to receive her. Instantly they were locked in each other's arms. Silent, motionless they stood beside the same fountain, the water like a silver surface. Above them hung a mantle, star-spangled, like to his banner, 'neath the green leaves of branching trees, covered some with fruit and some with flowers. Vases in profuse arrangement were ornamenting the circular path on which they stood. Pledged vows whispered, "Forever, forever, holy, forever and forever one." Not a word broke the silence till they came towards the imposing gallery. Dulcet sounds, as they vanished, faintly echoed, "Forever one—immortal love. It will be so." The dead ones had eparted. It lingered on her ears in the hour of her soul's transmigration, in louder accents, "It will be so." Reader, believe this an allegory of her life, as so many pages and sentences appear to my eye—prophetical of some great event.
                  Through the gay summer, at the extremely fashionable watering place, our heroine was an attraction shining from her own light, unless preferring independent solitude. The matter of her retirement was much canvassed in the minute conversations of those days and evenings. She was the fastidious woman—very rare kind of young widow; to her peculiar style was applied the term of author, at least a writer of MSS. This fabulous tale spread with her belleship reigning louder; yet from her quiet retirement, with complacent smile, she trusted to her graces, and awaited with inwrought delight the coin-stamp of her dream.
                  A dreadful malaria sprang up in the marshes of the fair island. Our friend and her children were forced to leave, with her servant, for the lake. The first night of her arrival she received the dear watched-for letter, under the very identical roof, again in the broad drawing-room at Hotel Hemlock.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 "GRITA DEAR:
                              
                              "Still in reveries of by-gone years, I turn to your loved image of the past, ever with me in these far-distant regions. It clings to me in the tented field, in the excitement of war; it prevails over my rest. How I loved you, you well know. The shadow of one beloved hangs over me. Still my heart is a blank. It is but a dream, a memory. It is the shadow of one who 'was' beloved. That impression I shall carry to my grave. Now there is a shadow over my path. But why do you complain, you will say, who have but few ties to call you away from the path you have chosen? 'Tis true, too true, and pity 'tis too true. There are few ties that bind me to any one spot, although there are memories that fondly cling and cluster nearest my heart—memories of the past, that carry me back to former years; that breathe of 'joys long dead.' Little matters it with me whether I dwell among savages or civilized men; life is pretty much the same everywhere. Were I to see you again, how vividly would the past be brought to mind, when I saw you in the gay metropolis! Although clad in the habiliments of mourning, you appeared to me still the same lovely girl whom I had seen in Petersburg, afterwards in Richmond, years before. But there was a sadness at my heart I shall never explain, and although I was glad to see you, it was mingled with feelings anything but pleasant. Alas! has that heart any secret now, any tenderness, any affection? No; it is a wreck, desolate; a waste of feeling unemployed; an aching, dreary void. No image as of you now holds possession there and reigns supreme; no loved one claims a part of what once belonged to one. Dear image of the past! I turn to thee. That one still—her image haunts me, is ever with me.
                              "Ah! Grita, now I go to Oregon, to fight the Indians. Recently, in a battle with our troops, two officers and several men were killed. Such is my path. The veil that conceals from view the events of the future is woven by the hand of mercy. I can testify to the truth of that. May that merciful hand weave its web, and still keep from us, from me, the dread events of the future. But why should I shudder at imaginary evils? I have little to lose, no happiness to gain. 'Love' is but a name, 'happiness' a dream. What is the future in this life? Why should we fear to have it revealed? But there is a future to which we are all tending. Who shall unfold its mysteries? Only He who hath made us what we are. What time for reflection has one, away out in the desert, situated as I am? We can look back upon the past with a sigh, and toward the future with indifference. The retrospect is dark and sad; the prospect—what may that be? 'Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.'
                              
                              "But I am indulging in a strain little suited to a gay young widow, engaged to be 'married.' To her at least the future promises 'more' attractions. She indulges in dreams of future bliss; may she realize them! May they not prove dreams alone, but may she enjoy substantial happiness. May her heart, full of affection, meet only with love from one tender and true as her own. May no storm cloud the brightness of her future; no coldness or indifference chill the warm current of her affection. Happy in her children, happy in her love, thrice happy may she be in the anticipation of that 'future' where happiness is eternal.
                              "Adieu! write me at Benicia. Write me your plans—how the children are; and believe me truly your devoted cousin,
                              
                                 "GRANVILLE."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  Friend reader, we are into her jewel-case of letters. Let us feast on the pathos of the most solemn affection that could or can live between souls coexisting, to enjoy eternal happiness in the "house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens." This, too, is revised by the breezes of Katlin's water. At her lake-window she unfolds the newly-arrived treasure, not touched by the finger of the Calby's polluted opinion; she gets them through the strong bars of true friendship, her deeply-prized friends the Faxwells. The noble lines are spread before our reader fresh from his pen.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 "CAMPS ON BLACK FORK, En route to Salt Lake City, July 5th.
                                 "MY DEAR GRITA:
                              
                              "Your kind, affectionate note reached me amid the deep recesses of the Rocky mountains, and from their dark shadows I will attempt to write you. Your letter has been a long while on the way, but it is not the less acceptable on that account. Just after I received it, I was attacked with pneumonia, and was quite ill for some time. After I recovered we were under orders for Salt Lake; and so long was I in preparing for that long, dreary march, that I have but little time to write. My dear Grita will pardon this seeming neglect, for she must feel assured I never can forget her. From time past, 
                                    
                                       "'Solitary memory takes her flight,
                                       And o'er the past she broods with miser care;
                                       Time but the impression deeper makes,
                                       As streams their channels deeper wear.'
                                    
                                 
                              
                              "I am getting sentimental. The idea of thinking of female loveliness in such a dreary waste as this! We are arriving near Salt Lake, having passed over the desert, with rough fare. Frequently we had no water, and what we had, and were compelled to drink, was brackish and disagreeable in the extreme. We met Indians, but they were friendly and gave us no trouble. I have been travelling since the seventh of May. For the last few weeks we have been wending our way among mountains. The days are hot, but the nights very cool, when three or four blankets are very comfortable. The valleys between the mountains tains are very pretty; but in general, after entering the mountains it is more or less a wilderness.
                              "The troops have entered Salt Lake City: the difficulty, it is supposed, will be amicably settled.
                              "When you write, let me know when that wedding of yours is to come off. It is what I had expected for some time before you wrote and informed me. Let me know more about it. I still feel the deepest interest in you, and trust you may marry a man who loves you as you ought to be loved. As to your looking old or losing your beauty, I know better. I feel now I shall never love again; the time is past; my heart is lone and sad.
                              "My love to your fine boy. Tell him his uncle Granville will always love him very much for his dear mother's sake. And your pet, the girl, is growing more like her sweet mother, no doubt. I shall love her very much if such is the case. Write me soon, and think of your true cousin,
                              
                                 "GRANVILLE."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  Our heroine is fortunately located at Winter-wood for the season of '58. In September she arrived from the lake. Consequences begin to entangle. The difficult question is asked again of our heroine, "Will any man ever understand you?" From the broken engagement, as report and evidence announced, with the chivalrous guardian, the widow has been thrown into a marvellous position. It is done! Justice and Truth, eminently, consistently with the rules of her life, come unspeakably to her advantage, in the settlement ment of the late solemn, death-sworn compact. By no wrong has she severed the covenant friendship between the noblest of guardians, but by honour due her first love. The chivalrous guardian and herself are severed, as solemnly severed as the death-warrant could make them. Mr. Calby shows forth his noblest powers and assistance, as by a rare law of her widow's rights she has two trustees to manage her. The matter is done. Across the prairie speeds a missive to the one she loved best. His letter comes with this fonder feeling still alive. How she trembled, nay, died almost at heart, fearing he might not hear in time. She had gratitude, gratitude even deeper than for James Oustan, towards Lorenzo, his dearest brother by long adopted friendship; but her admiration, respect, gratitude, and esteem had cast the die to the higher compliment the chivalrous guardian had proffered to her keeping. It was done; Granville's image, fresh from its birth-mould, is best revived, and she is all his own. Her gratitude was to one who would stake his life for her, and showered blessings on every wish.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "My dear Grita," he writes, "Ah! Grita, will ever man read you aright? 'He is still your very dear friend.' When you become engaged again, let me know: I shall ever pray for your happiness. In the interval since I last heard from you I thought you had married, and of course had forgotten me, as you did before. I have few to love, and few to be loved by. How I wish I had stolen that miniature of yours I saw at your mother's. I wish I had it here to look at in my solitary hours. It would afford me some pleasure from the tedium of this long, dreary march. I am writing in my tent, late at night. All is hushed but the tread of the sentinel on his beat, as he walks his rounds. In the stillness of this night I think of thee, and from this solitude, from this far-distant land, I waft you my blessing, and breathe a prayer for your happiness.
                              "But, Grita, my dear Grita, send me your miniature by all means. I shall gaze on it as I once gazed on you, and shall prize it above all price. I shall kiss it and imagine it bears a fragrance to my lips; that its dark lustrous eyes look on me in sadness, if not in love. Send it to me; let me keep it next my heart. I once through the battle-storm wore a ring given me by you when a young thing, and raised that hand in the hour of victory.
                              "Adieu, good night! My dear, sweet Grita, good night! Write soon, and send your picture. Ever devotedly,
                              
                                 "GRANVILLE."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  In that fashionable street and fashionable boarding-house Mrs. Oustan had lived this winter (as we have said). Another and another had drifted into her silken mesh. The rival brothers were her kind and most true friends. The foremost impression that roused her admiration for both was their exquisite regard for honour. They seemed always to reflect on such intentions. The brothers were both men of profound dignity, highly distinguished cultivation, polished courtesy to ladies and dignity to men. The youngest had met the widow of the lake at Hemlock Hotel, in her earliest days of gloom. He saw her smile, at the breakfast-table. From that early hour he watched to admire her elegant dignity in her delicate position. Years had passed; by rare occurrence they lived again in the same house. He became devoted; his friendship wore into serious attachment. She had, through these years of intimacy as household guest, acknowledged her conception of his estimate and his compliment, but begged him to remain simply the brother-friend. "Let our friendship, so very striking, remain—the obligation not beyond liquidation—harmless and true."
                  Not so; for Dolph Nannering was hourly her slave. His time, unoccupied by his high office and science, was quite her own. He was now a day and evening visitor at Winterwood. The six months had grown less when he came in to congratulate her on the release. He saw Ymataca Oustan a lighter-hearted woman, but restless and unhappy. "I rejoice to know you are free, "he said.
                  "Alas!" she replied, "sad, my life very sad may be."
                  "What!" he ejaculated, "my signal to fall after this constant waiting? Not so! Are you another's?" he asked.
                  
                  "A profound secret, Mr. Nannering, has taken root, never to be removed. I regret to lose your delicate friendship, but, seriously, we can only be friends."
                  Like others, Dolph Nannering misconstrued her nature, for she had tried every way to prevent this. He watched her a moment, then took her hand.
                  "Let me tell you this, cousin Ymataca" (in that near tie he persisted, because he was a Southerner); "let me tell you I have suffered now nearly three years, patiently, a torture."
                  With that information he rose from his seat, and, advancing a few steps, stood before her. His great, soft, beautiful hazel eye searched her coldly as he spoke.
                  "You are as heartless as stone; a marble statue, without feeling, ha! ha!"
                  "Sir," she replied, "I have spoken from no selfish feeling or motive. I thought to secure your confidence as friend only; since I find, in justice to honour, it is due you to make the painful confession."
                  Dropping his clenched fist on the piano while he spoke, he turned to the widow as she stood near the instrument.
                  "I do, do blame you as cold and unfeeling; but you have been irresistibly lovely. No man could have steeled his heart against your rich peculiarities. I blame you, dearly as I love you. I almost hate you now! Would that I had never seen you! Look at yourself in that great mirror. It will reflect your lovely form. Look with my eyes. See the haughty beauty I love. I do and—I cannot help it—will love you still," his eyes fixed on her face, averted. "You glory in your triumphs. I have known you to be an educated flirt. Thy chains are broken!"
                  His altered tone and manner, so excited, aroused the widow. So conscious clear was she of her way, that she thought he was not in earnest after all. Her castle was not easily won by crusade. Instantly she found to her regret a misinterpretation, and smiled with arch coldness as he rose and placed himself immediately opposite to her, with mute and withering scorn. His countenance to her had never before assumed such an aspect.
                  "Yes," he said, vehemently shaking his fist, "I repeat, I pray God that He may curse you! I pray He will never give you a blessing! I call down on you Heaven's vengeance, hoping sincerely that 'the one' you love will forever scorn you and your love, as you have done mine."
                  She sickened, faint, at the demon in the delicate and refined form and manners of man, as he held the door-knob, and vowed that she should hear what he had to say of her heart-cold treatment.
                  "Will you leave my presence, Sir, and never resume my acquaintance again! I think you selfish ish, coarsely inelegant to the very woman you profess to love and ask to become your wife. You deserve my pity and contempt; you have both."
                  He raved the more fiercely. She really was alarmed at his speedy revenge. His foul curse was again repeated, as she ran her fingers over the piano. His anathema was a curse causeless, never to be answered, for conscience only could make her a coward. A calm silence prevailed for a moment, then young Nannering slid from her guileless presence. That same night, long after the whole house was hushed, a light might have been seen burning in one of the upper windows at Winterwood House. She sat by her table, rocking to and fro in the little rocking-chair, which had long been one of her fancies, with kind and loving Queb watching the soothing motions. Queb often came in to quiet her broken and exhausted spirit. That very night her proud nature writhed. She seemed to catch the tone of that mocking laugh and its idle, wicked jest, hateful pity, humiliation of hopes, unrequited love! Ymataca marvelled almost sorrowfully over his steadfast patience. The warm feeling of her nature united her sentiment to him as a brother, and a peaceful influence pervaded their long association. She deciphered not without pleasure the brave, true heart of him she had trusted as friend. Even now she felt mortified when she remembered his angrily-knitted brow, for he was too polite, too proud to betray the harshness of such grave reproof. She saw her lamp grow pale, and in a few words restored her sleepy senses for repose.
                  The next evening the good and truly noble gentleman called on the widow to offer healing words. She permitted it, but allowed him to pass unnoticed. Again and again he came, as he seriously felt he must force the apology which she would never accept. Yet his favour, never a pecuniary trifle, was distinctly regarded with obligations never to be forgotten. She felt secure of his strong admiration, secure of his respect. Thoughtless words are forgiven. Perhaps he has not forgotten, "not even a blessing." 
                        
                           "Her sweet smile held all minds in thrall;
                           Her greatest spell was ever,
                           That heart was in, and over all;
                           She could be worldling never."
                        
                     
                  
                  In this era of Granville's and Grita's history, each volume, each page, will be alive with memories of that strong love which had been the very essence of her life, from which every development of her intellect, every phase of her character had sprung, by the very influence of her unworldly nature—simple. Yet perhaps there was more in her theory than many imagined. It is the faithful, the holy-hearted ones, who walk calmly and safely on the troubled waters of life. Grita set out for the path on which her destiny decided. Against its influence her spirit now struggled. Try another visit in your family, said the many. And, too, the change she felt had come; the path crossed and recrossed by the shadow of that terrible love. She sought to analyze her sensations, but sank back trembling in every limb. All her wrath, all her sternness, all her pride, were gathered up in one word—no! But the imperious eyes, which had lighted up with all the fires of youth, implacably asked the dreaded question, the old strain, strife between duty and love. "I never deceived him from the first." Grita revived at old things passing away, before the coming of that wild and delicious, terrible love, with reproach. "Therefore," said Ymataca Oustan, "I yet ever shall love him; the chivalrous guardian I respected and esteemed, but would not have been willing to marry him." From tongue to tongue had passed the countersign, heavenly-voiced gratitude, the strong beating in its sisterly exultation; and solemnly was she bound to the guardian, infused by his own beautiful symphonies of boundless affection. She felt pride and confidence in his glowing character, unspotted by a small thought. The strange theory of their exigencies appeared bound to the deathless bound. She felt no abusing sin of indifference to him whom she loved, loved affectionately, in acknowledgement for boundless devotions of a noble, liberal heart, intentions and chivalrous guardianship. Universally he was greeted in the best society as a man distinguished above others and worthily esteemed. Her heart was yet pure enough to be fearless; and now that these outpourings of gratitude were no longer chained, she deemed it another sacrifice, as God's power averted the second debt of imperious fires. That searing iron had been shattered as easily as it had been forged, leaving on the page of recollection his unbounded respect for woman's influence from boyhood to manhood, from manhood to maturity. She was the only woman he classed alone, above, superior, from her height. Under a veil of purity she should become incense to passers-by. How often he would ejaculate his deference. "In you," he would say, "I have seen no equal, except in Him you so truly love. Under your shrine, my loved Ymataca, you should stand as the being I worthily, holily, faithfully loved; as the best I ever saw. From the man of the world and worldly man, preserve my words."

                              "Thank you, dearest Grita, for your two sweet letters, one of which reached me on the march hither, the other at this place. We arrived here on the 15th inst., after a long, dreary march of two thousand one hundred miles over desert, and prairie, and mountains, through sand, through deep snows, and driving storms. Thy image has has ever been present to me, whether scaling the dizzy heights of the Sierra Nevada, or plunging through the deep sands of the desert on the lone and silent prairie. In the stillness of the night, broken only by the cry of the sentinel as he walked his lonely round, sweet memories of thee haunted my rest; and your letters, sweet messengers, how I hail their arrival! They breathe sentiments of kindness and sweetness. They revive old feelings which have long slumbered in my inner heart. Yes, I did expect to hear of your marriage; and when I took leave of you, it was to see you, as of old, the wife of another. Never more on me the freshness of the heart shall fall like dew. No; seared in heart, and lone and blighted, I must plod along through the gloomy vale, and only hope that through the vista of the future there may be a ray of hope to gild the gloom. But you, young, lovely, and loved by one whom you love, why can you not be happy? what is your insurmountable obstacle? Yes, tell me—you say you will—everything concerning the past which you have not told me. Pray, let me know everything concerning yourself and myself. I am not so vain as to suppose that it has reference to me, but let me know what it is. Dearest Grita, would I were near thee! but when that will be is most uncertain. I am again in civilization, on the Pacific Ocean; you are far, too far away. Yet why dream of thee? why associate you with the future? You were with me in the past—thy love, thy loveliness was not for me. I left you; you were soon a bride. I saw you again, a happy wife, a mother; and again, a widow, with two sweet cherubs to smile away your sorrow. As blooming girl, as wife, as mother, as widow, to me ever lovely you have appeared. But, alas! as all of these, you have loved and still love another. But I pray for your happiness. Ever true,
                              
                                 "GRANVILLE."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  Each steamer that came from the Isthmus brought tidings of her lover. Our hero was hunting among the mountains of the Pacific coast-range, and writes of the day as follows:
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 "DEAREST GRITA:
                              
                              "I have recently been some fifty miles in the wilds of California, and grand, very grand is its scenery. Its frowning heights and tops are covered with snow, and at its base a rushing torrent roars as it dashes by. I have footed it nearly a month, as the journey was a difficult one. Transportation was carried on pack-mules. I took with me twenty men, whom I left in a valley to guard against Indians, returning with only three. I saw a man approaching the express, who told me he had letters. On opening them, I found your picture, the beautiful miniature, in its mourning dress, like that I saw at your mother's. I sat down on the mountain-top, and gazed with an ecstasy of delight on those features. I read your sweet letter, and gazed again on your sweet face. I read your letter again and again. I put your picture in the left breast-pocket of my shooting jacket, next to my heart, and carried it there the remainder of the trip."
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  From the fort he writes:
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 "MY DEAREST GRITA:
                              
                              "Alone in my tent. The camp is hushed to sleep. I am watching your sweet likeness. Your image lies on the table before me. Those dark eyes, those speaking lips, how sweetly they seem to smile—or is it imagination? Those dark eyes are as bright as of old, when I used fondly to gaze on their dark lustre; those lips look as dewy. It is Grita! There she is, in all her loveliness. What is that beautiful picture doing out here in these wilds, far from the haunts of men? It is here for me to gaze on in the morning when I rise, and at night when I retire. It brings the joys of other days back most vividly to memory. I thank you, dear Grita, for your likeness; it is a good one, but it does not do you justice. The features are perfect, but the colour of the cheeks is wanting; and your sweet smile,that I can't see until I see you. Would I were near thee! but far away in the wilds of California, around me rise frowning heights, and near me my dog, the beauty, Grita, is sleeping; and you adorn the little table in my tent, which has not even a cover. But I must fix up a little; I must put a blanket on the table. I must fix up, since your likeness has come. Do you love me? Ah! can I believe—I will imagine that you are somewhere near. Would it were so! Would that I were near thee, to hear sweet words from those eloquent, breathing lips! I shall kiss the picture; I have kissed it fifty times; but here in this cold, uncultivated region, kissing glass is a cold business; my lips are met by an icy coldness. Will such be the case when I meet you, Grita? I trust not. You have been cold and cruel. Do you love me? You say, had I met you later you would have listened to what I had to say; but were you not then listening to vows from 'that man?' Ah! Grita, woman's heart is a strange piece of God's handiwork. It has been my lot to meet you in love with and engaged to somebody else, once particularly. How unfeeling to me! but you say it was unintentional, the result of circumstances. Well, I believe you. When I had left for the west, your letter came, announcing the 'agreeable' intelligence that you were engaged; and oh! how happy I thought you were! Well, you say you were miserable at the idea. Be candid—no evasions; did you love me when last I saw you? if so, you acted most strangely.
                              "I cannot say when we shall meet again. I know not what may happen to me, nor do I care much. Life, the better part of life with me, is gone. It has been rather a sad one at best. The past is full of sad memories, the future is not very bright; few rays of hope gild the gloom. But if I can find excitement enough to kill all thoughts of the past, I shall feel a sort of happiness. What is society? what are its charms? I am distrustful of everything like true affection. I have never found it when I have most earnestly sought it. No, I found coldness, indifference. Friendship's but a name, 
                                    
                                       "'Love is still an emptier sound,
                                       The modern fair one's jest.'
                                    
                                 
                              
                              
                              "When you wrote me, Grita, that you were to be married, I thought, what! so soon? She scarcely gave me a look or word of encouragement. At first she refused to come down to see me as a friend and cousin, who had known her from childhood; and now she writes me about marrying another man. I may be, I hope I am, mistaken in supposing that you loved him. Smiles are hypocrisy, words deceit.
                              "Ah! I am growing misanthropic; you will forgive me. Your letters are fascinating. I pore over them as I would over the most fascinating novel; they dispel my gloom. How can I believe that you ever loved me! I cannot—impossible. You did not when last I saw you, or how could you have resisted and rejected my proffers? How I loved you, you well knew. Let the past, if possible, be forgotten. When I see you I shall be more fully able to explain my thoughts and feelings. I am now travelling in the snowy mountains on pack-mules, almost unable to get along amidst precipices and awful rugged chasms. With all, with everything, you are with me; I constantly think of you. Think of me, and write; write affectionate, long letters, if your feelings really prompt them; write often to your devoted, but unhappy cousin,
                              
                                 "GRANVILLE."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  We pass on to the expiration of months, and find all arrangements are made for the journey to the South in May. Our heroine sat alone in her chamber, blessed with kind care of loved ones. Alas! it is true. I must go—going where she should never have gone, but for the straight curve haunting its onward tread. It seemed as if genii were writing on her own heart a gleam of lurid brightness. The world itself did not look as it had done one day before. She remembered, too, old friends and the family. How would they meet after such an absence, almost estrangement and silence? She shrank visibly between the periods; yet she desired to make them feel what she had felt, by Truth and Justice. There, even there, by love-reviving fires, she mingled no darkening cloud of vengeance. Grita saw "it was a solemn thing to have travelled thus far with Granville on the universal road." She murmured these words to herself as she retired to her chamber at Winterwood, in a melancholy dreaminess, standing as it were on the brink of what seemed a crisis in life's history. At that time four years appeared a long absence. Four years from him, then roving on the Pacific coast! It seemed to imply the onward tread to high numbers on the milestone, marking their hidden path. "I will," she said, soliloquizing, "read his heart, face to face. I shall see him—I shall see him," she whispered hoarsely. On the table at her side lay the old worn-out desk, or green trunk with gilt nails, which she had when a child, in which her treasures were kept. She opened it—looked over his first and last letter, in which he tells her to send for his miniature at Arthur Seat—a likeness of him when first they met—the almost boyish cheek of youth. He writes:
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "There is not an artist in the wilderness, and I am too ugly for a picture. Yours is very good, but it is too pale. I wear it next my heart. I hope we may meet again, dear Grita, I do. Can you tell me why Mrs. Calby was so very anxious that I should not see you? She told me that you would not see me. I did not believe it, and made the attempt, defying your walls. What was her motive for preventing my seeing you? May-be she took compassion on me, and did not wish me to be again victimized! It was funny, any way; I don't understand it. If you do, please explain; it is beyond my dull comprehension; I recollect now, she appeared astonished and somewhat shocked when I informed her that I had, contrary to her injunctions, called on you. I had no idea that she really did not wish me to see you. Perhaps she thought people might talk about it. Well, you women are strange fish! I don't understand you—never did—never will; no man ever did. What a pity that women are necessary to our happiness! Fudge! they are not. I am happy without them—happy after a fashion; free from care, painfully free from all care, with nobody to care for me. (But I don't like that.) Ah! Grita, Grita! the past, the bitter past. I know not why it is, but I do feel sad at heart. Yes! I know, too—why, I shall never explain. I feel what is to hang like a funeral pall over my future life. But we must meet the future, we must brave it.
                              "In these vast solitudes, I commune with self, with nothing to distract my thoughts. The past rises before me, and many things I would wish to erase from memory's tablet haunt me from day to day. Where shall I find a port or haven of rest? Not on this earth, I fear. Is it to be found hereafter? I sigh for rest, but not to feel'tis rest. I want excitement, excitement; not the excitement of the cup or the gaming-table—I loathe both—but any healthful excitement of the mind or feeling that can make me forget. That is what I crave—forgetfulness. Few who know me would suppose that I ever had a sad moment—a face wreathed in smiles, a heart lacerated with griefs.
                              
                                 "Devotedly, affectionately yours,
                                 "GRANVILLE.
                              
                           
                           
                              "P. S. Grita, my mind misgives some consequence, yet hanging in the stars, will bitterly begin its fearful date from this night's revels."
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  Grita had paused, oppressed with many mingled feelings in her slow perusal. As she reached the P. S., her countenance changed, grew pale and darkened. Her soul flew to him, yearning to cling to his bosom, to speak aloud with him; nay, with quivering lips to smile at the future—even if they had set their faces bravely and patiently to the fates.
                  This, reader, is an illustrative exordium, which may be considered as heralding the advent of a new epoch. The cloud-shadows appeared to melt away; and day after day, night after night, her friends attended with their affection and care. She was indeed loath to part from the warmest, closest friendship she had ever known, enriched with all the costliness of human greatness. In her calm retirement regrets had folded up their long silken tresses, and deeper and stronger yearned the heart full of reverent love to the beloved great friends. And beside her, to the last hour of parting, stood the Faxwells, Von Coburgs, and the Rutlands, her beloved and dearly prized friends.
                  From the Faxwells' door our heroine, with Crit, drove to the steamer, accompanied by her dearest intimate, Mrs. Faxwell, and her two little fairies. The noble Von Coburgs had joined the travelling party, to bring back the son's pet love, Grita's little daughter. Their kindness had increased grateful love without bounds. The adopted pet had been guest at their elegant residence for weeks previous to this. "Tuyve," as her baby-prattle called young Von Coburg, gave up with unfeigned devotion the household pet, parting sadly, expressive of feeling much, from the tiny lady-love. With a fervent kiss, he clasped on her fat, snowy neck the most exquisite little chain and cross of gold, minutely chased, with a beseeching tone that he should have her again before many months. He should visit the South and return with Siva, their household pet. Another kiss, a hearty shake of her mother's hand, and the distinguished young militia officer of the Seventh Regiment was gone. On Miss Siva's tiny finger was placed the tiniest ring, as a token of warm friendship of her mother's elegant friend, the Professor, a man of unrivalled talents and very agreeable. He came to say bon voyage! The day was calm, but sad. Friends in numbers gathered around the young window and her two little ones. Mr. Faxwell was almost too late to say adieu. He bowed with an easy grace, smiling benevolently. Heartily he grasped the hand of his fair friend, and expressed his sympathy and good wishes. He glanced at her with a pleasurable meaning, and held before her the last steamer's expected communication, direct from the mail-bag via Aspinwall. Grita started in joyful surprise. Touched by the harmony of the moment, his soul unites, by his very hand, the last link to bind North and South. "What strange coincidents I meet with!" were her words. Having gained the prize, she coquettishly glanced at Granville's large and careless handwriting, with a look of grateful gratification at the gift from Mr. Faxwell's hand. Mrs. Faxwell, the dear intimate, said, "I must know the news." With a word of excuse, she left the circle of friends a moment for her state-room. Mrs. Faxwell, the dear, loving, and beloved friend, passed out from the bevy to where our heroine was, and read a line or two, leaning over Grita's shoulder—a hurried glance. The first bell rang immediately. They returned to the ladies' upper saloon. In another half hour the iron tongue called, "All ashore!" Their customary courtesy loosed hands, and the tie that had cabled a long friendship was slipped, fastened on shore to meet again. The clasp—the farewell—and from each other they had parted. With tearful eyes she looked from the quarter-deck, leaning forward with her face on her hands, watching to the last. They had all gone, as she let fall the signal of adieu. Their waving of hand-kerchiefs ceased. The great ship steamed out on the bay. Alone, the lady in gray sat under the eaves of the wheel-house. Her little ones had been playing about the deck with their friends, the fairies, and now were tired, and came around to the mother's seat and clung together there. Crit and Vasiva smiled at the rough ocean. Tears were dropping from the pent-up fountain, for within her spirit there dawned a new energy. Wrestling with the strong agony of crushed love—an irresistible power to work, to will, to do—the deep fountain overflowed; and there she was on her way to her birthplace, according to the urgent but passionless desire of others. The motive she too well read; it imbittered her conscience and pride. She had long resisted the world's opinion as to her duty; yet, with doleful regret, she was nearing that place. "No power on earth," said she, "shall persuade or force me to marry another. I am free from every tie that fate has bound. Thank God, I am free!"
                  On the ocean, the open sea, Granville and Grita had flown in thought to each other, listening to the same delicious strain: "Thou feelest, and I feel, therefore we are one!" The gossamer of fate, stirred by the heaving ocean, fell on her pathway to grow into a coil again. A smile wreathed itself around her mouth: "Ah! Granville, the ashes of love are phœnix-like!"
                  The star! one star alone shone from its lofty and exalted sphere upon Grita as she sat there. Down into those lowest depths darted his kindling eye—his classic countenance, on which genius and truth were written. The helm of time directed her life into new places, winding up from graceful roads. She and her two guardian angels passed on to the river, and the ship anchored at Norfolk. Our heroine entered the small town, but did not continue a stranger long. She found herself situated in the midst of polished experience, of reputed courtesy. Her eldest brother met her at the wharf. After resting for a few days, she made her arrangements. With unbending firmness, and placid but indomitable will, she heard the pleadings and gentle words of advice urging her to remain at Richmond. "No, no." They agreeably located themselves at the National, where her brother had been telegraphed to join her, from thence to escort her to the most celebrated of seabathing resorts, Old Point; but wisdom and feeling, ruled by fate, steered another course. Thus she was kept longer than she anticipated at Norfolk, devoting herself for several days to her beautiful sick boy, who had been attacked with measles as he arrived at Norfolk. The skill of the medical faculty of that marine town was called in by her brother. The first physician, a noted professional, had come from the steamer with young Marlborough, as escort for Mrs. Oustan, in the carriage with her sick boy. From that hour this kindest of medical men devoted unheard-of interest to the strangers. Never could Ymataca Oustan forget the unostentatious hospitality of the polished ones who received her, partly owing to that most kind man. Not only was his care bestowed upon her beautiful Crit with a tenderness which the boy delighted to receive, but the doctor immediately surrounded the pretty strangers with carefully designed attention. Crit was soon well enough for his mother to carry into execution her summer plans. The day designed for starting with her little party, her brother was taken ill, and remained to watch over the children till Ymataca returned. "All is for the best," hoped she. Her cheek flushed with pleasure when she arose at dawn the next morning, and smothered the darlings with warm kisses. Leaving them asleep, her brother came softly in to take leave of her before the day's journey began. Summoning her attendant servant, she gave orders and directions regarding the children. With a dignified step she descended to the hall, kissing her brother good-by. She passed out from the age-worn passage of the old Liverpoolish hotel. The lone stranger entered in silence the omnibus at the front entrance. From its dimly lighted archway a gay bridal party came forth, and collected in the same omnibus. They rolled on, on the half-deserted river-side diverging from the quiet streets. The party and the young widow alone took the boat to Hampton, arriving in three hours' time at the picturesque cove. Passing up to the steamboat pier at the ancient village, all about the water-views much resembled the scenery on the Elbe.
                  Mrs. Oustan proceeded to the accomplishment of her purpose. Entering first the adjacent grounds which led directly from the steamboat wharf, she found on the street a delicate-looking, gentlemanly boy, of whom she asked the way to the Hall. He walked at the stranger's side, seemingly wrapt in thoughtful admiration. Scarcely a moment passed before she reached the long English lane. They passed under rich clustering foliage, into the enclosed and beautiful lawn. He speedily gained for her the desired prospect. At this moment she looked in the direction in which he pointed, to a gentleman approaching from the banks. The courteous elegance of his manner at once assured Mrs. Oustan of his high breeding. The lady in gray descried his intentions in a moment. Without going a step beyond the halldoor door, with singular brevity she arranged her plan. Not even a seat was accepted in his carriage to Old Point, in her haste to meet the next and only boat to Norfolk that day, as they were only running once or twice in a week, so early was it in the season. She fixed her eyes on the new ground, as if fearful of the agitation and extreme suffering which must yet be met with ere she returned to her sweet seclusion. She emerged from the silver-stranded Hampton to communicate with Old Point Comfort. The boat came by the Government wharf. She awaited near the fortress, like a heart-cherished home. She smiled in exultation on her entrance to the new place she had selected for the summer of '59. There she desired to pass the remainder of her life, in that gorgeously bright spot of earth. She looked out on the broad landscape lying in the depths of a thick wood, with the gay flowers mingling their fresh young beauty with her new voyage, meet emblems of the moment.
                  Three hours more, and she had returned to her children. They set out soon after to continue the way. Every hour brought her visibly nearer the soul of conquest. Torpid despair rushed over her, with Granville's late letters in the pocket of her hand-bag. Mysteriously she retouched Peters-burgh, the old ground on which Grita first stood as heroine—this the first and only time, since she left it in. 1840. The cars were but exchanged, when these predominant sensations retained the passing directions of quick travel to the main route, every instant growing worse as she met the pain, the horrors of Richmond. Fresh features produce double agony. The ground she had touched was the shadow of retrospection; the morning of her life lay there in '40. In the evening of this day at her birth-place, the shadow stretched long and broad, and deepened before her. She struggled now to hide perception from the scoffer's eye and taunts of tongues; but there was no retreat for Mrs. Oustan. Once more she was welcomed by the dear, great-hearted cousin Clara Nallam, who had just then married her first love, and was most woefully changed by circumstances. But her residence, like Miss Hepzibah Pyncheon's, had reliques. It stood opposite the St. Mark's of the city. Her dwelling seemed to imbibe the dignified solemnity due to the neighbourhood, supported by the seven granite Dorics of St. Mark's fluted columns, directly at the side of the handsome square. This elegant building of Grecian chasteness presented especial interest. To the right and left of this graceful street the immortal image of Washington was erected. Let us rest awhile in the lovely shades, lie down on the green banks, sloping terrace after terrace into deep dark dells, redolent with sweet odours, and alive with singing birds. Here and there its marble steps, like spectral stair-cases, climb to sunny heights; while fresh rippling fountains chimed a pleasant music to the spiritual harmony of churches. Stroll along those gravel walks, worthy reader, and the finest vista in the city catches the eye. From those massive iron gates we emerge to the marred and venerable building in front of the church, at which Ymataca Marlborough was married. The curious structure of ordinary buildings disturbs the uniformity and propriety of that model of Greek architecture, and the spot consecrated to the most solemn associations, meet for the visitation of her ghosts of the past. It appeared as if the echo of her footsteps betrayed much. She stood there, absorbed in a trance.
                  An instinctive wish to give pleasure to others was as courteous in Clara as it had ever been. The universal urbanity made the true gentleman in her husband's attractions, and added to their combined charm of liberal hospitality. Our travellers were among them, and the family were also guests again at Clara's. The first change of immediate connection was the death and absence of the idol child, Minho, who was married and died within the year. All engaged their utmost goodness and untiring efforts, trying to interest and give charm to the grandchildren. The perspective she viewed with her customary demonstrations of civility. Her voice thanks the kindly motive which ease of refinement and cultivation vation caused to flow in its current of vapid compliments. Her own peculiar smile cast a grave sweetness over her face. Patient politeness sat on her lips. Unused to leaving the sting, ingenuously Ymataca sustained the burden of restlessness that would not, could not pass away. That tiresome, listless visit wore morning into night; and she awoke to the terrible vividness, the reality of those pulses which had been shadowed before. Nothing could remove its impressions, while often her lips formed the smile and her eyes wandered about abstractedly in general society. There was a deep solemnity in our heroine, on passing a house over which the shadow of woe still lingered—"a grief not seen;" but this hidden link startled by its strange concatenation of touches: christening of her blighted, imperishable offspring, which gave back to memory a life-like air in a cousin's bridal footsteps from the well-known Ambleside. It was a marriage; and that house, the threshold, our heroine, from passing circumstances, omitted to approach. The outward courtesy of parties or social reunions was with a firm will declined. The very track of Granville's footstep seemed freshened. She saw nothing, felt nothing, but the vanished face. It seemed as if his soul had passed into her own, giving it second life. She awoke, as if in the Old World, her whole being changed and sublimated. With her, everything in existence now tended toward one thought, on desire, one passionate, yet solemn prayer, trembling with eagerness to tread her new-made way. The eccentric, frozen-hearted woman became a meaningless, frigid nothing. At home and in society the atmosphere was glaring and oppressive; its drafts reflected the form of Granville. 
                        
                           "Seldom hath my tongue pronounced that name;
                           
                           But the dear love, so deeply wounded then,
                           In my heart, with silent faith sincere,
                           Devoutly cherish till we meet again."
                        
                     
                  
                  She was one who had always kept love sacred from all. Her generous, delicate mind never boasted a broken heart of any man, before one of her sex or theirs. The ordinary woman, as then she appeared, buried the name which lay deepest in her heart; the last likely to rise to her lips, unless to defend it from contumely. She made no outward show of the deep, silent course of her life; for she deemed it alike due to Granville and herself it should be buried deep down a thousand fathom out of their sight. She would not permit herself to be a mark for the pointed finger of curiosity nor the scornful glance of intrusive pity. Still less was she to suffer idle, jealous tongues to bring reproach against his name. Her heart folded over the terrible grief closer than over the precious love. Again, she moved among the crowd, suffering, but it was with calmness she waited for the strange mystery to disclose itself by the hand of mercy.
                  'Twas night-time when the pent fountain overflowed. What are tears! Those silvery vapours shut out the world around. Lifting itself from the horizon, the star beamed on his star. Amidst the silence of her lofty attitudes her repose was melted into countless joys, as the beam of his letter stretched from ocean to ocean. Thither the tiny messenger carried their ship's news. What exquisite accords, what solemn, earnest thoughts, what comment of love wafted over the face of the great deep, from the mountain solitude! Yes, her soul retired to those secret chambers, as the news emerged from the ocean. She observed with joyful surprise that his name was published as passing through Sacramento with colours flying and drums beating. "They crossed the plains."
                  "And it came to pass afterward that he loved a woman whose name was Delilah." And when Grita saw that he told her all his heart, she called to him, and caused him to shave off one lock of his hair. It came from the wilderness like a green with pinned by its golden beam of love and folded in the first letter to her birth-place. All her love rushed back like a flood. She pressed the darkened tress to her breast and sobbed violently, passing from anguish of mind to dawning hope. What nearer to life than its latest touch! Granville yet alive, and she toyed with the hair from his living head. She looked on the growth of that curled wreath. The relation was far more beautiful than she dare hope for. She looked up from her lone couch when, at that hour in the dreamy hush, the sacredness of love rose up in prayerful gratitude. 'Twas Granville's first gift to Grita, and it had worked itself into her very holiest connections—the token of immortal love wrapt in an essence of bodily freshness; the unchangeable spell woven there. to the soil of her nativity, carved by its silent ornament. Grita sat wistfully by, wrapt in thought. It came from where her image lay, and was enveloped in the silken paper in which her miniature had been sent to his canvas walls. Full before her eyes was the address he had smuggled from Mrs. Calby's parlour, unknown to any but the twain, when he called at Winterwood. Such were their valued reliques. Granville had kept the scrap, and held it strong enough to mark the distance of time, a period of four years. The white silk paper with her address, as trophy of her surrender, he restored, with its wreath of glory, as the highest ornament too. She gazed on it as if he had wandered back. They must meet there together. "And before that church our love is first united in breathing, life-giving ties. "Then came the light of love, tender and beautiful, over her pensive face, a blushing joy which echoed his smile in words that accompanied the gift. She kissed it and kissed it again rapturously, that wavelet from the mighty deep. Every one of its fibres clung to her day by day. For hours she would lie on the lone couch, watching the rustling leaves and scented shrubberies, as the crowd of beings strolled the broad avenues, listening to the delicious strains of the band which added to the majestic charm of the State Square.
                  She grew tired of the stupid place. But very urgent and flattering was her cousin's invitation that her children and self should visit Pine Lawn. Weeks had passed, and she acknowledged the compliment by accepting. It led her back to his home, Arthur Seat. A delirium of unknown pleasures seemed to give strength to the delicious sorrow. She reached the doctor's well-distinguished residence, and sauntered along under the neighbouring influence of Arthur Seat. A hot tear dropped upon her cheek, as the third and fourth promise had been given. That she should visit his beautiful mansion, even with his order, was by the worldly critics said to be a moral wrong. Social and merry were the opportunities of such delightful intercourse in the country-house, to all apparently delightful; but our heroine found its chain a difficult thread to break. One morning the pensive kindness of her heart gave way, and before the doctor.
                  "There she is, sitting on the same bench," said Doctor Kobb, "that Granville left when Madame Marlborough so cruelly hurt his feelings." Having discovered the secret of this fair cousin's heart, he took upon himself to give her warning, and in a darker vein than Grita had yet heard, denouncing him as a traitor. She answered with a measured earnestness as the blood faded from her face, which became white and cold. With a mournful, proud tenderness, she exclaimed, as she looked around to breathe the invigorating air of morning coming from those hereditary domains, "In this wide, wide world, I am roaming; but, cousin doctor, if ever there was faith in woman, here it is. I have prayed to God for him, and have faith still."
                  "Take care, my pretty cousin," he said, startled to amazement; "consider what you do. Ere you depart, let me tell you, no blacker villain or more desperate man walks the earth than Granville Rutland. Is your will so firm that it cannot be changed?" She turned her face to the wall, and answered not. Pausing in his entreaties, he walked to the end of the vine-clad porch, then back, urging her still.
                  "I see, cousin, it is already your woven life; but cut its thread."
                  "Ah, alas! vain man. What God hath JOINED, let no man put asunder. I have learned it all, "she persisted, her ardent soul flashing in her eyes and dilating her stature. She laughed a scornful laugh, as she continued, "I heed nothing now—the prison nor the block, heaven nor hell. If this faith I hold be false, there is no God."
                  Like a maniac of energy, she flew from his presence as from pollution. She passed from the placarded pillory of Granville's sufferings, marked by the first hand that untied the cable. But, thank God, now she wept. None but the highest powers of heaven can cut the threads.
                  From those towering monuments of pain she released herself and Crit. As her belief, so was ever her practice, as her visits will verify. "Refrain thy foot from thy neighbour's house, lest he be weary of thee and so hate thee." Amid pleasures scarcely remembered she had loitered in a kind of friendly familiarity. The darling children, too, had been ill with measles, and kindly and skilfully attended by good Dr. Calby, who prohibited their removal till Vasiva was better. In all this time her youngest brother, Will, was moved by his sister's intense earnestness, and spoke with deepest devotion from his knowledge and various productions of her confidence. He was the only one in her family who was ever spoken with on the vital matter. With his full blue eye and best of faces, he would argue and strive to separate the real from the unreal. He saw the great coil which sprang from her whole soul. His brow contracted as he looked on her, saying:
                  "Grita, your gifts were fatal. I think you very beautiful, sweet sister. But favour my views, and forget your idle chimera."
                  Her lips trembled with a smile. He saw her eye followed him admiringly, with the true affection she had always for him. He stood in her upper chamber, with his arm around her waist.
                  "Ah! Will, my good brother," laying her small hand on his fine manly shoulder, "no, never! My green-house plant shall never die for want of nurture."
                  A new lustre in her eye lent an unwonted softness to every tone of her voice. They were soon out together for a walk.
                  Another morning has dawned. She mounted her high horse of sentiment and feeling, and cantered gently away at dawn, when the beauteous eyes of heaven unwinked upon the guests departing from the presence of the companions, cousins, and family. The carriage rolled off very hastily, and landed the travellers at the boat. The favourite brother, young Marlborough, stood yet upon the pier when her last good-by was shaken from the waving handkerchief to the lone protector, who appeared unusually sad as they parted; and the boat started off on her first trip for the season. She had quitted the city of scorpion stings, and gathered round her aching heart the welcome of repose. She listened to the soft breeze of that early morning, answering to the cheerful sunshine dimpling golden reflections from the under der current. Once, she looked again back on her childhood's home, but incessant gall corroded her thoughts; while beneath its swelling tide her soul was calm, her patience strong. The whirlwind of her heart's emotion throbbed back upon her brain, as the boat glided on with the flowing stream, tracing its windings amid the woodland scenes. Youthful summer robed the sloping hills with Virginia's dark pines, and the solemn shades of those forests seemed to mantle the clouds with storms. Then she sank back on the seat along the gunwale, amidst a violent burst of sobbing. Swift-winged hopes, however, stole over the choking sighs, and she yielded herself up to discourse with Crit and Siva. Beautiful as ever, heaven's unspeakable joy played around her in all the freshness of childhood, as their musical notes blessed her bewildered spirit. Joyously they romped upon the decks. Grita, unheeded and alone, sat with thoughts differing in shape and dress, but imbued with something undefined as she approached Old Point Comfort. The brief journey ended; it was about noon-time when the boat moored at the sea-shore. Our heroine walked from the gang-plank, the only arrival, with Crit and Vasiva on either side. Memory was doubled, and she considered the magnitude of its melancholy sentiment, and embraced "this earth of majesty, this seat of Mars." In fact, it was most striking; already she had entered the new path:
                     
                        
                           "Light was the touch, but it thrilled to the bone,
                           And shot a chillness to her heart."
                        
                     
                  
                  The path led to a road from the steamer's wharf. The old. stage moved slowly up the acclivity, along the same esplanade from which Grita left her acquaintance with the charms of Hygeia. They were detained, by arrangement about luggage, till late in the afternoon, when they heard the thunder, shrill and distant. The winds and waves were strangely mingling with the battling clouds; the lightning, with its vivid glare, shone on the phosphoric sea; the roaring, raging elements changed the sky to blackness; in triumphant music the artillery of heaven grew louder, filling the moated isle with its discharge; the bursting clouds belched out their flood-deeps, and long they poured; the angry, forked flashes hurled their blazing bolts upon the reeling surf whose white crests retired to the dark, heaving waters.
                  The driver found it best to cross the gunbridge, and protect his beautiful burden, as the rising flood was already dashing at the horses' feet. Deeper and louder grew the tempest. Fierce and black it raged, while the travellers were outside, quietly shielded under the right wing of the picket barracks. Grita's lips murmured a thanksgiving that they were safe, though exposed to the fury of the tempest. Was it a terrible dream that furrowed her new ground? thought the silent and sad woman. The wild blast bore away amidst its thunders that echoed at that hour, hymning vespers: "It is well," chimed a vesper: "Welcome to your unknown world! God's best messengers are heralded by storms." A fresh impulse was gained from the solemn communion of those deep, deep waves mingling with the air, the wind, the tempest. At the hour of vespers it was hushed, and still repeated with its psychological mysticism, "It is well!" It invited contemplation, and drew attention to heavenly bodies. Taught by the first step advancing to the silver strands of Hampton, Grita reflected with profound solemnity upon the infinite presence of the one living and true God, who had just caused the apostrophe, to reflect and meditate upon the powers of His wisdom. "Smoothing like oil upon this stormy sea the roughest waves of her destiny" and bearing promise of His holy sight; advancing as she is to the soul of origin divine.
                  Steadily on they move to the right. The rain has ceased, and the air is purified with the most glorious, invigorating atmosphere. She moved on the narrow seat, and drew the fatherless ones to her bosom. Then she lifted up a secret prayer to heaven, striving to impart strength and dignity to her trembling frame. There was upon her heart a sublime and beautiful desolation; a veil was drawn over her senses; the storm without melted to the sweetest music, as it became a wondrous dream. Nearly three miles from the given point, and they have reached Hampton; so wondrously old, its spire so eternal-looking, as it tapered into the sky. On its apex was perched a gilded ball which gleamed in the distance. They passed on to the Leam, running its clear stream between the inner and outer Hampton. It is crossed by an old bridge which stands opposite to the Hall, of immortal note on these historical pages. They pass through the main street and turn to the right, from the outer gateway; drive up a long, shaded lane to another broad, white gate thrown open, just opposite the fine old entrance of an antique building called the *Great * Gable.* Just as the sun was setting, with the last rays slanting through the tree-tops, the travellers had finished their journey. The tide of glory flowed on, and poured out upon them the sublime benediction of a triumphant march.
                  The day of early June, 1859, was closing in, when the old stage-coach gave up its prisoners, who had been crowded on the back seat, to keep free from the driving storm which had glared its lightning flashes through the leather crevices of the old curtains. The stately welcome of the courteous proprietor received the party as they alighted, lifting out first the little ones, and shaking them warmly by the hand. Looking now at her, "Alone are you, madam?" said his voice, gentle and kind, which struck a singular charm to the lone heart. Looking upon them as a friend, he continued, "Madam, I regret your arrival should be clouded by such darkness; but all things shall be made bright indoors;" and, as if to invoke the blessing, she directed her glance to the last bright hours of day. The west was all burnished with glory triumphant: "after the tempest, the calm." The gallant Dr. Royal led his newly arrived guest and her children, accompanied by the servant, to the room. Not another did she see that day or evening of her arrival. They did not enter nor touch the flight of stone steps which ascended to the porch of the *Great * Gable*; but on the broad circle of the fine gravel ring around the large grass-plot they stood for some moments, as it were before the portal of some unknown but mysterious influence. The very air seemed promising; and forward she moved to the right from the old and venerable *Great * Gable.* They have passed to new things, or that part of the hotel erected to occupy the opposite site on the expansive lawn of the *Great * Gable.* Continuing three flights, the door closed upon them, and gladly she threw herself down to rest, proud bird of independence! Grita always soared to eyrie tops. She had chosen the loftiest apartment for her pretty abode. Along the very broad passages countless doors marked the ins and outs of summer expectants; reminding, too, of an infirmary with its cells, from whose doors the green curtains waved a "no admittance." Hers was the only room occupied in this building, save one on the first floor, the domestic resort of young Dr. Royal, situated next to the ball-room. The servant in attendance on our little party was given the adjoining room opposite. The new guests settled themselves with a strange feeling of home. Grita invested the ample roof with a new-born happiness, unknown as it had been to the wanderer. "I have no closer tie but one," thought she as the unexpected hospitality and cordiality had warmed the new place. Little Siva raised her soft, dove-like eyes upon her languid mother, peeping at her through her dark lashes and chestnut locks, which tumbled in profuse clusters over her sweet low brow. Kissing her idolizing mother, she said, "Ma mère, bonne nuit." The sweet language of affection melted a tender chord—while Crit's great bright eyes grew dim with fatigue. The little nestlings dozing on her knee were soon placed in separate beds, and closed their eyes in gentle slumber, the mother bending over her babes with full comprehension of her care. What a picture of life! The young, homeless mother knelt, and wept as she kissed the two little reflections of heaven's pure joy and comfort. With variable complexions of thought she rose, undaunted by the deep stream in its echo. She whispers, "Whither, oh, whither, when all else shall pass away? Children! shallyour mother's name lie unsullied! "Watching her tender ones, she fell asleep at their side.
                  Each day returned with joyous things for her children. On the sea-shore they wandered all the day, listening to the waves as did Paul and Florence; and Siva, the flower-girl, craved every blossom—even blades of grass she twined in the bouquet for sa chère mère. Vasiva's qualities are very marked. Hope and joy soar above every disappointment, always responding, "It is best; to-morrow it will be." They both have sterling faith and love to God and Jesus. Vasiva's prattle always yields when she prays. Crit, with all his chivalrous spirit, is a perfect theologian. The little, all-hallowing household live above the frigid zone of hollow fashion. Their flame of altar-prayers ascend night and morning: the never-forgotten circle of union blessed the sunshine of their room. A few days, perhaps a week, passed by; Grita was settled in that new abode. From her window scenes of enchantment broke upon her mind, like the chambers of those mighty guests at Hampton Court, where old Father Thames is seen meandering through a level country adorned with gardens, parks, and forests. Their sloping garden verged to the water's edge by granite terraces, calculated to stand the weather and waves of the stream. Near the enclosure of the bridge-lodge were three buildings, apparently of different ages, and separated only by three beautiful lawns, with pretty white palings over each line of separation. Flowers were festooned in vines, and roses clung, with white faces leaning upon the glossy green of their leaves, interlacing the bars and blending with the red rose, all blooming monthly. Lofty trees rose in parallel splendour. Their age-foliaged branches swept the soft turf of the lawns, and a long line of sycamores deepened the shade on the boundary line of the Hall grounds. There were prominent residences adjoining the Hall grounds, luxuriant with a variety of flowers and arbours, adorning the banks on both sides of the flowing Leam, which broadened into a large bay of ocean.
                  So you may imagine the situation of the village. Beautifully picturesque, though low, it is most pleasant. The houses for the most part are old, and built of timber, with several hotels and many churches. One of the latter is a relique, and attracts the stranger's notice the moment he arrives in the hamlet. The church-yard is of great antiquity and celebrity. The crumbling walls are red brick, overgrown with creepers, and roses cling to its mouldering form. The graves are rank with weeds, while roses are growing profusely, half hid in that deathly stillness. Ivy, the rare old plant, winds its green trail about the reverend walls and half covers the tower. The snowy seams of the edifice mark the worth of its materiality. The hoary, cruciform building stands among the graves, graced with scars of stern patriots; and beneath a yew-tree is one worn, mutilated urn, silently speaking of him who lies there in dust and ashes. The urn is to the memory of Grita's distinguished ancestry. Around these tombs all is quiet, and in silent stillness we leave them as they lie.
                  Beneath her eyrie rose the pine-tops, with here and there a dingy hovel, from which a thin column of smoke curled upwards above the cottage-roofs; and yonder the steeple of 1710 marked the house of prayer. What a mystery hung over that ancient temple, the sanctuary of the Lord! Each sabbath Grita went to the all-hallowed spot, with holy trust guiding Crit and Vasiva to worship their Great Creator, always attended by the elegant young Dr. Royal. How very odd the singular remains of former years! high stalls, or pews; its cruciform shape and brick nave; three high galleries supported by spiral columns, and a crescent rail enclosing the altar. On its agedimmed cushion lay the ponderous relique, the Bible, and a prayer-book. The morning service was well attended. The pews were well filled with aristocratic people, and an air of polished refinement seemed to inspire the elderly ladies. All was time-toned to its ancient birth. In that congregation of much beauty sat our pretty newcomer. Grita appeared in matronly grace, with her reflections flowered in the dimpling chin and cheeks of her children. The character of her dazzling manner gleamed among strangers like a silver thread. With a deep feeling, her dark and intricate eyes marked the influence of her melancholy with the foreign intermixture of mould and birth. On these occasions, at her place in church service, Dr. Royal the younger was ever ready to attend. His own nature was religious, and to an almost woman-like tenderness he united clear sense and firmness such as few men can boast. Their legitimate perceptions were surrounded on every side by a companionship of equal trust. He was a comforter and strengthener in the new place, and they became friends indeed.
                  Grita has, we know, turned her face directly to this spot, as if going into a holy place. We know that she stood before the curtain of the unknown, and an influence held her from touching the portal of the *Great * Gable*, upon which we are to know the divine presence of SIBYLLA ROYAL rested, over shadowed by the Spirit of the most high God. Thus we bring forth in the solemnity of heaven's Judge the Truth made perfect, Justice blessed by God's anointed one. The whole development of this great work has, we can testify, been gradual, and, applied to its conjunctive, needed a most extraordinary interpretation to judge the real character of divine truth and faith, as if never before in this sceptical world it was realized. In title of her triangle with its demonstration to the stars, a fixed purpose pose distinguishes the contemplation, producing the unbounded wisdom which shall vindicate our heroine's innocence, as it must be seen openly to come only from God, and is the highest proof of the divine origin of the mission and message, heralded by storm. But we cannot announce its part until events foretold shall come to pass, while describing the existence of her inspired being. The order of ceremonial is affirmed of 1860, as consecration robes to justice and truth; besides the invaluable lesson, which opens with a most graphic and powerful description, suggestive of the nation's downfall. This new prophetess casts her view forward to the future, and her predictions are not surpassed by any of God's olden prophets. We must compare the authorship of this coming sequel with its bright completion of things promised by fulfilment, to Scriptural miracles: so alike her prophetess, defied by the laws of God on the pages of His own Holy Gospel, that we charge the reader to beware, as Jeremiah will show that the event will declare who are true prophets, and judgements against mockers of the true prophets. The spiritual attributes are sufficient to render eternal silence on all false oracles and deceivers, soothsayers and wizards. Ah! no—peculiar to her Christian doctrines of faith and obedience, God has marvellously condescended to signify His pleasure by attestation on the soul of His child of duty, His communicable power by works of His omniscient, all-seeing will. Each providence has, we can but know, encouraged her to practise duty, and therefore her completely pure life vindicated her religion, as by faith, from all aspersion. And it, too, confirms the heavenly doctrines of His laws by the supernatural glory of the visible and invisible. This is the tenor of faith—a fulfilment of promise made to them which believe; and in contrast we refer to the prophecy of Elisha—the incredible plenty in Samaria—in Kings, 7th chapter.
                  In the month of June, '59, Grita made the new league which reaches the shores far away from Richmond, and she has a secret joy and invulnerable strength which gives her ability to await Granville's coming—not yet, but on the soil of her nativity. She rests peacefully within the new place, with its thousand hues, and in the ancient hamlet of the New World. Perhaps seven to nine days elapsed after her arrival at the ancient home-stead—for the old bricks, painted a lead hue, had that inviting look of peace and plenty. The great white facings around the high windows seemed to support a polished centre, and produced a fine combination, encircling the venerable abode with a broad and cheerful piazza. Only three doors opened from the south and west sides, and introduced personages to an old and established passage, broad and airy, with two large folding-doors thrown back into the wainscoted parlours of the *Great * Gable.* The rays of the sun unveiled a glorious loveliness, and sent its fresh-culled crown of light, like a blessed thing, to usher in the morn of mysterious life of mind on mind. The early sun shone through two east windows, brilliant with their red draperies. The order and harmony of its expression were enhanced by the India summer-cloth which gave a fresh, cool atmosphere to the two drawing-rooms, neatly furnished for the fashion of its summer visitors. The great sounding bell had just summoned Mrs. Oustan and her children to breakfast. They had crossed from the new building, or hall, to the venerable *Great * Gable*, ascending by the five stone steps leading to the porch of the *Great * Gable.* Dr. Royal, the host, smiled his welcome on the guests as they bowed to his courtesy. His family were nine in number. There they were assembled at that morning meal, in domestic enjoyment with our small party, around the sumptuous board. Mrs. Royal, a woman of fine intellect and culture of mind, occupied the head. Mrs. Oustan had entered from the stairs descending to the large and airy dining-room on the groundfloor, immediately opening on the green sloping lawn. Fresh came the breeze of early morning from the Roads. The dazzling waves, dancing with their music before the door, were delightfully prominent with local charms. Dr. Royal's kind wife seated Mrs. Oustan and her children, with all the politeness due a stranger. At the farther end of the table sat a lady of singularly striking appearance, and the hostess introduced her to Mrs. Oustan as "Miss Royal." Miss Royal fixed her eyes on the widow with a remarkable glance amid her very peculiar radiance of expression. Grita gave back a significant smile, which seemed to answer the look of silent sympathy expressed in the quick, penetrating eye of the stranger. Miss Royal rose as she bowed her acceptance of Mrs. Oustan's acquaintance. For a moment she stood, silently observing the lady in gray; with fine ease of manner she then seated herself opposite to "the pretty widow." Grita was struck with her features and personal distinction; her air of dignity was rare indeed. Miss Royal leaned back in her chair and entered into conversation with the new acquaintance. That meeting was impressive and agreeable. After a reasonable time had elapsed, occupied with agreeable conversation, they resumed their breakfast of rolls and coffee, with the celebrated oysters. Neither had tasted a morsel during the first moments of the extraordinary acquaintance. Grita spoke but little beyond what was requisite for politeness; but the watchful look of Miss Royal, from time to time, made a clear impression, as at the first glance upon the strange meeting. When Miss Royal spoke, her voice was clear; what she said was elegant, and in flowing language, marked by the Southern accent. Now the magic thread was woven between them, Grita seemed really unconcerned, only realizing that the singular countenance and remarkable impression was a circumstance intended to make her feel at ease in all the loneliness of her position. One thing it at least suggested—that the interview expressed thoughts of sympathy; and they were strangely attracted towards each other. Miss Royal's indescribable ease of manner and extraordinary versatility inspired a certain irresistible fascination. She was about twenty, but looked older; with dark hair, or rather a light brown, simply arranged. The contour of her face was so exactly like that of Victoria, of England, that Grita was enchained to observe the queenly picture, with all the colossal majesty of her mind and inspired presence. Miss Royal's style of dress was remarkably simple; not even as elegant in taste as one would have imagined from the delicate culture of her mind. But she gave honourable proof of intellect above material things. A fair exposition of her appearance would be the diamond—the natural lustre comparatively nothing, but scintillating with soul. Miss Royal was veiled beneath the more graceful cloak of fastidious taste, like Grita. 
                        
                           "Tell me by what hidden magic

                           Why should smiles sometimes repel us?
                           Bright eyes turn our feelings cold?
                           What is that which comes to tell us
                           All that glitters is not gold."
                        
                     
                  
                  The charming simplicity of Miss Royal's style was in accordance with her figure. But, reader, what an unusual expression have those keen, glittering gray eyes, and very marvellous mouth, the smile supercilious, yet quickly followed by a magnanimous tenderness. We must consider our new character a study. She has travelled through abstract sciences, and in dead languages, and unsphered the stars.
                  She ate slowly, and at intervals scrutinized the stranger with an unfathomable eye. Mrs. Oustan rose and left the breakfast-table, merely glancing a smile on the passing introduction, as she had heard but once of this Miss Royal, from the servant-maid, who had mentioned her as a member of the family who was never seen or known out of her room. For two years she had lived entirely secluded, even from the immediate inmates of her father's roof. All but Dr. Albert Royal were denied her presence. He was an idolized brother, and he induced her to leave her room for once, at least, to see "the pretty widow" whom he had learned to love. Mrs. Oustan thought the introduction quite natural, and knew nothing of the tribute to herself till long after. So it was a matter of acquaintance, dropped as suddenly as she had appeared. That morning our heroine monopolized her two merry little rompers and returned to her room. Days passed into weeks. Most profound solitude reigned. Day by day was her young, gay spirit saddened more and more; day after day faded the loveliness of her youth, its freshness, its hopes. The eyes which had once danced in brightness were now dimmed by tears. The cheek which had glowed or faded at a word, a thought, was now ever pale and thin. The joyous laugh, the gush of happiness, was hushed, the light and playful sally heard no more. She now rarely spoke except when addressed. Then her words were cold and studied. Earth and air had so freshly connected a thousand memories with links in her chain of thought, she would not, could not break now, binding, even in her new home, past, present, and future, in mighty fetters, which death alone could burst. Who has not felt that gladdening light, memory? the mighty master of magicians. Who would forget the charm?
                  And then and there his letters came. Alone she read them. The well-remembered characters she read as one whose heart was in her eyes. Joy and triumph were alone visible in the eloquent countenance. Her eyes flashed, her breast heaved; and clasping that follower of her presence to her lips, she pressed it with a transport of joy: "Granville, dear Granville!"
                  
                  Since then her emotion constructs its vast emporium to severe discipline of energy and courage, almost inspired to believe her faith is holy, placed by the side of the grandest society that ever lived, in the immensity of mind. Grita is profoundly attentive to the internal immensity and dignity of that place. It seemed to communicate a powerful impulse and an encouragement to hope. His name appeared illustrious as never before. The excessive details of those reciprocal friends added a magic perspective, confiding a glory from its surroundings. The grandeur of sentiment harmonized with the graceful garden they had frequented so often. Nothing disturbed their beautiful hours. Albert Royal, the young doctor, was ever full of enthusiasm about widows. He now boasted of none such as the veuve distingué. Such was the first impression on Miss Royal's mind, with the declared preference of her favourite brother for "the pretty widow." Ardently he had induced the cloistered woman to behold his ideal of her sex, for which reason she had appeared at the breakfast-table that sun-crowned morning hour. Mind powerfully embraced mind as they met; and at every meal she came now. The same fixed and unfathomable scrutiny adhered to her acquaintance, whilst she treated Grita with such very charming courtesy as completely mesmerized Grita's inner self. No hope of attracting-admiration had ever been held out to Grita in childhood, so that her actions flowed from natural promptings of the once gay but kindly heart. She was always natural, always the same, aping no manners, modelling herself after no superiors, descending to no deceit. She met kindness with gratitude, as being above her merits, and looked on all things through the medium of her own happiness, never dreaming of envy or ill will, still less suspecting the admiration of her grace. Especially was she led to revere the excessive goodness and liberality of the new friends, Doctor and Miss Royal. Dr. Albert Royal was a military-looking man, very dignified and attractive; with his mixed feelings of religion and poetic inspiration, which was another enjoyable trait for the fair widow. From the first sight of the lady in gray, Albert Royal lost all control over his heart. Her first visit to the fortress was with the young doctor. Joining his efforts with his sister's, every attention was extended to the new guest. Mrs. Oustan's peculiar position irresistibly drew her to the sister of her friend; for Miss Royal was a delightful companion, and quite a protectress, as lady of her father's house. Fortune indeed seemed to smile on the new home. Miss Royal and herself, naturally estimating music a divine art, made it a chief amusement, as well as cultivating the reasoning faculties; forming, as it were, for our peculiarly intuitive genius, an endless source of interest and enjoyment. Miss Royal's sound and extensive education, encouraged by a general taste for literature, added proportionally to the brilliant imagination of Grita. It is hardly possible to enumerate all the advantages of such society or that of the neighbourhood; for the aristocratic portion of the village appeared to surround the hall and its inmates; but, as it was early in the season, there was little intercourse. The last conversation with Sibylla Royal, upon the mind of Grita had a tranquillizing and salutary effect. But it made a small part of the numerous conversations she held with our heroine. While they addressed themselves to the reason, they inflamed yet more the fancy.
                  It was some weeks after these incidents that Sibylla Royal entered the front chamber and corner room of Grita's apartment. The profoundness may be conjectured. It was a solemn stillness, stirred only by the low-speaking waves as they flashed along the silver Leam by moonlight. The extreme clearness of the air served to render distinct the features of a range of country studded with armour-bearings. The fortress loomed grandly in the distance, and lent all its magic to the lonely and desolate road which wound itself from thence to the shores of the Leam. The effect of all this on Grita's character was impressive. Her mind gradually became fitted to this sequestered, musing life. She forgot at last the vanities and chimeras of the outside world. A strange, ineffable consciousness sciousness of power, of something great within, an impulse that she could not resist, was a recognition of feelings dim and glorious. Everything was well assorted; everything was brilliant, harmonious, and sweet.
                  It was in obedience to a promise to meet that Miss Royal visited the mystic chamber. It seemed the stranger's presence only served to heighten Grita's star-lit music; for she turned a timid glance on the stately visitor, spontaneously unconscious of the form of Sibylla, as she stood under the half-open door. The air of her demeanour personified her own airy motions, glorious in the image of her mysterious grace of being. The countenance at once, like magic, fixed a speculative, dreamy stare upon Grita; the small, glittering gray eyes fairly shone; and her serene brow inspired her with powers such as she appeared never to have known before. A strange sensation seemed to whisper its echo into Grita's starlit song; while yet Sibylla gazed in spell-bound admiration on the splendour of her approach to Grita, which gave an unwonted languor to the flush of excitement on Grita's cheek; while the effect of Sibylla's earnest, kindly look, with its inspiriting influence, which her eye and calm, half melancholy smile had at first exercised on the new guest, produced an intoxicating charm. Nor could she at that moment withdraw from that face, as the twinkle of the unfathomable eye met her own. Such indeed was the gentle encouragement of benign and compassionate admiration that Miss Royal's look produced on Grita's mind; an effect never to be analyzed nor forgotten. It was one that awakened an indistinct, haunting reminiscence. The awe and coldness that had before seized her vanished like mist before the sun. She still sat before the window, and the significant silence ripened the luxury of the hour. The siren's voice had poured her entrancing notes into the dol far niente of the Southern moonlight. Her cheek flushed a deeper blush when faculties recalled a seeming want of courtesy, so marked at times; only now the impression of her mortal guise distracted a thrill past fancy. The grace of etiquette was lost in prudence, but was followed by a beseeching look of welcome; and Miss Royal only now entered the very room. Grita, all the while unconscious of her spiritual cast, as it might easily be traced to the abstraction of her mind, gathered up loosely her beautiful hair, and her dark eyes swam with grateful tears as she looked upon the kindly glance of her friend. She had risen, and was encircled by the arm of Miss Royal, standing before the great work of Canova's sublime conception, her trophy from Vienna, the finest of engravings. The illumination of the moon richly endowed the general appearance of her unpretending ornaments of art, and gave finish to the real comfort of the chamber. Beneath an old book-shelf and the table assigned to literature, lay piles of music from favourite operas and charming ballads. They stood with delight, enjoying the fresh sentiment of art, song, and genius, round the glowing creations of the great.
                  It is this privilege of introduction to the well-wrought head of her beginning that decides the contemplation of her model life. This timely assistance from the teachings of Destiny revolves the sublimest example of the deified mind souled in the image of her Creator. This hour, let us remember, is the starting-point of a new era of intellectual and moral excitement. The softening south wind stole over their souls. They stood transfixed, dreamers of majestic composers, as Grita placed the lighted lamp on a table, beside a book which lay open, which happened to be "Kenilworth," loaned her by Miss Royal as the first of her literary selections given to Grita's hand.
                  "Up! rouse thee, Mrs. Oustan!" said Miss Royal; "why sittest thou apart? thy face I found resting on thy hands, thine eyes fixed on space. Up! rouse thee! and accept my sober friendship and advice," with a light touch tossing her Spanish guitar on the table. Arm in arm they started out upon the corridor, or third tier of porticos running along the rear of Grita's room, overlooking the bay, or Roads of Hampton. There they paced the solitary gallery, or pansed to gaze upon the extended scenery that stretched below. At an hour past midnight they threaded a path surrounded by luxuriant foliage. From afar rose the Fortress of Monroe, frowning darkly against the sea of Roads; and at two o'clock Grita parted from her new companion, and sauntered musingly into her own room, finding Crit and Vasiva sleeping sweeter than ever: 
                        
                           "While happiness unseen is falling
                           Down from God's bosom silently."
                        
                     
                  
                  During these days the delicate, generous, and respectful affection of the young doctor was no less new than delightful to Mrs. Oustan. He took such pleasure in the happiness "the pretty widow" created, that he gradually weaned himself from all other society. By this time, too, the sunshine and warmth of July had brought society, mirth, and fashion to the sequestered sea-bathing resort. But again our eye follows the circumstance of those absorbing metaphysical discussions and unity of companionship—friendship clearly—and the one after another newly-created source rejoins the three in possession of their bridge. At the appointed hour of early evening they would partially assemble there, opening upon the silver-capped stream by a broad flight of wooden stairs, each seated upon a step, to enjoy the spectacle of a summer-night scene, exhilarating and truly beautiful. As evening followed evening they were found ever resorting to the pier or bridge jutting into the Roads of Hampton.
                  Events which I have yet to relate make it necessary to mention this spot above all others in the new place, as no circumstance from beginning to end happens, of my own evidence, more closely connected with the marvellous truth of its records. The evening, I remember, was serene. Grita wound her way slowly over the wide gravel-walk descending from the tea-room to the water's edge. She had highly relished its beverage and compound of overflowing elixir-conversation at the table, when she picked up the sound of home and social expressions, and left her chair to proceed to the bridge. The sultry night was enlivened by a full moon rising in lonely splendour through a star-lit sky. Sibylla joined Grita under the deep shade of the shore, and both vehemently began to apostrophize the prospect. Soon afterward Albert Royal presented himself, with all his warm Southern nature. He walked forward in the mysterious light and stopped at Mrs. Oustan's side, with evident sincerity of affection; which, from the smile that won him at the breakfast-table, had placed his services at her disposal during the season. Dr. Royal's violent fancy and usual kindness claimed Mrs. Oustan's purest good feeling, and were descrving great praise. The considerate ceremony of his perfect good-breeding was to her a great attraction. Dr. Royal's music, which he played with tender feeling and delicate taste, was a closer tie than usual to their friendship. Mrs. Oustan's natural enjoyment of giving back by her artistic accomplishment, only wove another quality which drew the three closer and closer together. These simple habits, which regulated even such approval, combined to fold her domestic fascinations around his elegant sympathy. His partings and meetings every day, and under his father's roof, were in themselves a peace domestic. He shook hands at night and morning as if he had touched no other woman's in his life. They were secretly drawn by his sister's love, and her high admiration with greater kindness absorbing the innermost sanctuary of her heart to interpret all Mrs. Oustan's wishes before she scarce knew them herself. The good-humoured arguments—the quiet peace of a real home—how vividly that picture paints itself on those scenes which re-live while I write! From the very place where they had chosen, I see Sibylla's graceful form, half of it in soft light, half in mysterious shadow; for by this time the moon had stolen around the terrace, and outside they sat on the oak stairs leading to the boat-landing beside the stone facing, valanced by grasses and fringes waving gently in the light evening air. 
                        
                           "Our lives are rivers, gliding free
                           To that unfathom'd boundless sea;
                           Onward its course the present keeps,
                           Onward the constant current sweeps,
                           Wrestling with the tides of Fate."
                        
                     
                  
                  Those three sat side by side in the tropic clime of youth, and sheltered in the love of the sandy shore. They found repose from the tumbling surf laden with seaweed and floating among the rafters of their bridge. "The Celestial Pilot" (for such seemed the outstretched arms of those heavenward perfections to the exiled stranger, whose chilled and bleeding wounds waited and knocked there), "Whither, oh whither shall my dwelling be?"
                  "Here," gently cried her guardian angel. "Thou shalt see from thy casement. Look! thou camest before my gate, and sheltered shalt thou be from unearthly dews, here. Chilled by unkindly frost, from your mansion of truth, enter. I will greet thee and tell thee of a glory that shall never fade."
                  It seemed a charmful whisper from those zephyrs. I see the valves of her heart expand, as if the touch of fate launched these words of sympathy in her ear.
                  "Thy advancing steps were hot with tears struggling with imperious thought. Come forth to rest. Here, at this portal, you stood overburdened with pain, faint with thy adventurous thought into this undiscoverable land. With thy tender hand thou hast opened a mysterious gate. Welcome to this," said Miss Royal; "welcome thou hast been to our foreign fireside. The world has, it seemeth, dealt harshly with thee. Come, sit down here," she said.
                  
                  "It has soothed me here like spring," replied sad-hearted Grita; "so full of fragrance, that it is joy indeed. I am glad—I like it. These waves have a cheerful, soul-stirring sound. Sibylla, your voice to me is silvery as music, like to a bright image of light and beauty that dwells in human nature. There seems some beautiful spirit breathing upon me; it comes like a benediction that follows my prayer. This is the place!"
                  "Ah, woman!" observed Sibylla, "what a glory the world puts on for him or her who goes forth under the bright and glorious sky, and looks on duty well performed. Yes, the majesty of these deep woods uplifts my thoughts from earth. All things are new. Those buds, the leaves, those elm trees, that gliding stream, appear wreathed in braided streamlets drifting, drifting on the shifting currents of my restless heart. Come and read to me," said Sibylla, "something that will soothe that restless feeling."
                  "But ah! a sadness that my soul cannot resist," said Mrs. Oustan. "Yes," rejoined Miss Royal. Uttered not, but comprehended. Ah! reader, see you not her language, quaint and olden, wherein she was to read wondrous things, truths manifold as wondrous? Those her wishes tender and blossoming at night. Turning to that silver streamlet—silent river! that lesson is deep and long. Onward like the stream of life.
                  "Ah!" said Grita, "I felt my heart beat lighter, Sibylla, when I saw those waters gleam. I watched with mingled feelings stealing like a tide, half in rest, half in strife. I love thee, not because thy waves are blue, Estacado! 'tis for this, thou silent river—more than this."
                  The sky was without a cloud, and a sense of peace and seclusion soothed their thoughts into a rapt, unearthly repose. A balmy quiet deepened over the deepening light, which seemed to hover over us with its gentler influence, when there stole upon it the ball-room music—the musicians breathing such power and pride in the silver light of spangles, toned to the time of flutes and fife, most pleasing instrument, firing inconsiderate youth with the voluptuous motions of ball-room splendour, when dancers with flowing robes and gay attire swept on like dewdrops to grace the flowers of chivalry, trained by gay and courtly gallantry. Passing, the orchestral strains floated to the peaceful steps below, as nightingales lulling soul-like into the prelude of fate. Heavenly tenderness of music!
                  On the side nearest the terrace Mrs. Oustan was seated, on her right Miss Royal. The rays gathered full from parlour lights, and fell on Mrs. Oustan as they slanted across the mysterious shadow of moonlight, associated directly amidst the ever-changing wonders of sea and land, calling every appreciating faculty into rarely practised attractions of beautiful nature and art.
                  
                  Bending over her guitar, Miss Royal was so absorbed she did not appear to notice the softly uttered words of her idol-brother Albert, on the step below, admiring with enthusiasm her friend, "the pretty widow," at the moment when he stepped over the ladies' bridge of laps to be nearer to her he so fancied. Miss Royal nodded with a lively grace to the delightful refinement of familiarity which characterized all he did and said.
                  "A secret, Mrs. Oustan?" laughed her friend. With a triumphant flourish of his hand, he paused, and stood before her on the fragment of a step.
                  "A perilous solitude," replied Mrs. Oustan.
                  "You don't suspect me of treachery?" said the doctor.
                  "Pray, don't suppose that I had any idea of undertaking your destination, Dr. Royal," was her rejoinder. Striking his handsome cane against the rafters, he asked that she would think of something.
                  "Search your memory, madam, for an announcement. Here, then, is one of my anticipations of the morning happily fulfilled; if I may take credit to myself, conscious of my anxiety to serve you;" and mingled with his vivid impressions her bright existence, while strong his quickened pulses stirred within to her sweet portrayal of acknowledgments to his model earnestness.
                  "Good, bad, or indifferent?" she questioned.
                  "Ah! madam, have you any leisure time to spare?"
                  "Certainly, doctor, and am suspicious of your underhand work; let me know the invisible threatening."
                  "I have time, and always at your disposal," he remarked with a provoking humour. "You must promise implicit obedience. What think you of this?" and drew his hand from his pocket as he spoke, with a letter in a sealed envelope, holding it before her.
                  "Is that for me?" she asked. Mrs. Oustan took it from him and looked at the address—a strange hand-writing.
                  "Where did you get this?" she continued.
                  "From the surgeon's orderly at the fortress."
                  "Expectations of pleasing interest were connected with this letter, doctor, which you see has produced the result I anticipated."
                  Grita's face expressed vivid interest and astonished delight. "I am gratefully sensible of your kindness, Dr. Royal. My spirits are elevated, as they ought to have been, by the prospect of future enjoyment, in this high honour Surgeon Percy so flatteringly presents me with—considerations I had not allowed myself to entertain; and this announcement, Dr. Royal, becomes an event which occurred at a former epoch of my pleasantries. Now, too, I have shown you all the pet points of my obligations."
                  
                  "I am conscious of my privilege," he replied with gallantry; "yet under such conditions I have made no discoveries. This was a matter of curiosity, for I thought I had woman to excite, and was certain of success on my involving it in a mysterious adventure of yours. Yes, the secret—the unknown hand-writing. I see it takes a woman to know woman—something wanting to effect this curious caprice of fancy."
                  Miss Royal laughed at his truthful blue eyes, looking first at Mrs. Oustan and then on herself. They both thanked him for his considerate expectations, and turned from the jesting to another source.
                  Sibylla cast one look of earnest fondness from her inexhaustible mine of sympathy upon the relation of this incident. The woman who first gave life, light, and form to Grita's shadowy conceptions of beauty, was seeming to fill a void in her spiritual nature that had remained unknown till she appeared before the mysterious gate of the undiscovered future. Sympathies that were too deep for words, too deep almost for thought, were touched then. A charm her senses felt, and claimed kindred in their two souls. Let me write, reader, that the smallest characteristic of this strange woman, has something original with the marked peculiarities of Grita's amazing prominence, which may single her from the highest rank, while it reminds forcibly of the grandly calm, immovable power and influence of those unfathomable eyes, with their cold, irresistible glitter, which always forced Mrs. Oustan and others to look at her, and always to feel uneasy while they looked. Ah! what an extraordinary expression! what unfathomed power! Mrs. Oustan, her pet of favourites, seemed her object of brilliant occupation. The feature most conspicuous was the studious steadfastness of her inexhaustible attentions. Yes, that quiet deference, that look of pleased, attentive interest to Mrs. Oustan's every move, with a secret gentleness of voice, was added to all the dexterities of extraordinary aptitude and daring independence of thought. Her knowledge of books was extended to almost every language; yet her experience of society was not widely spread. All these made Sibylla Royal the most remarkable being of woman's nature in the world. It was now, by the merest accident, the first interchange took place between the three friends. Up to this hour nothing had been known of Mrs. Oustan's position by any acquaintance. Tranquillity of congenial sentiments made Mrs. Oustan receive this tender tribute with affectionate remembrance. The letter, still in her hand, she had read and replaced in the envelope. She felt a weariness of depression; yet the immense assistance of their careful raising of her spirits reconciled her to this new existence and interesting country, as, too, significantly adopting the first opportunity she devoted that fidelity of gratitude which developed the excellence of her being. This most noble passion purifies from all the dross of humanity, elevating the soul. Those ashes of the smothered flame gathered its inevitable separation, which silenced her as before. She smiled sadly as she put her handkerchief to her face, to hide the betrayal of her feelings.
                  "Oh! Mrs. Oustan! you are crying," whispered Sibylla: "Crying!" She waited after saying those words, looked at her, fixing the unfathomable gray eye full upon the brilliant object of her attention. It seemed like a lurking reminiscence of some abysmal suspicion that Miss Royal's mind was prying into hers; a vivid sense of her telescopic gaze diffused the misty glow to bear index to its perspective, which adequately traversed Grita's conclusions that the character of Miss Royal's telescopic gaze attained an overlooking instrument which produced an electric native light proportionate to the incomparable splendour of her peculiarly strange impressions and conspicuous power of influence, which overcame the extreme feeling, whilst its volcanic majesty combined to conceal the ejection of its blue flame. During the remarkable phase of its inextinguishable evidence, her companion's illuminated consequence soothed profusely the sorrow-stricken exile. Fortunately, the never-ceasing accumulations gradually became precluded from possibility. Grita blindly, ignorantly, acted for the best, in shaping her ends to meet with those unquestioned benefits becoming more and more assimilated where courtesy and finest feeling acquired well-remembered eloquence.
                  The doctor now thought to perform his miracle in a pharmacopæial consolation of systematizing woman's caprice to criticism of her curiosity.
                  "We do not object," said his sister, to brother Albert's art-critic example as fruit of his confidence in man's knowledge of our sex, but exercised for his benefit. We will turn his practical result to our own degree—transport ourselves to music and her sister song. Come, Mrs. Oustan, I am tired of brother Albert's chat; let's turn the tables with a winning hand."
                  "In that case I wish you happiness," said Dr. Royal. "Shall I not be allowed my old place, Mrs. Oustan?" interposed the faithful attendant.
                  "You are to play?" asked the widow of her medical friend, with her eyes diverted significantly at the place they had left, for she was by common consent placed every night at the piano, and she had rather be excused for that night, as too absorbed to sing.
                  "Are you resolved?" he asked.
                  "I am, and claim from your honour the acceptable delight."
                  "I will play it," he said, and struck the notes most passionately as he touched the guitar. His voice imparted to the music his resolution, as with lingering fondness he sang the mournful, tender song, the very essence of purity: 
                        
                           "I may not love thee; but within my heart,
                           When night and darkness set my spirit free,
                           And I sit musing from the world apart,
                           There is a low, deep voice that tells of thee.
                           That voice is sweet and mournful as the tone
                           Of far Æolian music heard in sleep,
                           Or the wild cadence of a spirit lone,
                           O'er the hush'd waters of the midnight deep."
                        
                     
                  
                  Those chords kept Mrs. Oustan's attention riveted on the music, and Sibylla's fondly cherished brother Albert's voice and every action.
                  "I am not so ungrateful nor forgetful, Dr. Royal, of such evenings, as your conduct and opinion to-night asserted. I have heard and felt more than you think."
                  He saw the red spot on her cheek, and a faint sigh fluttered from her lips which she tried vainly to suppress. Her face grew pale, her eyes glanced more intently on the waves tossing against the steps, and bathing the tips of her immaculate skirts, which lay in ample folds. He added softly at the sudden cessation of their converse, "I only know that I am near you when I sing." No words could have expressed so delicately that she understood his friendship, as the kind blue eye, whose slightest change of expression she learned to interpret so well, looked at her appealingly pealingly, beseeching her never to sigh again. She took his arm as they rose from their chosen seat, and with an accustomed friendliness proceeded from one end of the old footpath to its terminating wall within the shrubbery walks, talking together. Albert Royal was sufficiently practised in anatomy, and confirmed his law by professional experience: she must cease those awful sighs which unnerved him, expressing in downright terms his advice and accurate knowledge of her danger, with a polite assurance of his indefatigable care of the escaped terms of her difficulty.
                  "Consider well," he said; "you shall not be so distressed. This unaccountable melancholy shocks and distresses me."
                  He spoke with extreme feeling and kindness. Mrs. Oustan appeared quite frightened at his suspicions of her disease.
                  "These words I say seriously, on my word, Mrs. Oustan, from my heart. Your delicate constitution will sink into sleepy exhaustion, which is startling now. Remember your duty, madam. Try no quack remedy. As my patient, you understand, I will nurse the attack; and with your permission be your medical attendant."
                  She laughed. "The proposal, Dr. Royal, is only one of your many acts of goodness."
                  Yet neither the doctor's looks nor searching questions appeared to disturb those depths, as he called them. She now answered him composedly ly, for she was too much absorbed by waking impressions.
                  While they were walking slowly along, Miss Royal stopped in her sudden return just before them.
                  "Well, brother Albert, have you played your trump card?"
                  "No, no," he replied with earnestness;" kindly leave us, like a friend, Sibylla."
                  Again she strolled off leisurely from the point of the famous footpath to the Celestial Pilot.
                  "Go, Sibylla! Mrs. Oustan and myself are speaking professionally."
                  "Well," replied the sister, "what have you found out? I promise to remain, brother Albert, and differ from you in the view I take of the case. Yes, yes! we will wait for events. I find there are some hours of evening left. Let music speak to us to-night in a happier language than yours. For the present, at least, Mrs. Oustan, won't you take your old place?" Miss Royal inquired: "Mrs. Oustan always expected, you know, to occupy the old stool before the piano, and regale us with music which she knew by memory," commenting upon her foiled determination. She was provided with a combination of conditions essential to the tranquillity of her preparation to do that which she could not do. The struggle speedily terminated in a stimulating song. Kindly and unaffectedly she kept her place at the piano, displaying a courage and victory over spirits which formed her incomparable best. The chair stood near to her side in which Miss Royal was an accustomed occupant—the famous rocking-chair. In majestic silence she was quieting herself by riveted attention unutterably beautiful. Sometimes her fingers touched notes with a strange, feverish energy, and she would linger by the music-stand; but most usually, since they met, Mrs. Oustan kept the place at the piano, and then and there, beside her favourite singer, Miss Royal would unremittingly play or sing as if music was their only refuge from self. With this accomplished effort, Sibylla cast one quick glance at Mrs. Oustan, and taking a piece of music suddenly from the stand, asked for some of those melodies "brother Albert so loved to hear, as I do, so much." Mrs. Oustan's fingers flew over the keys nervously. She stopped and turned a page of the music, and touched the keys with a surer hand.
                  "Shall I play one of my pet pieces?" looking down at it while she spoke.
                  "Yes, yes, if you please," ejaculated the doctor, as he threw himself carelessly into a chair always at her left.
                  She started the soft, plaintive, dying tenderness of her rich, high soprano, which imparted a witching pathos to the Andante con moto, composed by Richards.
                     
                        
                           "Oh, whisper what thou feelest,
                           That no unhallow'd ear
                           May listen to the music
                           Of words to me so dear;
                           But if their tone should falter,
                           And on thy lips should die,
                           Oh, let their honeyed sweetness
                           Be gather'd from thy sigh."
                        
                     
                  
                  She rose from the piano after its exquisite finish, and a faint smile struggled to live on her lips, but died away from them as they looked at her. It told at what sacrifice her outward composure was maintained. In a few seconds she swept through the bright and radiant glow of lamp-light that now dazzled her in the drawing-room where she spent some of the happiest evenings of her life. She held out her hand to Miss Royal, whose hand closed gently around hers; the three said "good night," and she was gone immediately to her room, escorted by the elegant gallantry of the doctor's politeness. It was a nightly privilege, a stipulation of regard for her safety, that he should see her across the broad lawn to the entrance of the Hall. So far and no farther should he come.
                  "I shall see you at breakfast, I hope?" was the doctor's inquiry.
                  "Yes; I shall be down to meet your sister."
                  "Remember your third condition," he said, confidentially, as Mrs. Oustan went in at the folding door; and he stood there below on the broad gravel crescent, meditating: "These events must have a meaning; these events must lead to a result."
                  The sunlight of her chamber, and months in these new scenes among these kind-hearted people, had been beneficial to our heroine. Evidently now her mind was occupied with the message she had received from Dr. Royal, in behalf of information she had been fortunate enough to obtain in reference to the high estimate in which the garrison surgeon was held at this Point of Comfort. However precocious her suggestion, she avails of the access afforded, with utmost credit to herself and all her impressibility; having paid the ceremonial mark of respect to a friend who had been better than a mother; while, too, the voluntary demonstration maintained the privilege of expressing a grateful sense to a benefactor's kindness and touching sympathy. Could she ever forget Doctor Percy? The impression of that physician's healing testimonial and gentle care in the sick-room tended to cement more firmly the friends, without translating thoughts long banished from her mind, nor once reverting to her forlorn wretchedness, shame, and self-reproach, so derogatory to the dignity of a wife. The confession of that secret! Mrs. Oustan paused to think in the shadow of uncertainty. "Is there anything wrong unconnected with the memory of Dr. Percy?" The scrupulous woman was tempted by gratitude to risk the agreeably charm of his acquaintance, and soothed reason thus, some time after her arrival near his post again. The Old Point was indeed a comfort. Grita concluded her friendly evidence by a card, simply engraved, "Mrs. G. Y. Oustan;" underneath the name, Du Nord, her city. The presentation received peculiar attention; and she had been handed his lines in correspondence, by the favourable opportunity of Dr. Royal's kindness. The letter came in formal reply, written with martial distinctness:
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 "Monday, 20th, 1859.
                                 "MADAM:
                              
                              "Dr. Percy has just found out who Mrs. Oustan is, and will call immediately.
                              
                                 "Very respectfully,
                                 "EDWARD J. PERCY.
                                 "FORTRESS MONROE."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  Mrs. Oustan drew a heavy breath of relief, as if having stepped over the stile. "All is well that ends well," felt our heroine; "really a friend in a new place." It came like the dove of hope and comfort. Surgeon Percy arrived at the hall the day appointed. And, reader, let us consider the circumstance, which shows such unusual good feeling. If he came from charity, pure charity, did it not deserve her extraordinary praise? as, too, a contribution of high-toned ceremony? As she expected, the best of good old friends came, on one of his brisk mid-day walks along the airy road and over the moor leading to Hellespont bridge, opposite Grita's windows; from which we must digress a moment, to afford a glimpse of wild romance and beauty.
                  The fairy form of Zabeth Penoese was thrown from that very central arch out of a light buggy, as she was driven over it by a friend and lover. The fiery horse committed her to the hurrying waters of the Leam. She seemed a diving pearl, robed in a fleecy ball-dress, as she was on her way to the Hygeia party; but a changing current of life swept her on the swelling tide, and she danced home on the green sea-foam, with a bouquet and a fan wafting in one hand above the surface. 
                        
                           "Along that bridge Surgeon Percy rode;
                           Proudly his red roan charger trode;
                           His helm hung at the saddle-bow;
                           Well by his visage, you might know
                           He was a stalworth knight and keen,
                           And had in many a battle been.
                           His eyebrow dark and eye of fire
                           Show'd spirit proud and prompt to ire;
                           Yet lines of thought upon his cheek
                           Did deep design and counsel speak.
                           His thick moustache and coal-black hair,
                           Bedeck'd with gray, showed wisdom rare."
                        
                     
                  
                  Under the Great Gable he alighted. Conducted by the servant to an empty drawing-room, he sent up the messenger to announce his call, which was immediately acknowledged by Mrs. Oustan. The sun shone dazzling bright as she stepped lightly across the shelving lawn from the ball-room balcony. Her colour heightened as suddenly she met the surgeon, taking a survey of the lovely summer place, marking the margin of the deep, and the rampart there. 
                        
                           "Half breeze, half spray, came whistling by,
                           And each hour brought a varying tale."
                        
                     
                  
                  A really distinguished, handsome-looking man stood on the broad piazza under the Gable, irresistibly courteous and considerate; ready to make allowance for the novel encounter. His flashing eye studied at a glance the graceful figure of a lady in a black and white Swiss muslin. The surgeon moved towards her with the same ease of manner, and in undress uniform. He stood a moment in silent amazement; then cordially they met, clasping hands, and shaking a hearty renewal of welcome. Surprised inexpressibly, he said:
                  "Mrs. Oustan!"
                  She was as earnest and responded:
                  "Dr. Percy! Let me hope that I may be able to explain my presumption. Let me inform you now, exactly, of my lone condition, wishing to meet your approval by kindly reverting to former well-remembered obligations. It will be unreasonable for me to weary you with additional thanks for this disclosure of your old and unselfish traits."
                  Her bright, brown eyes welcomed him with a feverish excitement on her cheek.
                  "Madam, I am inexpressibly glad," said the surgeon, looking at the same time in her face very attentively, "for this singular chance of renewing an acquaintance I have never forgotten, while you had the advantage of a pleasure I should in time have realized. It is strange to look back," said he, standing before her yet, and surprised beyond all expression.
                  Retracing their steps from the piazza to the cool and airy hall, attending to trifling ceremony, Surgeon Percy and Mrs. Oustan seated themselves on the large old-fashioned hair-cloth sofa that stood between the doors, spread as usual to the open breeze, and before the drawing-room lintel posts. After the prelude of ceremony, the friends, so strangely cemented by a memory, greatly rejoiced over their fortune. They resumed their seats in two great rocking-chairs opposite the open window and door, looking out on the summer heaven, sending sunbeams on the snowy sails; thence they viewed the blue sea-waves. Boughs of saplings were mingling with locust branches to meet the river-breeze.
                  "Mrs. Oustan," observed Surgeon Percy, "I must revert to your tiny messenger, received duly, as you know. But I am sincerely glad to improve this opportunity, yet wonderfully astonished to see you, my little friend of West Point. Can you think of my interpretation of your unexpected introduction? I held that card before me, and asked my wife, 'Mrs. Percy, who is this lady? I remember no such name; I know none of that name at the North.' We wondered the more, for she was as much in the dark as myself. Again, I made an effort to grasp the new idea, and ran over the names of numerous friends whom I might have expected to meet, and those in and out of the army. Another search, another glance, and I found out who Mrs. Oustan was. Excessively was I surprised to read, and so distinctly, its truth; for your features blazed before my eyes as if you had presented yourself. It is very singular; very, very remarkable. 'What a synopsis of the case!' I remarked to Mrs. Percy, as I explained the object of your meaning—recalling memories of my little friend from that Point, when I promised to make her acquainted with you; which was denied us both by her confinement to a bed of illness for many weary months. 'Mrs. Oustan has chosen not to forget the past, which I shall appreciate, my dear wife, by this arrangement—that you will, on leaving your sick-bed, I hope now in a few days, accompany me to see our little stranger, and to offer our care and protection, should she need it; certainly our hospitality during her sojourn at the Hall.' The proposal we both extend and desire. I desire especially that you shall accept."
                  Warmly she expressed a grateful appreciation of their rich-toned politeness.
                  "You are not at all changed," he continued, "but paler than usual.—Now I must tell you something very striking about this our meeting. Do you remember the morning we passed so seriously together in your room at the Flag-Staff? Seven years since then, I have kept all sacred—had a lively recollection of two incidents connected with Mrs. Oustan which transpired there. First, I have not forgotten I was obliged to tell you of a lurking distrust, which certainly existed in former times; while I poured the profaning bitterness of this world's wisdom into your heart—that innocent mind; while your every better feeling recoiled from my high permission, standing at the beginning in the position of the chosen depositary of your closest secrets. In other words, its overwhelming receipt of confidence was hoarded; that was my consolation indelibly written, as a hard truth. You must have learned an inevitable lesson. It was indeed a memorable day for a surgeon's diary. In the turn which affairs have taken, I am your true old friend, ready, willing, and desirous of serving you in any way. Command my attentions as friend or brother, professionally, at all times. Now it is over, I shall claim to go beyond, and ask that 'splendid' cousin's name?"
                  Unhesitatingly she replied, "Colonel Rutland land," still talking and laughing in the best spirits. He started, exclaiming with sudden excitement:
                  "Mrs. Oustan! Rutland! Rutland! a noble fellow, I know him well; a brilliant man, a superior officer; always beloved in the service, none stand higher. Is it possible! Marvellous concatenation of circumstances! Are you not amazed as I am, to meet the living and its dead secret, alive again? How curious, how strange! Rutland!"
                  Self-possession was overdone, for reflections like these were so startling, it was almost distracting. With an expression very painful, for the sad look was not yet erased, she spoke, after listening attentively to the surgeon, brought face to face with its hard truth; and her overwhelming obligations for that mighty confidence. She had, by her very card 'Du Nord,' expressed gratitude and admiration for the well-remembered gentleness and firm interposition which had strengthened her unchangeable conduct during the remaining years of her married life, and after she had imposed on him such unparalleled trust; while the active contention on his part had awakened conviction to a holier faith. He went on to say:
                  "Yes, madam, so intelligent was the impress of pain graven on my mind at that rehearsal of your absolute agony, and the struggle it cost you to preserve appearances while all alive to the unwillingness to part from its paroxysm, that it gave to my recollections an expression that can never be obliterated; its features were fixed so inflexibly passive in its resignation, and so shockingly unnatural, so cold and insensible. Let me tell you now, seven years since then, that one memory was traced in the very name of Mrs. Oustan. On your card the letters spoke out in living impress. Can you startle now to think that I took the earliest moment to assure you of my sympathy? eager under such circumstances to meet you again, and trust I shall resume the same deep interest, with friendship. Those features then were, and are now, such as I had never witnessed on the field of ghastly death, nor has my hospital experience of war-service such a record of pain. Never! a countenance so agonized never fell under my eye. But that look, that memory on your face stands graven alone; it could not ever be erased. The hysterical vehemence, tears, sobs, that so violently agitated your form, from head to foot convulsed, must have cost what I saw. But that secret I shrouded, slightly indistinct, from time; while in the interval of sojourns it cast a fresh light, in consequence of a general inference drawn from military objects. Every new face of an officer attracted contemplation—my brother officer, married or single. I wondered who—among the hundreds crossing and recrossing our various stations and elsewhere— who could that 'splendid' cousin be? The youthful hope, the secret regret failed not to continue through manly compassion. Oh, thought I, what hopeless uncertainty of repose! However, with all due respect to the passionate outburst of the romantic episode, I did reverence with all my power, leaving no place to dissolve the time-honoured home tie—the well-beloved wife, the mother—ah! was not its record on volcanic grounds? Marvellous to say, madam, it is marvellous my little friend and the officer, the 'splendid' cousin, now stood before me preëminently to each other at Fort Leavenworth. The intimate relation of that secret surrounded me there at that post. The stirring significance inclined to a confidential instruction. The actual living with the dead was there veiled in a mystery. But I roused up; the excitement was in a manner clear and satisfactory, yet an idea supposed it to be Rutland! Then for years, and there only in our lives, we met first, and last we parted. While in the presence of his unrivalled distinction, there seemed to me some impressible signification over that special officer. And he was a mark of great comment. Many others thought it very strange that Rutland was not a married man, with so many honours, and his refining sway of fascinating talent, which bore elegant testimony to his heirship and fortune, making him everywhere appear a reasonable and brilliant prize for the favours of fair rivals. Really, we marvelled and commented on his perfectly expressed indifference to affection and love, with so many beautiful women as his opportunities presented. He plumed himself inconceivably insensible to their fair charms; and, too, continued blind to the real state of your embassadorial spy. And never more apparently than. now, and in your presence, were the mysteries of that affinity between you so clear. It comes back and up from those garrison walls inscribed with an iron pen. A memorable coincidence of our impressions is linked alike by my every recollection of Granville Rutland."
                  Grita's reflecting response was, "There! Dr. Percy, my first letter to that dearly loved cousin was sent to Fort Leavenworth, but he received it at Laramie."
                  "Well, well, my little friend, still clinging to that past," said the surgeon, seeing another volcanic suppression when she wiped away the storm-tear.
                  "It seems an article of faith," said Grita earnestly. "I shall, kind friend, try to be worthy your great feeling; touching indeed your delicate interest."
                  Her eyes sparkled, her face was suffused with a soft blush. "It is indeed the echo of bygones. But I rejoice to tell you we have flown to each other by that letter-communion you refused; even kind as was that interposition then. Now, deeper, warmer enthusiasm lives. God grant it may live forever! Granville Rutland is still unmarried; within the last few days I have received his letter by the latest steamer from the Pacific coast. We may yet be—one." She laughed with a sad heart. "Unfortunate soldier-automaton, far, far away, too far from each other!"
                  To this ingenuous statement the surgeon insisted that she should comprehend his continued esteem for so rare a gem of constancy.
                  "Pray, don't forget, madam, I take all possible interest in your affairs so coexisting. Cheerfully would I do anything to promote the marriage settlement. Let me know what happens. Now, my valued friend, I must tell you of my other little keepsake, in token of you. It was and ever will be irresistibly delightful. I shall never forget your kind words of invitation to enter your room. On occasions I was strongly reminded of visits to your sick-chamber. The salutation and farewell of those graceful little episodes has no equal. I never heard its striking notes from another being. The perfect delivery and animation of spirit riveted my attention. Here, at the Old Point again, we turn another page of that tender music; or will it be a significant trump-card?"
                  These morning hours were ended with proven friendship, and Surgeon Percy drove home to the fortress, to appoint an interview and visit from his wife. In a few days she had the honour to hail the noble friends, and she found imposing proportions of goodness distinguished in the lovely form of Mrs. Percy, with unfading richness of social attractions and excellence of her illustrious rank as woman, wife, and daughter of the eloquent and eminent qualities of an exalted man, an American chief-justice.
                  We must leave Grita, surrounded by the exquisite delights of their most noble care and affection, while we are to finish the first volume of their mighty love, which is my loyal mode of meeting charges that have been brought against our hero and heroine. She, particularly, with all her real or imputed faults, must remain to this day a peculiar original. The outline of herself is the same. Thus preserved and hallowed for her sake are these my representations of her character. If opposite points greatly vary, or should the favourable opinion of her sex be as much open to discussion as ever, I will repeat, for the disposition of their lights and shades, be it remembered, the development of facts proven has been treated according to the principles of her triumphs of moral justice, to see truth established, and the falsehood of her self-interested accusers made manifest. Decide, fair reader, if, in our unfinished personal history of her reign, "woman's influence" is denounced by a train of evidence scarcely credible. Are such friendships usual among shameless wantons?
                  
                  Thus animated, the pen of her historian hands down to her family few this heirloom. Soft melancholy renders still more touching the tangled chain of their mighty volume of love, the hero and heroine of the nineteenth century. What a strange destiny was theirs! Granville's and Grita's lives, in their changes and vicissitudes; their partings and their meetings; where they met; their inquietudes and persecutions. We are awake to their thrilling recollections, and alive to see their faith, which had power to allay anguish, to gild the front of shame itself, and substitute the sceptre for the iron rod of justice. But in the celestial perspective we are to look upon the composition of their grand nebula, ungirdling in singular degree the impressive contemplation of the Fixed Stars; perforating the conditions of their existence, with the magnifying power to divulge the truth, which, though crushed to earth, shall rise ascendant in the Fixed Stars. 
                        
                           "Astra regunt homines, sed regit

                  The material of this volume is exclusive to Eras; the period of primeval earth is tenacious to its topography. I summon up your strength to watch and wait for the beautifully preserved "1860," reposing its Era under the light of inspiration approximating to the unknown limit of its marvellous vellous destiny. We wait and watch on the verge of her terminating five years for the divine origin of their course, announcing, Only Believe! with their principle applied to their final fulfilment of promises to them which believe. Monstrous as it may seem, we close the latest language of the telescopic gaze by the miracle of knowledge, shown by the visible and invisible power deified in the form of the prophetess' soul. Also in solemn form of words we ally ourselves to the belief and language taken in its Scriptural text: "When the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the Lord hath truly sent him." So even has Sibylla's word lived, while we watch and wait for 1860. We argue prophecy announces divine prescience. It is impossible therefore to over-estimate the importance of the prophetic evidence of Holy Scripture. The sacredness attached to her spiritual organization is conscious of the impulse given. The prophecy of coming events is symbolic of the periods so marked with prophecy in the Bible; while Sibylla's overpowering manifestation by word of mouth shows, too, her period, during which time her prophecies are delivered to correspond with the national and individual history of 1860.
                  And now, dear reader, this volume of work I have finished. Will you be ready and prepared to believe? The tender association that entwined around this attached volume, to Granville and Grita, will be inexpressibly touching in the solemn discourse of prophecy; in the solemn dialect and depths of their devotion, tried by the alchemy of faith, as in His holy temple they keep silence before Him. Beautiful silence! voiceless till five years aspires to converse with its Maker in the presence of His anointed One. Granville and Grita, amid fulfilments, unfold the germ of their existence to blossom as the fleur de souvenance, in the presence of their conjunctive, hallowed by the Fixed Stars ascendant. Thus auspiciously begins their union, twining garlands of love to the prophecy of disunion, made one with their historical and national romance from 1860 to the time predicted.
                  PEACE!
