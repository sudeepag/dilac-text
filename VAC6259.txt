               IN TWO PARTS.
               
                  PART I.
                  THE MARKET-PLACE.
                  
                     
                        
                           "O Isabel! dost thou not see
                           A shape of horrors here?"
                        
                     
                  
                  "I DONE gone b'leeve dar's any devil!"
                  "Laws! Phillis, you's de mos' onbelieving nigger! I tells you dar's a debbil,
                     sure's ever you're born, chile. Don't ye s'pose I know? Didn't I set up with
                     Miss Kezzy de Brayton, she dat was one ob de grand folks, dat night she died,
                     gal? Laws! chile, 'twas awful, 'deed it was; never wants to see no mo' dying
                     pillers, 'cept they're downy—same's dem what JESUS makes. Blood creep all over,
                     chile—hear de words dat woman use.
                  "I stan's over her with the gruel dat I's jest made, nice and hot, and
                     says—
                  
                  "'Missis, I hopes you feels more comfortable, now;' when she ups with her hand,
                     so thin and ringy, jest like birds' claws, and throws de hot gruel all over my
                     face.
                  "Couldn't help crying out, chile, case my face burn like fire; and says
                     she—
                  "'Good God! if thar's any niggers in heaven, I hope I shall go to hell!'
                  "Needn't look da' way, Phillis, case it's de livin' truth; says she, 'good God!
                     if thar's any niggers in heaven, I hope I shall go to hell!'"
                  Phillis was a bright-looking mulatto girl. A blue print dress fitted closely
                     her neat round form, showing it off to advantage. The shoulders were plump and
                     brown, and the throat full. The hair was clasped about a small head in heavy
                     bands, over which a white handkerchief was jauntily thrown. Aunt Esty, her
                     companion, wore a light loose night-dress, over a black petticoat. Her
                     complexion was ebony, of the deepest shade, and her features decidedly African.
                     Beautiful colors, harmoniously blended, made her head-dress a conspicuous
                     object, while her large black eyes and white teeth gave force and piquancy to
                     the character of her face.
                  Both women sat quietly in the market-place of one of the county towns of the
                     State of Maryland. It was early in the morning—so early that the sun was just
                     beginning to gild the tree-tops. The shrill cry of chanticleer echoed through
                     the blue air; the slopes of the distant hills glistened serenely under the
                     reddening sky. The scent of flowers, the sounds of birds, the stir of the
                     hucksters, the stamping of the market-horses, the tinkling of the change, the
                     happy laugh of the negroes, chaffering with the farmers' wives, the gruff
                     sounds of the butchers as they refused to cheapen their meats or allow for the
                     bones that weighed too heavily in the scales, made up a scene of traffic,
                     eager, noisy and hearty, that is seldom enjoyed beyond the dominions of the
                     South.
                  Phillis and Aunt Esty had made their purchases, and with characteristic
                     nonchalance, finding a corner unappropriated, sat down to await the passing of
                     some friend. Aunt Esty had been telling her dream of the previous night to the
                     young girl, the relation of which had brought out the remark—"I done gone
                     b'leeve dar's any devil." This led to the recital of the death-bed scene, to
                     which Phillis listened with a countenance painted with the strongest
                     emotions.
                  "You better b'leeve you, Phillis, my blood grow mighty cold," continued Aunt
                     Esty; "seem's if I could hear de crackle of de fires down thar, an' the smell
                     ob de brimstone come right under my nose. Well, I jest done gone wipe my face,
                     when I saw Miss Kezzy—laws! chile, may I neber see sich eyes agin! two round
                     fires couldn't a-bin brighter nor redder—burnin' like—and dey was fixed on
                     somethin' onto the foot ob de bed. I jest looked—an' may I be roast in de
                     eberlastin' fire, ef I didn't see de devil hisself, glaring right at Miss
                     Kezzy, with his mouth stretched wide, an' his teeth sort o' gritted—so;" and
                     Aunt Esty set her teeth, and placed her face so near that of Phillis, that the
                     girl gave a scream, and sprang to her feet.
                  
                  The old woman laughed till her head-gear shook, still protesting, with tears in
                     her eyes, that it was true as her "blessed mars'r's gospil," when suddenly a
                     voice rang out—
                  "Clar the way, you niggers! here comes old Mars' Kenneth, on Spitfire!"
                  No sooner were the words spoken than a coal-black horse, guided by a restless,
                     fiery-eyed man, came galloping through the market, trampling on the melons and
                     ripe fruit till the juice ran over the ground, and causing many a shriek of
                     real terror from the groups that sprang dismayed out of his path.
               
               
                  PART II.
                  LAWYER KENNETH.
                  Gaining the outer air, the man took off his wide straw hat, waving it round his
                     head, with a short, sharp cry of satisfaction, coupled with an oath; then
                     turning his steed, whose flanks smoked, and whose slender, beautiful limbs
                     quivered from unwonted exertion, he shouted—
                  "Now, Spitfire! at her again—off, good fellow!"
                  Once more the horse, obedient to the voice of his master, dashed up the long
                     inclosure, and once more returned—the latter time, however, stopping short near
                     the middle of the market. Taking off his hat, and shaking back. The wiry black
                     locks that hung in masses over his temples, Lawyer Kenneth made a haughty bow.
                     The pale, thin face, fea- tures sharply outlined, and of statuesque beauty, the
                     brow unusually wide, under which flashed a pair of deep-set grey eyes, stamped
                     the countenance as one belonging to no common character.
                  He glanced about from stall to stall, as he sat erect, one hand pressing the
                     mane of his magnificent but restless horse, the other holding his hat.
                  "Well, good sirs," he said, his clear voice sounding bugle-like through the
                     roofed market, "I have had my sport; now what's to pay?"
                  No one seemed inclined to answer.
                  "The peaches out yonder," he continued, using an oath and pointing to the
                     floor, "ready-made jelly, by a new process, by horse—entirely new. Spitfire did
                     the work well! So many melons turned into squash!—ha, ha, ha! upon the word of
                     a gentleman, a poor exchange. Potatoes, apples, tomatoes—all mixed in
                     irremediable confusion. Come, come, what shall I charge for mincing you a hash
                     ready for the table?"
                  Still no one spoke. Some of the farmers frowned, and turned away, but all
                     seemed restrained by fear from replying to his insulting speeches. They knew
                     that the lawyer was armed, and, in these moods, reckless.
                  "Well, dummies! I suppose I'm interrupting trade, and Spitfire here is damming
                     up the channels of commerce—so here's some change—divide it as you please." He
                     then emptied a silver mouthed purse in his hand, and, tossing it in the air, a
                     shower of small gold pieces fell in all directions. As he rode off more
                     leisurely than before, the hucksters
                     crowded out of their stalls, and pushing and shouting quarrelled for the
                     money.
                  "They were my peaches!"
                  "They were my melons!" resounded from all directions.
                  "I lost a basket of potatoes."
                  "My tomatoes, fresh picked this morning—every blessed one smashed!"
                  "Drat the infernal villain!" exclaimed a man in a light blue blouse, "he's been
                     off all night, I reckon, on a drunken spree. Been to Georgia—just got
                     home—stopped at the hotel down town last night, and took it into his empty head
                     this morning to spoil our day's work."
                  This man, Davis, had been unanimously chosen to divide the gold which had been
                     gathered, and, after a sharp consultation, put into his hands.
                  "I say, we're clean ridden over by this rich rascal," he added, in a low
                     grumbling voice; for Lawyer Kenneth had stopped, and still sat on Spitfire
                     within the market, frightening the poor mulattoes with his lowering brows and
                     wild eyes bent steadily upon them. "He thinks because he owns a hundred
                     niggers, and a plantation or two down South, that he can trample on us, I
                     s'pose, as he has on the truck. Drat him! Come boys and girls, speak up one and
                     all—give us a fair estimate of what you've lost. You, granny Brewster—I believe
                     all your peaches is gone."
                  "Every blessed one," cried granny Brewster, looking woefully at the mishappen
                     mass at her feet; "grew on two of my very best trees, and was all spoken for by
                     Mistress Kenneth's gal."
                  "Hadn't you been paid for 'em?"
                  "Not a blessed cent," replied the miserly old woman, clasping the money which
                     she had in reality received so tightly in her hands that the nails were almost
                     buried in the flesh.
                  "Well, then, you'll only git the devil's own," replied the distributor, handing
                     over a dollar which she grasped, eagerly. Others now came forward, pressing
                     their claims, and the money was paid off until all were satisfied.

                  PART I.
                  IN WHICH THE READER WILL BE INTRODUCED TO A NEW CHARACTER.
                  
                     
                        
                           "Bonds and afflictions abide me."
                        
                        BIBLE.
                     
                  
                  AMONG those who had sprang back affrighted at the entrance of the lawyer and
                     his powerful steed, was a delicate girl named Lucina. She wore a white cape
                     bonnet, and a dress of grey, thin material, modestly covering throat and arms.
                     A melancholy tinged the natural beauty of her face, a touching sadness seemed
                     thrown like a veil over the large brown eyes, and her small red lips appeared
                     ever ready to grieve.
                  She was evidently an entire stranger, and had been passing from stall to stall
                     too shy almost to ask for the article she wanted. Her color alternately came
                     and went as some of the rough men casually complimented her upon her beauty. It
                     seemed as if she were trying to shrink into a smaller compass, and her brown
                     eyes grew dusky with apprehension.
                  Near the place where she stood, paralyzed by the strange movement that had just
                     taken place, lawyer Kenneth stopped, magnetizing every eye with that dark
                     electrical glance. After staring the sable faces out of countenance, he met
                     Lucina's scared look.
                  "Ha! pretty one!" he exclaimed, "whose yellow girl, or white girl are you?
                     Speak!" he shouted, as she fell back without answering.
                  "Mrs. Kenneth is"—began the girl, but as if with absolute terror, the rest of
                     the sentence was frozen on her lips, and again she strove to shrink yet farther
                     away.
                  "Mistress Kenneth—Mistress Kenneth—humph!" he replied; "madam has been treating
                     herself to a rare piece of flesh and blood since I've been away. Well, Miss
                     Beauty, I have the honor to be your master," he added, with one of his mocking
                     bows; "pretty soon I shall ask you what you think of me. Ha!" he cried, in
                     suppressed tones, "who does the girl make me think of?" then, rising in his
                     saddle, he shouted, "Hi! Spitfire! show your metal, my brave! 
                        
                           "'Off and away
                           Rode the rider and his steed—
                           Off and away to the forest,'"
                        
                      he hummed, almost savagely.
                  While he was going out, and after he was fairly gone, some of the hucksters
                     turned towards the young girl, laughing and hinting among themselves. The
                     indignant blood again crimsoned her cheeks as she read insolence in the
                     familiar manner and the winks they exchanged. Her lips quivered, and she turned
                     to retrace her steps. The black face
                     of Aunt Esty, full of a genial, hearty cheerfulness, here encountered hers.
                  "Don't you mind 'em, honey. Laws, chile! I sees you arn't used to none of this
                     yer nonsense yet; it's a new place to you—but never mind, honey. I'm one of
                     Mars' Kenneth's niggers, an' he's a mighty good marst'r in de main; only, laws!
                     he will drink like a fish when he has them sprees of his'n. Come, honey, we'll
                     tote along togedder. 'Pears to me you isn't like the gen'l run ob slave
                     gals—they isn't often oncommon modest."
                  Lucina's red lips trembled, and the tears seemed ready to fall at this
                     unlooked-for kindness. She clung close to her protector, whose broad, fat body
                     was a sufficient guaranty for her safety, and taking her purchases the two left
                     the market. An old grey-headed farmer who was going their way kindly offered to
                     give them a ride in his light wagon—for Aunt Esty was a favorite with
                     everybody.
               
               
                  PART II.
                  MISTRESS KENNETH.
                  The lawyer, after a few more aimless freaks, turned the head of Spitfire
                     towards his home. The fresh sweet wind blew softly, driving golden-tinged white
                     clouds over the rich blue of the heavens, and giving audible voices to the
                     nodding trees. The gardens on every hand were budding and blooming into
                     splendor, and the reckless man, as he recognized the calm beauty of nature,
                     took off his hat, lifting it reverently, and thus holding it in his hand,
                     ambled along more slowly.
                  A night's or a week's carouse did not leave its marks in red and purple upon
                     him as upon the generality of men. Aside from a disarrangement of dress and
                     hair, and an unnatural vividness in his dark eyes, there was no sign of
                     dissipation. His naturally hollow cheeks were puffed out and tinted a little
                     with exercise—his senses were beginning to return. As he appeared in sight of
                     his own house, he saw Lucina just entering by one of the side doors, and
                     spurred his horse on to the gateway of Washington Grange.
                  The mansion was well appointed without and within. The place belonged of right
                     to him. After the death of its former proprietor, Colonel Hollister, the father
                     of his wife, it was found to be so heavily mortgaged that the young couple
                     might have been dispossessed at any moment. Being a wealthy man, he had
                     redeemed it with a part of his own fortune—but Lawyer Kenneth was a prodigal
                     liver, and of late years had become somewhat embarrassed. The Grange, however,
                     was a modern paradise.
                  Scarlet flowers grew luxuriantly over the pillars, and floated, breathed upon
                     by the wind like spots of ruby, all over the wide front verandah. The building
                     was of grey stone, beautifully ornamented and finished. The gateway, surmounted
                     by an arch, broad and richly stuccoed, was shaded by two rare trees, imported
                     at great expense. They were Tamarind-trees, growing to the height of more
                        than forty feet, and sending their
                     branches with wonderful regularity in graceful ovals from the first offshoot to
                     the top. The lawyer was very proud of them, and regarded their prosperous
                     condition as a proof of his own skill and attention.
                  The grounds were gracefully turfed, and margined with white marble. Here and
                     there, through the perspective of delicate branches and the limbs of young
                     trees, statues gleamed out with a pale, bright light. Vases of southern flowers
                     were set at irregular distances, and through the windows of the great
                     conservatory shone clusters of oranges.
                  As the lawyer sprang from his horse, his groom came forward. None of his slaves
                     dared to touch Spitfire till his master had given the word of command. A
                     strange intelligence characterized this favorite horse of Lawyer Kenneth. He
                     tossed his head haughtily as black Ebony, talking to him, led him towards his
                     stable, and moved as if under compulsion in any other hands but those of his
                     master.
                  The lawyer walked slowly up to the house—his eyes scanning the windows. Nobody
                     seemed stirring. He entered the great hall, hung his hat upon the rack, and
                     striding forward opened a door.
                  Lucina was arranging some trifle on a fanciful stand. At sight of him she
                     started and retreated.
                  "Where is your mistress?" asked the lawyer, standing within the threshold.
                  The girl trembled like a leaf. Those haunting eyes, that seemed making some
                     dumb inquiry—(in truth, each time he saw her he wondered where he had seen her
                     counterpart)— that dark, handsome, yet evil face, thrilled her with a new and
                     oppressive feeling.
                  "Mrs. Kenneth is in her room, I believe, sir," she answered, with perhaps
                     unconscious dignity.
                  The lawyer seemed puzzled. But that he had seen Lucina in the market-place, he
                     would have deemed her a guest of the house—but that was impossible. With his
                     mocking smile he repeated—
                  "Ah! Mrs. Kenneth is in her room, is she? Well, I believe I'll wait till
                        Mrs. Kenneth has come out of her room then."
                  So saying, he turned into the hall. He entered the family sitting-room. A
                     lap-dog, roused from its slumbers, shook itself from its silky bed, raised its
                     large eyes in a lazy, undecided way; but in a moment the little creature sprang
                     towards him, and first with motions of delight, then with sharp, glad yelpings,
                     leaped about him caressingly. This brought a young and pretty girl into the
                     room; her father's arms were extended to receive her.
                  "Oh, papa! the moment I heard Minnie, I knew it must be you, so early in the
                     morning," she cried, when he had released her from his ardent embrace. "Are you
                     quite well?" she asked anxiously, with a glance that sent the blood to his
                     temples.
                  "All right, my pet—though somewhat fatigued; but a nap and a good breakfast
                     will restore me."
                  "And did you see Mag and Hattie? Are they coming?" she inquired.
                  "Yes; cousin Maggie, sure—Hattie, perhaps. Our old neighbor's son, Marshall Randolph, is coming
                     home, I suppose you know. Ah! we shall be all alive here in a week or two."
                  He pinched her cheek, making the faint pink nestling there a ruddy
                     rose-color.
                  "Here is mother," said Amy.
                  The lawyer turned, as if under some restraint. An airy, fragile figure, draped
                     in white, and moving like a cloud, was advancing towards him. The long blue
                     ribbons of her snowy wrapper fluttered as she walked, and the laces on her
                     pretty morning cap made her light, abundant tresses, that danced in curls
                     against her cheeks, look more shining and golden. The blue eye brightened—she
                     held forth her hand in a constrained manner, her lips for a moment were tightly
                     compressed, and her motion, as she moved towards her daughter, seemed to
                     signify a sort of relief that the meeting was over.
                  "Where is Bob? I must make my toilet before breakfast. I haven't seen the face
                     of a single black rascal besides Ebony. Where are they all?" asked Lawyer
                     Kenneth, throwing himself leisurely in a seat, and drawing Amy towards him.
                  "They have been just as lazy and ugly as they could be, since you have been
                     gone, pa; and they haven't come from the quarters yet," said his daughter. "If
                     you had not forbidden it expressly, I should have had a dozen of them
                     whipped."
                  "Why, you little slave-driver!" exclaimed the lawyer; "I'll send you off South,
                     and make you my overseer."
                  "I wish you would," replied Amy, throwing back her curls as she looked up from
                     the frolicking lap-dog; "I should like to punish Hollister with my own hands. I
                     believe I could do it, too—he's an insolent fellow, and deserves it. Why, don't
                     you think"——
                  A warning look from her mother suspended the sentence in air.
                  "Well, well!" cried the lawyer, impetuously, "what next? out with it—and if the
                     scoundrel deserves it, I'll have him shipped off to New Orleans."
                  Mrs. Kenneth turned white.
                  "Why, nothing—very important"—Amy said in a hesitating way—"only—he spoke to me
                     when I thought he ought not to—and—I—struck him with my riding-whip in the
                     face—and he—hasn't dared to be insolent since."
                  "Insolent! h'm—I'll teach him to be insolent! I'm glad, pet, you gave the
                     fellow a lesson. That Hollister is altogether too smart. I begin to see I've
                     made him of too much importance. I must take him down a peg."
                  His valet appearing, the lawyer retired to his room.
                  "Amy! Amy!" cried Mrs. Kenneth, nearing her daughter, and speaking in low,
                     suppressed tones; "I pray be careful how you rouse your father's anger.
                     Remember Holter is white, and these white negroes are terribly revengeful.
                     Never complain of him again. Don't, I pray you, excite your father's
                     suspicions. Sometime, when he is not himself, there will be trouble."
                  All this Mrs. Kenneth repeated rapidly, her cheeks never changing from that
                     ghastly pallor.
                  
                  "I don't care if there is!" exclaimed Amy, her father's hot temper flashing
                     from her eyes. "He presumes altogether too much on his white blood—that's what
                     he does. His manner towards me is not that of a slave towards his mistress. If
                     he has been brought up with me—and I think it was very foolish in you, mamma,
                     to make so much of him—it is no reason why he should dare, speak
                     to me as he has spoken once or twice. And then, the way he looks at me, mother!
                     I can't bear it, and I won't!"
                  She straightened her slight girlish figure, as she spoke, throwing back her
                     little haughty head. Her face bore all the aristocratic finish of her father's
                     classical features. Her countenance expressed the same vivacity and
                     resolution—her eyes the same light, depth and fire.
                  "I am certain Hollister means to be respectful, my dear," said Mrs. Kenneth
                     falteringly. "I don't think he can possibly be actuated by any wrong motives.
                     I'll try and see what can be done with him—your father would be unwilling to
                     sell him, because he earns him a great deal of money; but perhaps he can make
                     him stay in his quarters more, and not come up to the house."
                  "I don't care in what manner, mother—only keep him out of my way," Amy
                     answered. "I don't want to see him."
                  "Where is Lucina?" asked Mrs. Kenneth, moving away.
                  "I don't know," answered Amy. "Yesterday, I set her at work in the parlor, and
                     happening to go in there, I found her looking over my books. I reckon she had
                     to leave them alone in a hurry."
                  "Why should you feel so towards that poor girl?" asked Mrs. Kenneth, looking
                     away from Amy, however.
                  "Oh! because I do hate to see people pretend to be so much above their station.
                     A slave has no business to know how to read; that is what has spoiled
                     Hollister. He knows too much, and pretends to consider white folks his equals.
                     I'll let him see!" and, with another haughty shake of the head, she gathered
                     Minnie under her arm, and left the room. Mrs. Kenneth remained behind for a
                     moment, and assumed a look and attitude of the deepest dejection; then sighing
                     heavily once or twice, she followed her daughter.
               
               
                  PART III.
                  IN THE KITCHEN.
                  The sun was now high, and the blacks were moving in all directions. Heads
                     bobbed around out-houses and the adjacent cabins, and the space about the
                     kitchen swarmed with sable faces. Savory smells pervaded the atmosphere, and
                     slaves were passing and repassing continually with covered dishes.
                  "I say, Dick, mars'r's home—da's ole Spitfire in de stable," said a colored
                     boy, who, in a large check apron, was engaged in some out-of-door work.
                  "Ky! t'ought I smell brimstone when I go by dar, jes now," Dick replied, lounging against a chestnut
                     tree, "Ole Postboy glad to see he, dar say; mighty nice ole fellow, Postboy—but
                     Spitfire! he quarrel wid de oats, 'less mars' orders 'em."
                  The kitchen was all bustle and confusion. Aunt Esty, in her glory and a blue
                     jacket with short sleeves, scolded, laughed, and ordered almost in the same
                     breath. Some of the slave girls, half-dressed, were peeling and mashing
                     potatoes; others were engaged in cleaning fish. The culinary operations were
                     going on with more alacrity than had been conceded to them for a month
                     previous. The master's arrival was like a string that set all the puppets in
                     motion.
                  "Salt, Phillis—quick, nigger!" cried Aunt Esty, turning her reeking face for a
                     moment from the, great fire; "dar, gal, you's spill it—da's bad luck for ye—ye
                     ain't learned to do tings handy, chile. Laws! 'Lascus," she continued, going on
                     with the narrative she had before commenced, "you neber did see
                     such a sight, all your born days. Dar come ole mars', sheop! down dat ar market
                     like a streak ob lightnum. 'Clar! ef Spitfire didn't seem like de ole one
                     hisself."
                  This was addressed to a good-looking negro, her son, who stood leaning his
                     elbow against the projecting shelf.
                  "Da's noffin, ole woman," replied Alascus, "I's seen he drive Spitfire right in
                     de hotel—ole hoofs carry mud all over de carpet. Yah! wasn't de landlor' mad?
                     dissent say nothin', though. Mars' Kenneth don't car for nobody when de wine's
                     in um. Great man, dat Mars' Kenneth—don't car for de devil hisself. Got plenty
                     niggers—plenty gold—don't car for A'mighty hisself. Satan claw he some o' dese
                     yars, sartin—da's so!"
                  "Reckon mars' feel better since he done gone frighten folks to death," said
                     Phillis; "reckon mars' felt kind o' streaked, when he see missis's new yaller
                     gal."
                  "You, Phillis," said 'Lascus, with a sly look of admiration, and a
                     grin that displayed a set of magnificent teeth, "better shet up 'bout yaller
                     gal—like to know wha' you call you'self?"
                  "I'm none of common niggers;" retorted Phillis, bridling her pretty neck and
                     shoulders.
                  "Yah! heah! common niggers is yaller—aristopracy am black. No mean white blood
                     in dese yer veins—good King Pampolo blood—none o' yer mixed stuff; r'al pure
                     grained Africum—da's so!" cried Alascus, lifting himself up.
                  "Come, come, chill'n, hab done your fightin'. Here 'Lascus, take 'long dese
                     yer, fixin's. You, Phillis, dish up de toast. Car'line, off wi' dem taters, or
                     I'll put de broomstick over yer head. Clar de kitchen! ebery soul of ye—g'long,
                     you black chickens!"
                  So saying, Aunt Esty shut herself in, and commenced preparations for a
                     delicious breakfast. A little dish of hominy, another of eggs, a slice of
                     sweet, broiled ham, a delicate round of toast, the wing of a chicken, a cup of
                     well-creamed coffee, and a pot of butter, yellow as a marigold, graced the
                     cleared board. So Aunt Esty sat down alone in her glory.
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER III.
               IN THREE PARTS.
               
                  PART I.
                  IN WHICH LAWYER KENNETH DELIVERS HIS OPINION OF HIS WIFE'S NEW
                     PURCHASE.
                  
                     
                        
                           "The cruel word her tender heart so thrilled,
                           That sudden cold did run through every vein."
                        
                     
                  
                  AFTER breakfast, lawyer Kenneth donned his blue dressing-gown, and a smoking
                     cap which Amy had worked in gold-thread, and taking his amber-mouthed pipe, he
                     followed his wife into her own private sitting-room. This being an unusual
                     freak for that gentleman, Mrs. Kenneth was rather startled, and moving back a
                     little behind the crimson curtains she drew her sewing-table towards her. He
                     sat down by the open window, and it struck his wife that his face looked
                     strangely; but she could not see it as plainly as she might through the
                     delicate wreaths of white smoke that veiled his countenance.
                  The sun lay in broad red swaths, like rich harvests of gold, over the opposite
                     hills; the distant meadows were brightened in its beams.
                  Everywhere, the peaceful day smiled benignly. The flowers were kindled into a
                     richer red—the grass sparkled like tubes of emerald. Lawyer Kenneth glanced
                     over the prospect, and then within.
                  "Well, any news?" he asked coldly.
                  His wife shook her head slightly.
                  "Nothing of importance has taken place, I believe," she answered.
                  "H'm! I should think so. What embroidery is this?" and he lifted a frame filled
                     with bright colors from the wall, where it stood beside him.
                  "Oh! that is—I didn't tell you; I have taken the liberty to buy another slave,"
                     she said, rapidly, yet striving to command her voice. "She is a neat sewer, and
                     embroiders well. That is some of her work."
                  "Accomplished, by heaven! But where," he added, in a tone that soundest like a
                     sneer, "where, my dear madam, did you get the ready cash?"
                  "I bought her partly on time," replied Mrs. Kenneth, "trusting to your
                     generosity to help me out."
                  "Really! quite a romantic step; there must have been something about the girl
                     extremely captivating to your fancy, Mrs. Kenneth," he replied, with a
                     searching look.
                  "She was placed in very unfortunate circumstances," said Mrs. Kenneth, whose
                     lips and hands trembled violently, a having been brought up by a lady in the
                     North, to whose care, I believe, she was consigned in early years. This woman
                     treated her like a daughter; but dying suddenly, it was found that the girl was
                     of southern origin, and might be disposed of. A Northern man, taking advantage
                     of this knowledge, brought her to
                     Virginia, and was about to sell her to a slave-fancier, who was driving a hard
                     bargain. I liked the girl, and, to save her from a worse fate, bought her."
                  "You did!" exclaimed the lawyer, biting the mouth-piece of his pipe nearly
                     through, as he paused for a moment. "What a philanthropist you are! I never
                     before heard you confess to any qualms of conscience on that subject. But women
                     grow pious as they grow old. Well, I must say you have not done badly—she will
                     admit of a pretty nice speculation. She's rather a fancy piece of flesh, in the
                     way of looks—almost as white as Amy. Quite her size, too, and not bad-featured.
                     People will take them for twins—what will you do then?"
                  "Nonsense, Mr. Kenneth!" but the voice faltered, the whole frame trembled; and
                     had not the curtain thrown its fictitious crimson upon her, he would have noted
                     the blanching cheek, the whitening lip.
                  "What are you going to do with her?" asked lawyer Kenneth, "and how long have
                     you had her?"
                  "I have had her two months, and intend her for a sort of dressing maid and
                     companion. Amy is so much in company, and I am alone."
                  "Hell!" said the lawyer under his breath, as his pipe fell to the floor from
                     his hands. For a moment he gazed about him in a strange, uneasy way; then he
                     asked, briefly:
                  "Where is she?"
                  "She is not far off," replied his wife.
                  "Send for her," he said, shortly.
                  His wife gave one quick, troubled glance towards him, and after a moment of
                     indecision, touched the bell upon her table. Lucina appeared at the door; she
                     beckoned her in, and then bent her head over her work.
                  The lawyer turned himself partly about, raised his slippered foot to the back
                     of a chair that stood near, and causing the girl to remain before him, he
                     coolly surveyed her from head to foot. She shrank droopingly and with burning
                     cheeks from his measured stare.
                  "Well, girl, what's your name?" he asked.
                  "Lucina Stewart," she replied, modestly.
                  "And who was your master before you came here?"
                  "Master, sir; master!" ejaculated the girl, faintly, casting a look of anguish
                     towards Mrs. Kenneth, who was striving to appear calm, "I never had a master,
                     sir."
                  "Oh, well, mistress, then—mistress—who was your mistress?"
                  "I—they say—oh, indeed sir, I cannot tell an untruth, I never had a mistress,
                     sir."
                  "I told you how she was reared," faltered Mrs. Kenneth; "she was not aware of
                     her—misfortune."
                  "Misfortune!" sneered the lawyer, angrily, "why, madam, you are almost ripe for
                     the kingdom!"
                  "Where did you live before you came here?" he asked, turning again to Lucina;
                     "or perhaps you didn't live any where."
                  "I did live in Boston, sir," replied the girl.
                  "The devil you did!" he exclaimed. He then glanced from her to his wife.
                  
                  "She was sent there to be educated," said Mrs. Kenneth, faintly.
                  "Educated—thunder! I beg your pardon. I forget I am in the presence of educated
                     ladies;" he said, ironically.
                  "Now, Miss Lucina—what is it?—oh! Stewart—a royal name, too—MISS
                     LUCINA STEWART! Am I to understand that you have been to boarding-school?"
                  "Yes, sir; I have been to boarding-school," replied Lucina, her cheek
                     reddening, and a little fire coming into her dark eyes, while Mrs. Kenneth bit
                     her lip with vexation.
                  "And do you play the piano?"
                  "Yes, sir."
                  "And speak French?"
                  "A little, sir."
                  "Draw, play, and embroider, hey?"
                  "Yes, sir;" the tone was quiet, but firm.
                  With one chilling oath the lawyer sprang from his seat, kicked his pipe under
                     the table, and stood with folded arms before his wife as he said:
                  "Madam! will you inform me who and what the devil this girl is,
                     whom you presume to take into your family without my knowledge? This female
                     Admirable Crichton is not at all suited to your wants or mine. I am not in the
                     habit, as your father was, of purchasing accomplished nigger-wenches for very
                     obvious purposes. Now, what does this mean, madam? Are you intending to save
                     the expense of masters for Amy, or what are you trying to do?"
                  With a wonderful calmness, a command that covered the fierce bounding of her
                     pulse, and the quick flowing back of the blood against her heart, his wife
                     replied:
                  "Everard, you ought to thank me for my discernment. Every accomplishment, you
                     know, will bring so many more hundred dollars; and as I obtained her at a great
                     bargain—if ever we wish to sell her—she would be worth more than a thousand,
                     cash down."
                  "True enough! I didn't think of that," said the lawyer, with a peculiar side
                     glance toward his wife. "And, by the way," he added, slowly penning something
                     on his memorandum—"by the way, Dole Baker wants just such an article. Well, my
                     dainty girl," he said, pretending not to notice the quick gasp his wife gave,
                     as she turned to the window for air, "do you think you shall like me awhile for
                     a master, till I provide you with a younger one?"
                  The girl's eyes seemed for a moment to swim in blood, so red and bright was the
                     angry color by which they were permeated. Then throwing upward one earnest
                     glance, as if imploring heaven, she clasped her hands; tears swam in her
                     pensive eyes, the veins stood out on her fair brow with excess of emotion, and
                     turning from the beseeching face of the lawyer's wife, she exclaimed:
                  "Oh! sir, I am very wretched. I am no slave; I have never been a slave, never!
                     I am as free as you are. I believe I am Southern born—so I have always been
                     told, but my mother was no slave—oh, no—but an honored, loving
                     wife. There is some plot, some dreadful plot in operation to disgrace me. I
                     have read of such things. I have been basely wronged, outraged, deceived—lured
                        away, under the pretence of going
                     home, from those who would have protected me. Oh, have pity on me, have pity on
                     me! let me go back, and I will work my fingers to the bone that I may repay you
                     what you have lost by me."
                  The tears, the beseeching attitude would have moved any but a heart accustomed
                     to look indifferently on human suffering.
                  Lawyer Kenneth threw back his head and burst into an insulting laugh.
                  "Why, look here, little fancy piece; upon my word! you'd make a famous actress!
                     Pity you weren't taller. But I've a word for your private ear—now listen!" and
                     he bent his searching eyes upon her face, till she shrank again—"I'm generally
                     considered a good master to my people—too good, by heaven! When they are honest
                     and try to please me, I am reasonable; but the minute I find them shamming,
                     they go down South. It isn't in my nature to be cruel to my negroes, and it
                     isn't according to my will to have such insolent upstarts as you about me—do
                     you hear? So, you daughter of a Southern lady, remember that all who live on my
                     place, with the exception of my wife and daughter, are—slaves."
                  The girl seemed stunned into marble, moving either eye nor foot, as the lawyer
                     left the room. Then a bewildered look passed over her face. She shuddered as
                     she encountered the pitying gaze of Mrs. Kenneth, and sinking on her knees she
                     burst into tears, and sobbed in an abandonment of grief.
                  "Foolish girl! foolish girl! I told you I would some time find a way of escape
                     for you; I told you if you would only be silent, you should have a pleasant
                     home. Why, why have you destroyed your only hope!"
                  "Oh, a slave! a slave! a slave!" cried the girl with a choking voice.
                  Why did the lips of the lawyer's wife tremble? Why did she force back her
                     tears? She had never been a gentle mistress. There were but few slaves on the
                     place but feared her more than the master, sweet faced and delicate as she
                     was.
               
               
                  PART II.
                  AMY'S PROPOSITION.
                  Amy appeared at the door, flushed and warm.
                  "Mamma, I can't possibly practice, unless somebody fans me!" she cried
                     impetuously.
                  "Get Joe, or some of the boys," replied her mother.
                  "Oh, they're too careless; first they fan and then they chase flies, and I have
                     to keep stopping in my lesson. Can't Lucina come?"
                  "I want Lucina."
                  "So do I!" cried Amy; and the little head was shaken with a haughty toss.
                  Amy was an only child, and her word was law both with mother and father. If she
                     appeared tolerably amiable, it was because she had always had her own way.
                  
                  "Well, Lucina, go for an hour," exclaimed Mrs. Kenneth, in a fretful voice; "I
                     am not mistress of my own house."
                  Lucina was in despair. She had no motive—no hope—no courage. The beautiful mind
                     God had given her was, for the time, as much crushed by the blow that had
                     fallen upon her as if it was a palpable thing; and she could feel it quiver,
                     see it bleed. As drop by drop of this real lifeblood fell, her heart sunk
                     heaver and heavier in her bosom. She felt like the man upon whom the walls of
                     his prison were closing, every day shutting out one window more. The last
                     resort had failed, and she saw before her only hopeless slavery. So she obeyed
                     whatever command came first, with a blind, unquestioning obedience, but hardly
                     knowing why. She followed her young mistress—mechanically took the fan to which
                     she pointed, and began her task.
                  "What's the matter with your eyes?" asked Amy, pausing abruptly.
                  "Nothing," replied Lucina, mildly.
                  "Nothing!" exclaimed Amy; "now, don't be sullen. You've been crying. I think
                     you may be very well contented with your lot. Father and mother are just as
                     kind as can be to their slaves, if they only behave well. By the way, have you
                     seen Hollister, our carpenter? He's a splendid fellow, almost white, and
                     noble-looking as father. I've just thought of it! he'll be the very man for
                     you, and we'll have a wedding. You shall wear the handsomest dress I've got—my
                     white satin."
                  Lucina stared as her young, mistress rattled on, but did not comprehend. She
                     had not yet come out of that strange stupor.
                  "Hollister is very clever," continued Amy, growing quite red over her imaginary
                     match, "and handsome as any white man you ever saw, and as papa
                        never sells his slaves, unless they're very bad,
                     why, you and he might live together a great many years."
                  "What do you mean?" asked Lucina, suddenly waking up to the impression that she
                     was the subject of this speculation.
                  "Why, I want you to marry Hollister."
                  "I marry! I am not going to be married to any one—more especially a"—
                  Before the dreaded word escaped her lips, she remembered that a hopeless
                     captivity was also her destiny, and bowing her head on her arm, she groaned
                     from the very depths of her spirit.
                  "Perhaps we may not consult you in the matter. I wish you to understand that
                     you belong to us, and we don't allow our black people to put on
                     airs."
                  "Black!" Lucina glanced from her own hand to that of the young
                     girl, resting on the ivory keys. Both were dark, for Amy was a brunette.
                     Perhaps Amy's was the clearest; a trifle the lightest. Amy divined her
                     thoughts.
                  "To be sure you're very light," she said; "but then you must remember that the
                     slightest tinge of African blood, on your mother's side, dooms you
                     to bondage. Come, fan away; we'll talk about Hollister by and by."
                  Lucina plied the fan. Amy struck notes and chords, and played sadly out of
                     time.
                  
                  At last she paused
                  "Oh, dear! I wish you were Monsieur Le Strange, and could tell me how to count
                     that bar," she cried, impatiently.
                  "Those four over the semibreve are to be played as grace notes," said Lucina,
                     speaking mechanically.
                  Amy almost sprang from her seat in her consternation.
                  "How in the world do you know?" she exclaimed.
                  "Because I have played that piece a great many times," replied the girl,
                     quietly.
                  "You?—that difficult bravura? Nonsense!—sit down and play it now, then."
                  "I had rather not," she said firmly.
                  "Do as I bid you!" exclaimed her young mistress, stamping her foot.
                  Lucina dared to dream of resistance. The sad eyes gathered fire to flash upon
                     this arbitrary girl. But she remembered that she was a slave! The
                     words sounded again in her car: "Dole Baker wanted just such an
                        article." The subtle face of her master seemed gazing through
                     the eyes of his child; and without speaking again she laid by the fan, and
                     sitting down to the instrument, played the whole four pages.
                  That firm, yet delicate touch, could be compassed only by a, soul kindled by
                     the warmth of genius.
                  The young mistress seemed, as she watched her, conscious of this girl's
                     superior talent. She was silent, almost wrathful, when Lucina arose from the
                     piano. Her features worked with some restrained feeling. She left the room,
                     hurried to her mother, and threw herself panting upon the lounge.
                  "I don't like it all, mother, that this girl is such a superior piece of goods.
                     For pity's sake, did you know that she plays almost as well as I do
                     myself?"
                  Mrs. Kenneth did not reply; she was trying to frame something to say.
                  "Your eyes are red, also. What! have you been crying with
                     her?"
                  "Silly child! what should I cry for?"
                  "I don't know—without—my father may be hers. If so, I
                        hate her," she cried, springing to her feet with burning
                     cheeks.
                  "Silence! Amy! What has put such frightful thoughts in your head?
                     Your father never saw, never heard of the girl before to-day."
                  "Truly, mother?"
                  "Do you think your mother would tell a falsehood?"
                  "You do to the slaves," replied the daughter candidly.
                  "I am obliged to govern them by subterfuge, sometimes; but then, they are not
                     to be treated with the consideration we accord to the whites. Never, Amy, let
                     me hear you speak in such a manner again, as long as you live. Whatever faults
                     your father may have—he is true"—she paused a moment, much
                     agitated—" to his wife and child. What could put such a horrible thought in
                     your mind?"
                  "Because, mother, General Randolph has three slaves on his place, all his own
                     children; and that is what makes his wife so sick and sorrowful. Phillis told
                     me about it. They were not born on the Randolph estate, though. He has only
                     bought the women and their children within a few months; but someway his wife has found it out. How
                     ridiculous it seems to buy his own children!"
                  Masters and overseers seldom commit a trespass on their own plantations. The
                     jealousy that more or less infects a Southern home is too keen-eyed for that.
                     Hence it frequently happens that the planter has two or three children by
                     slaves on a neighboring estate, whom, to insure them good treatment, he
                     sometimes purchases, and in that way suspicion is not roused in the family.
                  Amy, who had been reflecting, suddenly spoke: "Mother, may Lucina be married to
                     Hollister?"
                  "Married to Hollister! what a question, Amy. If he married her he would still
                     be here. Besides, you are foolishly prejudiced against Hollister."
                  "I want him married," said Amy, petulantly, "and Lucina ought to be married
                     too. She is rather too handsome to be single. Somebody will be falling in love
                     with her when we have company; then there'll be trouble."
                  A heavy sigh was the only response to this sagacious speech.
                  "Say, mother, won't you marry her to Hollister?"
                  A hectic spot burned on the sallow cheek, as her mother made reply, nervously,
                     half angrily—
                  "Amy, you know he's a slave!"
                  "And pray, what is she?" Amy's eyes were fastened suspiciously
                     upon her mother.
                  "Why, a slave, to be sure! but very different from the general run.
                     Unfortunately, she has been too tenderly brought up," said Mrs. Kenneth. Her
                     words were hur- ried, as if she were in haste to correct some
                     misapprehension.
                  "Well, so is Hollister one of the superior kind," said Amy, sneeringly. "I have
                     often heard father say that he knew too much—that he was capable of taking
                     charge of almost any kind of business. I don't know of any one more
                     intelligent, except perhaps Fred Keene, over at General Randolph's. By the way,
                     mother, I never saw people have so much confidence in one who has been a slave,
                     before, as the Randolphs have in Keene. And the girls carry on a newspaper that
                     he sets up, and they say that Keene and Hollister write for it. You know
                     they've got a little printing press, that used to be Marshall's. I believe Fred
                     Keene is intrusted with all General Randolph's business."
                  "Yes, I know," said Mrs. Kenneth, impatiently.
                  "Keene is of French extraction, isn't he, mother?"
                  "Yes, yes; do, Amy, talk of something else," exclaimed Mrs. Kenneth.
                  "Why, mother, how cross you are to-day!"
                  "I wish you would leave me alone, Amy," said Mrs. Kenneth, turning away to hide
                     her tears. They were dropping heavily; presently they rained down her cheeks,
                     and she pressed her hands over her eyes, wholly overcome.
                  Amy looked on, astonished. She was not very affectionate, but she had seldom
                     seen her mother weep, and it touched her heart.
                  "Have I done anything, mother?" she asked timidly.
                  "No, Amy, no; but I am wretched. Leave me for a while. I shall feel better
                     soon."
                  
                  Amy went a little reluctantly, but glad to get away from the sight of
                     sorrow.
               
               
                  PART III.
                  HOLLISTER.
                  The spoiled daughter had occasion to pass through her mother's chamber; her own
                     was beyond. Opposite her room was one that had not been used for any particular
                     purpose—a small, light, pleasant apartment. Arrested by the sounds of work
                     within, she opened the door. Susan, a chambermaid, with sleeves rolled up, and
                     head turbaned down to the eyes, was nailing a neat carpet to the floor. Rose,
                     another chambermaid, was busy putting up muslin curtains. On a small bedstead a
                     quantity of quilts and other furnishing was thrown.
                  "What in the world are you doing here?" asked Amy.
                  "Oh, we'se go'ne to hab a yaller missis, I s'pect," said Susan, driving a nail
                     spitefully down.
                  "Who are you arranging this room for?" asked Amy.
                  "We're 'ranging it for dat gal missus bought t'other day," replied Rose. She
                     was grinning from ear to ear.
                  "Mighty nice piece, I s'pect," muttered Susan, tugging at the carpet. "Don't
                     see what missus wants of a yaller gal so nigh her own room—'deed I
                     doesn't—'deed not,"
                  Amy listened in angry surprise.
                  "Do you mean that Lucina is going to occupy this room by herself?"
                  "'Deed she be, Miss Amy, 'deed she go'ne occumpy it
                        'tirely herse'f. 'Specs missus 'll git her a pianny here, an' a
                     music-box 'muse herse'f with. Never did see a nigger treated dis yer way

                     heart, kase missus don't want her no longer for dressin'-maid," continued
                     Susan, indignantly; "never did common work 'fore 'n all her born
                     days—'deed she did not.
                     She never hab room like this—no mam. Phillis can't
                     border, sartin, but she's jest de beautifulest plain sewer—deed she
                        is, and tan't jes' de thing," added the angry woman, seeing the
                     indignation in Amy's flushed face and restless lips, "to go and put this
                     strange gal right over Phillis's head, 'cause she's got redder cheeks an'
                     han'somer hair; 'deed, now, Miss Amy, 'tain't right 'fore my blessed marster,
                     make flesh o' one, an' bone o' meat o' 'nother."
                  Amy turned away, leaving Susan with hammer in hand uplifted, the picture of
                     servile eloquence, and springing into her own chamber, she threw herself
                     passionately on a seat.
                  "Another of mamma's crazy notions!" she cried in a suppressed voice. "Why is
                     this girl, this slave, to have a room almost as elegant as my own?
                     A stranger, too! If mamma had brought her up as she has Phillis, I wouldn't say
                     one word; but this upstart, to come here and supplant poor Phillis—and perhaps,
                     who knows, by and by, to supplant me! And Hollister, too, he must have a house
                     fitted up for him! What does it mean? I don't wonder they are proud and unreasonable, Mamma don't know how
                     to take care of slaves. I'd keep them down under my feet—I'd make them know
                     their place, the impertinent wretches! I know one thing—Phillis shan't be put
                     off with the other blacks. Mamma may have Lucina all to herself—Phillis shall
                     be my dressing-maid, and, if I please, she shall have a room of her own, too.
                     We'll give up the house to the negroes, and take the quarters ourselves."
                  Turning her head to the window for a moment, she shrank back instantly out of
                     sight. Her father was walking leisurely along, and following, nearly at his
                     side, was a tall, fine looking man, dressed wholly and neatly in light linen.
                     His straw hat was in one hand, and with the other he was pressing back the
                     thick, glossy, curly hair from his forehead. He had bold, handsome features,
                     and his brow was fairer than that of the man who owned him. In form he was very
                     much like lawyer Kenneth, but not so thin. Manly grace characterized his
                     motions. He held his head erect, as if he felt that God had made him. His
                     master, if he dared, could have blotted out those few but pregnant words of
                     holy writ, "In His own image made He him." It was heresy to read
                     that to the slaves; nevertheless, the slaves knew it.
                  His former master was his father. His mother was a beautiful mustee. On the
                     death of Mr. Hollister, the father of Mrs. Kenneth, he fell to her lot. At that
                     time he was a splendid boy of ten, and the little Amy was two years old, so
                     that there was but the difference of eight years in their ages. Hollister
                     having one sixteenth of the unhappy blood marking an outcast race in his veins,
                     would in a tropical climate be called a mustafina. His hair was not woolly, but
                     singularly soft and undulating. His eye, brilliant and commanding, was yet in
                     expression as sweet and gentle as that of a babe. His lips were delicately
                     shaped, Grecian in outline, and, like Napoleon's, passing easily from a smile
                     to a menace.
                  Kenneth himself, stern and exacting as he was to his slaves, yielded sometimes
                     an involuntary respect to Hollister.
                  The latter felt all his degradation. It had burned in his heart for twelve long
                     years, and still his lot among slaves was an enviable one. His mistress
                     deferred to him, his master consulted with him, and often left his business in
                     his hands. He was, shrewd, gifted with foresight; his mind was intuitively
                     quick, and for miles around he was known as Kenneth's smart boy.
                  His only weakness was—shall I dare to breathe it of a slave?—an overpowering
                     passion for Amy Kenneth. He had grown up with her, watched the child blossom
                     into the woman, while she, with many a little art of coquetry from the time of
                     her twelfth to her fourteenth year, had riveted his chains hopelessly upon him,
                     fettering soul and body. Still, he had never, save in one sense, called her
                     mistress. Mistress of his heart she assuredly was, and when she awoke to the
                     fact that this chattel really possessed affections, and that they were given
                     unreservedly to her, her pride rebelled, and she became suddenly as cold and
                     haughty as she had before been capricious and coquettish.
                  
                  Now, as he was passing with her father, he was gazing up towards the window
                     near which she sat. But not altogether worshipful was the look he gave. She had
                     dealt him the first blow he had ever received, and that in his face! The sting
                     of the whip-cord had not yet subsided. It was hot and scorpion-like in his
                     heart, and all his great love could not forgive that. No! though he still
                     yielded her every thought, that was a black stain not to be wiped out. He had
                     met her not long after, and given her the look she had described to her
                     mother.
                  "Insolence!" she exclaimed to herself. "I hope he hates me now!"
                  No sooner had she spoken thus than came a secret hope that he would not.
                     Strange to say, that dark look of yesterday, in which a concentrated malice
                     seemed to gather, had in the slightest degree altered the current of her
                     feelings. She had laughed at it, resented it, but the malign eyes seemed
                     hovering over her. The face looked terribly grand in its wrath. The more she
                     thought of it the more its dark beauty impressed her. Yet she shut the emotion,
                     whatever it might be, close down in her heart. She would not stay alone with
                     it, as it was revived by the passing of Hollister, but hurried back again into
                     her mother's room.
                  There sat Lucina, her sad face composed. She did not even lift her eyes at the
                     entrance of her young mistress, but worked away patiently with the brilliant
                     silks, though some, times tears dropped upon the flowers growing under her
                     hand.
               
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               IN ONE PART.
               OLD HEPSY DENOUNCES THE LAWYER, AND REFUSES TO TAKE MONEY THAT HAS
                  BEEN IN HIS POSSESSION.
               
                  
                     
                        "Let me resign this wretched breath,
                        Since now remains to me
                        No other balm than kindly death,
                        To soothe my misery."
                     
                  
               
               BY six o'clock market was over.
               The carts were in motion, the stalls deserted, the farmers gone.
               Old Hepsy, to whom the money scattered by the reckless horseman had been donated,
                  lived on the outskirts of the town nearly a mile from the residence of lawyer
                  Kenneth. She had once been the property of old Colonel Hollister, but on the
                  attainment of her hundredth year, Mrs. Kenneth, whose chattel she subsequently
                  became, gave her her liberty. She was now one hundred and ten, a tall, venerable
                  and still queenly African. Her hair was as white as the snow new fallen, and she
                  wore neither cap nor handkerchief. Her features were pleasing though very much
                  wrinkled. A dark stuff dress fitted her thin form closely, a white cloth was
                  always folded over her shoulders in the shape of a mantle, not cornered as is the most frequent
                  fashion with old people.
               Her residence had been constructed especially for her by. Hollister, who always
                  regarded her with great veneration. It consisted of one very large room, built of
                  square logs. It was airy, and whitewashed without and within. In one corner stood
                  her bed, very wide and low, that it might accommodate her infirmities. The square
                  around was covered with homely rag-carpet, whose once gay blue and green had faded
                  into dingy yellow. There were four good sized windows, at each of which hung a
                  certain of homespun check. Parlor, sitting room and kitchen were all united in
                  this comfortable place. One had given the old woman a settee, cracked and dingy;
                  another a looking-glass, and another some little ornament or a strip of carpet, so
                  that the old creature lacked for nothing in the way of furniture.
               In the middle of the room a table was always set with the few dishes old. Hepsy
                  used. "'Deed she wasn't gone to tote from de cubboard to de table four times a
                  day—'deed not she"—so there they sat, there they were washed, and there they were
                  always ready.
               A good old-fashioned fire-place, with black jambs, took up nearly one side of the
                  room. The chimney was built on the outside. Near the door stood her tubs and
                  kettles, pots and pans, all in decent array, clean and shining, for old Hepsy was
                  as neat as it is possible for one to be. The stern woman was very proud that she
                  was no longer a slave, and took care to inform every one who called to see her of
                  that fact.
               How cheerful she looked! sitting up so straight, the gold beads that she had worn
                  now nearly fifty years glistening on her ebony neck. Hepsy had been the favorite
                  slave of her first mistress. Hence the gold beads.
               A strange mixture of simplicity and shrewdness was old Hepsy—of religious faith
                  and the most abject superstition. She could never read, but mistress Kenneth had
                  been in the habit of allowing Phillis, her waiting-maid, to go there three times a
                  week, and read to her from the bible. In Washington country, it is not death for a
                  slave to read. The people dare not turn that screw—they are too near the
                  boundaries of freedom.
               It was now ten o'clock of the morning, and old Hepsy, after sweeping everything
                  that could be swept, polishing everything that could be polished, and dusting
                  everything that could be dusted, sat patiently waiting for the appearance of her
                  favorite.
               "'Pears to me," she said to herself, looking out upon the little garden that
                  yielded her all the vegetables she needed, "Phillis seems to me like own chile!
                  Never did think, after Sue toted off, I car' anymore 'bout folks,
                  anyway; but thank blessed Marster, ole heart found somefin' to root onto 'gin. Bin
                  longing see that child, ever since sun-up—thar she come, bress de Lor'."
               "'Hallo! Aunt Hepsy," cried Phillis, flushed with a little rencontre on the
                  road.
               The old woman bridled up.
               "Is da' manners, nigger?" she exclaimed, tone and look severe. "Has
                  you forgot de ref'rence for white hars—one foot in de grave—an' over a hundered? Reckon you's not Phillis dis yer morn'n;"
                  and she shook her head sorrowfully.
               "Laws! Aunt Hepsy, didn't mean to hurt yer feelin's, noway," said Phillis; "but
                  I's real flustered, that! I's turned out long o' common niggers, Aunt Hepsy, an' a
                  yaller gal taken in my place. Mistris likes her best, so I doesn't car for noffin
                  any longer. I don't, so!" and she dropped all in a heap in the first
                  chair that offered.
               Aunt Hepsy took off her round-eyed spectacles, and surveyed the young girl
                  suspiciously, for a moment.
               "Now, you chile, tell de whole truf, and noffin but de truf. Mistris wouldn't a
                  done gone dat for noffin."
               "It is truth, Hepsy," the old woman bridled up again, "it is truth,
                  Aunt Hepsy," cried Phillis, her eyes filling with tears; "she's taken a yaller
                  gal, a real handsome, clar complected yaller gal, and now she's—fittin'—up jes de
                  best room in de house for her 'ception—right over agin Miss Amy's."
               Phillis began to sob a little.
               "Merciful Marster!" ejaculated the old lady, raising her hands; "well, that! I's
                  kept de secret nigh on sixteen years; clar to de Lord I won't tell it now."
               "What secret, Aunt Hepsy?"
               "Oh, g'long!—don't ask me no questions," and the old African puckered up her lips,
                  and straightened her still erect form, while Phillis pouted and cried.
               "I jest hate her, thar!"
               "Blessed book says, love our enemies," said old Hepsy, piously, "and put coals
                  o'fire on dar head—only," she cautiously added; "musn't let anybody but de Lord
                  see you do dat."
               "I'd like to burn off all her fine har!"
               "Da's a bad spirit, Phillis, chile. Blessed Bible says, 'be angry an' sin not.'
                  Dat means, musn't hate 'em any more'n dey can bar. Some folks can bar more hate
                  dan others, chile; dey'll stand still an' take it while you puts its on an' puts
                  it on; but dar orders 'll turn right 'bout an' keel ye ober, chile—no, no, musn't
                  hate 'em any more'n dey can bar."
               "'Spec massa thinks she's a fine piece!" cried Phillis, spitefully; "go after her
                  in missis' own room dis yer very mornin'."
               "Ky!" exclaimed Hepsy. "Whew!" she whistled with a prolonged breath; "clar! if de
                  Lord should take vengeance dat way!"
               "What's he got to take vengeance for, Aunt Hepsy?"
               "Oh, you don't know nothing', chile; Lord's ways ain't our ways, nor our ways
                  anybody else's, 'specs. Come, child, jes read dat good word to ole Hepsy—clean
                  starved out; is, so! Dar Phillis, does you see dat ar' fire-brand?
                  Stood jes' so ebber since de fire go out; sure's you live, child, ole Hepsy goin'
                  to have a present, da's so!"
               It would have been a strange thing if a week had passed without bringing a present
                  of some kind to old Hepsy. The slaves from far and near gave her all they could
                  out of their poor means, and not unfrequently Hour and potatoes found their way to
                  her little home from the farmers round about.
               
               Phillis opened the Bible, and had just read a verse in the Psalms when a knock
                  came at the door.
               "Clar! I nebber has any time to myself!" cried Hepsy, smoothing down her white
                  breast-plate; "so much compery!—can't even hear de blessed word o' de Lord! Come
                  in that, whoever you is."
               The door opened. Jim Davis stood on the threshold, in blue frock and slouching
                  cap, a whip in his hand.
               "Laws! Mars' Davis; clar I'm glad to see you! Phillis, got no manners, chile? Git
                  a char for Mars' Davis."
               "No, thank ye, Hepsy. I can stan' while I stay. I've got a little matter o' money
                  to ban' to ye. Lawyer Kenneth took it into his crazy brain to ride through our
                  market this morning, and spoil a matter of ten dollars' worth or so of our truck
                  with the hoofs of that infernal horse of his. After he had had his fun, as he
                  called it, he out with his puss, and threw enough gold round to make it all right,
                  an' a little over. We voted amongst ourselves, that, to bring you the balance; so
                  here it is."
               He held out the money.
               Hepsy had arisen, caught up the long staff with which she usually walked, and
                  stretched her withered form to its utmost height. A stern, severe expression
                  gathered over her wrinkled face, as she cried:
               "Ole Hepsy never tetch no blood money. Mars' Kenneth devil's own chile. Curse of
                  de Lord be on him for ebber!" she exclaimed, lifting her skinny arm. "The Lord
                  curse him, an' his wife an' chile, his hands and all his pausessions. Didn't he
                  sell my chil'ln when ole Mars' Hollister promise none o' me or mine ever be sold?
                  Didn't he tote, Eben off down South jest kase he gib him a word back? Didn't he
                  sell Sue to be white man's mistress? Didn't he sell Jack for cussed bigger driver?
                  Didn't he leave ole Hepsy chileless and comfortless in old age? Oh, Mars' Kenneth
                  nebber strike he niggers, oh, no, no—but he put 'em what they struck clar through
                  the heart. Now Sue is dead, an' Eben's dead, an' Jack's cussed soul driver; an'
                  Mars' Kenneth's gold all blood money. Never take it, honey, never. 'Fore my
                  blessed Mars'r, starve first; will, so!"
               "Poh! Hepsy, you're squeamish. Six dollars 'll buy you a good carpet for the floor
                  here."
               "Never wants to, walk on my chillen's hearts!" cried old Hepsy, trembling with age
                  and anguish; "blood squash out all over my feet. White man not see 'um, prehaps,
                  but Hepsy see 'um with inside eyes. Mars' Kenneth never g'ine to die like folks,
                  mark this child's words! Never strike slave hisse'f, but plenty soul drivers way
                  on he plantation down Souf. Reckon God hears niggers' prayer—reckon God see
                  niggers' tears 'way off dar jes' same as in ole Maryland."
               The old woman had wrought herself into an, excitement that was awful to witness in
                  one so aged. Her body rocked to and fro with spasmodic emotions; her throat and
                  mouth worked convulsively, she threw her hands in all directions, while tears
                  trickled from her eyes, streaming down the furrows of her wrinkled cheeks. Phillis
                  had risen, and stood looking at her with fear-strained eyes.
               "Reckon I'll clear out o' this, and next time I undertake to do a benevolent action I'll git the parson,
                  "exclaimed Davis, backing off hurriedly, and shutting the door.
               It was a long time before the poor old negress grew, in a measure, calm again.
                  When she did, she turned to Phillis, whose face betrayed a sorrowful sympathy,
                  exclaiming—
               "Jes' take dat Bible 'gin, Phillis, 'chile, an' turn to de Lor' A'mighty's
                  judgmints! Read whar he drowned dem soul-drivers in de Red Sea for not lettin' de
                  chillen' of de Lord go when de Lord say so. Da's what I wants to hear."
               Phillis opened unwittingly, and the first verse that caught her eye, she read
                  aloud—
               "But I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you,
                  do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and
                  persecute you."
               "No, no, no, no!" ejaculated Hepsy, violently, "da's for white folks; nigger can't
                  do it. What! love Mars' Kenneth when he sell last chile old Hepsy left her! Oh,
                  Lor! can't do dat. Anything in reason, blessed Marster," she cried,
                  lifting her eyes and tremulous hands to heaven; "but don't 'spec old Hepsy to love
                  Mars' Kenneth; 'deed, Lord, it's onpossible—'deed 'tis so!"
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               IN TWO PARTS.
               
                  PART I.
                  THE QUAKERESS AND HER SON.
                  
                     If, as some believe, angels do inhabit human forms, that must have been a
                        glorious seraph that took possession of Mabel Van Broek.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           "Shine out young spirit in the blaze
                           Of thy most proud divinity."
                        
                     
                  
                  THE doctor came slowly down the broad staircase, and paused at the foot a
                     moment to draw on his glove. Many times during the last month had his carriage
                     stood at the door of that great mansion. Many times had his heart ached as
                     pleading eyes had gazed in his own, striving to read in their unreadable depths
                     the hope they longed to feel.
                  "Well, doctor, how is mother to-day?"
                  The question was put by a young man who had just, entered by another door. His
                     quick tones, decided movements and earnest face, gave token of a strong and
                     active spirit, of energy and business tact unusual in one so youthful.
                  The doctor shook his head, saying, "I don't think she is any better, sir."
                  The frank young face fell instantly.
                  
                  "A change of climate would be the best thing for her, even if she went no
                     farther than Baltimore," continued the doctor; "I told her so to-day, but she
                     seems averse to travelling."
                  "She has relatives in Maryland," said the young man, lifting his hand to his
                     ear, as if he still felt the pressure of the mercantile pen.
                  "So she says, in Washington country; I should think that would be the very
                     place for her," responded the doctor, his hand on the door-knob. "She dreads
                     the journey alone, however, and I don't know but she is almost too much
                     debilitated to travel by herself."
                  "By herself! indeed she should do no such thing," said the young man,
                     earnestly. "I should go with her; mother must have forgotten me."
                  "Perhaps she feels delicate about asking you, as you are not her own son."
                  "Don't say that, doctor," responded the young man, quickly, while the slightest
                     flush mounted to his cheek; "no own son could love or be willing to sacrifice
                     more for a mother than I love her and am willing to sacrifice for her. My
                     father, in his last solemn charge, committed her to my keeping—but if he had
                     died and made no sign, my strong attachment to her would have been a sufficient
                     guaranty for my future conduct. If we could but save her, doctor! She is one of
                     the gentlest, best of mothers! I cannot bear to feel that I must part with
                     her."
                  "And it may please God to spare her," said the doctor, as the door came slowly
                     open; "let us hope for the best."
                  Springing up the stairs two at a time, Harry Van Broek entered his
                     step-mother's room. It was a beautiful apartment, befitting so stately a home,
                     very large, elegantly furnished, abounding in pictures, mirrors, statues, vases
                     and flowers. A carpet of the brightest, most harmonious colors covered the
                     floor. The light came in unchecked through four large windows. The furniture
                     was covered with pale blue velvet, quilted satin, and embroidered cloth. A
                     door, half open, discovered a bed hung with white lace, and part of the
                     furnishing of the chamber beyond.
                  It was a luxurious room to be sick in. There were the odor of fresh flowers,
                     and, within chaste frames, the grand scenery of mountain regions—the calm wild
                     beauty of valley country, with its delicious skies—the tropical splendor of
                     Indian climes—to please and refresh the languid senses. There were majestic
                     historical groups, touching delineations of Walter Scott's genius, particularly
                     his trial of Jennie Dean—classical representations from Shakspeare and other
                     immortal bards. Creamy-veined statues of children, with almost living grace,
                     stood on every side; the mirrors—there were two—reached from floor to ceiling.
                     The tables were moulded into every shape of pliancy and beauty; the paper on
                     the wall gave added brightness and clearness to the delicate surroundings.
                  Truly, if these could take away the sting of sorrow, or the venom
                     of disease, if these could tone down the hectic into the natural crimson of
                     health and beauty—if these could deepen the pate veins in the temples, or give
                     the laboring bosom one more generous breath—Mabel Van Broek needed not to sit so quietly in the great arm-chair
                     that stood near the centre table.
                  One picture, inclosed in a massive frame, that I have omitted to mention, was
                     worth all the world to this gentle young widow. It was the portrait of a man
                     who looked scarcely beyond middle age. A noble face had Death changed when he
                     laid his icy finger on that counterpart. Mabel had been Governor Van Broek's
                     second wife, but his first; and only love. He had married before from a
                     conviction of duty, because they told him that his cousin was dying for
                     him.
                  Long after her death, for she was a happy wife but a few years, dying in giving
                     birth to her son, he met Mabel West, a beautiful young Quakeress. For fourteen
                     years he had devoted himself to his profession—the law—and to the education of
                     his idolized boy. He had almost forgotten that there were women in the world,
                     when one day, walking from his office in the abstraction of study, his son, a
                     well-grown lad who was with him, exclaimed, "Oh, papa, how pretty!" Startled by
                     this unusual admiration, he looked up and encountered a pair of mild dark eyes,
                     and the sweetest face he ever saw in his life under a little Quaker bonnet.
                  It was so sudden, that the case he had been arranging with great mental legal
                     precision entirely escaped his mind, and instead of collocating dry arguments,
                     he repeatedly thought to himself—not "how pretty!" but how angelic! how
                     heavenly!
                  Here was a great and noble character—this future Governor Van Broek. In the
                     midst of his active and responsible life, he still cherished an animated love
                     for art, literature, and rural solitude. His mind was enriched with classical
                     and Bible lore. He was eminent as a Christian no less than as a lover of nature
                     and science. No wonder that Mabel West, the gentle and refined, when he had
                     wooed and won her, imagined that all the graces, virtues and princely
                     attainments of the noblest of his sex were gathered in this one perfect
                     nature.
                  Not long after their marriage he was elected Governor of his native State, and,
                     alas! in the midst of his honors, usefulness, and domestic happiness, death cut
                     him down. This was a blow from which the sensitive, delicate wife had never
                     recovered.
                  He had now been dead two years. His son, whom by her gentle care she had
                     rescued from destruction at a critical time, curbing his then headstrong will
                     with the silken reins of her womanly government, loved her with an abiding
                     affection. To him she was truth, beauty, purity; and whatever spoke to him of
                     heaven, he likened to her.
                  Mabel had been alone until Harry Van Broek entered.
                  Clad in a dress of sable color, thrown wide open at the neck, her hair rippling
                     back from the pale oval of her cheek, her eyes shining fitfully, she had been
                     grazing at a lock of dark hair that laid on a delicate envelope before her. It
                     was the curl of an infant daughter, who smiled on her for four brief years, and
                     she had been thinking of a little spot in the corner of a churchyard. Of little
                     hands, folded away there in the darkness, with a wreath of white roses turned
                     to fragrant dust upon what was the swelling, dimpled bosom of gentlest life. Of ashes, the color of brown
                     locks that glittered once as if every thread were inwoven with gold. Of smiles
                     that melted into heaven, and eyes that saw angels just before their crystal
                     doors were closed. Of a heart whose every pulse was a little gospel of love. Of
                     feet that spared the very wild flowers, and would turn out for a helpless worm.
                     Of lips that clung to hers, sweet, and dewy, and crimson.
                  "They must go, little darlings," she murmured. "Their tender feet
                     are bruised under the dark portals. Their little limbs shiver in the cold
                     river. The dews of the heavy cloud fall like spray upon their pure brows. In
                     vain the dear hands clasps ours—in vain we cling to their dying grasp! Tears
                     cannot keep them—prayers cannot save them. Oh, the lambs! Mine has gone to the
                     fold on the other side; and, thank God! I shall soon follow."
               
               
                  PART II.
                  THE DECISION.
                  "Well, mother mine!" exclaimed Harry, coming in like a sunbeam, though his
                     cheerfulness cost him an effort, "they say we must go South. I like that; I'm
                     almost tired of business, and should like to run off for a week or so."
                  "A whole week!" said Mrs. Van Broek, looking up lovingly into his fine
                     face.
                  "Well, a month, then, if you say so—come, where shall we go? To our
                     uncle's?"
                  She smiled.
                  "I have not seen my brother for nearly ten years," she said. "He was then a
                     most impetuous character; and I remember he said he should never visit us
                     again, because we opposed his views so strenuously on the subject of slavery.
                     He married a Southern woman, who held a great many bond-people. But more than
                     that, he has since bought men and women himself, and owns, I understand, a
                     large plantation in the South, with drivers and overseers."
                  "He lives in Maryland, does he not?"
                  "Yes. Thee has heard me speak of him as a man of a fiery and peculiar
                     temperament. He never seemed like one of us, although he was a birthright
                     Friend," she replied.
                  "And how will you relish living in the midst of slavery?" asked Harry.
                  "Ah! thee knows I would never go, but for one more attempt to recover health.
                     This means is pointed out to me. They say it is the last."
                  The Quaker "thee" and "thou" sounded very sweetly on her lips. Governor Van
                     Broek never would consent that she should change the fashion of her
                     language.
                  The mouth trembled a little as she cast a glance towards the portrait of her
                     husband.
                  Harry divined her thoughts. They were, that it would be happiness to lie by the
                     side of his father in the cold ground—but that she had no right to trifle with
                     the life God had given, nor
                     justification for neglecting any method that promised restoration.
                  "This brother's name is Kenneth, is it not?" he asked, carelessly, toying with
                     a little silver cupid, that held a minute knife-blade curiously concealed under
                     its wing.
                  "Yes; Everard Kenneth," she replied. "I think he must be much changed. He has
                     not written me for three years, although I have sent him a letter every
                     month—or if not him, his daughter, whom I have never seen. Sometimes she
                     writes—but evidently under constraint. How can she help it, dear girl, not
                     knowing me?"
                  "So, he has a daughter!" said Harry, smiling.
                  "Yes; and if at all like her father, a beautiful girl. Everard had all the
                     beauty of the family, I have heard it said."
                  "Oh, no!" exclaimed Harry, earnestly, "not one tenth part, compared with my
                     mother."
                  "Thank thee," she replied, the hectic kindling into a blaze on her before
                     colorless cheek; "but I must gainsay thee. I used to think that more perfect
                     manly beauty did not exist. I often called him the Apollo Belvidere—and I was
                     not the only one. The artist, Flemont, they father loved so well, told me that
                     he never saw a more striking resemblance. But what art thou doing?"
                  "Getting ready to write to this uncle. We must pack up and be off; I'm really
                     in earnest to go, now."
                  He brought the silver inkstand near, and took from an embossed portfolio a
                     sheet of paper.
                  "What is his address?"
                  "Haggiston, Washington country," she replied.
                  "Those slaves up there will give you such good nursing! That, with the mild
                     climate, will quite restore my little Quaker mother," he said, as he paused a
                     moment, after some rapid writing. "But, mother"—
                  "Well, my son?"
                  "How are we going to get along with that shocking system? I shall be for
                     setting some of those fellows free, and then there'll be the dogs to pay."
                  "How does thee know but thee may fall in love with it? They say most Northern
                     people do."
                  "Never!" exclaimed Harry, indignantly; "not if they were feasted in palaces,
                     and ate off of gold. That their toil is unrequited, that their bondage is
                     hereditary—that their children's children can be bought and sold, is sufficient
                     to stamp the system devilish. No! let me earn my bread by the sweat of my
                     brow—let me go before my maker unsullied by the wages of sin."
                  "Thee looks like thy father, now!" exclaimed Mabel, admiringly.
                  "And, Heaven helping me, I'll act like him," said Harry.
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VI.
               IN TWO PARTS.
               
                  PART I.
                  AMY KENNETH IS NOT PLEASED WITH HER LETTERS, AND FEELS THE
                     INFLUENCE OF OLD HEPSY'S SUPERSTITIONS.
                  
                     
                        
                           "Next advices, no doubt, further facts will afford,
                           In the meantime the danger most imminent grows."
                        
                     
                  
                  "PROVOKING!" exclaimed Amy, throwing down a letter her father had placed in her
                     hands a few moments before.
                  She sat in her mother's room. The table drawn up before her was covered with
                     opened letters, that had been hurriedly read and thrown aside. Lucina was just
                     leaving the room with her hands full of work. To gratify the imperious Amy
                     Kenneth, she had been banished to her own little chamber. The dress which she
                     had worn from the place where her hitherto happy life had been spent, was
                     replaced by one of dark blue cotton, plainly made. No under-sleeves ornamented
                     her arms—but the sleeves of her dress were gathered into a band, and closed
                     around the wrists. Amy had commanded her to wear a handkerchief bound about her
                     temples, but this Mrs. Kenneth resisted, only stipulating that the curls should
                     be smoothed out, and worn plainly behind the ears.
                  Lucina did not appear to so much advantage in this changed attire. That was
                     precisely what Mrs. Kenneth wished. Still she looked sweetly graceful, and the
                     mournful beauty of the drooping eye, and the often quivering lips, nothing but
                     death could alter.
                  Mrs. Kenneth, who had been absent for a moment, now entered the room.
                  "Mamma, just read this letter," said Amy, throwing the missive towards her with
                     a pout.
                  "I see nothing very startling in it," Mrs. Kenneth replied, returning the
                     letter.
                  "Who wants that Quaker woman here, with her everlasting thee-ing and thou-ing?
                     Sick, too—deep in consumption—likely as not. Can't we put her off? Say we're
                     going to have a house-full, or shall travel, or something. She'll spoil all our
                     fun."
                  "She is your father's sister," replied her mother; "he would never consent to
                     such a thing."
                  "Worse and worse!" cried Amy, her face growing red; "here's a letter from Miss
                     Lufburrow—she will do herself the honor of stopping a few weeks with her dear
                     cousins Kenneth. It is too bad!" she cried, an expression of
                     disgust settling on her face; "we shall hear nothing but 'my brother, the Rev.
                     Joe Lufburrow,' and she will harp upon one string till we are stunned and
                        ennuied to death."
                  "We must make some excuse to her," said Mrs. Kenneth, now sharing
                     in Amy's anxiety. "She is a nuisance I cannot endure, if she is a
                     relation."
                  "Oh, but, mother, impossible! She wrote this from Philadelphia, and is almost here by this time.
                     She will be here to-morrow."
                  "Then there's no help for it," said Mrs. Kenneth; "we must put up with her
                     company the best we can. Remember you have large expectations from her, and it
                     would never do to offend her."
                  "Fiddlestick!" cried Amy, suppressing the tears of vexation that had gathered
                     in her eyes; "it's always so when I depend upon having a particularly good
                     time. Here's this Quakeress coming for her health—nobody must speak above a
                     whisper while she's in the house, and I suppose we must give up Lucina entirely
                     to her, because she's father's sister. Besides, father says she's to have the
                     large front chamber—the very best—when I had set my heart upon giving it to
                     Maggie and Hat. Oh! dear! everything goes against me this year, just as old
                     Hepsy told me."
                  "Just as old Hepsy told you?"
                  "Yes. For pity's sake, mother, don't look so scared! The old woman isn't a
                     witch, is she?"
                  "When were you there, Amy?" asked Mrs. Kenneth, pausing in her work.
                  "Day before yesterday," replied the girl, "I was riding past on Postboy, and
                     thought I'd go in. What she was doing, mercy only knows; but she had that great
                     red cloth that I gave her—you remember the crimson piano-cover that was so
                     moth-eaten—well that hung from her neck to her heels, and her white head on top
                     made her look so curious."
                  "What was she doing, Amy?"
                  "Stirring something over the fire with a long stick, and muttering away to
                     herself. Then she had the broom and the tongs, and a small table, standing in a
                     row, upside down, and a lot of gourds strung together hanging over her
                     head.
                  "'Why, Hepsy,' said I, 'what in the world are you doing?'
                  "'Don't matter much, chile,' she answered, putting away her stick; but she
                     looked and acted so queer!
                  "Then the thought struck me, and I asked out of sheer fun—'Hepsy, do you ever
                     tell fortunes?'
                  "She stared at me a moment, shook her head, saying,' 'deed, missy, reckon I
                     does.'
                  "Well, then I ordered her to tell mine; so she looked at my hand—without taking
                     off this great red cover that hung from her head to her feet, and through which
                     she had her arms thrust—mercy, mother! you look as frightened as if you saw a
                     ghost!" exclaimed Amy.
                  "What did she say?" queried Mrs. Kenneth, without moving hand or eye.
                  "Why, she said, 'there's great sorrow coming to Washington Grange'—and so there
                     is, you know, Miss Lufburrow—then she added, 'Cockroach an' fowl, dem fight
                     togedder, and no ask beetle-bug.' What an African she is, to be sure!
                  "Said I, 'What's the sorrow going to be, Hepsy? Am I to have no lovers?'
                  "'Deed, chile, you hab more lovers dan you want, and dey work you sorrow,' she
                     said. I never saw such a grieved expression as came over her face then.
                  
                  "'Now tell me something good, Hepsy, and I'll give you some money,' said I.
                  "''Deed, chile, wouldn't take none o' yo' money,' she cried, starting back, and
                     her face changed like a flash of lightning, and became as dark and evil as only
                     Hepsy's face can, you know. Don't you remember how I used to scream at sight of
                     her?"
                  "Yes, yes; but what did she say more?" asked Mrs. Kenneth, hurriedly.
                  "''Deed, chile,' said she, 'can't tell you nuthin' good dis year; 'deed, honey,
                     it's an awful disappointed year.' And so I should think, if we're going to have
                     one sick woman and one fool."
                  "Hush, hush! Amy, Miss Lufburrow is not a fool, although she has some
                     intolerable ways. I wonder what the old woman was boiling up."
                  "Some charm, likely as not," said Amy, lightly.
                  Mrs. Kenneth changed countenance.
                  "She brought all these foolish notions from her country," said Mrs. Kenneth.
                     Her lips were nearly closed; she spoke with an effort.
                  "Some say that those negro charms do really take effect," said Amy, bundling
                     her letters together, and adjusting them by striking one end on the table. "At
                     any rate, the slaves stand in mortal fear of them; and General Randolph, if he
                     finds any such thing going on in his place, whips the sorcerer almost to death.
                     He's a cruel old wretch, though I do think papa is too easy; they ought to be
                     well beaten sometimes, especially those proud white fellows;" and her lip
                     curled while her cheek flushed. Then she gave the letters a great blow, as if
                     she were angry with them or herself, and letting them slide off in her lap,
                     looked aside in deep thought.
                  A few moments after, she said—
                  "Hepsy pretends that she would have been a queen in her own country."
                  "I wonder how many queens have come from Africa?" queried Mrs. Kenneth,
                     quietly.
                  "I do half believe Hepsy, though," said Amy, "there is something so different
                     about her from other negroes. "Was she really smuggled over from Africa?"
                  "Yes; my father knew her origin when he bought her," said Mrs. Kenneth. "She
                     was then twenty-five, according to her reckoning. They had terrible times with
                     her. I recollect hearing my father say that he was ten years taming her."
                  "She hasn't lost the old fire yet," responded Amy, rising and going from the
                     room.
                  "Lucina," she said, pausing a, moment at the door, "go down into the
                     green-house and get me a flower for my hair."
               
               
                  PART II.
                  FRED KEENE.
                  Lucina arose, laid her work aside, and went softly down stairs. The house was
                     divided by a wide hall, across which
                     servants were lounging with pails, mops, brooms, dusters, and all kinds of
                     household cleaning implements.
                  An old woman of seventy, with a pipe in her mouth and arms folded, walked up
                     and down—now this way, now that. Everybody seemed to look to her for
                     directions. She wore a short blue dress, white stockings, that were displayed
                     some way above the ankles, and neat shoes, while the rest were barefooted, with
                     gowns pinned up, and sleeves rolled to their utmost extent. The handkerchief
                     which towered upon her head was snowy white, and ended in a pyramidal point.
                     This person was the chief director among the women-slaves, and as she was
                     devotedly pious and trustworthy, was treated with especial consideration by the
                     Kenneth family. To be sure, Lawyer Kenneth laughed at her religion, and
                     tormented the poor creature whenever he could get the opportunity about her
                     fanatical notions.
                  Old Tabby undertook the regulation of that part of the house destined for the
                     coming visitors. It had been through the yearly cleaning; but Tabby was
                     neatness itself, and the suites of rooms, upstairs and down, must be completely
                     "scoured, shaken, and dusted," as she expressed herself.
                  "Now gal, put them curt'ns straight," she called out to a black who was
                     leisurely pulling the lace awry; "this room is gwine to be fixed for Mars'
                     Kenneth's sick sister—an' we mus' gib obery possible 'tention to its
                     cleaniless. Cleaniless, nex' to godliness; hopes de poor missus got de love of
                     de Saviour shed broad in her soul—if missus gwine to die, needs it partickler.
                     You gals, thar, go up stars and bring down all dem white marsales—an' heaps o'
                     piller cases an' sheets. Dem ar sheets wid broadered ruffles, for dis yer room
                     on second star. Plain ones do well nuff for da' oder chamber. Da' pesky ol'
                     maid, Missy Lufbro, gwine to sleep dar—mar's says she's comin' too. Pray de
                     Lord give us patience, and nuf of it, every moment of our 'profitable
                     lives.
                  "Mars' Kenneth say, take de frame off dem ar picters, an' muslin off dem
                     statters, an' jest go to de 'servatory and 'peak to Jim for he choicest
                     flowers. Dis room berry nice. Mars' Kenneth says, wheel in de red arm-chair,
                     and dat ar push sofa. Laws! wonder what kind of chile she is, to have so much
                     fuss an' 'tention; but then she's Mars' Kenneth's sister."
                  Just then Lucina appeared, coming from a side parlor, walking slowly, and with
                     a sorrowful face.
                  "Poor chile!" muttered Tabby; "neber knew she was slave gal," she added, fixing
                     a, pitiful glance upon her; "mistress put on ol' blue dress—push back all dem
                     pretty curls—wonder if she hab 'ligion? Looks heart-broken, sure. Reckon Miss
                     Amy ain't g'ine treat her any too well. How's yer dis morn? 'Clar! seems as if
                     I mus' say missee," she muttered, aside.
                  Lucina glanced up—smiled faintly—a grateful look shot across her fair face as
                     she replied—
                  "Thank you—I'm not very well;" and passed on.
                  Her manner was so much that of a refined and well-bred lady, that old Tabby
                     made an involuntary half courtesy as she went by, then laughed a little apology
                     to herself.
                  "Da's missus new white nigger," exclaimed one girl to another.
                  
                  "Feels hersef mighty big, I s'pecs," was added, sneeringly.
                  "Don't you talk none 'bout dat poor'gal!" exclaimed old Tabby, with a vigorous
                     shake of the head, holding her pipe aloft in one hand as she spoke. "Jes' you
                     keep at you work—nuf to do mindin' you own selves."
                  Tabby's word was law—so, with a little grumbling under the breath, they
                     desisted.
                  The conservatory was entered by a long covered passage leading from the back
                     hall. The gardener was busy talking with a man from the neighboring plantation,
                     who seemed to be giving him some advice. Both stood with their backs towards
                     Lucina, as she went softly in. The flower she sought grew on a low, seated
                     shrub, and was small, but darkly and intensely red.
                  Both men turned when they heard her footsteps, and the gardener, knowing that
                     Amy sent for such a flower every day, came forward to the shrub, and selecting
                     the fullest and most perfect, cut it off carefully. He was an old mulatto, with
                     face puckered with wrinkles, a white apron hanging from his throat nearly to
                     his feet, and never without his garden-shears, which he held as a sort of badge
                     of his calling.
                  As he was parting the branches, Lucina gazed admiringly round. Crushed as she
                     was, her heart still yearned toward the beautiful, fragrant children of mother
                     earth.
                  There is a mysterious inspiration, a drinking as of some rare ideal wine when
                     the soul communes with nature. Merely to feel the wind's velvet touch on the
                     cheek—merely to meet with a little flower smiling alone in the midst of a great
                     world of dust and dry roots—softens the heart and calms the spirit.
                  The slave, thank God! felt this as her eye roved from rich tropical flowers to
                     bright tropical fruits. The yet unripe oranges hung in clusters; the lemons,
                     paler and longer, contrasted well with the deep green of their glossy leaves.
                     The pomegranates, of a fiery red, dotted like flaming rubies the bushes whereon
                     they grew. The figs, broad and luscious, dropped heavily on short stems from
                     the generous branches that supported them. A few yellow-birds fluttered about—a
                     few southern trees spread their slender foliage against the glass roof, and the
                     Sun and the blue sky glittered through, pouring fiery colors of splendor over
                     the pink-leafed cactus that bloomed in every nook.
                  Meanwhile the man who had been talking with the gardener (the latter, by the
                     way, was Tabby's husband) had stepped back, and now, screened by the spreading
                     form of a magnolia, he stood and watched the motions of this young girl. "He
                     was a white man—as white as Hollister, but some fifteen years older; white, and
                     not a slave! There was, not a trace of colored blood about him. He possessed a
                     winning and noble countenance; not so decidedly handsome as Hollister's, but
                     permeated with a vivacious, agreeable expression, which was constantly
                     changing.
                  This man was Fred Keene, the confidential servant and agent of General
                     Randolph. He had been a slave on the plantation of old Colonel Hollister, whose
                     homestead was famous for handsome chattels, both men and women. He, as well as Hollister, was the son of
                     the old colonel. His mother was a French mustee, for whom his father had given
                     fifteen hundred dollars in gold. She was his mistress till her death, and after
                     that he bought Hollister's mother, a much more beautiful and spirited woman.
                     Keene and Hollister were aware of their relationship, and never were two
                     brothers closer friends.
                  The dark grey eyes of this man either sparkled intensely, or were wet with
                     tears as he looked over towards Lucina. He marked the drooping eyes; he thought
                     he had never seen so sad and so lovely a countenance.
                  He gazed, and gazed, with his whole soul visible in his face, and when she
                     turned and went away with her flower, his head dropped, a sigh escaped him; a
                     bitter sigh.
                  "What young lady was that?" he queried of the gardener.
                  "Young lady! ky! that's missues' new slave. Young lady, yah! did you see de
                     blue dress? She no more young lady dan dis chile."
                  "A slave!" muttered Keene angrily; "a slave!" he repeated.
                  "Ky! shu' she is. Mighty peart piece, likewise. Dey
                     say she bin to boardin' school, derefo' she
                        'strordinary. Missis buy her—guess mars' didn't know nothin'
                        'bout her. Leaked out some way. She was a
                        slave. Bad white man bring her to
                     Virginny—sell her cheap to some white
                        massa—hard up fo' money—didn't know wha' sich a
                     gal worth. Missis on a visit to ole Virgin—derefo' see this gal—larn how she
                     didn't never dream she slave gal, good 'struction,
                     and so forth."
                  The gardener had a habit of emphasizing almost every other word.
                  "You say a Northern man brought her to Virginia!" exclaimed Keene; "where was
                     she before that?"
                  "Some school, s'pect, 'way off North; so dey
                        say. Don't know, on'y dey say so;
                     derefo' can't tell pertickler."
                  "Does her mistress think a good deal of her?" he asked, after a few moments of
                     deep thought.
                  "Ky! Fred Keene, wha' make you so mighty exquisitive? Yah! yah! yah! ain't got
                     no wife, has you?—mighty fine gal—scarce no color—don't
                        look like a yaller gal—mighty nice wife for Fred
                     Keene!"
                  "Hush, your fooling!" exclaimed Keene severely, and his voice was tremulous
                     with feeling; "I shall never have a wife!"
                  He walked abstractedly to the door of the conservatory, and passed out, leaving
                     the old gardener cutting and grafting.
                  "Sho! don't say so!" cried the black to himself in an ironical humor. "P'raps
                     nobody good enough for you but some white missus. White ladies
                        very kind to white niggers; oh, Lor'! yah, yah! can't
                        look on white gal, got black blood pint of a pin in her veins,
                     can ye! Wants missy wid her white kid gloves; oh, ky!"
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VII.
               IN FOUR PARTS.
               
                  PART I.
                  IN WHICH THE GUESTS ARE INTRODUCED, AND SOME THINGS MENTIONED
                     THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SPOKEN OF BEFORE.
                  
                     
                        
                           ——"But 'your eels are a vile oleaginous breed,'
                           He would fain use them gently but cookery says 'No,'
                           And—in short—eels were born to be treated just so."
                        
                     
                  
                  "HERE, you black rascal, jest go an' ax old Tab to fill dis jemijohn
                     wid,'lasses—quick!" cried Aunt Esty, handing the article in question to a
                     little woolly pated negro.
                  Away went the boy with the demijohn, running with all his might, while Aunt
                     Esty's eyes followed him; but the minute she turned away, he set down the
                     utensil, and turning his heels in the air, spent ten full minutes in healthful
                     gymnastic exercises.
                  When he came back, he received a diploma in the shape of two lusty blows on
                     each ear for being gone so long, at which he was very indignant, declaring that
                     "old Tabby let all de 'lasses run out of de bung-hole, and he had to stop while
                     she made some more!"
                  "You awful nigger!" cried the angry cook, "devil ketch ye dis yer bery night
                     when yer goes to bed! Thar, g'long wid yer short shanks. Come gals! work fas',
                     we's goin' to hev lots o' company to-morrow. Ye stone de reasons, Kate, an' ef
                     ye eats um, dey'll be jest like chuck-stones, an' make you dream ob dem
                     kang'roos what Mars' Kenneth sees in his, fits; da's so!"
                  Aunt Esty's kitchen was neat, notwithstanding the oft-repeated assertion that
                     Southern negroes are never clean. The cream stood on the white pine board,
                     yellow as gold. The eggs were beaten to a froth, yolks and whites apart. Sugar,
                     spices, flour, and many other delectable materials were placed around, ready
                     for use.
                  "You fixin' for pudd'ns 'minds me of a suckumstance 'curred when I war Missis
                     Clark's table-gal," said Kate, a diminutive colored woman. "Our cook name ole
                     Musty. Fus' rate ole woman, but mighty fond of "sperimentin'. Well, we used
                     have black gal, what name was Sal. Sal was fus' rate reader, young missus
                     larned her; so every time ole Musty want somefin 'strondinar' nice, she'd set
                     Sal ramsackin' all de pages what come in she way.
                  "So, one day, Sal she come crost a piece whar de man wha' makes de paper writs
                     sumin' makin' fun, ye knows, kase folks eats such mighty rich things, mixin' um
                     all up slumery flumery in dar stumacks; an' Sal she read it fo' law an'
                     gospil."
                  "Don't take de gospil too onraverent in your mouf', Kate," said Aunt Esty with
                     great gravity.
                  "Sal wasn't a know much for sartin, you sees," pursued Kate, "for I remember
                     whar he said, nice cake an' 'fection-
                     ary wasn't no wuss dan iron filins, ratsbin, arseny, or any dem ar' pison
                     tings.
                  "Tinks I, da's fun! I knows da's fun, I jest does, so! But when
                     Sal comes to de recepy, I larfs rite out, 'deed I does; an' ole
                     Musty she swaller it."
                  "Wha', de recepy?" asked Aunt Esty.
                  "Sho! you knows wha' I means. Now I members de recepy dis blessed minit. Thar's
                     your four pouns o' flour—thar's your two pouns o' butter; thar's your one poun
                     o' suet, your one ounces sallyratus, your quarter poun o' cloves, your dozen
                     eggs, your four spoonsf'ls of mustid; thar's your poun o' cheese, grated all
                     up, which all you wishes to sweeten to your taste. Thar, you Esty! thar's de
                     very recepy dat ole nigger swaller down, fo' make cheese pudd'n."
                  "Now, nigger, don't spec' I's gwine to bleeve dat!" exclaimed Aunt
                     Esty, stopping the motions of her rolling pin.
                  "'Deed she did! 'deed did she make it, 'fore blessed Marst'r,
                     'deed did she!" exclaimed Kate, gesticulating earnestly. "And bes'
                     of de hul was, missis hab a gran' company da bery day, and wanted a ticklar
                     nice pudd'n! Musty good cook, 'deed she was! but oh Lor', dat pudd'n! Choke
                     myse'f larfin', t'ought to blessed Marst'r I should, 'deed I
                        did, when she empty um out. Such a cheese pudd'n! oh, Lors!
                     good Lors! look for all de world like white bugs an' black bugs chasin'
                     tharselfs all ober de dishes."
                  "De creashun!" exclaimed Aunt Esty, laughing back and forth over her pastry;
                     "laws! you Kate, dat is nuf to choke a body; sartin so! Well, what
                     happen den?"
                  "Why you sees, I waits 'pon de table, an' I kind o' felt my har' rise when dat
                     ar' pudd'n come in. 'Deed ef blood didn't tingleum t'rough ebery vein dis yer
                     chile's body. Pore ole Musty! she bin sittin' down in de chimly corner, cryin'
                     luf her heart break, pore ole sole!
                  "'Well,' says missus, an' her powerful eyes 'gin to blaze, 'wha' kind o' mess
                     ole cook give us dis time, anyway?'
                  "'Please missus,' I whispers, 'it's bran new fashum—it's cheese pudd'n!' Dat
                     seem to sassify her like, an' she guv de pudd'n round; but 'fore blessed
                     Marst'r, it smell nuf to choke a nigger. De trufe I tell, nobody like put he
                     spoon in fus, so dey all put um in togedder; an' bery fus moufful, dey all
                     look's if dey swallowed toads an' live spiders. Some he put hankercher to he
                     mouf, some he turns from de table, an' some he guvs rite out, he did
                        so, an' has to clar off to de yard. 'Fore blessed Marst'r, I's
                     tellin' de trooth," she cried rapidly, tears and laughter following each other,
                     while her body rocked till the raisins danced from before her on the floor.
                  "But laws," she continued, sobering suddenly, "pore ole Musty! Missus go out
                     whar she war, spectin' fire an' brimstone, an' she ups wid ole
                     log, an' she chucks it rite at ole nigger's head; 'deed it's de blessed trufe!
                     I sees her do dat, an' I s'pect to dis yer day, da blow make she kill; 'cause
                     pore Musty die some day not bery far fore dat time. But what you tink? Dat bery
                     paper-man at da bery dinner! an' he, he, he, yah! he eat some ob he own cheese
                     pudd'n. Ya, ya; he, he, he! Guess he didn't write no mo' 'bout cheese pudd'n;
                     da's so! Guess he git nuf o' cheese pudd'ns."
                  
                  "Oh ky! you shet up; you talks too much, gal!" exclaimed Aunt Esty, laughing
                     and choking, for the story had pleased her greatly.
                  "When da' talk da' don't eat de reasons," replied Kate, demurely.
                  "Wonder wha' Lascas running here fo' da' way, like to broke he neck?"
                  "Laws, ole woman, ye ought to see de company!" cried the negro, springing into
                     the cabin; "giv us dat basket ober dar, quick! I's got to go right back to de
                     house to help."
                  "Like mighty well to see dem folks wha's come," said Aunt Esty. "Kate, you
                     watch de cookin', I'll run over back way, an' jest hab a look at dar
                     faces."
                  "Laws! yes, Aunt Esty, I'll nebber stir—take good car' o' ebery ting; will
                     so."
                  "Now, you jes' look in dat ar' oben," said Aunt Esty, untying her floured
                     apron; "an' be car'ful, or old Tartar come in, eat up ebery blessed ting."
                  "Sure's I lib, Aunt Esty, I sit here jes'so,an' pick de plums;
                     won't stir for my mars'r," cried the woman.
                  No sooner had Aunt Esty flown like a very substantial bird across the space
                     that intervened between the house and the kitchen, than Kate sprang up, set the
                     dish of raisins on the table, and ran out of the door up to the corner of the
                     house. There, sheltered by a throng of noisy black children, she watched till
                     the new comers entered; then she hurried back, and was industriously picking
                     raisins on Aunt Esty's return.
                  "Laws! did dey look like folks?" asked Kate innocently.
                  "Yes,'deed dey did! dey look like real folks! None o' you make
                     bleeve gintility. Dar's two young ladies in one car'ge, an' a lady an'
                     gen'leman in de odder. Lady wi' gen'leman look mighty pale, do; an' gen'leman
                     he mighty carf'I—da's so."
               
               
                  PART II.
                  THE NEW GUESTS.
                  Miss Lufburrow came later to Washington Grange, quite at dusk, bringing with
                     her a little Irish servant, in order, she declared before she went, that none
                     o' them poor slaves should do anything for her. She was an ordinary looking
                     woman, with a pale face, pale eyes, and pale hair. She had a pale way of
                     dressing, also, as all her dresses looked as if they had once been in the blush
                     of youth, but had now faded.
                  Mabel Van Broek had been welcomed, and was reclining on a crimson lounge in the
                     parlor that had been prepared for her. In compliance with her, request, she was
                     alone, that she might obtain a little rest after her wearisome journey. Fitful,
                     though glorious, was the bright red on her cheeks.
                  Harry was sitting with Lawyer Kenneth in his private room, leading from the
                     back verandah, and fitted up with voluptuous elegance. Hattie Goldsmith and
                     Maggie Wil lis were busy in one of the
                     large back chambers, combing and arranging their locks; while Phillis was
                     pulling out dress after dress from the open trunks that stood round, and
                     another slave supplied the young girls with towels, brushes, or whatever other
                     appendage of the toilet they wanted.
                  Hattie Goldsmith was a tall, good-looking, energetic girl, with dark hair and
                     splendid eyes. The rest of her features were indifferent. Maggie, on the
                     contrary, had a charming little face, capable of being moulded into any
                     expression, and sometimes almost laughable for its mobility. Now her eyebrows
                     would rise, now lower—now her mouth worked nervously, especially if some one
                     described any startling or curious incident; and her beautiful nostrils would
                     swell and curve, her eyes flash, her brow become stormy. Or else, on the
                     repetition of some laughable story, her face would grow fantastic in its mirth.
                     She was quite small, perfectly proportioned, and as wild an elf as ever was
                     imaged in the shadowy groves of fairy land. Quick of temper, somewhat
                     imperious, yet easily melted to tears and penitence—wherever she went she was a
                     favorite. She was one of those persons who could say just what she pleased, and
                     nobody thought of reproving her. Termed by her parents an oddity, and by her
                     teachers incorrigible, Mag had pretty much her own way on all occasions, and
                     was, therefore, terribly self-willed. Her cousin termed her a young female
                     Napoleon, because she generally led the van on every occasion, and subdued
                     others to her own desire.
                  She called herself an experiment, and a doubtful one at that.
                  "For one day," she declared, "I sit down with pen and ink before me, bite my
                     thumb nail till there's no more of it, and then I take to biting my pen, but
                     that hurts my teeth. I call up all the celebrities, French, German, and
                     English. First I vow I'll be a second De Staël—then a Madame Roland. So I go to
                     writing furiously something about politics, government, etc.—and all at once
                     that wicked woman, George Sand, pops into my head.Then I try to build a
                     monument of sand, but I can't say such queer high-up-in-the-sky things, and I
                     come down to common sense, and imagine myself Mary Howitt. Then I think
                     something about a factory, and labor away till I've got a real grand verse
                     about poor little children starving to death, and so forth. That makes me
                     hungry, and I call for a lunch. Then, of course, I have to wash the ink off my
                     fingers, and before I know it, I am talking to Bob, the canary. That suggests
                     singing, and off I pop to the piano; and before the day is out, I've really
                     forgotten that I'm going to be anybody at all. I don't believe I am; that's the
                     worst of it."
                  Such a girl was Mag Willis; a creature to admire, to play with, to laugh and
                     wonder at, and a great study for the gentlemen.
                  Hattie Goldsmith, on the contrary, was really a genius. She improvised. She
                     sketched. She painted. She wrote poetry. She read French, German, and Italian.
                     She showed very little on the surface; but her heart was a deep well, always
                     mirroring beauty.
                  "We had such a time in the cars!" cried the volatile Maggie. "I got up quite a
                     flirtation with the funniest fel-
                     low—wasn't he Hat?—the most comical genius you ever saw."
                  "What! a perfect stranger to you?" asked Amy, whose dignity was a little
                     shocked.
                  "To be sure!" replied Mag, tossing off curl after curl from the glossy hair
                     winding about her finger; "wasn't he, Hat?"
                  "To you, yes—but not to me. I happened to meet him a year ago; he was then just
                     going off to the West Indies. Your neighbor's friend was in company with
                     him—General Randolph's son."
                  "Oh, you don't say!" cried Amy, with a little leap, and a clap of the hands,
                     "that Marshal Randolph has returned from England?"
                  "Yes; but you can't remember anything about him," replied Hattie, banding back
                     her dark hair—"he has been away seven years, hasn't he?"
                  "Yes; but I do remember him, though, if I was only
                     eight years old when he left. He was a boy then, and I remember what good times
                     I used to have with Hollister and him," replied Amy.
                  "Who is Hollister?" asked Hattie, now sitting down, and half lounging, while
                     she drew her blue dressing-gown carefully about her, that she might not
                     disarrange her wardrobe.
                  "Hollister—oh! he's one of our slaves," replied Amy, coloring a little; "a pert
                     and saucy fellow, too, who presumes a good deal because he has white blood in
                     his veins. These white slaves are intolerable!" she exclaimed.
                  "I don't think so," cried Mag, now emerging from her dressing-gown, and
                     preparing to don an elegant muslin, duly flounced. "I'm mighty proud of ours,
                     especially when they travel with us. It gives one more consequence to carry
                     around an elegant-looking slave, with perfumed locks, gold chain, and kids. And
                     when there are no beaus, it's somewhat amusing to pretend to show them a little
                     extra notice, too. I think it's prime fun, because they do often actually
                        like one; and then they are slaves, indeed. My! we
                     have one at home who will fly, if I lift my finger, quicker than any gallant
                     I've got!"
                  "How ridiculously you talk!" exclaimed Hattie, laughing.
                  "Well, if I wasn't ridiculous, no amount of pains would make me sensible,"
                     retorted Maggie. "Better be an out and out fool, than neither one thing nor
                     t'other. Phillis, if that's your name, do for pity's sake untangle this hook
                     for me; I can't move."
                  Phillis, in her eagerness to serve the young lady, and proud that she had been
                     preferred for this duty before the handsome Lucina, sprang forward with such
                     eagerness that, tripping over some article that lay on the floor, she fell,
                     severely spraining her ankle.
                  The other slave endeavored to lift her up, but Phillis cried out with piercing
                     screams that her ankle was broken, and with many an exclamation of impatience
                     from her young mistress, the girl was sent off to be taken care of.
                  "The great fool!" cried Amy passionately, "she ought to be beaten for being so
                     careless."
                  
                  "It was an accident, you know," said Hattie compassionately.
                  "If she had sprained her head," said Mag laughing, "or her neck, she wouldn't
                     have minded it in the least, but these niggers have such tender feet and
                     ankles. I reckon they were originally intended to walk on their hands."
                  Amy laughed at this, and Mrs. Kenneth, who had entered at the sound of
                     distress, said, "I suppose you will have to take Lucina, now. What shall we do
                     for Mrs. Van Broek?"
                  "Oh, she's used to doing without niggers, I imagine," returned Amy; "get some
                     of the other girls to wait upon her."
                  "What! that sweet looking invalid? oh, indeed, don't take an experienced
                     dressing-maid away from her, for our sake, I pray," said the good hearted
                     Hattie Goldsmith; "she needs her more than we do. As for Mag and I, we've been
                     travelling so much that we've quite learned to do for ourselves; and we voted
                     to leave our maids at home because they're so ladyish on a journey, that we can
                     positively hardly put up with them."
                  "Well, Lucina isn't an experienced dressing-maid," said Amy with ill-concealed
                     irony; "but a young lady (!) quite as white as you or I, whom
                     mamma took a fancy to because she was going to be sold off South. I assure you
                     that neither you nor I can compare with her in the matter of beauty, bearing,
                     or accomplishments. For my part, I don't want a princess at my elbow; but as I
                     can't possibly dress myself, I suppose I shall have to take her
                     for a while. The Quakeress is probably asleep, and will not want her till
                     to-morrow."
                  Mrs. Kenneth left the room, her cloud-like dress of white floating about her
                     delicate figure, and her blue cap-ribbons streaming, making a gentle fluttering
                     noise.
                  "Is that gentleman who came with her your aunt's brother?" asked Hattie
                     Goldsmith.
                  "Bless you, no; he's her son!"
                  "Never!" cried Mag; "if so, he was certainly born before his mother. Why, she
                     doesn't look twenty, and he is thirty, at least."
                  "There you are mistaken," said Amy, "she is fully thirty-eight, and he not over
                     twenty-five, if he is that."
                  "Now, Hat!" cried Maggie, contracting her movable features, "did you ever hear
                     of one's having a mother only ten years older than oneself?"
                  "Oh, she's his step-mother!" replied Amy laughing as much at Mag's queer face
                     as her frolicksome tongue.
                  "Ah, that puts the matter right. Well, he is certainly a very niceish young
                     man, as our Jupiter says."
                  "Jupiter! have you got a Jupiter?" asked Amy.
                  "To be sure we have; a great black fellow six feet high; such a giant!"
                  "We have a Jupiter, too," said Amy, "but he's a little imp, not four feet high.
                     He's the greatest piece there is on the place; but father humors him
                     dreadfully, because he's smart."
                  At the entrance of Lucina, Hattie started, quite in surprise at her
                     appearance.
                  "Luce," exclaimed Amy, an indignity she had not before attempted, "I wish you
                     to put my hair in decent order for
                     to-night. Unfortunately my own dressing-maid has hurt herself; see how well you
                     can do it."
                  Maggie and Hattie exchanged glances.
                  This girl certainly, just then, under the stigma of bondage, appeared
                     incomparably more to advantage than her mistress. What reserve! what
                     dignity!—an ease of manner impossible to imitate. Was this a slave? There were
                     white girls on the plantation, but they were nothing like her. They were
                     presuming, forward, seemingly unconscious or careless of their condition. She
                     stood there, looking so serene, so sadly conscious, yet so modest! Every
                     movement was that of a refined nature. Her beauty was exoticlike; rare colors
                     rarely blended. Her blue dress was exchanged for a white one of plain fashion
                     and common material, but it only added grace to the outline of her perfect
                     figure.
                  "There! I told you so; don't you see she's a lady?" queried Amy, with voice and
                     manner that would have seemed vulgar in any slave. Lucina had gone from the
                     room.
                  "Why, where in the world did you get her?" cried Maggie; "she looks like a rose
                     blooming in the wrong place."
                  "What nonsense!" exclaimed Amy faintly. "Don't, for pity's sake, go to being
                     romantic about her!"
                  "I shall—I most certainly shall; shan't I, Hat? I take all the
                     pretty slave-girls under my protection, and marry them off nicely to
                     house-servants; and I warrant you I've made some good matches in my day—only
                     poor Dinny!"
                  "What of her?" queried Amy, who being dressed had no objection to hearing a
                     story.
               
               
                  PART III.
                  THE BROKEN HEART.
                  "Why, it's not a very unusual case," said Maggie; "but I cried myself almost to
                     death about it. I did indeed! although she was a slave girl. She had grown up
                     with me—Dinny had—and upon my word, I was quite attached to her. You may
                     believe that, when I tell you I wouldn't accept a watch on my twelfth birth-day
                     unless Dinny had one too. She was handsome. Blue eyes, dark auburn hair—curling
                     elegantly; such features! such a figure! such an air! She was somewhat
                     educated, too—quick, you see, and being with me always when my tutors came, she
                     picked up an astonishing sight of knowledge. I used even to teach her to play,
                     and she sang the plantation songs accompanying herself on the piano. Every time
                     I had a new dress, so did Dinny. Her name was originally Dinah, given her by
                     her Creole mother. That was vulgar, you know. Don't you think so,
                     for so pretty a girl? so I called her Dinny. What was I saying? Oh, every time
                     I had a new dress, so had Dinny, and don't you think, I even saved my
                     pocket-money to get her a silk dress, once in a while.
                  "Oh! you can't think what a pretty, loving creature she was. Amy Kenneth, if
                     you laugh it me because there are tears in my eyes, you deserve to be whipped.
                     If you had known poor Dinny, you would have loved her too. I am very sure you
                     would.
                  
                  "There was a young sprightly mulatto on our plantation, a shoemaker. Handsome,
                     lively, and agreeable, and a second Paganini. Upon my word, he did
                     play the violin very sweetly. Quite dark, to be sure, but such eyes! black,
                     shining, real glorious eyes! Well, of course I must get up a match between Cob
                     and Dinny. He never had I any other name, that I know of but Cobler, so we
                     called him Cob for brevity. I began to hint round, then managed together, and
                     the wooing went bravely on. By and by Dinny told me a secret—oh! girls, such a
                     secret! she was going to be married. To be sure, I was just as ignorant as you
                     please, and expressed any amount of artless wonder.
                  "Dinny had a great wedding. I put the bridal veil on myself, and twined the
                     orange flowers around her curls. Didn't she look pretty, though? and wern't
                     they a right handsome couple? We had them in the parlor, of course. Mother, you
                     know, is in her element at such times, and the cake was a perfect tower, with
                     flags, and such beautiful ornaments! It was a triumph of art.
                  "Twelve picked men played at the wedding, and serenaded Dinny and Cob to their
                     pretty little cabin. They were going—that is, Dinny was going to be my maid
                     still, you know, but they thought they must have a cabin, and I had actually
                     coaxed fifty dollars out of father, that I might furnish it all my own self.
                     She didn't know anything about it till she stood in the doorway. You never saw
                     such a look as she gave me when the pretty furniture, neat chairs and andirons,
                     and a bit of carpet, and a curtained bed, and a bureau, first met her sight.
                     Down she fell on her knees, and kissed my hand so gracefully, while her eyes
                     were full of tears. I declare! if a painter could have caught that scene!
                  "Do see Hat's eyes glisten—we shall have the painting, be sure! Hat paints
                     beautifully, Amy, did you know it? Originates, too. Do paint it, Hatty, it will
                     make you famous.
                  "Well, indeed, they were a happy as well as a handsome couple, and loved each
                     other dearly, you may be sure. Every day I congratulated myself that I had made
                     two human beings blessed—when, like a clap of thunder—oh, dear! I can't bear to
                     think of it!"
                  Her face was hidden for a moment between both hands.
                  "Well, to be sure it's very foolish to be so 'flumstrated, as Jupiter calls
                     it," she cried, a smile twinkling through something that looked like tears in
                     her bright eyes, "but I've begun the story, and you shall have it all.
                  "You see, I always had thought that Cob belonged to father—oh, dear! why didn't
                     I know? It seems he was 'the property' of my uncle Jeff, one of
                     the most hateful brutes that ever existed. There! whenever I call him names, I
                     feel like a Catholic just coming from the confessional, with absolvo te ringing in her ears. He was, I mean is,
                     a mean, wicked, black-hearted man. Don't you believe any of our
                     blood runs in his veins; he is only my mother's brother by compulsion—that is,
                     through marriage, someway. Oh! how I did hate that old man! Long, grey beard,
                     black-grey eye, peaked nose, narrow forehead, bald headed. Do you know, girls,
                     I think he'll go to that place when he
                     dies—'tisn't polite to call it by name. Oh, my! such a nose!
                  "Now, you're laughing—you don't know how sad it's going to be! Sad as a
                     funeral.
                  "Cob belonged to Uncle Jeff, and when he went further South, owning a great
                     many negroes, and a first-rate shoemaker among them, he left Cob, then quite
                     young, on my father's plantation. Poor Cob! I wonder where he is now?
                  "Dinny had been married just a year, when Uncle Jeff came after Cob. He seemed
                     to think it a fine joke that he was married; too bad to separate them; and so
                     forth. Dinny overheard this. She came to me, white as a sheet, and could only
                     say, 'oh, Miss Maggie—oh, Lord! Miss Maggie!'
                  "I was frightened—poor thing! she was soon to become a mother—and although I
                     didn't know what the matter was, I almost cried to see her distress.
                  "By and by she sobbed it out. 'Dinny and Cobb be parted? Never!' Why, girls, I
                     didn't dream it would be done. I went to father to see what it meant. He
                     referred me to Uncle Jeff, saying that he had offered more than he could afford
                     for Cob, already—the cotton season had been so bad.
                  "'Oh! father, buy him at any rate!' I cried, 'I'll go without silk dresses for
                     a year.' Hat knows what a denial that would be for me. But he only
                     said, 'I don't think Jeffries will sell him for any price. He's a peculiar man,
                     and set in his way.'
                  "I thought I'd like to see him set in such a way that
                     he wouldn't move again in hurry. But I went to him, and used my woman's wit,
                     tears, threats, and eloquence—all to no purpose. All the old wretch said was,
                     'let the jade get another husband.' Jade! to call Dinny a jade! I hope he'll
                     have to expiate, for just that one word, nine hundred and ninety-nine
                     years.
                  "How I begged and prayed! 'Wouldn't he sell Cob at any rate?'
                  "'No!'
                  "'Wouldn't he buy poor Dinny?—if not now, by and by, when she got quite
                     well?'
                  "'No! Had more more 'wenches' than he knew what to do with—one waiting for Cob
                     already.' Oh, my soul! girls, I felt like burning him alive. I was a rank
                     universalist before that—now, I don't think that man will ever be
                     saved. Ah! if Cob didn't look like a changed man! His sprightly step was gone.
                     He never looked up—oh, dear, dear—I never want to like a slave girl again—no,
                     never.
                  "When they came to part it was awful! I had locked myself in my chamber, but I
                     couldn't stand her screams. I took one of father's pistols in my hand, and
                     clown I went. Do you think that old brute was pulling poor Dinny by main force
                     from her husband? Suppose that was you or I, girls, what would we do?
                  "My blood was up, and it don't generally take much to raise it, so I just
                     stepped forward with the loaded pistol, and cried out:
                  "'Uncle Jeff, if you don't let that woman alone, I'll shoot you as true as I
                     live.' He was a coward—I knew he was.
                     Any man who will take hold of a woman that way, slave or not, is a coward.
                  "'You've no business? in the first place, to separate them,' I cried as he
                     turned pale and moved away. 'You have been offered a good price for Cob, and
                     you might have Dinny almost for nothing, and now that you will
                     take Cob away they shall be just as long as they please, parting.'
                  "Oh Dinny, my poor, poor Dinny! she lay upon Cob's bosom, white as a ghost; and
                     clung to him as death clings to the dying. He, poor fellow, was trying to look
                     brave, but it wouldn't do; oh no, manly as he was, after a long effort to keep
                     still, he burst into tears, and with his head fallen on her shoulder, he sobbed
                     aloud.
                  "I cried with them—cried like a baby—for Dinny had been more like a sister than
                     a slave.
                  "Pretty soon Cob lifted his head—looked down in her face.
                  "'Take her, Miss Maggie,' he said, turning his face away, 'pray de Lord she
                     never come to again.'
                  "Dinny had fainted.
                  "They just took her in that unconscious state, and bore her up to my own room,
                     and Cob was carried off.
                  "Oh, that awful coming to! that terrible waking to life, that was worse than
                     death! If Dinny had been just a common black slave, I suppose I shouldn't have
                     cared or thought much of her distress; but she was as white as I am, every
                     whit.
                  "After that, never once did that wretched wife smile—never! Her babe was born
                     dead, and we nursed her as carefully as we knew how. To be sure she got over
                     that, sat up, and walked out; but her hand was always on her heart. She grew
                     whiter and whiter, thinner and thinner; sometimes starting, and clapping her
                     hand to her heart, as if a spasm seized it, and doing that one day, she fell
                     down dead at my feet.
                  
                  "There, girls, I declare I shan't be fit to go to table. Are my eyes red, Amy?
                     are they Hat? I look like a fright when they are. You won't catch me to tell
                     that story again, before dinner. No, and I don't know as I will any time."
                  "We've got a fussy old creature here—you mustn't mind her," whispered Amy, as
                     the bell rang, and they were all going down stairs. Amy had listened to
                     Maggie's story without a tear, or the sign of one.
                  "Pray, who and what is she?" asked Maggie.
                  "A Miss Lufburrow, from the West—some distant relation. Rich as a Jew, but very
                     queer."
                  "Good! I'm glad you've got some curiosities," said Maggie.
               
               
                  PART IV.
                  LAWYER KENNETH ON SLAVES.
                  The dining-room was lighted with a profusion of wax candles. They blazed on
                     antique silver candelabra, that for
                     oddity of design and grotesqueness of ornament, might have formed a part of an
                     old Roman's establishment.
                  The broad, long table was spread with delicacies. Sparkling wines reddened
                     richly-cut decanters; a vivid lustre brightened the frescoed ceiling, and made
                     the pictures stand out with almost living beauty.
                  Lawyer Kenneth very gallantly escorted the young ladies to a seat. Presently
                     Miss Lufburrow and Mrs. Kenneth entered. The trim waiters in uniform grinned to
                     each other, while the pale little old maid in her dress of pale lemon-color,
                     took the seat assigned her.
                  "This is an unexpected pleasure!" exclaimed the lawyer, as Mabel Van Brock
                     entered, leaning on the arm of her son. Very sweetly she looked in her dress of
                     a clear amber color, her cheeks slightly reddened by excitement.
                  Harry was often looked at, and much admired by the girls. Of course, the
                     glances were taken ad libitum, and by
                     stealth. He never knew it. Men are like blocks of wood. They have no vanity. At
                     least that is the opinion of the men themselves. He was, to tell the truth, so
                     charmed with his mother's apparent vivacity and buoyancy, that he had eyes for
                     little else.
                  "Pray, does thee have good water, here, brother?" asked Mabel.
                  "Water—umph! well, really, sis, I can't tell, for the life of me; I have never
                     tasted it," replied Lawyer Kenneth, bringing his wine glass before him with a
                     series of delicate taps, and getting ready to pour out the wine.
                  "Why, father!" exclaimed Amy, laughing.
                  "Truth, sis! lived here sixteen years, and 'pon my word I don't know what sort
                     of a taste the water has, or whether it has any taste at all. This is my
                     drink," and he poured out a glass full of the wine.
                  "Why, brother, is thee really in earnest?" asked Mabel.
                  "To be sure; did thee ever know a birth-right Quaker to tell—improbable
                     stories?" queried the lawyer. "Ask my wife, she'll assure you that I'm the soul
                     of honor," he added, with an expressive look.
                  "My brother, the Rev. Joe Lufburrow, has become a decided temperance man," said
                     the little old maid, receiving her wine gratefully.
                  "Indeed!" exclaimed the lawyer.
                  "Yes, he's given up every drink but water."
                  The lawyer offered wine to his sister; to Harry. Both respectfully
                     declined.
                  "My brother, the Rev. Joe Lufburrow, of Hamilton county, West Hathborough,
                     thinks that temperance is one of the cardinal virtues," said Miss Lufburrow,
                     across the table to Maggie.
                  "Ah!" said Maggie, "I wasn't aware that cardinals had any virtue to speak
                     of!"
                  Harry turned a quick, roguish glance upon her, for which he was rewarded with a
                     smile.
                  "My brother, the Rev. Joe Lufburrow, thought that wine didn't agree with him,"
                     continued the lady, after staring quite amiably at Maggie, for a moment.
                  "Dear me, mamma," whispered Amy, "she'll pursue that declaration to death."
                  
                  "Pray, Miss Lufburrow, was your brother an Indian preacher?" asked Maggie, very
                     gravely. "There was a Lufburrow, a Choctaw, quite a fine-looking man, on one of
                     the Western Reservations, where we went last summer—where was it, Hat?"
                  Hattie could not speak for suppressed laughter. It was, indeed, comical to see
                     the little woman's look of horror.
                  "They said his name was given him, first, because he liked very much to borrow; Loveborrow was the original in translated
                     Choctaw—corrupted into Lufburrow, I think one quite as pretty as the other,"
                     she said, demurely.
                  "My brother is not an Indian, miss!" exclaimed poor Miss
                     Lufburrow, with a very severe expression. "He is the Rev. Joe
                     Lufburrow, of Hamilton county, West Hathborough; a
                        highly intelligent and educated man."
                  "Oh! I beg your pardon," said Maggie, readily.
                  Lawyer Kenneth was talking volubly with Harry. He was a splendid
                     conversationalist. The wine touched his tongue with fire; kindled in his eyes a
                     strange, clear, flameful flickering. He loved to boast of his slaves.
                  "You hear wild and improbable stories at the North," he said. "The color of
                     fanaticism is always blood-red. I tell you, there is not a happier set of
                     people in the world, take them as a whole, than the slaves. Your courts hang a
                     poor white man for murder, and imprison him for theft. We give the rascally
                     thief a few lashes, and the thing is over with. The next day he forgets the
                     whipping."
                  "And repeats the theft?" queried Harry.
                  "Perhaps so. Your convicts do the same thing; only their confinement makes the
                     dog a wolf."
                  "And if they kill, what then?"
                  "Oh! then we hang them up in the nearest tree."
                  "Without giving them any benefit of trial by jury?"
                  "Assuredly not! Trial by jury—niggers! ha! ha!"
                  Harry's face flushed.
                  "Now, I never touch my slaves," said Lawyer Kenneth—"never whipped a slave in
                     my life."
                  
                  At that very moment, night was framing in an awful picture. On one of Mr.
                     Kenneth's plantations in Danville, Kentucky, an incipient revolution had that
                     day been discovered. Twenty-four slaves were doomed to death. Seven of them
                     were women, of whom two had been sold from their families in Washington Grange,
                     for some trifling misdemeanor. Three of the men and two of the women belonged
                     to Lawyer Kenneth; the rest were slaves on adjoining plantations.
                  On the outskirts of a field, the drivers and agents had selected twenty-four
                     young pine trees, and to each tree they had bound a slave. Then they heaped
                     fagots about the roots—piled them high—laughing, jeering, blaspheming, as they
                     worked. The slaves were naked—some were light, and some were ebon black.
                  God gave no moon that night. All day the sky had been overshadowed with partial
                     darkness. These men and women, had they been in France, dying thus for liberty,
                        would to-day have been immortal.
                     But they were slaves in a country of freedom, and their ashes, unknown and
                     unhonored, are scattered to the four winds of heaven. The fagots were heaped.
                     The women looked down in speechless terror, and felt not only their own, but
                     the pulses of unborn babes, leaping with the horror of nature outraged at
                     prospect of such a fate.
                  Scorn them for their degradation as you may, they were still women, mothers,
                     wives.
                  
                  "I never whipped a slave in my life!" said Lawyer Kenneth, smacking his lips at
                     his luxurious table.
                  They had lighted the fagots in Kentucky, perhaps at the very second that he
                     spoke, draining his glass.
                  Oh! could those shrieks, those groans, those piteous wailings, have been heard
                     amidst the splendor of that room! Could those roasting bodies, shrinking,
                     scorching, shrivelling, broiling, have been there ranged in the stead of those
                     luminous pictures, with their cumbrous frames, that cost not half as much—what
                     consternation! what livid cheeks! what starting eyes! what fearful swoons,
                     would have borne witness to the revolting horrors of slavery!
                  "To-morrow I'll take you over my place," said Lawyer Kenneth. "I have, though I
                     say it, the finest set of slaves that can be found in Washington county."
                  "How do you manage them?" asked Harry.
                  "I magnetize them," was the reply.
                  "Magnetize them?" exclaimed Harry and Mabel together
                  "Magnetize them—why, sir, I can tame a wild bull if I can but get his eye,"
                     replied the lawyer, slightly lowering his brows, and sweeping the table with a
                     piercing glance, from which his wife involuntarily drew back. So did Hattie
                     Goldsmith.
                  "There's Spitfire, my horse; one of the most incorrigible Lucifers, when I
                     bought him, that was ever known. In fact, had the enviable notoriety of having
                     killed two or three men. I made the brute as mild as an angel, in my hands. I
                     wouldn't counsel any one else to touch or ride him, however—it would be a
                     dangerous experiment."
                  The black waiters nodded their heads to each other, as much as to say "that's
                     so."
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VIII.
               IN FIVE PARTS.
               
                  PART I.
                  MABEL AND LUCINA.
                  
                     Showing that while one human soul was enduring anguish beyond all portrayal,
                        Lawyer Kenneth took luxurious care of his race-horses, especially the one
                        which in nature assimilated most to himself.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           "Oh! grief beyond all other grief, when fate
                           First leaves the young heart lone and desolate."
                        
                     
                  
                  MEANWHILE Lucina sat in the parlor vacated by Mabel Van Broek. One light burned
                     on the table upon which rested her elbows. Her face was hidden by her hands.
                     Her posture denoted utter despondency. Her breathing was a succession of
                     sighs.
                  Slowly she lifted her head—her hands fell listlessly on the table before her,
                     as she murmured, "Hopeless!"
                  "Dare I tell this sweet woman my story?" she asked herself, shuddering, as the
                     powerful eyes of Lawyer Kenneth seemed reading her secret thought. "She is from
                     the North. If she knew my hapless condition, I am sure she would pity me. But I
                     want more than pity—I want help! This woman, whom I must call mistress,
                     promises me protection; but of what avail would that be, were her master and
                     mine determined to sell me? Oh, God! pity me!"
                  A tap at the window. Lucina knew the bright black face that was pressed against
                     the glass. She raised the sash.
                  "Yo', Lucene—ole Hep's out yere, down to Aunt Esty's kitch'n; she sen' fo' you;
                     says you mus' come, right away."
                  "Who is old Hep's, Jupiter, and what does she want of me?"
                  "Ole Heps, laws! do'no' who da nigger is? why, she Africum, wha'
                     was slave once, but free now. She mighty ole nigger, mos' a tousand, I 'specs.
                     She want to see yo' mighty bad."
                  Lucina paused and thought a moment. The kitchen was not far from the house—an
                     hour, frequently two, was spent at the dinner table—nobody would miss her;
                     besides, Jupiter had spoken the charmed word—this old woman was
                        free!
                  
                  She hurried from the room through the hall, and stepped out into the mild
                     night. The stars were strewn thick, like silver seeds, over the dark field of
                     the sky, but there was no moon. Following Jupiter, she soon came to the
                     kitchen. Loud shouting and laughter sounded there; the blacks appeared to be
                     having a happy time of it. Jupiter threw himself in their midst, and with a Jim
                     Crow attitude, announced "da' white Lucene's come!"
                  Reluctantly Lucina entered. Aunt Esty abandoned her own seat on an empty
                     raisin-box, and offered it to her. The kitchen was a large comfortable room,
                     well supplied with conveniences for culinary operations, but woefully lacking
                     in chairs. Hence, Hepsy had contrived to mount to the long white table, and
                     seated at such an elevation, with her immense crop of snow-white hair, looked
                     grimmer, more gaunt, more majestic
                     than ever. Lucina recognized her instantly by Jupiter's description, "mos'a
                     tousand." Aged as she was, she really looked much older to-night. Her eyes were
                     turned towards the new comer. Four or five of the slave women were lounging
                     about, all regarding her with more or less curiosity.
                  A candle, struck in a square block of wood, flared from the mantel-piece, and
                     Aunt Esty kept jumping up and snuffing it with her fingers whenever its beams
                     grew dim, which was very often, for the candle was of poor material—the meanest
                     of mean dips.
                  "So you's da' gal wha' Missy Kenneth done gone buy?" said old Hepsy, clasping
                     her hands under her chin, and gazing thoughtfully upon her.
                  "De Lord forgib her!" she ejaculated in a low tone a moment after, and as if
                     talking to herself; "Lord don't forgib sich tings 'dough—da's wha' he make hell
                     for;" and she shook her head repeatedly.
                  "Da's de bery features! Look jes' like he—'deed, 'fore blessed Mars', look jes'
                     like he! De god Lor,' wha' me talking 'bout?" She shrugged her shoulders, and
                     shook her head again.
                  Lucina's poor fettered heart beat painfully at these words. Who
                     did she look like?
                  She glanced sixteen summers back. It was a long retrospect, but she could see
                     there the forlorn child, fatherless, motherless. The poor dependent little girl
                     cared for by hirelings. No wonder the dark eyes grew sad! No wonder the lips
                     quivered rapidly. And thus she had grown up, petted, admired for her
                     beauty—loved, as her childish heart longed to be loved—never.
                  Here she sat at last, torn from all the ties she had ever known—kind teachers,
                     brilliant studies—torn, under pretence of being carried home—to
                     that home she had imaged so often, from surroundings that had grown beautiful
                     to her—and by the faithlessness of a man-fiend (and that man born and bred in
                     the North!) sold into hopeless bondage!
                  Here she sat at last in the kitchen, amidst slaves, herself a slave.
                  "Will you tell me what you mean?" she asked, trembling with agitation; "who do
                     I look like? who did you ever see that looked like me?"
                  "Ky, chile! plenty slave gals white as you!" cried the old African, while
                     intelligent glances passed from slave to slave.
                  "Ky! ole Hepsy know some tings couldn't make her tell; no, not if chop head
                     right off. Never do tell white folks' sins; black folks' sins dey am make
                     double. Laws, yes! 'case a slave ain't got no soul; devil chops black stuff up
                     in little small pieces, make black folks out of; dey nebber has no
                     soul! Dey ain't got no hebben to go to—dey ain't got no hell to go
                     to—consequence, black folks bar all dey sins, an' white people's too—da's
                     so."
                  "Nonsense!" exclaimed Aunt Esty, "niggers got souls well's odder peoples;
                     debble don't make niggers eider—da's moonshine, an' yo' know yo' don't believe
                     it. You don' got hardened, I fears; ain't got de 'ligion ob de Lord Jesus
                     Christ in you ole heart."
                  "P'raps you has!" exclaimed the old negress, with a sneer.
                  
                  "I knows I has, kase what I bin love befo' I hate now—what I hate befo' I love
                     now. Used do all de wicked tings could find for han's to do. Now love precious
                     Marst'r Jesus who 'pill he precious blood fo' me—po' dying sinner."
                  "I must go back to the house," exclaimed Lucina, starting up; "they will miss
                     me."
                  "Sho! wha' s'pose car ef dey do?" queried old Hepsy; "plenty yaller gals do
                     dere biddin. 'Fore my blessed Marster, ef I bin you, wouldn't
                     tetch my han' to work—wha's de use bein' slave when might jes' well be
                     missis—ky!"
                  "Hush, old Hepsy! Mars' Kenneth got powerful ears!" cried Aunt Esty.
                  "Kar ef he hab! Mars' Kenneth notin' more to do wi' ole Heps—'deed no—he hab
                        no! cried the aged woman, her eyes beginning to shine, and her
                     body to rock, "Mars' Kenneth go to de debbil! dar! an' dar's whar he
                        will go!"
                  "Don't go be frightened," whispered Aunt Esty to Lucina, "'specs ole Heps' got
                     in one of her hitytitys. Mighty ugly ole woman when she mind to be—hasn't had
                     one ob dem turns fo' year. Ole ting dreadful changed eber since her Sue
                     died."
                  "Oh, horror! horror!" cried Lucina to herself, with a sickening soul; "oh,
                     where am I? How can I bear these sights?"
                  Dizzy and faint, she tottered out into the yard. The soft night wind swept by;
                     its cool touch revived her, and restored her almost suspended animation. Still
                     the snow-white head of the vengeful negress appeared like a vivid light in a
                     dark night directly before her, and her ringing cry as she closed the door, "Go
                     to Mars' Kenneth an' tell he Lord will have vengeance—'deed will
                        He," still vibrated. on her ears.
                  She hurried along, keeping in the broad path that led round by the house to the
                     front of the verandah. Entering that, she paused a moment, for her own name was
                     spoken. Two voices were engaged in colloquy. They were not slaves, she thought,
                     for their language was not in the negro dialect.
                  "Have you seen this new girl, Lucina?" asked one.
                  "Oh, yes; a few days ago she came into the conservatory for a flower. I was
                     there with the gardener," replied the second voice.
                  "She is as white as you or I. What do you think about this story that she was
                     well educated at the North? Do you believe it probable?"
                  "Certainly; I believe it;" replied the other; "and what is more, I believe one
                     of her parents was not a slave."
                  "Of course," said the first speaker, "it is very likely that her master was
                     some white planter!"
                  "Or her mother some planter's wife or daughter!" exclaimed the other, in a
                     hurried, stormy voice.
                  "Good heaven! Fred, you screw my shoulder as if your hand were a vice."
                  "Did I? I was thinking. I have a story for your ear—sometime—not now. How
                     does—Lawyer Kenneth seem to treat this girl? with familiarity?"
                  "I should judge not: familiarity with his slaves is not one of his vices."
                  
                  "Has not been, you mean," replied the other with a hissing
                     whisper; "but he is bad enough for anything; and this girl is fearfully
                     beautiful."
                  "I tell you, Fred, my shoulder is flesh and blood!" exclaimed the first speaker
                     again, while Lucina felt as if she were rooted to the spot. A cold dew broke
                     over her forehead, and her veins crept with chills.
                  "Yes, but what should you care? It's not your flesh
                     and blood?" replied the other.
                  "Don't! don't add insult to injury," exclaimed the first speaker in a shaking
                     voice; as if the words had entered his heart.
                  "I beg your pardon, Hollister—I forget myself sometimes;"—then he added in a
                     still lower voice, "if ever I hear that Everard Kenneth lays the weight of his
                     finger on this girl, I'll have his heart's blood, if it cost me my life!"
                  "Fred! Fred! for heaven's sake! there may be somebody near us. I thought I
                     heard a step. Be careful on my account, how you speak. Come! we will go down to
                     the shop; I've got to arrange to-morrow's work."
                  Still, as they retreated, Lucina stood trembling, wondering, fearing, and
                     hoping. Who could this stranger be, who took so much interest in her? She
                     reviewed every word he had spoken; she arranged them with the language of old
                     Hepsy, but she only grew perplexed as she thought. Suddenly the sound of the
                     piano, warned her that her presence would be missed. She crept hurriedly into
                     the hall. Poor child! she had already begun to feel a slave's bitter fear.
                  
                  
                     
                        MABEL VAN BROEK.
                     
                  
                  Opening the door cautiously, she saw Mabel partly reclining on the sofa, while
                     Harry was arranging pillows for her head with all the tenderness of a
                     woman.
                  "Come in!" said Mabel pleasantly.
                  She entered, and went timidly to the back of the room. The light was not
                     strong; she sat down in her accustomed seat.
                  "Now go, Harry; do go. I know the ladies expect thee, and I am so very
                     comfortable! This good young friend will take the best care of me; won't thee,
                     dear?" she asked of Lucina.
                  "I will, indeed," said Lucina earnestly, the tears coming to her eyes.
                  "There! thee hears; good evening, my son. I may retire before thee can
                     return."
                  Harry left the room—casting a glance towards Lucina, buy the young girl held
                     down her head.
               
               
                  PART II.
                  MABEL PROVES HERSELF AN ANGEL OF MERCY.
                  Mabel on her arrival had felt so weak and indisposed, that when Mrs. Kenneth
                     said, "this girl will attend to you, sister," she had merely nodded her head,
                     and thrown herself down in a state of complete exhaustion.
                  Soon after that, Mrs. Kenneth had required Lucina's ser- vices when the accident had happened to Phillis.
                     The girl had returned in time to assist Mrs. Van Broek a little at her toilet,
                     but Mabel was then rather hurried, and treated her with merely the courtesy she
                     awarded her own dressing-maid.
                  Mrs.Van Broek had intended to bring her own servant, but her brother had
                     written to her to do so on no account, as he had more household help than he
                     knew what to do with; and as the young girl knew just what care to bestow on
                     her favorite flowers, she was rather glad to leave her at home.
                  When her son had gone out, Mabel Van Broek, after lying a moment with her eyes
                     shut, said gently:
                  "Friend, will thee come this way?"
                  Lucina gratefully arose, and drew near the couch.
                  "Thou art—a relative of this family?" half questioned the sweet Quakeress, as
                     Lucina stood before her.
                  Lucina shook her head, and her eyes grew more mournful.
                  "Pardon me, dear; I did not mean to make thy lip quiver so. Thee is certainly
                     not"—she paused. Lucina's troubled eyes were raised sorrowfully to her.
                  "Child, child, thee is not a slave!" exclaimed the Quakeress,
                     lifting herself from the crimson pillow, than which her cheeks were not more
                     deeply dyed.
                  "They say I am—but oh, I cannot be!—am not," and rapidly, her
                     voice broken with tears, she told her story.
                  "My poor friend, this is very mournful!" said Mabel, weeping, as she listened
                     to the end; and taking the hands of the excited girl in both her own, she
                     continued—"trust thee, in the God of the friendless, my sorely stricken one!
                     Alas! alas! this is a sad, sad system throughout—it hardeneth hearts and it
                     crusheth hearts."
                  "Cease thy tears, friend—I will call thee friend—for I know neither servant nor
                     slave, other than as brother and: sister of God's great family. Cease weeping,
                     my child; thou shalt hear nothing of these things while thou art with me. Come,
                     we will be very happy together, if they will let us. Now, I have something for
                     thee to do. Take this key and unlock yonder red trunk—nay, bring it first this
                     way, and then I can help thee.
                  "There, thou hast opened it nicely; now take the books, they are my favorite
                     authors from which thee shall read, instead of Harry. He would, willingly, as
                     his tastes incline that way, but I have a mind to keep him busy in another
                     manner, while he stays here. The poor boy needs recreation sadly.
                  Lucina's eyes glistened as she unpacked the daintily bound books, one after
                     another. Such treasures she had not held in her hand for many a day. She had
                     not dared to touch a book in the costly library of Washington Grange, and Amy
                     had taken care to keep her supplied with work. While thus occupied, the merry
                     sounds of laughter, and the clear tones of the singers came to their ears.
                  "Alas!" thought Mabel, "could I sing and laugh here, and girls like this sweet
                     creature in bondage? Never, never."
                  After the books were nicely ranged in glittering rows on the table, Lucina gave
                     the key back into Mabel's hand.
                  
                  "Now thee may bring forward that smaller box," said the Quakeress. "Here is the
                     key; unlock it."
                  The girl uttered a cry of delight as she saw, when the satin-lined cover was
                     thrown back, a beautiful array of colors, paintings, prints, and pencils.
                  "Did thee study drawing or painting?" asked Mabel.
                  "Oh yes, and I was so fond of both!" exclaimed the girl, almost forgetting her
                     troubles.
                  "Then, if I am to have thee while I am here, thee shall draw and paint for me.
                     And can thee play?"
                  "Yes, I was taught music," replied Lucina, the recollection of her captivity
                     coming over her soul like a black wave.
                  "And they allow thee not to play here?"
                  "Oh, never!" replied Lucina. "Only once at the—command of Miss Amy. I played a
                     bravura. Since then, I am not, of course, allowed to enter the room where the
                     piano is."
                  "Poor child!" said the Quakeress, again compassionately, and her heart ached as
                     she marked the beauty of this unhappy slave, so gentle, refined, and yet
                     enchanting.
                  "Thee may now light another candle, dear friend, and read to me," added Mabel,
                     gently. "But I had forgotten, my son has brought a guitar; can thee play on
                     that?"
                  Lucina shook her head.
                  "Will thee like me to teach thee, dear?" asked Mabel.
                  Lucina looked troubled. Then she said, sadly, "You know I am valued at so much
                     more money for every accomplishment."
                  The Quakeress raised her eyes to heaven.
                  She had never dreamed that Lucina might be sold! Suddenly, all the horrors of
                     such an indignity, such a barbarity, loomed up before her. Sold for what? Her
                     pure soul revolted from the thought. Not to rear a sacred home! Not to decorate
                     a beautiful domestic altar! Not to consecrate children to the service of their
                     country and of heaven! Not to weave garlands of undying beauty around the dear
                     hearthstone!
                  What then?
                  To serve the brutal lust of some unbridled libertine.
                  To own no home; to know no altar of domestic beauty.
                  To bear children with the exceeding anguish of maternity, and never
                        dare to call them hers.
                  To be bowed down with the humiliating thought that she must perpetuate
                     licentiousness—that foulest sin before God—and yet know no help.
                  To feel that as she had no hearthstone, neither had she country, hope, nor
                     recognized being as a human creature.
                  To be crushed in nature, person and attributes!
                  To dare to make no resistance to insult!
                  To revolt from herself, and yet have no friendships!
                  To be fully aware of her divine right as a creation of Almighty God, and yet
                     know that to assert it would rivet her chains until the iron goaded the
                     flesh!
                  To have faith, trust, memory love, and every darling prerogative of immortality
                     hopelessly blotted out forever!
                  Good God! Is this THY will to man? Do we ask for all this horror,
                     and black, despairing darkness, when we reverently pray "THY WILL BE DONE?"
                  
                  This aspiration filled the soul of the Quakeress.
                  Lucina's beautiful head was bending over the little trunk, and tears were
                     falling, drop by drop, within.
                  "I needed to come here," thought Mabel; "I needed this lesson, to learn
                        how to pray for the poor slave."
                  "Come, my friend, come; we will see what shall be done for thee."
                  Lucina dashed the tears away and tried to smile. Poor child! how plainly
                     through that forced and sickly smile could be read the anguish of a life that
                     was eating itself up, yet never dying!
                  "There's a book," designating by her hand which one. "Take it, and read to
                     me."
                  Lucina complied, and soon the cheerful page restored her animation.
                  She had been reading perhaps thirty minutes, when Mrs. Kenneth came in to see
                     that her guest was comfortable.
                  The slave started, and laid the book upon her knee."
                  "Thee will let me do as I please with this young girl," said Mrs. Van Broek,
                     gently.
                  "To be sure," replied Mrs. Kenneth; and the look that she cast towards Lucina
                     was one of mingled tenderness and regret. "I give her up entirely to you, while
                     you remain with us."
                  "Is thee not afraid?" asked the Quakeress, archly.
                  "No; none of our friends—least of all, my husband's sister—would so use our
                     kindness and hospitality as to abuse it," replied Mrs. Kenneth, gravely.
                  Mabel's cheeks flushed.
                  "Thee must have known what I mean," she said, quietly.
                  "I know you could mean no harm," Mrs. Kenneth replied. "Will you let me sit
                     with you and hear Lucina read?" she continued; "they are singing and chatting
                     so noisily in the front parlor that my brain feels sadly confused."
                  "With great pleasure," said Mabel; and Mrs. Kenneth chose her seat a little
                     distance from Lucina, where she could watch the young girl's features as she
                     read.
               
               
                  PART III.
                  SPITFIRE.
                  Lawyer Kenneth rarely stopped at his home of an evening. To-night, after
                     listening to one or two of his favorite songs, and risking a little light
                     badinage with Maggie Willis, who as usual came off victor, because she dared to
                     say what she pleased, he excused himself and retired.
                  Going to his own room he selected a fresh cigar, and donned a large, loose
                     overcoat of thin material. He also exchanged his hat for one with a more
                     slouching brim.
                  Sallying out towards the stable, he rapped with his thin cane at the window
                     over the door.
                  Presently, Ebony came tumbling down.
                  "Eb, saddle Spitfire," said the lawyer.
                  "Yes, massa," replied the black; and together master and slave entered the
                     large stable.
                  
                  It was finely appointed. Spitfire and Postboy lodged like horses of noble
                     blood.
                  On one occasion, at a race, Kenneth had vowed that if Postboy and Spitfire won
                     his stake, he would line their stalls like a lady's boudoir. He kept his word.
                     The stalls were lined, one with crimson, the other with blue damask.
                  A lamp hung suspended from chains in the centre of the ceiling. Elegant
                     machines for cutting and sifting feed stood in their appropriate places.
                     Saddles and bridles, and over a dozen costly blankets, of different shapes and
                     colors, with fly-nets, light, beautiful, and gaily tasselled, hung on every
                     side.
                  When the lawyer entered, Spitfire began to neigh and paw the floor. As his
                     master did not immediately attend to him, he stamped and whinnied, and fairly
                     screamed.
                  "Spitfire no let me speak to he, mars', 'less you speaks to he fus'," said
                     Ebony, as he dragged down the light but cumbrous looking trappings.
                  "Hey, Spitfire! my good pony! yes, yes," said the lawyer, soothingly, going up
                     to the head of the stall on a side platform raised for his convenience, "hi! my
                     fine fellow!"
                  The creature responded with a cry of joy. He held his splendid neck up, shaking
                     his head aloft, turned his full, dark eyes upon his master's face, and then, in
                     the excess of his feeling, laid his beautiful head with its, flowing mane
                     across the shoulder of Lawyer Kenneth, and whinnied his pleasure. For a moment
                     he objected to being led out, acting as if he would keep his master with him,
                     and prancing as much as his limited quarters would allow.
                  Then Kenneth looked steadily in the animal's wide-rimmed eye. Every limb on the
                     strain seemed instantly to obey the influence, and the horse drooped his head
                     and contracted his eyes.
                  "Now, Spitfire, Ebony is here to saddle you. Do you know, Spitfire?"
                  The horse answered with a sound between a sniff and a neigh.
                  "And will you behave yourself, my beauty?" asked the lawyer, as the creature
                     was led out.
                  The horse answered, or seemed to answer, again."
                  "Here, Eb, be quick, for I'm in a hurry."
                  The black, without fear, though his countenance had expressed indecision
                     before, now placed the bridle and pressed in the bit, adding afterwards the
                     other appurtenances.
                  "Ky!"he said, soliloquizing to himself, "ef mars' come with Eb, Spitfire no
                     'low Eb to touch he; or ef Spitfire hear mars' voice; cle' off to de house, Eb
                     he fear ob touch he, But Eb come all alone, golly! 'have hisse'f better
                     den."
                  Mounting lightly and easily, away flew the lawyer up the horse path, and at the
                     gate and along the road, the sparks of fire struck out now and then from his
                     horse's hoofs, scintillated all the brighter for the darkness of the hour.
                     Gentlemen's mansions, standing far back from the road at long distances apart,
                     shone out through the trees, where every window seemed a square of flame.
                     Lawyer Kenneth paused at one gateway.
                  
                  "I suppose they want Marshall to themselves to-night, so I won't stop at the
                     General's," he muttered. "On, Spitfire!"
                  As he clattered along, the houses grew more distant, the farms more extended,
                     and old Hepsy's little house had a solitary candle-light gleaming at one of the
                     windows, as if to show the path in front.
                  "That's a sign the old woman is out," said the lawyer to himself; "wonder if
                     she went on a broomstick?"
                  Soon the roads changed into streets, with here and there a block of houses. In
                     the distance blazed the windows of a hotel.
                  "A black servant stood on the steps in waiting for him.
                  "Now, sir, behave yourself!" said the lawyer, addressing Spitfire; and, turning
                     to the black, he continued, "don't touch his head, and guide him carefully."
                     The grinning groom said "Yes, massa," and led the horse to the stable.
                  The broad hall was flooded with light. On one side it turned into the public
                     bar where the loafers, loungers and politicians discussed the news of the
                     day.
                  The lawyer did not pause here, however, but moving through the hall, he entered
                     a room at the extreme and of the passage. From thence, lighted by hanging
                     lamps, he mounted the stairs, and throwing back a door of green baize, he was
                     in an immense apartment hung with crimson. A dozen gentlemen or more were here
                     assembled, some sitting at tables with cards, some engaged at billiards, some
                     sipping brandy and water, others quietly chatting and smoking. Full-length
                     portraits of the several Presidents hung around this room, and between them, in
                     convenient spaces, were pictures of a far more questionable character. In its
                     other appointments, the place was equally superb. The roulette and billiard tables were made of the finest rosewood,
                     and lined with velvet. The arm-chairs and couches were fit to ornament the
                     saloons of a prince. The curtains were heavy damask, with long magnificent
                     fringing, and the gilded cornices from which they hung, mocked an estimate of
                     their worth and richness. Several engravings of celebrated racers were
                     conspicuously placed, among which was the likeness of Spitfire. A jovial club
                     was that which met in this their favorite club-room.
                  "Ha, Kenneth!" cried one and another, welcoming him hilariously.
                  "Why, General!" exclaimed the lawyer, "I did not dream of meeting you here
                     to-night."
                  "Devil you didn't! Why not, my boy?" asked General Randolph, a large, portly
                     man, with a magnificent head of white hair, that fell in patriarchal waves down
                     his shoulders. He placed his hand familiarly on Kenneth's arm, and his bluff,
                     handsome, but red and dissipated face, lighted up at sight of his old
                     crony.
                  "I thought, as Marshall had returned, you would remain at home to enjoy his
                     first evening."
                  "Curse home!" cried the General, laughing as heartily as if he had said a witty
                     or a sensible thing. "The young scamp has stayed away from me seven years. Went
                     to spend a few months—thought he must finish his studies there—made up my mind
                     he'd make a lawyer, or, at the least, a doc- tor—took it into his head he wouldn't be either.
                     Don't know what he will do—queer fellow—don't like horse-racing—goes against
                     betting—refuses a cheerful glass—devilish Puritan, that's what he is—a blessed
                     good church-member, you know. But I'll spoil all that fun for him. Get him in
                     with us, ha, Kenneth? we'll put him through. Take a glass of brandy and
                     water?"
                  "Thank you. How does this son of yours look?" asked the lawyer, seating
                     himself, and sipping lazily.
                  "Look! humph! he's a Randolph clear through from his head to his heels. A
                     gentlemanly fellow, I must say, with a spice of the old country about him. Saw
                     a few dozen of our noble relatives—but curse the nobility, say I! Rather be the
                     master of a dozen slaves than the owner of a coronet. Nigger property makes
                     every man more or less a monarch—hey, Kenneth? But, to tell you the truth, he's
                     as splendid a young scamp as you'd wish to see. I expect he'll be picking round
                     among my handsome quadroon wenches—ha! ha! he! he! Terrible temptations for
                     young men—he! he! ha!"
                  "And not always resisted by old," said one of the company.
                  "None of your twitting on facts, Musgrave," replied the General, shaking his
                     shaggy white locks, "none of your personalities—they cut too close. Ha! ha! he!
                     ha!"
                  "I bought a yellow girl yesterday," said Musgrave, getting closer
                     to the group to avoid the clashing tongues of the gamblers, who were becoming
                     excited. "I swear! she's as fine a piece of flesh and blood as you ever saw,"
                     he added, closing his lips about his cigar, and puffing away.
                  "What did you give for her?" asked General Randolph.
                  "Oh, got her for a song: a mere trifle for such an article. The old man who
                     owned her died. She was his own daughter, and has been brought up a little too
                     delicately; but she'll do for the purpose I'm going to put her to;" and again a
                     fiendish laugh broke round the circle. "Her master's son, and her brother, is a
                     drunken young scamp—he'll sell them all for a glass of brandy, I expect, unless
                     the property is put out of his hands. Why, I gave," and he lifted his cigar
                     daintily from his lips, "I gave—only—seven—hundred-—dollars—for that girl; and
                     I'm sure to get two thousand!" He finished his speech with a shocking
                     blasphemy.
                  "Pretty, eh?" said one.
                  "I rather think you'd say so," returned the Southerner, with a knowing wink;
                     "wouldn't care about your seeing her! Imagine a girl with a neck
                     and bust like Juno—splendid arms, flashing black eyes, long, glossy hair, rich
                     color in her cheeks, good features, and spunky! spunky as the devil! Ha! it is
                     prime fun to see her eyes fire up whenever I go near her. These black things
                        have got pluck; that's a fact. I tell you, I have to look out
                     and keep my pistols well primed, for she's a very she-satan sometimes; but
                     then, gods! isn't she handsome! If it wasn't for making a good spec, I'd keep
                     her myself; but I'm deucedly in want of cash, these hard times."
                  "I think Nell Gwynne would match her for beauty," exclaimed a thin,
                     scary-looking man, who stood as if trying to reach the frame of one of the
                     pictures with his porcupine hair.
                  This man was one of that miserable class denominated poor whites. He was a flatterer and toady of
                     General Randolph's; a fine singer, and a useful man in his way; hence his
                     admittance among those who called themselves his betters. Nell Gwynne was quite
                     a celebrated slave-woman, the mistress of a Frenchman.
                  "Nell Gwynne!" cried Musgrave, contemptuously. "Nell hasn't anything to boast
                     of but a prime figure, while this girl has eyes, hands, feet, figure and
                     complexion, all tip-top. I tell you she's a splendid article.
                     Whoever gets her will have his money's worth—and his eyes clawed out in the
                     bargain!" he added, aside.
                  "I wouldn't swap my wenches, either of them, for your Junos or your Sapphos,"
                     said General Randolph. "I'll challenge any white man to bring out a handsomer
                     stud, by ——! than my Roxann or my Lorina. Whew! git out! Scare up a nicer pair
                     of nigger feminines, and I'll hand over the money."
                  "I can beat you all, gentlemen," said Lawyer Kenneth, quietly.
                  "Doubt it—begging your pardon," retorted Musgrave.
                  "Now, Kenneth," exclaimed the General, "we'll allow you a fair share of
                     boasting with the rest of our honorable company, but this is going too far. I
                     know who you mean. Phillis is a pretty taught piece, a trim ankle, a round
                     waist, good shoulders, tolerable eyes, but she can't begin with either Roxy or
                     Lorina. Why, they'd sell to-morrow for fifteen hundred apiece."
                  "Mine would sell for twenty-five," said the lawyer, sipping his glass
                     leisurely.
                  "Go to ——. Stop, Kenneth I don't make a breach between old friends. That
                     Phillis of yours wouldn't bring a thousand."
                  "I know it," the lawyer replied.
                  "Then, what in thunder are you driving at?"
                  "I'm not talking about Phillis," said Lawyer Kenneth; "mine's a horse of
                     another color entirely. I say, Musgrave, sum up your chattel's accomplishments
                     full figure, every cypher in its line, and every decimal in its proper
                     place."
                  "Accomplishments!" said Musgrave, "why, my dear sir, she can sing like an
                     angel. She'd make a first-rate prima donna, and chant a man right out of his
                     senses."
                  "Well! so far as it goes. Now, can she play the piano?"
                  "What a question!" exclaimed Musgrave, poising his cigar.
                  "Answer fairly and candidly, man; can she embroider?"
                  "I hope not," replied Musgrave. "Embroider—fudge!"
                  "Can she speak French, read Latin, and paint?" continued Lawyer Kenneth,
                     growing excited, and beginning to emulate General Randolph in; his frequent
                     mention of his Maker's name. "Because, I've got a girl that can do
                        all this, and is a devilish sight whiter than any of this
                     present company."
                  "When did you get her? Ho! you are joking about your own daughter."
                  "Mention my daughter in connection with this matter, and I'll blow your brains
                     out!" shouted Lawyer Kenneth, with terrible fury, confronting the snake-eyed
                     man with the porcupine hair. "I wish you to understand, that Miss Ken- neth's name is sacred
                     from insult when her father is by! How dare you, sir?"
                  He stood shaking with sudden rage, his large eye dilating till it seemed to
                     gather the fire of every other orb within its powerful compass.
                  "I beg pardon, sir; I—really I—sir—I did not intend"—
                  "Oh, have done with your apologies, I beg you," said Lawyer Kenneth, suddenly
                     recollecting the insignificant individual with whom he had to do; "and
                     remember, that taking liberties with the name of a gentleman's daughter is not
                     the same as speaking lightly of a man's slave!"
                  "You have been treating yourself to a new piece, then," said Musgrave.
                  "No, I haven't; I speak of a girl my wife has bought. And I tell you, for
                     color, feature, form, and accomplishments, there isn't her equal in Washington
                     county."
               
               
                  PART IV.
                  DOLE BAKER.
                  "AW—what were you speaking of, gentlemen? Good evening, Kenneth! General!
                     gentlemen—all. Aw—Musgrave, my good fellow! how—a'are you?"
                  A young man, with locks scented and thrown purposely in disorder—high, arching,
                     intensely black eyebrows—keen
                        MR. DOLE BAKER.
                     
                      black eyes, thin, acute features, and,
                     on the whole, a dashing, imposing face, though it was at the same time reckless
                     and dissipated, had entered unnoticed, and now stood receiving their
                     congratulations. His form was modelled upon the exact fashion of a tailor's
                     block, his air exceedingly aristocratic, his dress extremely fashionable, and
                     an agreeable perfume floated in the atmosphere honored by his presence.
                  "Ah! Dole—glad to see you; when did you return?" said Lawyer Kenneth, while the
                     General, to one of whose daughters young Baker was very attentive, gave a
                     hearty welcome of oaths and expletives, in his gruff manner.
                  "Aw—I arrived this noon," said Dole, seating himself gracefully; "a-arn't you
                     going to have any games to-night? General—a—I saw Marshall a few moments ago. A
                     great change in his appearance; a—and for the better. I—a—scarcely remember,
                     though, how he looked; I was such a lad when he left! Aw—were you talking
                     about—a—new purchase, Colonel Kenneth?" and, with a patrician air, he turned
                     himself about.
                  "A girl my wife bought," said Kenneth, sententiously.
                  "I wish I could get one to suit me," said young Baker. "I—a—declare! I'd
                     give—well, money, you know, would not be any consideration."
                  "Is this girl you speak of as beautiful as she is accomplished?" asked the
                     General.
                  "She is handsome enough," said Kenneth, throwing himself on his reserve, and he
                     would say nothing more.
                  By and by, they adjourned to the card-tables. Slaves passed rapidly back and
                     forth, mixing toddies and slings,
                     and the reeking fumes of the punch, famous at that establishment, filled the
                     air with its odors.
                  Drinking and playing, betting heavily, losing, winning, playing and drinking,
                     Kenneth grew communicative once more, and again began to talk of his wife's
                     girl. He spoke of Mrs. Kenneth's exceeding care; but boasted, that if he were
                     ever up to such things, he could evade the vigilance of his wife. Talking in
                     such a way, made the company roar again.
                  He had not left the table before he had promised the dissolute men there
                     present that they should have a fair look at Lucina, bragging of her mournful
                     beauty in such language that Dole Baker mentally resolved that she would be
                     cheap, as his mistress, at any price.
                  This young man, by birth a Virginian, was reported immensely wealthy. Being a
                     descendant of a really good family, and having the reputation of a dashing,
                     handsome, reckless lady-killer, he had—as a matter of course—the entrée of all the homes of Washington county. A
                     gentleman at large, he sported or travelled at his leisure. Insignificant in
                     intellect, he existed only for the gratification of his sensuality. He visited
                     France for the express purpose of finding a fit in Paris gloves for his
                     extremely small hands, or to see for himself whether the reputation of the most
                     eminent tailor was cleverly earned. He would journey five hundred miles to suit
                     himself in a particular style of cravat, and twice the distance to encase his
                     elegant feet in dainty kid or morocco.
                  At a small hour in the morning Lawyer Kenneth and some few others were scouring
                     town and village, uttering the most unearthly and maniacal noises. As the
                     former passed old Hepsy's cottage, on his way home, he rode up to the window,
                     and struck the sash with his whip till every glass rattled.
                  The poor old creature awoke. She knew the ringing tread of Spitfire.
                  Could he have seen her, sitting up in the darkness, her withered hand uplifted,
                     her curse following him as she uttered the malediction like a weird and fearful
                     seer, his bold, bad heart might have trembled.
                  Away he rode, till the dawn saw him before his own door. He roused the sleeping
                     Ebony, saw that Spitfire was put in good trim for a day's rest, and entering by
                     means of his night-key, he staggered to his private room and his uneasy
                     couch.
               
               
                  PART V.
                  A RIDE OVER THE ESTATE.
                  The following day Mabel Van Broek was restless and indisposed. The excitement
                     of feeling under which she still labored was unfavorable for her malady, and
                     she lay suffering with languor, the hectic constantly visible—the laboring
                     chest panting for breath. Yet, in all this great anguish her mild eyes were
                     often sweetly raised to heaven, and the words, "It is good for me to be
                     afflicted," were constantly escaping her lips.
                  
                  Lucina gazed and wondered. Whence came that beautiful serenity? How could she
                     smile, with an expression passing all human loveliness, when the strong pain
                     was racking her gentle frame? Whence that peace that illumined her features?
                     Whence that lighting up of the whole face, as with closed eyes and lips scarce
                     moving, she seemed in secret communion with some unseen intelligence?
                  "The book of books, dear friend," said Mabel, gently, as Lucina proposed
                     reading.
                  The girl turned away thoughtfully; her eye ran over the gilded bindings. One
                     volume, larger than the rest, encased in velvet and silver, had on the back the
                     words: 
                        "HOLY BIBLE."
                     
                  
                  That was what she wished, Lucina felt, although she had never fully known the
                     beauty of the sacred word. It had been to her a sort of text or lesson-book.
                     She had been accustomed to read a few verses in school—to hear it expounded as
                     beautifully consistent with the wants of humanity, filled with the grandest
                     poetry, the most sublime imagery in the world; but it had never appealed to her
                     heart.
                  Or, if it had, it still stood without, knocking, from the dew of the morning
                     till the dew of the evening, and she had not opened the door.
                  Lucina took the volume. "That is right, dear," said Mabel; "sit down, now, and
                     read to me."
                  According to her request, the young slave-girl sat down and read Christ's
                     incomparable sermon on the mount, Mabel commenting as she listened, till,
                     filled with astonishment, Lucina cried, "I never really saw that chapter
                     before; and yet how often I have read it."
                  "Ah! my dear girl, thee and I need the consolations of this divine word. During
                     my long illness, I cannot tell thee how sweet it has been to me."
                  "But, Mrs. Van Broek, I overheard my—Mrs. Kenneth say that this book, the
                     Bible, God's own word, sanctioned slavery."
                  "My child," said Mabel, "one command within the lids of that book, enforced as
                     it was with the wisdom, holiness, and divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ, would,
                     if carried out, overthrow the whole system of slavery—
                  "'WHATSOEVER YE WOULD THAT MEN SHOULD DO TO YOU, DO YE EVEN SO UNTO THEM.'
                  "It specifies no complexion, race, or character. It embraces the world. It is a
                     maxim of eternal truth, that even the heathen philosophers accepted and
                     declared."
                  Mabel sank back exhausted; but the holy glow that had made the face a beautiful
                     transparency, through which the pure, imperishable soul could be seen, still
                     suffused her features. Lucina gazed at her with as much awe as love. She could
                     see heaven imprinted on her brow. She almost imagined that angels surrounded
                     her. If this was faith, if this was religion, might she not experience a
                     blessing so elevating, so real? She would pray for it.
                  "Are you not well to-day, Aunt Mabel?"
                  Amy had come in, dressed for a drive. Her bright, dark hair smoothly banded
                     under her chip hat, and the glow on her cheek, made her look even prettier than
                     usual.
                  
                  "Don't you think you might possibly drive this morning? We have some beautiful
                     scenery to show you;" said Amy, growing very earnest, as she saw Mabel's
                     evident weariness and incapacity to move, much less take violent exercise.
                  "No, my dear, but could thee"—she paused with crimsoned cheeks. It was upon her
                     lips to solicit that Lucina might take her place; she had forgotten that to
                     Amy, Lucina occupied the position of a slave.
                  "Any request, Aunt Mabel?"
                  "No, dear; good morning; I hope thee will enjoy the drive." As Amy left the
                     room, Mabel turned to Lucina, who had taken her sewing, saying, "now, do thee
                     go and walk in the garden a few turns; it is not good for thee to stay so much
                     in the house."
                  Harry came in with a glowing face.
                  "What a prodigious walker that girl is!" he exclaimed.
                  "Who, my son?"
                  "Little Maggie Willis. I thought Southern ladies never walked. The little
                     magpie has led me a long race, and then, fresh as ever, laughed at me because I
                     owned to being tired. Now I've got to drive the ladies, I wish you would go.
                     They are harnessing two carriages, one for the girls and myself, the other for
                     poor Miss Lufburrow, with whom Mrs. Kenneth has consented to go. If you'll get
                     ready, mother, Miss Goldsmith would willingly ride in the other carriage, and
                     Cousin Amy, Miss Willis and you under my protection."
                  "Take care, take care!" said Mabel, with her peculiarly arch glance; "don't
                     thee fall in love with one of these Southern slave-owners, and marry her as
                     Everard did," and she shook her head; while Harry, with some warmth and color,
                     protested that there was no danger. "Miss Willis was, to be sure, a fascinating
                     little thing, but when you had said that, you had said all;" and he renewed his
                     entreaties that his mother should go.
                  "I cannot, Harry; perhaps, to-morrow thee will take me. I could not bear rapid
                     driving, thee knows, and the young ladies can."
                  So Harry went off and watched the negroes harnessing. There were six or seven
                     at work, and before they had finished, three more joined them.
                  "Dear me!" thought Harry impatiently; "one of our farmers at home would have
                     done all that work in half the time." The blacks seemed more particularly
                     employed in keeping out of the way of Jupiter, the little hump-backed negro,
                     whose sable features were the very embodiment of fun, and sly good humor, as
                     well as mischief and impudence. The boy looked oddly, bobbing about between the
                     horses' heels, dressed simply in a long red shirt, and a straw hat, whose
                     broken rim pointed to all points of the compass. Now his head was pitched
                     against Ebony's black calf, and before the man could turn, Jupiter would be
                     jumping over the back of some other stooping negro. If they caught him, the boy
                     was like an eel, and slipped out of their hands, administering a good round of
                     blows in the movement. Sometimes he would slily unbuckle a fastening; then he
                     would tickle the horses with a stick and make them jump.
                  "You little rascal!" exclaimed Harry on one occasion, when the animal came near upsetting the
                     carriage; "what did you do to the horse?"
                  "Me stick pin in um, massa," was the prompt reply.
                  "Take care how you do it again; that's all," said Harry, shaking his head with
                     a menacing air.
                  "Lors, mars', dis yer nig tells de greatest 'mount o' lies;" returned the imp,
                     repeating precisely the same operation; "dar! fact are, da horse knows master
                     from de Norf stan'n here to see um, an' he playin' off; be still, you critter,"
                     he cried, giving the poor animal a pinch that made him rear and back, till he
                     was nearly unmanageable.
                  Before he knew it, Harry was chasing the woolly-headed hump-back with uplifted
                     cane. The boy dodged under the horses, between the blacks, under the wheels;
                     and while Harry was fishing for him in the last place, he heard a cry, and
                     looking up saw Jupiter on top of the stable-house, tumbling about on its peaked
                     roof as if it were the level ground.
                  "Lors, mars', now 'taint no use try to catch dis nig; clime like lightnum!"
                     shouted Jupiter, wild with excitement, while a peal of laughter issuing from
                     the back verandah, caused the young man to turn.
                  There stood Amy, Hat, and Maggie.
                  "Capital! capital!" cried Maggie; "is that your first lesson?"
                  Poor Harry felt foolish and confounded.
                  "I should have done the same thing to a white boy," he muttered as he drew near
                     them; "impudence is my detestation."
                  "That comes of abolishing the whip!" exclaimed Amy, looking spitefully towards
                     Jupiter, who had drawn his feet under him, his shirt under his feet, and with
                     his dilapidated hat placed over his face instead of his head, was making a
                     series of bobs and motions that threw Harry into a fit of immoderate laughter,
                     as often as he glanced that way.
                  "Don't laugh at him, I beg of you, Mr. Van Broek. I declare it's quite
                     aggravating that there isn't a whip in the house long enough to reach him. If
                     there was, I'd use it myself! Papa makes a fool of that boy, and I thoroughly
                     hate him."
                  "What's the matter, Amy?" asked Mrs. Kenneth, now appearing with Miss Lufburrow
                     tucked under her arm.
                  "Why, Jupiter has been playing his antics; just look at him!"
                  Mrs. Kenneth glanced up at the odd figure, still bobbing away as if in the very
                     ecstasy of motion; and she too turned her face away laughing.
                  "Dear me! what is that thing up there?" queried Miss Lufburrow, whose eyes were
                     dim without her glasses; "is it a crow?"
                  "Yes," cried Maggie; "a Jim Crow; and he's got a red shirt on; only think of
                     it!"
                  "What kind of a crow did you say?" continued Miss Lufburrow, who
                     was a little deaf in the morning.
                  "A James crow;" repeated Maggie gravely; imported from James
                        town, Virginia! It isn't so warm here as it is there, so they
                     dress the creature up in flannel!"
                  "Dear me! how singular!" said Miss Lufburrow placidly; "James crows must be real curiosities. I should
                     like to stuff one. I had a pelican sent me from Guatemala, and I have him at
                     home over my bust of Shakspeare. Would one of these crows be as large as a
                     pelican, do you think?" The poor little woman was still striving to make out
                     the singular motions of the queer bird, that never stopped for a moment.
                  Maggie tried to answer, but she was forced to move away to hide the mirth that
                     was choking her, while Miss Lufburrow every now and then persevered in her
                     inquiries for the James crow, plainly showing that it filled every nook and
                     corner of her mind.
                  The horses were now brought up, beautiful creatures, though used on the
                     farm—two pairs of greys, docile as a favorite hound. After many demurs against
                     being driven by black Ebony, as she knew he couldn't drive by his very looks,
                     Miss Lufburrow was seated, and began instantly on the crow-question, asking if
                     they were numerous, how much they cost, and what they were good for.
                  Mrs. Kenneth, to humor her mood, replied that they were more plenty than she
                     wished they were; that she valued them at several hundred dollars apiece; but
                     that they were, on the whole, good for nothing.
                  "They may make a very good curiosity," said Miss Lufburrow, "but I shouldn't
                     want more than one at that price!"
                  I don't think you would, thought Mrs. Kenneth, but she said nothing.
                  Admiring faces of black, red and white filled the kitchen and cabin doors, as
                     Harry, managing his horses admirably, drove by them through the back part of
                     the place.
                  "I'm sorry you have to drive, Mr. Van Broek," said Amy; "but Tom, the coachman,
                     is sick, and has been for some months. Pa thinks of selling him and buying
                     another."
                  How such language grated upon the ear of the Northern man! However, he declared
                     himself quite willing, and that he felt some little pride in the
                     accomplishment.
                  They passed the cabins, where different kinds of labor were going on—scouring
                     tins, washing, ironing. Little black children, naked from their waists upward,
                     swarmed about the doors. Now and then and African mother would appear, snatch
                     up her naked baby, and with a sleight of hand quite admirable, hold it behind
                     her, its curly head protruding under her arm, while she grinned the carriage
                     by.
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IX.
               IN TWO PARTS.
               
                  PART I.
                  WHITE AND BLACK.
                  
                     The white slave, though he have beauty and intelligence, is not considered a
                        whit better than the black, because both are bondmen.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           "'Twas not for him to swell the crowd
                           Of slavish heads that shrinking bowed."
                        
                     
                  
                  "WHAT house is that?" asked Hattie Goldsmith, pointing to an ornamented lodge
                     of two stories, very square and trim, and neatly kept.
                  "The carpenter's quarters," said Amy, drawing back.
                  "Oh, who is that handsome fellow?" cried Maggie, almost leaning from the
                     carriage, and Harry surveyed him with interest, as Hollister, attracted by the
                     sound of wheels and voices, came to the door of the shop in his cool linen
                     suit.
                  "That's one of our slaves," said Amy, arrogantly, while two or three quick
                     changes passed successively over her countenance. Harry started as if he had
                     been struck.
                  The man had a commanding form—a commanding air—a commanding face. Harry could
                     hardly believe his senses; he kept repeating to himself, "That man a slave! Is
                     it possible? it cannot be! But yet, it is possible, for he is a slave, and in
                     slave quarters!"
                  "I declare!" exclaimed Maggie, "I wish he wasn't. He's just the man I should
                     like to conquer, that is, if he wasn't a slave. Don't look so horrified, Mr.
                     Van Broek, I'm no worse than the rest of my sex, only I 'speak right out in
                     meeting,' a habit I inherit from one of my ancestors, an old Englishman, who
                     once told the king to his face that be was a fool, and like to have forfeited
                     his head for it. It's no use to reason with me, sir, I'm like a chestnut; when
                     the burr opens, you know, it will drop out. Hat, how soleman you look! What are
                     you thinking about?"
                  "What a fine taste that man must have! How prettily the trees are grouped about
                     his little house! and that garden at the side! Isn't the effect beautiful
                     now?"
                  "Always after effect; well, I hope there's light and shade enough for you here.
                     The man we just saw was as white as Mr. Van Broek, begging his pardon, and
                     there's a man who is so black you cannot see him clearly. Upon my word, you
                     have to judge by the outlines."
                  The man in question had just stooped to pick up a piece of iron. Now he turned
                     about, displaying his soiled black-smith's apron—a magnificent frame, a very
                     Hercules in size; his broad shoulders, massive breast, and brawny, muscular
                     arms appearing to the finest advantage against the rudely whitewashed walls of
                     the smithy.
                  "He is a noble looking black," exclaimed Harry, "a real African king. There's a
                     splendid breadth of brain," he added, surveying the wide massive front head of
                     the negro. "He ought to be a smart man."
                  "He is," said Amy; "pa wouldn't take two thousand dollars for him."
                  
                  That speech called up something like hate toward the fair speaker in Harry's
                     free bosom—man to be still valued by so many dollars the pound, or the ounce
                     more of brain, the grain over of intelligence, the addition to usefulness by
                     some extra accomplishment!
                  "Papa thinks everything of Joycliffe," repeated Amy, "and I rather like him.
                     He's a good sort of fellow, and perfectly respectful; knows his place, and
                     that's more than half of them do. I perfectly detest them when they put on
                     airs."
                  "That man looks as if he had intellect enough for two or three," said Harry,
                     cautiously.
                  "Don't talk of intellect and niggers," said Maggie, in a laughing way.
                  "Et tu Brute?" thought Harry.
                  "I contest that a man like that must have mind!" he exclaimed.
                  "Oh, he has a sort of intelligence," said Amy, "and understands
                     his business. He's the best blacksmith in the place; sometimes he makes father
                     a hundred dollars in a month."
                  Harry turned short round so as to look Amy in the face. "Makes your father a
                     hundred dollars in a month? I don't understand you."
                  "Why, you benighted heathen of the North!" cried Maggie, thrusting back a curl
                     or two that had escaped confinement, "don't you see that all the people round
                     about don't own good blacksmiths, and of course they come to Joycliffe to-get
                     their horses shod, and their linch-pins made, and all sorts of iron concerns?
                     Of course, they pay as they would in your barbarous section of the world, and
                     Lawyer Kenneth gets the money, as he should. I only wish I owned,
                     such a blacksmith!"
                  Harry did not say all he felt—"That's mean business"—but thank God his
                        thought was not under surveillance. He could think how utterly
                     abject and ungentlemanly it was, to say nothing of the morality of the thing,
                     to give this man no wages, and appropriate all his
                     earnings. "Thank Heaven, I don't live here!" he exclaimed, mentally.
                  "Oh, what splendid hills!" cried Hattie Goldsmith, clapping her hands, as the
                     amphitheatre of wooded heights rose up around them, crowned with nature's
                     richest foliage. Harry turned his attention to the scene, though it was not
                     without an effort, for black Joycliffe engaged all his thoughts.
                  Vain the exclamations of delight as point after point of beauty burst upon
                     their visions—they awoke no answering response in the, young man's heart, Had
                     the hills, in the expressive language of Scripture, been "covered with the
                     ashes of desolation," they would not have seemed more devoid of life and
                     beauty. Here man, made in the image of his God, was bought and sold, and used
                     as a tool, a chattel, an article of merchandise! The thought sickened him, and,
                     like Lucina, he cried, "Horror! horror!" Maggie had sunk deeply in his
                     estimation; he only saw a beautiful image degraded by its associations; its
                     coarseness, voluptuousness and avarice glossed over by a thin coating of
                     refinement. She seemed no longer the irresistible little syren that she had; and Hattie, though silent and
                     thoughtful, he decided could be, as the daughter of a southern planter, not a
                     whit better.
               
               
                  PART II.
                  AN UNEXPECTED MEETING.
                  "Now, Amy and Hat!" cried Maggie, suddenly, "look your prettiest; there comes
                     General Randolph's son, whom we travelled with, and—who is the other?"
                  "I think it's Dolan Baker," replied Amy, preparing to look interesting; "yes, I
                     know his black hair. Oh, Mag! I'll tell you a queer story about him; never mind
                     now! Don't they ride well, both of them?"
                  The words, "Very well," had hardly escaped Maggie's lips when the two horsemen
                     came near. Both touched their hats gracefully, and the ladies, as in duty
                     bound, smiled back graciously.
                  "Such a change!" exclaimed Amy, after they had passed—"why he looks more like a
                     minister than ever. He's handsome, though!"
                  "Which?" cried Maggie, "the one with the black locks? Oh! he's magnificent! Did
                     you ever see such perfect features? such black eyes?"
                  "I mean Marshall Randolph," replied Amy. "Dole Baker is a great favorite with
                     the ladies. I don't like him, though; he is too conceited."
                  "What a beautiful saint's head the gentleman on the farther side would make!"
                     exclaimed Hattie, who seldom spoke.
                  "Yes, he has the reputation of being a saint, too. I don't see how he came to
                     be in Dole Baker's company, for Dole is considered extremely dissolute. But
                     Marshall is a thorough fanatic. Why, would you believe it? he joined the church
                     when he was sixteen; now, sixty is young enough, in all reason."
                  At that moment, Amy caught the expression of Van Broek's eye, and she knew what
                     it meant. She read in that glance the dawning of both dislike and contempt. He
                     who had seen the unselfish Christian life of Mabel Van Broek for ten long
                     years, was not prepared to indorse this flippant fling against the holy cause
                     his mother loved and adorned by her walk. He could not pass it by without
                     rebuke.
                  "Did you ever hear," he asked, "of a better part that one Mary chose, in olden
                     time? No man or woman is ever degraded by choosing heaven. I beg your pardon,
                     cousin Amy, but you mentioned the word fanatic. A true Christian is never a
                     fanatic; it is your dissolute character instead; there is real fanaticism."
                  Amy was reproved, but her lip curled with scorn. However, she replied nothing,
                     but sat farther back in the carriage, and was unsocial till their return.
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER X.
               IN TWO PARTS.
               
                  PART I.
                  ONE BLOW ON A FREE BACK TELLS MORE THAN A THOUSAND BOOKS OR
                     SERMONS AGAINST SLAVERY.
                  
                     
                        
                           "To think that man, thou just and gentle God!
                           Should stand before Thee with a tyrant's rod,
                           O'er creatures like himself, with souls from Thee,
                           Yet dare to boast of perfect liberty!"
                        
                     
                  
                  IN the afternoon, the girls were called down to receive the visits of Marshall
                     Randolph and Mr. Dolan Baker. The beautifully glazed card of the latter only
                     said,
                  "D. Baker."
                  The other card was not glazed, but delicately inscribed in his own writing,
                     "Marshall Randolph."
                  Such a fluttering and fussing! Dresses to be smoothed, curls to be pulled and
                     braids straightened. Final looks, six apiece, in the long mirrors.
                  Amy was robed in pink muslin, full of infinitesimal tucks. A white sash, thin
                     bracelets of gold and a queen-like tiara of velvet completed her attire.
                  Maggie wore a dress of white tulle, with coral bracelets, and no ornaments on
                     her pretty head. Hattie, also, looked uncommonly attractive. She had been
                     painting all the morning, after her ride, attempting Amy's portrait, and so far
                     she had done well. Success lighted her always brilliant eyes with a fresh fire,
                     and colored her cheeks. Her dress was some delicate shade of green, very
                     becoming. Her magnificent hair had no ornament.
                  After presentations and the few blessed common-places that are so serviceable
                     in the beginning of an embarrassment, conversation began to flow easily.
                  Marshall Randolph had been over Europe—was familiar with all the old routes—had
                     the names of celebrated characters, things and places at his tongue's end—could
                     talk admirably, while his fine eyes told almost as much as his lips. After a
                     while, Dole Baker, whose fancy was captivated by Maggie, managed to seat
                     himself by her side, and the volatile laugh of the young girl, as she gave the
                     conceited fellow many a pill in a sugar coat, rippled through the room. But
                     towards Hattie, the quiet, reserved Hattie, Marshall Randolph seemed drawn.
                     Though he talked laughingly with Amy about the "days when they were young,"
                     whenever he made a pointed remark or described scenery or characters, he
                     invariably turned to Hattie. It might be he was charmed with her dignity, so
                     strongly contrasted with the bird-like Maggie and the graceful, indolent Amy.
                     The call was a long one, and brought to a close only by the entrance of other
                     visitors.
                  "I was—a—hoping we might by some chance meet with that beautiful slave of
                     Kenneth's. Everybody's talking about
                     her," said Dole Baker, as they mounted their horses at the gate.
                  "I have heard nothing about it; what is she to you?"
                  "Oh! a—you know, I'm a devoted admirer—a—of beauty. I—a—have a
                        very handsome white fellow at-home—a. I—a—would like to mate
                     him; a—you understand?"
                  "Yes, as you mate your horses," said Marshall, impatiently.
                  "Well—a—yes; I think I take full as much pains—a—with my slaves as I do—a—with
                     my horses; though—a—the latter animals are by far—a—the most, intelligent,"
                     replied Dole Baker, stroking his horse's black mane.
                  "Sometimes horses are more intelligent than their masters," said Marshall
                     Randolph, coolly.
                  "I know—a—I think the horse "is—a—an eminently useful creatcher! Now, that
                     horse of Kenneth's—a—Spitfire; that animal understands whatever his master says
                     to—a—him, and acts accordingly. Kenneth laid a wager once—a—that Spitfire would
                     answer six consecutive questions—a—intelligently; and—a—the horse did it, sir;
                     the horse did it."
                  "Almost as well as a slave would, I suspect," said Marshall, drily.
                  "Well—a—yes, quite as well," replied Dole Baker. "Oh! there are some
                     slaves—a—above the average—a—quite above the average; but—a—the majority of
                     them—a—are much more stupid than brutes; dumb creatchers—a—sir. Isn't—a—that
                     your opinion, Randolph?"
                  "Well, no, pretty plainly, Baker, it is not! My views
                     have undergone a material change since I left home."
                  "A—Randolph, you—a—don't say you're an abolitionist? Good Heavens! my dear
                     fellow!—a—if you are—a—you'll break your father's heart!" exclaimed Dole, with
                     an affected glance.
                  "My father's heart is pretty tough; I don't feel much fear on that account. No,
                     Dolan, I don't know that I am an abolitionist; but, I tell you what! I see
                     sights sometimes that almost make me one."
                  They were now within view of the General's house and grounds. Dole Baker's
                     company had not been of Marshall Randolph's choosing that day; so he really
                     hoped that he would leave him at the entrance-gate. He could not invite him in,
                     for he felt it would be duplicity to do so. The young man, however, did not
                     make any advances; but, after sending particular regards to several of the
                     inmates, spurred his horse, and galloped on.
                  Randolph was a well-bred gentleman, but he could not withhold the word "puppy!"
                     that leaped to his lips.
                  "It is on such make-chances," he thought, "that Fortune bestows her golden
                     favors. Well, well, if she don't weary of him, he will of her."
               
               
                  
                  PART II.
                  CLUBBING VS. PRAYING.
                  A little black came forward to escort Marshall to the stable. The child was
                     crying bitterly.
                  "Why, Mungo, what's the matter?" asked Randolph, compassionately.
                  "Mars' beat ole Jordan so he hurt," cried the child, evincing an uncommon
                     sensibility.
                  "What! old Jordan! my good old Jordan? Where is he? In the quarters?"
                  "Yes, sa," sobbed the child.
                  "Lead my horse to the stable. Is your master with Jordan now?"
                  "Yes, sa."
                  Not another word said the young man. Moving with a firm, hurried tread, he
                     passed down the yard to the place where the faithful old Jordan, almost ninety
                     years of age, passed his days, occupied in some useful employment.
                  Long before he neared the hut he heard the blows, and with a few quick strides
                     gained the place.
                  Pitiful sight! There knelt the aged man, trembling in every joint, his few
                     white locks straggling over bald temples, his dim eyes uplifted, great tears
                     running down the deep, sorrow-worn channels of his cheeks, his shaking hands
                     clasped for mercy.
                  His wife cowered in a heap on the hearth, her face buried in her lap, her frame
                     shaking with sobs.
                  Above the hoary slave, towering in his almost giant proportions, stood General
                     Randolph, furious with drink and passion. In his hand he wielded a round, thick
                     club, with which he struck the back of the slave. He, with his long, glittering
                     locks flying about his shoulders, his eyes rimmed with the red color of the
                     wine, his powerful chest dilating with the rage of his temper, looked the
                     personation of a fiend engaged in fiendish work—that of mutilating the worn-out
                     frame of an old, faithful creature, who already felt the chill of death come up
                     from the open grave over which he bent.
                  The slave had been guilty of—praying! only praying to his God.
                  "Oh! mars'r, mars'r, 'deed ole body ain't goin' to last long—'deed don't send
                     he to de grave all mashed up. Oh! massa! massa! massa!"
                  "Promise me, then, that I shall hear no more of this cursed yelling and
                     praying," shouted the old man, striking him with his bludgeon.
                  "Oh, mars'r!" cried the old black in agony, "I'll try to pray softlier, 'deed I
                     will, good mars'r. Me sorry mars' vex wid pore old sarvant so bad, but God's
                     angry wasser den massa's angry. Me sweet Massa Jesus tell me for pray; deed,
                     must mind me sweet Massa Jesus befo' me good mars' Randof."
                  "So you won't stop, you old reprobate! And I've got to hear your infernal
                     yellings, night after night, have I?
                     Now I tell you what! I've got as many devils in me as Mary Magdalen had, and
                     they all swear you shan't pray."
                  Again the club descended.
                  "Father!" cried Marshall, springing upon the threshold, his eye fiery with
                     indignation.
                  "Be off, Marshall; don't interfere!" screamed the old man, raising the weapon
                     of death.
                  "Father! you forget yourself," exclaimed the son, his voice choked with
                     resentment. The sight of this aged negro in tears, blood trickling down his
                     shrivelled cheeks, cut him to the heart.
                  "Be off, sir!" yelled the General.
                  The young man took a step forward.
                  "Father, I love old Jordan. I must protect his grey head."
                  "Bless young massa!" sobbed the negro. "O Lord! hear he for poor ole
                     Jordan."
                  The aged wife lifted her tremulous hands, putting up a silent prayer.
                  "Do you dare to interfere with me, sir?"—the General was now
                     almost beside himself—"do you dare, to say that I
                     shall not have the control of my own property? Stand off! or, I
                     warn you, that I will strike you!"
                  "Great indignity as a blow would be from you, my father," said the young man,
                     steadily, "I can better bear it than this aged slave. I am strong—strike me—but
                     spare him."
                  In the fierceness of his wrath, old General Randolph grasped the white headed
                     slave by the shoulder, and dragged him nearer to the side of the cabin.
                     Marshall trembled from head to foot, but when he saw the stick raised again he
                     sprang forward, encircled the old man with his arms, and received the full
                     force of the blow which would probably have finished Jordan's mortal career,
                     upon his own neck and shoulders.
                  "Oh, young mars'r!" cried the shrill voice of the decrepid wife, lifting her
                     bent form.
                  This outrage recalled the General to reason. Marshall looked up. His cheeks,
                     his lips were blanched white as death, and his eyes were encircled with a livid
                     blue. His father shrank from that strange glare; his own eyes dropped, and he
                     cowered.
                  "You would get up an insurrection, sir!" he muttered; "you teach my slaves to
                     murder me!"
                  "It is the first time you ever struck me!" exclaimed Marshall, in low intense
                     tones; "God in his mercy grant it may be the last!"
                  Again, that strange look. The eyes of a wronged, an outraged wife were flashing
                     through those of the son.
                  "It is your own fault, sir I—I warned you," repeated the General; "and as to
                     Jordan, there is another time! I'll wring your old neck for you, if I hear any
                     more of your praying on these premises."
                  "No, massa!—I won't holler—'deed I won't, sweet
                     massa; me an' ole woman get closer to God; we whisper in He ear;" cried the old
                     man, as, chagrined for the deed he had done (for the blow he had dealt his son,
                     not for the wicked torture of his slave), General Randolph left the cabin.
                  
                  Marshall arose, his back smarting with the welt of the heavy stick. But his
                     soul felt the keenest pang. All his nature was in arms. A terrible tumult shook
                     him, so that for a few moments he was speechless.
                  "Oh, blessed young massa!" cried the wife of the tottering slave. "Oh, Lo'd He
                     shower down mighty blessings on he young head! These yer ole arms held it many
                     a day; mars'r hang on dese yer shoulders—bress God! Little t'ink den dat
                     slave-stick ever touch he." The faithful creature burst into tears.
                  "Never mind me," said Marshall huskily; "he is to be pitied more than I am. And
                     yet that blow struck deeper than the skin. My manhood is struck! Do
                        they feel thus? They are men; their skin bruises as easily as
                     mine. They have nerves—they have hearts—they have souls—they have everything
                     but—liberty. Great God! wanting that—and then the whip, the chain, the collar
                     and the stake!"
                  "Sweet white massa, little know what slave suffer for sweet Jesus," said
                     Jordan, who had raised himself with difficulty, while his wife washed the wound
                     in his head.
                  "Jordan, how many times did my father strike you?"
                  "'Deed old back mighty sore, mighty stiff, massa Marshall; hardly lift arms, up
                     to head—no, can't do um at all."
                  "Moppy, uncover his back;" said Marshall, his own flesh throbbing with the pain
                     of the blow, doubtless the heaviest.
                  The aged woman did as she was directed.
                  Marshall turned shudderingly away; not so much at the fresh marks, red and
                     swollen, as at scars crossing and recrossing that poor back. It was literally
                     ridged with scars, one upon another, and so intersected that the miserable lump
                     of human flesh was a map complete of slaveholding vengeance.
                  "Jordan, how long has my father owned you?" asked Marshall, recoiling with a
                     deep, inward groan.
                  "I nuss he, sweet mars'r, carry he in dese yer old arms, when he leetle curly
                     headed infant, jes' as me did you, sweet mars'r. Old Jordan mighty ole man.
                     Mars' Randuf mos' sixty, ole Jordan thirty years older nor Mars'r Randuf."
                  Marshall bit his lip and shook his head indignantly.
                  "And has my father jellied your flesh in that manner?" he cried.
                  "'Deed Mars'r Randuf t'ink he punish ole Jordan for do wrong. Don't doubt dat
                     Mars' Randuf he hab 'casion some time. Nodder time not so. Ole Jordan Mars'
                     Randuf's property. Massa make wooden pail or buy he, he right to put what he
                     like inside—right to kick um ever ef him please. Jordan pore ole wooden bucket
                     now. All full ob cracks. He no hold not'ing no more. Mars' Randuf want to make

                     hab he own way, He soon draw ole bucket out of dis shaller water into riber of
                     heaven. Glory be to He name."
                  A beautiful smile lighted up the face of the aged negro, as he spoke thus with
                     eyes raised—a holy, light played over the features that he had never called his
                     own—a flame celestial seemed-to emanate from that dark, shining head, so thinly
                     covered with bleached hairs. The tears rushed into the young man's eyes—he held
                     out his hand.
                  
                  "Dear old Jordan," he said with shaking voice; "I always loved you, and I mean
                     to stand by you. You shall never be touched by stick or lash again; so help me
                     heaven! And Jordan, I too have drank of that river of life—I—shall—meet you
                     there;" and he turned away almost broken down with emotion at sight of the
                     forgiving spirit manifested by this holy old slave.
                  "Glory be to God! hallelujah!" shouted Jordan, still with eyes and face
                     heaven-bright, though his flesh crawled with pain.
                  "Hush! ole man," said his wife; "'member promise to Mars' Randuf. 'Deed mustn't
                     holler! 'deed no;—dough t'inks blessed angels look down on ole Mopp's

                  "Jordan—I don't want to countermand my father's orders," said Marshall; "but if
                     at any time you should get engaged and forget yourself, you shan't be punished
                     for it—remember that. I've borne the last blow that will ever be aimed at

                  "'Deed da' so like sweet Jesus! He bar sins fo' we po'sinners. God A' mighty
                     bress you! oh, 'deed an' He will!"
                  "Jordan, has my father always whipped you himself?"
                  "Oh, no, bress um—he send me once to calaboose, 'cause he done gone lose

                     feet of de blessed Jesus—me'm do dat."
                  "God help me!" said Marshall, aside; "this fixes my purpose. I can never be a
                     slave-owner—never!"
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XI.
               IN TWO PARTS.
               
                  PART I.
                  IN WHICH SOME REASONS ARE SHOWN WHY SLAVERY IS THE FOULEST WRONG
                     THAT WAS EVER UPHELD AND PERPETUATED BY MAN.
                  
                     
                        
                           He gives to Christ with one hand—with the other
                           He wields the whip above a bleeding brother;
                           A deacon of the church, he brands the sinner,
                           And keeps six slaves at home to cook his Sunday dinner.
                        
                     
                  
                  ONCE more in the open air, Marshall felt the hot flush of resentment cover all
                     his face. It was a hard thing to forbear the hot passion that burned in his
                     spirit against his father. He was an only son, and had always before been
                     treated with deference and great indulgence; his own temper was very impetuous,
                     and the more he reflected on that terrible blow that had probably left the
                     mark, or would leave it, in discoloration, the more his pulse throbbed with
                     something that felt like hate. But this young man was a disciple of one who
                     said, "pray for them which despitefully use you," and after a
                     while the wounded spirit flew to its Maker, and telling its wrongs, prayed for
                     the hand that had inflicted them.
                  "At least, I know now, practically, one of the humiliations of the slave," he
                     whispered. His eye fell on a handsome quadroon who was just coming out of the
                     house with her child, a white boy, with soft flaxen curls, in her
                     arms. She blushed as he noticed her, and turning her face partly aside, hurried
                     to her cabin.
                  "Men may feel the blows," muttered Marshall, his fine face filled
                     with an expression of mixed scorn and pity, as he paused for a moment, and
                     looked after the swift retiring figure; "but it is the poor woman—God help
                     her!—who is so imbruted that she is willing to submit to outrages upon body and
                     soul. I have heard of these things," he muttered; "that child is
                        white! My poor mother!"
                  He went in the house. A wild whirl of confusion, laughing, dancing, singing,
                     shouting, a happy noise, issued from the sitting-rooms down-stairs. Marshall
                     did not stop to join his sisters, but ascended directly to his mother's room. A
                     plain, but sweet-looking woman arose at his entrance; her wan face lighted with
                     a smile, as she said, "Oh, Marshall! I can't tell you how glad I am to see you!
                     I heard your horse long ago, and have been looking for you ever since."
                  "I know, mother; I have had business to attend to, but now I'm going to stay
                     with you and read, if you'd like it. I've got through all my calls."
                  "Who did you see at Lawyer Kenneth's?" asked Mrs. Randolph, motioning to the
                     slave-nurse in the room to attend to the babe stirring in its cradle.
                  "Miss Amy and some young lady friends, her cousins, I believe," replied the young man. "It seemed so
                     strange to find that little chit of a girl grown up into quite a woman, and a
                     very likely looking one, too. Dear me! the last time I saw her, I took her on
                     my knee, and gave her some sugarplums. I couldn't do either, now."
                  "Did you see those Northern people that Phillis tells our girls about?" asked
                     Mrs. Randolph.
                  "No; they spoke of them; the young man is a merchant, it seems. I should like
                     to make his acquaintance. They said he was attending to his mother, who is
                     quite sick."
                  "Ah! these good sons!" exclaimed Mrs. Randolph, with emotion.
                  "And these dear, good mothers!" returned Marshall, smiling fondly. "By the
                     way," he continued, "I like the appearance of one of those young
                     ladies very much; she has the face of a genius, and though she talked but
                     little, yet what she did say was so appropriate and sensible! Then there was a
                     queer character there, came into the room in such an odd way! a little
                     weazel-faced thing, and Amy seemed mortified and tried to get her out of the
                     parlor. The little woman, however, was determined not to be ousted, and sat
                     demurely knitting, only now and then putting in the funniest things. And this
                     slave-girl, mother!" he exclaimed, after a pause, during which he had been
                     gazing at the sleeping babe, and unconsciously comparing it with the child in
                     the arms of the handsome quadroon; "I hear a great deal about her. What is she?
                     Anything extraordinary?"
                  "I should think so," replied his mother, "by the stories they bring. She was,
                     it seems, dressed quite richly when she first came here, and did not know for
                     some time that she was a slave. It was a cruel shock, I suspect. They tell me
                     that she went from one fainting fit into another, for the first three days, and
                     they despaired of her life. Then she was violent, and they locked her up, I
                     believe, till they discovered that she was trying to destroy herself. They
                     heard a heavy fall, and on entering the room, found that she had suspended
                     herself from a nail in the wall, and, fortunately, it gave way and let her
                     down. She was probably nearly dead, but the fall restored her.
                  "Why! that was terrible! Pray, who had she been? Where and who with?" asked
                     Marshall, intensely interested.
                  "Brought up in a northern city, Boston, I think, and lured on here under
                     pretence of coming home. Undoubtedly the man who sold her had made the
                     discovery that she was the child of some planter by a slave."
                  Mrs. Randolph turned white as she said this, and Marshall started up in alarm,
                     thinking that his mother was faint. But, with a half smile, she shook her head.
                     "Don't mind it, Marshall," she said; "I have not been very well to-day; it was
                     a blinding spasm of pain in my head."
                  The heart of the young man beat with more rapid strokes as he saw the drooping
                     eye and hollow cheeks of his mother. "Alas!" he said to himself, "that sickness
                     is mental."
                  "I pity the poor girl, although I have never seen her," said Marshall,
                     feelingly; "I judge she is very pretty."
                  
                  "Oh, very! much more beautiful than Amy Kenneth, I should think, and more
                     accomplished, I am sure. I should have been over there to see for myself, but I
                     have not felt, really, like going out, and Mrs. Kenneth has been kind enough to
                     excuse me and call on me several times. She never speaks of her."
                  "How does Kenneth conduct himself now?" said Marshall, who had not before,
                     since his arrival, had an opportunity of being alone with his mother; nor would
                     he now, if the laughing group below had been aware of his arrival. "I have only
                     seen him once, and he looks thinner than he did, and peculiar. Not exactly
                     dissipated, but very far from correct—at least, so it seemed to me. He wasn't
                     at home this afternoon, Amy said."
                  "I really don't know what to make of him," replied Mrs. Randolph. "I haven't
                     seen him since baby was born; but I hear that he still has his crazy turns, as
                     the slaves call them."
                  "Say, rather, drunken sprees," exclaimed Marshall, contemptuously. "I remember
                     his chasing and running me down on that Spitfire of his. He had just bought
                     him, and he was almost unmanageable. It is the greatest wonder my brains
                     weren't kicked out."
                  "I expect it is hardly possible to live with him on any terms," replied Mrs.
                     Randolph. "There seems to be a constraint, a coldness, between him and his wife
                     that I can't account for in any other way than his intemperate, habits. It is
                     very strange, too. When he married Amy Hollister, he was, we all thought,
                     perfection; and he certainly was. A Quaker by birth and education—handsome—more
                     than handsome—splendid! with not one bad habit. Temperate, affectionate,
                     constant in his attendance on his wife, and like a lover for the first three
                     years; then, all at once, without any apparent reason, he began to drink
                     immoderately. I never could see through it. Drinking, too, affects him
                     singularly; it makes him fiendish, and I expect his family are always under the
                     apprehension that he will have one of his dreadful turns when they have
                     company. He was away when his wife brought this new slave girl home."
                  "Why, Marsh!" cried a loud voice, and in another moment a pair of round white
                     arms were clasping his neck. A troop of girls, seven in all, came flying into
                     the chamber, flushed and sparkling, all excitement with the "fun" they had been
                     having down-stairs.
                  "I reckon you won't come in again, and we not know it," cried Bell, a large,
                     showy girl, pulling at his sleeve. "Come, we were all playing 'what would you
                     be?' and we want just one more—come!" and "Come, Marshall," reiterated the
                     others.
                  "You've been away seven years; that's a year for each of us," cried Bell again,
                     dislodging him from his chair. "Now we'll stick to you like burs, won't we,
                     Caddy? Oh, do see that sprawling baby! I declare, if she don't look like our
                     Roxy's little boy!"
                  Mrs. Randolph, who had arisen, sank down almost helplessly at this, and
                     Marshall, turning a sharp, quick glance upon Bell, set his teeth at her in a
                     way that frightened her almost out of her senses for the moment.
                  
                  "Mother, you aren't well again," he said, going towards and standing over her.
                     Bell still stood looking in a bewildered way, at the baby, and thinking of what
                     she had said, till all at once a flush came in her face, and she turned about
                     and marched defiantly down stairs, the sisters following.
                  Pretty soon Marshall joined them. Neither he nor Bell spoke of the action that
                     had made both more thoughtful, but the interest in their play was lost, though
                     the younger ones kept it up with spirit, flying about like sprites, with curls
                     shaking, and round throats swelling with laughter. But after a while, Bell
                     proposed that they should all sit on the piazza, and when they were there,
                     Marshall spoke of going into town on the next day. So Bell and her sister sat
                     thinking up the commissions he had volunteered to execute for them, and they
                     busied themselves till the dinner-bell rang.
               
               
                  PART II.
                  THE SLAVE SALE.
                  It was a beautiful ride to town, much enhanced on Marshall's part by the
                     unexpected company of Harry Van Broek. Harry had introduced himself, and
                     Marshall frankly and cordially chatted as they kept their horses' heads
                     together towards the town. Harry's thoughts were filled with the projects he
                     had been discussing that morning for the benefit of Lucina. The poor girl had
                     had a violent fit of weeping the night before, and overslept herself so that
                     Mabel was obliged to waken her.
                  "Thee has not slept so soundly for a long time, dear," said Mabel, gently.
                  "When I sleep, I forget," said Lucina, sadly and significantly.
                  It was this expressive sentiment that had set Mabel and her son to talking over
                     some scheme by which Lucina might be saved from the fate of perpetual bondage.
                     They had thought of everything, and finally concluded upon asking Lawyer
                     Kenneth to put his price upon her.
                  "Though I tremble at the thought that I shall' deal in flesh and blood, yet I
                     am setting a human soul at liberty," said Mabel, "and we must decide soon, for
                     there is no knowing how long life will last; the strongest of us may fall
                     unexpectedly, and as for me, I dare not calculate upon a long life."
                  So far it was settled, and Harry, getting the loan of Postboy, galloped off,
                     meeting Marshall Randolph as we have seen.
                  They chatted pleasantly on their way, and leisurely entered the town. It was a
                     bustling place. Blacks were taking packages from street to street. Blacks were
                     driving drays and carriages; blacks were taking bags and baskets of vegetables
                     to the homes of master or mistress. The shops seemed all alive with business.
                     The windows of the houses, set back in their pretty gardens, were open, and the
                     curtains swung lazily in and out. Music sounded on all sides; the bell of the town-house was ringing
                     for some public service, and a crowd was gathered in one place around what
                     appeared to be an auction block, and a red flag hanging out.
                  "What's to be sold, I wonder?" said Marshall, riding more slowly, as the crowd
                     pressed thicker together. All faces looked eager and anxious for the appearance
                     of the auctioneer. Rough, low-browed men, delicate-handed lawyers, clergymen in
                     their black coats, farmers in their blouses, tradesmen, shopmen, loungers and
                     loafers were there congregated, and a loud buzz pervaded the assembly.
                  "I say, Jack!" said a vulgar-looking man, with his hat pushed back on his head,
                     "what kind of a gal is this that's to be sold to day?"
                  Marshall heard the question, and comprehended. He stood still a little way from
                     the throng, and listened. There were many present on horseback, some of whom
                     recognized him. Among these latter was Deacon Peninton, a large-bodied,
                     intelligent looking man, who extended his hand from some distance, and gave a
                     hearty shake.
                  "Well, sir, I'm really delighted to see you back again," he said cordially.
                  "How go church matters?" asked Marshall, after the usual comments upon weather
                     and health.
                  "Oh, bravely, I assure you!" replied Deacon Peninton. "We've had a very large
                     accession since you went away. Three glorious revivals, and over a hundred
                     additions to the church."
                  "And how is our good pastor?"
                  "Mr. Ramsay?"
                  "Yes, he baptized me; he had but just come, you know, before I went away."
                  "I know—I was thinking he came after—he is well, I'm obliged to you, and a
                     godly man he is too. The church never prospered so well as it has under his
                     care. He's not only a good minister, but a capital pastor, always finding time
                     to visit. I don't see how he gets through with so much."
                  "He lives in town, does he not?" asked Marshall.
                  Yes, next to the meeting-house; oh! we've built him a fine parsonage since you
                     were here, and Deacon Roebuck, Deacon Upham and myself, gave him, between us,
                     two likely men and three women, so he's pretty well off in the world, for a
                     minister."
                  Marshall recoiled a little. Harry looked on and listened. It was so odd to his
                     Northern ears to hear church members talk about giving a minister men and women
                     in order to help along!
                  The deacon was called away, and precisely at that moment a more tumultuous
                     noise was heard. They were bringing forward a man and woman. The man wore a
                     somewhat sullen and dogged look, and was quite black, athletic and sturdy. The
                     woman was a pretty mulatto. Her eyes were red, swollen and cast down. Her
                     countenance indicated despair.
                  The usual formula passed, the slaves were put up for sale. They were man and
                     wife. The woman was young-looking, scarcely eighteen, and seemed trying by
                     almost superhuman efforts to master
                     her emotion. The man was exhibited first, after a revolting inspection, by
                     several slave jockeys—his teeth, his limbs, his breadth of chest and strength
                     of muscle, all underwent a minute examination. It was shocking to any one with
                     the least particle of sensibility, as the woman went through the same ordeal,
                     to witness the suffering that shook every nerve of her being.
                  To be sold together! Oh, if that could only be! How the now dry, glazed,
                     hot-looking eye wandered from face to face, while they were bidding for "Jim."
                     How the clasped hands were pressed against the chest—how the laboring bosom
                     heaved—with what convulsive starts she listened to an opinion expressed. The
                     veins were swelled out on her neck. Her eyes were rimmed with a deep, dark
                     circle.
                  At last the fatal hammer went down. Jim was sold to a stylish-looking man. The
                     woman gazed eagerly round, gasping, choking the words—"Buy me too, mass'r,
                     don't separate Jim an' me, mass'r, we's husban' an' wife"—and that yearning,
                     helpless look was fastened upon him.
                  He seemed touched, and bid once or twice.
                  Every muscle and feature of the mulatto quivered with eager, exciting hope.
                     Then he fell off and shook his head, turning away.
                  One wild and piteous shriek rang out—"Don't, don't sell me 'way from Jim,
                     mass'r!" and the poor creature fell down in a strong convulsion.
                  The auctioneer kicked her with his booted foot.
                  "None of your shamming!" he cried; "gentlemen, it's only shamming! How much am
                     I offered? First-rate washer and ironer—can do up her six dozen a day!"
                  Not a voice was heard. "Gone at three hundred!" cried the auctioneer.
                  Oh, pitiful! pitiful!
                  She came out of that convulsion, leaped from the block, caught Jim about the
                     body, and screamed, foaming at the mouth—
                  "Oh! Jim, dey can't tar' us apart! dey shall kill me fus!' Oh! Jim, can't
                     nothin' be don? Oh! my God! Jim, me go crazy to be took from you!"
                  "I can't help it, girl," said Jim, snapping his eyes, and the muscle's around
                     his lips quivered.
                  "Oh! Jim, what God make us for? He give us hearts for love; now He let us be
                     sold like cattle. Oh, Jim! oh, God! oh, God!"
                  "Shut up, there!" bawled one of the men savagely, holding up his
                     whip-handle.
                  "Down with that!" cried Marshall, whose lips had been tightly locked, and whose
                     face was bloodless during the transaction. The man turned round scowling, but
                     lowered his whip.
                  "Will the last owners come this way to give bills of transfer?" asked the
                     auctioneer. The men designated stepped upon the block. They were Deacons
                     PENINTON and ROEBUCK!
                  "By the heaven above us," cried Marshall, "this is too bad!" Harry was gazing
                     in anguish on the suffering creature, who had not even the right of a poor
                     brute to the lover and mate of her choice. He was almost beside him- self, but felt compelled, by some
                     strange law of fascination, to stay and see it out.
                  "This is no Christian act. I'll condemn those men—I'll bring it up before the
                     church—the black-hearted hypocrites!" spoke Marshall through his quivering
                     lips.
                  They came from the block to part them. Rosa's screams grew fiercer. Her eyes
                     glared. They beckoned to her former owner. He came to her.
                  "Rosa," he said, with smooth, oily tongue, "I thought you professed to be a
                     good Christian."
                  "Go 'way, massa!" screamed the half crazed woman; "don't talk of Christian to
                     me! Go read you' Bible! What God had joined togedder, let not man put
                     'sunder."
                  Upon this a volley of coarse slang resounded on the outskirts.
                  "But, Rosa," said this buttery tongue, "God wills that you should part, just as
                     he does that white men and women should, when the missionaries go to the
                        heathen!"
                  "Off, debil's deacon!" shouted the mulatto, while her eyes blazed; "don't you
                     talk dat way to me. You none Christian; you sell me fro' me Jim; you break my
                     heart. Heart, feel, as well as yours, mars'r!" she exclaimed in
                     tones of intense bitterness. Then changing into most pathetic entreaty, she
                     cried, "Oh! mars'r, ondo it; don't part Jim an' me; s'pose you
                     sold, 'way from you' wife? Oh, mars'r, now do try let us go
                     togedder! do, blessed mars'r!"
                  "I can't, Rosa; you're already sold," said the deacon.
                  She looked in his eyes—a long, glaring, savage look.
                  Then she turned to Jim.
                  "Well, Jim, we say good by—forever, in this world. You never see Rosa 'gin; I
                     never see Jim any more."
                  A flood of passionate tears broke upon the pathos of that speech; but she soon
                     spoke again.
                  "'Deed, Jim—Rosa no' forget you. Heart feel heavy—full of misery. I no' want to
                     live any longer, Jim; 'deed I doesn't; 'deed I knows I shan't live."
                  "Be over with your parting—I want you now," said her new master, coming up.
                  The poor girl thought she had worked herself into resignation, but all her
                     anguish came back at this. She screamed, she raved, she called down awful
                     imprecations upon the head of her former master, and when at last they
                     succeeded in separating them, she went again into the most terrible
                     convulsions. Nobody, however, seemed to pity her much, except Marshall and
                     Harry.
                  "She was always a very headstrong girl," said the deacon coolly to a bystander
                     whom he knew. "Why, when her mother was sold, and she wasn't then much over
                     seven years old, we had to whip her to keep her from going into these fits. I
                     don't know but a little wholesome correction would do her good now. I think her
                     new master looks as if he wouldn't hear much. She won't find everybody as
                     indulgent as I have been! Sorry to sell the girl, I'm sure; but I
                        need the money more than I do her."
                  Marshall overheard this speech. He glanced at the deacon, and then at the
                     struggling body which they were just taking off.
                  "That man" said he to Harry, "is looked upon as one of the pillars of his church. Oh, the pious
                     exhortations I have heard him make! Oh, the tears I have seen him shed over
                     poor sinners!—and yet he can thus torture a soul for whom Christ died!"
                  "Do you think they imagine these slaves have souls?" asked Harry.
                  "They pretend to," said Marshall as they galloped from the place. "They call
                     them brothers and sisters in Christ, and then sell or mutilate Christ's
                     brothers and sisters. The whole thing is a shocking libel upon the Christian
                     religion!" he exclaimed indignantly.
                  "Why, are you not a Southerner?" asked Harry in surprise.
                  "By birth and affection, yes, and I love my home and every association with
                     which it is connected, save slavery. All the fair beauty of the South is
                     befouled by that one black stain. I don't know that I should disclose these
                     sentiments to you, but you don't seem like a fanatic, as we consider your
                     Northern abolitionists."
                  "My dear fellow, I never yet met with an abolitionist who was a fanatic," said
                     Harry smilingly.
                  "Don't they want to destroy the Union?" asked Marshall.
                  "No! THEY WOULD PERPETUATE THE UNION, THAT THE UNION MAY BE FREE!"
                  "But they pour contempt upon our Constitution, because they say it upholds
                     slavery."
                  "On the contrary, they prove that the spirit of the Constitution
                        condemns slavery."
                  "I can't see that," said Marshall; halting half way between his prejudice and
                     his scruples of conscience.
                  "When you return home, my friend, get your National Constitution.
                  "Mark its preamble: 'We, the people of the United States;' not
                     'We, the white people;' nor 'We, the free people;'
                     but 'WE, THE PEOPLE.' And mark well, too, what immediately follows: 'in order
                     to form a more perfect union, ESTABLISH JUSTICE, ensure domestic tranquillity,
                     provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and SECURE THE
                     BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and
                     establish this Constitution of the United States.' Look, too, at the Bill
                        of Attainder, the Habeas Corpus
                     Act, and Trial by Jury—all going to establish forever the great American fact
                     that no child shall suffer on account of his parent.
                  "Is there any slavery in that?"
                  "Your slave is said to be a slave because he was born of a slave, whereas his
                     life is as much the gift of God as your own, and no man has any right either in
                     nature or by revelation to dispose of an immortal soul, much less to buy the
                     child, as in some cases is done even before it is born. But I don't want to
                     engage in a controversy; only I ask you to take the Constitution, analyze it,
                     and then see if you do not say that the Constitution condemns
                        slavery from the, first page to the last. The word 'slave' or
                     'slavery' is not once mentioned in it, from the beginning to the end. These, I
                     am aware, are old arguments, but they are true as eternity."
                  
                  "But the idea of amalgamation! They tell me you Northerners advocate such
                     principles. That is revolting to me; I couldn't go that, Mr. Van Broek."
                  "Which do you think carries the principle into practice most
                     thoroughly, Mr. Randolph, the North or the South? I've seen, in my short visit,
                     not a few white faces in slave-quarters. There's a
                     verse in the Bible that runs thus: 'Can the Ethiopian change his skin?' If
                        he can't, I should think the Southern masters were doing it for
                     him pretty thoroughly. I beg your pardon," he added quickly, noting the flush
                     and the succeeding pallor that passed over Marshall's fine face; "I am in the
                     habit of speaking too bruskly, I fear. I trust you will overlook
                     my rashness."
                  "You have spoken the truth," said Marshall in a hoarse, troubled voice. "It is
                     a frightful feature of our domestic institution. I speak that which I know! Yet
                     is there not an intuitive repugnance in our very nature, towards this dusky
                     race? Has not God implanted within us a peculiar dislike for these offshoots of
                     another clime?"
                  "What! can God be a partial Deity? I think not. Besides, I see the
                     slave come near his master to brush his coat, black his boots, or do any little
                     inferior service for him, and the white man does not seem to feel
                     any of that intuitive repugnance that you speak of. And when the
                     Anglo-Saxon is sick, and his black nurse watches over his couch, lifts him,
                     puts the spoon to his lips, or does any other grateful duty, he does not
                     shrink, or manifest a natural or peculiar dislike. But if he comes up to you as
                     a free man, you feel 'repugnance' then. This seems very strange to me, but only
                     proves conclusively that it is not the color but the condition of
                     the black. His race has been enslaved. Slavery implies abjectness and
                     degradation; and we feel, like the man in Scripture, to say, 'Stand
                        off, I am holier than thou.'"
                  "There is truth in what you say," replied Marshall.
                  "My mother's religion," continued Harry, his blue eyes lighting up, "forbids
                     the exaltation of any one class or person over another. I have always been
                     accustomed to hear her call her servant 'friend'—'friend Hannah,' or 'friend
                     Mary' or whatever might be the name. And it, is beautiful to see how the slaves
                     are touched by it."
                  "What! does she speak in that manner to the slaves?" asked Marshall, in quick
                     surprise.
                  "To be sure she does, and there is no affectation about it. She is a 'Friend'
                     you know."
                  "So is Lawyer Kenneth," said Marshall, smiling a little.
                  "I beg your pardon; he is a renegade. Do you not know that the moment a Quaker
                     soils his hands with this accursed traffic, he is cut off from all fellowship
                     with the society? Certainly. My uncle does not call himself a Quaker now. It
                     has been a great grief to my mother," said Harry, thoughtfully.
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XII.
               IN SEVEN PARTS.
               
                  PART I.
                  SLAVEHOLDING ARGUMENTS.
                  
                     Showing that even slaves take the liberty of thinking sometimes for
                        themselves.—Old Hepsy gives her opinions without regard to consequences.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           "That tone—those looks so changed—the withering blight
                           That sin and sorrow leave where'er they light;
                           The dead despondency of those sunk eyes!"
                        
                     
                  
                  "I HAVE to alight here to do some little errands for my sister;" said Marshall,
                     "will you stop for me, or ride on?"
                  "I will remain I believe," Harry replied.
                  When young Randolph, came out, he added—
                  "That is a noble-looking girl who waited upon you; I didn't know it was the
                     custom for ladies to tend store here."
                  "That is not"—exclaimed Marshall, abruptly pausing—"that is a young
                     slave-woman;" and his cheek grew hot.
                  "You were about to say that is not a lady?" queried Harry smilingly.
                  "Yes, frankly; but on second thought; she certainly is charming in both face
                     and manners. She is the daughter, it is supposed, of Woods, the merchant. He is
                     a bachelor."
                  "Aha! what becomes of your cry against amalgamation?" asked Harry.
                  "True!" said Marshall, thoughtfully. After a long silence, he exclaimed—"I have
                     been over this thing in my mind many a time, since I visited the West India
                     Islands. Dining with the Governor of British Guiana one day, I asked him
                     frankly if the emancipation there had been of any injury to the colonies. He
                     was a noble-looking man, and his reply filled me with admiration. 'If it has
                     been a loss of money,' said he, 'it has been a gain of souls!' Upon this, the
                     Chief Justice, at whose right I sat, exclaimed, 'I lost fifty thousand pounds,
                     by emancipation, but I have found in the peace of my conscience, ample
                     security, upon which I am drawing every day. And besides that' he continued, 'I
                     have been more prospered in my business, and am rapidly making up for all
                     drawbacks.'"
                  "Ah, Keene! is that you?"
                  Marshall stopped to chat a moment with the man he had just greeted on the road.
                     When they parted, the former remarked—
                  "That man has been a slave."
                  "Is it possible? He is as white as my uncle's carpenter," replied Harry.
                  "They are brothers," said Marshall.
                  "Brothers?"
                  "Yes, brothers, both of them, and brothers of your uncle Kenneth's wife; nobody
                     can wipe that out."
                  "Oh, dreadful!" said Harry, shuddering.
                  "So you are horrified at the relationship?"
                  "No, no! but at the crime! the crime! These men had mothers."
                  
                  "Yes, and it is said that one of them died by violence. There is a patch of
                     woods some three miles from Washington Grange, where no slave dares go at any
                     time. Those who venture near, bring reports of horrible cries, shrieks and
                     groans, unearthly figures flitting to and fro, and all sorts of bugaboo
                     stories. You know these people are imaginative creatures, and a tap on the door
                     at the dead of night is an earthquake to them."
                  "But why does this man stay here? why not go North, if he is free?"
                  "He did go North after he bought his freedom, and set up business in a small
                     way with a man of color. There is one noble trait about these white slaves, or
                     men with a drop of black blood infused into the gallons of white; they seldom
                     disown their kindred, seldom pretend to be superior to them in any way. I
                     admire them for that. Well, Fred Keene's partner was, as I said, colored, but
                     not very dark. One day they went into a popular church in one of your Northern
                     cities, Fred and this colored man, and they were hardly seated before the
                     sexton came, all in a fluster, and nodding to the black man, said, 'There's a
                     place for you up stairs, in the corner pew of the gallery; we don't allow
                     negroes to sit in the body of the church.' You ought to hear Fred Keene tell
                     it. He was all on fire, you may believe, and says he, 'Well, sir, then I
                     suppose I am tabooed also, for I too am a negro; and they both left the church,
                     the sexton staring after them, as well he might. Then Fred says they would not
                     even let this partner of his ride in an omnibus, and in fact so persecuted the
                     colored people, that he swore he would come back South—and so he did. Just
                     mention a church North to him, and he breaks out rarely.
                  "Where do your black people sit in your churches?" asked Harry, "in the body of
                     the house?"
                  "Oh! no; in the galleries," was the reply.
                  "Then, I don't see as you're ahead of us in that matter," said Harry.
                  "Oh! but then they profess so much more than we do," said
                     Marshall, "they talk about 'the brother-hood of the races,' and 'the
                     immateriality of complexion,' and yet will not ride a mile with a black man,
                     while we—why, there are some slaves on my father's place, whom I actually love,
                     dear old creatures, and would ride with them, or eat with them, anywhere."
                  "That don't agree with what you said about 'inborn repulsion,' or 'intuitive
                     rising,'" said Harry.
                  "Ah! but you set that at rest when you make the black my equal; make him walk
                     with me, sit with me, eat with me, as a competitor. What a man owns, you know,
                     he will let no one underrate; but when you come to put these people, who have
                     been our slaves, beside us on our law-benches, beside us in our churches,
                     beside us in our workshops—then I confess I feel the risings."
                  "Which proves that it is not the complexion, but the condition of the slaves,
                     as I said."
                  "Yes, I suppose so," replied Marshall. As Harry turned his glance away, he
                     thought an expression of pain passed over the face of his friend, and that he
                     winced. It was so. The movement of his horse had chafed the shoulder that bore
                     witness to his great humanity; and the club of the slave-holder did more to convince his reason
                     than a thousand and one arguments.
                  Marshall Randolph was a man of the most exalted integrity. While his character
                     was purely delicate and feminine, his judgment, at the same time, was sound and
                     incorruptible—his mind always collected. Now his noble and serene countenance
                     assumed an air of intense reflection.
                  The young men had turned their horses' heads towards home; they had passed the
                     outskirts of the city. The ever-throbbing vitality of nature was above and
                     around them. The atmosphere was of a peculiarly soft, sunny, green-house
                     temperature. They were almost silent during the remainder of their ride home.
                     Harry, thinking over the plan of his mother and himself for the liberation of
                     Lucina, and which he dared not yet unfold to Marshall Randolph; Marshall,
                     musing upon what had been the subject of their conversation.
               
               
                  PART II.
                  MAGGIE'S NONSENSE.
                  "Oh, we're so lonesome!" exclaimed Maggie Willis, as Harry appeared among the
                     girls on the back veranda. "We've been devising all manner of experiments for
                     our amusement, and not one of them seems destined to succeed. Hat, here, wants
                     to get Hollister's face on canvas; but then, if a casual sight has made such an
                     impression, what would a dozen sittings do? We should have an elopement in high
                     life, sure!"
                  "Hush, you silly girl!" said Hattee, with dignity, her cheek taking on a color;
                     "I am not accustomed to treat slaves with the familiarity that you do."
                  "Hear her!" cried Maggie, merrily. "Upon my word, I do believe she tells the
                     truth. But then, poor creatures, they don't have much enjoyment, and a smile,
                     or a familiar chat, makes them so happy! Now, I move that we commission Amy
                     Kenneth to go to Hollister's quarters (he seems to look with more interest on
                     her than poor us), and beg him, as a great favor, to lend Hat his handsome
                     face. She'll make an Oriental of him, sure."
                  "Cousin Maggie!" exclaimed Amy, almost fiercely, and the blood surged up to her
                     cheeks. Hollister had come to the house on some errand, and must have heard
                     Maggie's silly speech. The slave passed into the house, and in a few moments
                     out again—his eyes, perhaps unconsciously, sparkling—his whole face lighted
                     up.
                  "La! who cares!" exclaimed Maggie, recovering from a momentary embarrassment.
                     "I'm sure the most famous artists in Italy pick beggars right out of the
                     street, and spat them on to the canvas, rags and all. I don't think it would be
                     beneath Hat to paint Hollister. You might call him the Americo-Anglo-African
                     prince. There's a blending of nations in that man."
                  Recollecting that Harry stood before her, Maggie colored up to the eyes.
                  The young ladies formed a pretty, picturesque circle. They were all robed simply in white garments,
                     Phillis sitting at a little distance, engaged with her sewing. The arbor-like
                     veranda was just the place for such a group, with green vines clinging outside,
                     and green tendrils gleaming through. Hattie was embroidering; Maggie and Amy
                     were trifling with their needles, but not apparently making much headway in
                     their work.
                  "Oh, girls! Amy! I've found something!" cried Maggie, stooping to hide her
                     embarrassment. "It's some of Hat's poetry, as sure as I live! Oh, Hat! may I
                     read it?"
                  Hattie held out her hand. "Maggie, Maggie, I beg—I entreat you—give them to
                     me," she said earnestly.
                  They were verses descriptive of just such a man as Marshall Randolph, and she
                     had felt the influence of Mag's merciless with more than once on his
                     account.
                  "Delightful beggar, there!" cried Maggie, throwing the paper towards her, while
                     Harry said, "I did not know there was a poet among us," looking somewhat
                     admiringly at Hattie Goldsmith.
                  "Why, you might have guessed it by her name—she's a relative of the poet, ever
                     so far off—ain't you, Hat?" she asked, mischievously. "And then she writes so
                     pathetically of poor, distressed people, like—who was it used to write essays
                     on poverty, and all that sort of thing, on a table of gold? Oh! and—Mr. Van
                     Broek—you don't know half her excellences; she can improvise both poetry and
                     music—paint beautifully—see her cheeks now—in fact, Amy thinks she's almost
                     equal in perfection to that elegant young lady who—doesn't wait on, oh no!—but
                     is your mamma's companion for a while."
                  "Mr. Van Broek knows you, Mag," said Hattie, gravely, "so there is no need of
                     making any apology for your foolish tongue."
                  "Thank you; that's compliment eleven hundredth and eleventy-'leventh," said
                     Maggie, flippantly. "You must know, Mr. Van Broek, I'm in the habit of keeping
                     a journal, in which I put down all the flattering things that are said of me,
                     and they really have amounted to that number. I'm so very popular!"
                  "I've kept a journal ever since I was fifteen," said a thin voice, and Miss
                     Lufburrow joined them.
                  "Bless me! how many volumes you must have!" exclaimed Maggie,
                     earnestly.
                  "Oh, no—only one—very handsome—large—well bound—my brother, the Rev. Joseph
                     Lufburrow, gave it to me. Dear! I wish Bridget was here. I'll go call her: I'd
                     like you to see how very well it has kept since I was fifteen."
                  "Let Phillis go," said Amy.
                  "Oh, no. I'm at the expense of Bridget, and I want my money's worth," said Miss
                     Lufburrow; "but I guess I'll get my journal some other day. Brother thinks it's
                     a very good thing for young girls to keep journals," continued Miss Lufburrow.
                     "He used to say every night, 'Sister, have you written in your journal to-day?'
                     and then, if I hadn't, I'd go right up stairs and get my journal, and I
                     generally had to get him to help me out. La! my brother Joe has such a
                     head!"
                  
                  "Is it thick?" asked Amy.
                  Miss Lufburrow gave her a stupidly amiable stare.
                  "I mean the book—not the head," said Amy, biting her lips; "some of them are
                     very square and thin, you know, and all of them are apt to be flat."
                  "Yes," replied Miss Lufburrow, forgetting the foregoing question, "very."
                  Harry, though he could not help smiling, thought it mean for Miss Amy to use
                     her wit, or rather volatility, upon this poor, weak-minded woman. After turning
                     the morning paper on all sides again, he excused himself to the ladies, and
                     sauntered out on the walk beyond. At first he thought of going down to the
                     carpenter's quarters, but seeing Fred Keene on horseback cantering that way, he
                     changed his mind, and went on beyond to the smithy.
               
               
                  PART III.
                  THE BLACKSMITH.
                  A near view of this black Hercules raised somewhat the admiration Harry had
                     hitherto felt. He was at his bellows as the latter entered, but with a ready
                     politeness he ducked his head with a "how d'y, massa?"
                  Harry had hardly yet become reconciled to that manner of address. To be called
                     master by a man strong, powerful, and intellectual, was not pleasant to
                     him.
                  "Good morning, Joycliffe," said Harry.
                  "Morn', massa; dis yer berry hansum day."
                  "Yes, a fine day," replied Harry; "pretty warm work smithing, I should
                     think."
                  "Well, massa, we brack folks used to warm work," replied Joycliffe, clasping
                     his huge hand over an iron bar. "We git our color, I 'spect, from the sun, so
                     we like him berry much; he no broil us as he do white man."
                  Harry longed to know how this black Hercules regarded bondage: whether he was
                     willing to concede that superiority to the whites accorded them by themselves,
                     but dared not for fear of trespassing upon the rules of the estate. Still he
                     was determined to bring out Joycliffe, if possible, without appearing to elicit
                     his sentiments by any opinions of his own.
                  He stooped and picked up a horseshoe.
                  "You work as if you were a happy man, Joycliffe," he said.
                  "Yes sa, me happy as in reason to 'spect," replied the black, ceasing a moment
                     from his work. "Tol'ably good massa; plenty eat—plenty wear—wife an' chillen.
                     Like me son go school like white massas', but then poor slave can't 'spec'
                     that, sartin sure." Then followed an enumeration of his son's talents, and the
                     declaration that nobody "never know in dis world what chillen coming to;
                     'spec', if dey smart, massa keep dem on de place."
                  "Yes, if he don't die," said Harry.
                  "Ah, massa, dat am de tight spot," replied the black, his face changing to a
                     look of real anxiety; "ef he die, what goes all de chillen?"
                  
                  "His heirs would own you then, of course," said Harry, watching his expressive
                     face.
                  "He heirs!" exclaimed Joycliffe; "why, massa," he added, in a sort of sadly
                     exultant tone, "me worth three thousan' anybody's money. Suppose they no want a
                     smith, I fetch a good price, 'specially down South; den wha's poor wife an'
                     chillen' gon'e to do?"
                  "This is one of the happy slaves!" thought Harry, as he saw the
                     strokes of the hammer now hasty and impatient, and marked the troubled look
                     that had gathered on the man's brow.
                  "What made you ever think of that, Joycliffe?" asked Harry.
                  "Me figger it out in me own head," said Joycliffe, quietly. "Head given to
                     tink, an' me tink good deal over my work. 'Sides, me see other slaves sold off,
                     an' have a 'spicion that white mens gits in tight places sometimes, where they
                     has to 'trench, as Hollister say."
                  "Do you talk much with Hollister?" asked Harry, carelessly.
                  The man gave a half questioning, half frightened look toward him.
                  "Sometimes he come here to my do'," he replied, "and I speaks to him, and he
                     speaks to me, but we don't mostly say nothing.' I can't 'spress myse'f, but I
                        tinks, massa," he said again with a gesture of carnestness.
                     "God A'mighty gave me my tink."
                  This was a sublime idea, though rudely clothed, and Harry felt sure he had been
                     right in saying that this man possessed intellect of a high order. There are
                     many like him.
                  "How much money do you earn for yourself, Joycliffe?" asked Harry.
                  "Bless de Lord, massa! yo' Northern folks so queer, any how. I doesn't earn
                     nothin', massa, only ef me work on holiday, or after day's work done. Then me
                     putty tired, massa; rather go to ole cabin, an' set roun' wi' ole woman and de
                     chillen. Da's my boy, now, massa, larnin' he de trade—shu so."
                  An intelligent lad of some sixteen years now entered the little shop. He was
                     formed after the exact model of his father, and only wanted years and weight to
                     give him the same magnificent stature. His face was as black as Joycliffe's,
                     but even more intelligent, and decidedly handsomer. He brought in some iron
                     implements, doffed his hat to Harry in a conscious manner, and then throwing it
                     on the ground, commenced work with the gravity and precision of an old man.
                     Joycliffe looked at him for a moment with a proud, happy expression; then after
                     a while a sadder glance succeeded. Was he thinking that this fine fellow, full
                     of youth, hope—strange hope, that of the slave—and energy, was not in any one
                     sense, his own? was by inheritance a slave, even though "God A'mighty himself
                     had given him his tink?" Yet he must not use it for his own comfort or benefit,
                     but wholly and solely for his master! and, worse than all, by the horrible
                     chances of the traffic, might be sold at so much per pound, at almost any
                     moment!
                  Ah! thousands of slaves do think of these things. Their great Creator has not given them the think for
                     nothing. Sometimes they think of revolution!
               
               
                  PART IV.
                  LUCINA FINDS A RESTING-PLACE.
                  Lucina was busy with her embroidery near the table drawn up to the centre of
                     the large parlor. Mabel sat drawing, every now and then calling for Lucina's
                     approval. The charming Quakeress had not seemed as well for months as she did
                     this morning. Her habit was rather more in accordance with her professional
                     fashion than usual. The cap was plainer, though worn still a little jauntily;
                     the clear white muslin handkerchief was folded under the pretty chin, and the
                     gown was of a plain drab-color. Every little while Lucina would cast admiring
                     glances towards the work progressing under the small white hands.
                  "Thee does not know, perhaps, that I never was taught these things in my
                     childhood," said Mabel, smiling towards the young girl, after secretly noting
                     the calm and peaceful expression that had gradually gained on the face of the
                     slave.
                  "I have heard that Friends seldom study them," replied Lucina.
                  "All this I learned subsequent to my marriage," said Mabel, industriously
                     playing her crayons. "I was always yearning after something unattained, and
                     could hardly tell what the craving was till I saw in other circles how ladies
                     employed their spare time, and I exclaimed to myself—these accomplishments must
                     be mine! So when I could summon courage to speak to Mr. Van Broek—dear heart! a
                     child might have had courage with him—he entered fully into all my plans,
                     procured me masters, and," holding up the pretty picture, "I consider myself
                     quite accomplished."
                  "Oh! that is very beautiful!" exclaimed Lucina.
                  "Almost as good as thine!"
                  "Better! much better!" said Lucina, deprecatingly.
                  "No, my dear, not better than thine—not anywhere near that—for thine is genius,
                     mine is the more talent of imitation. If I had possessed genius, I should have
                     known what the want was, and, like our great friend West, have made brushes out
                     of pussy's hair. But what is thee gazing at in such terror?" she asked,
                     following Lucina's eyes.
                  "Spitfire!" murmured the girl; "there is something very fearful about that
                     horse."
                  She had turned pale, because she heard Lawyer Kenneth call for "Dole Baker."
                     That name inspired her with unmitigated horror. Now she saw him. She knew it
                     was he with that saucy, dashing face, curling lip, and voluptuous motion. The
                     young ladies were talking with him from the front veranda.
                  Mabel had left her seat, gone forward, and leaning on Lucina's shoulder, looked
                     out. Her slight frame shivered.
                  "At that dissolute man, dear," replied Mabel, the ques- tion being asked why; "his eye fills me with
                     disquiet. I hope Harry does not know him."
                  "Ah! if you knew what I have heard about him!" said Lucina, her lip quivering
                     as she spoke.
                  "Tell me, dear, if it is no betrayal of confidence," said Mrs. Van Broek,
                     gently.
                  She repeated Lawyer Kenneth's language.
                  Mabel's cheek grew like marble. She started as with a spasm, exclaiming: "did
                        my brother—did Everard—say that?"
                  Lucina had forgotten at that moment that the man of whom she complained was the
                     brother of this sweet creature, whom she had learned almost to worship.
                  "Oh! I did not mean—I forgot—I did not think!" she cried, wildly; "what have I
                     done? how could I thoughtlessly pain you so?"
                  "Never mind, my dear—thou wert right," replied Mabel, tottering to her lounge,
                     the hectic now lighting her eyes with its vivid fire; "it has made me very weak
                     again—the thought of this unnatural proposition—and did she—did his wife
                     sanction it?"
                  "I thought it did not please her," murmured Lucina. Her eyes were filling with
                     tears.
                  Meanwhile, Dole Baker rode leisurely about before the veranda, looking around
                     him on all sides. He was evidently anxious to see something that was not yet
                     visible, and it was a long time before he desisted in his search. At last the
                     company rode off, attended by Lawyer Kenneth, whose laugh sounded longest and
                     loudest. Mabel listened, her face strangely sorrowful—her features sharpened by
                     grief. For many moments she lay quite motionless, watching the slave-girl's
                     drooping face and figure, thinking till she thought herself into a fever.
                     Several times she was on the point of telling Lucina what conclusions her son
                     and herself had arrived at with reference to her purchase, but an unwonted
                     dread held her back—her brother might refuse to sell—death might come to her at
                     any moment.
                  "I wish I might only die," sobbed Lucina, letting her work fall, and suddenly
                     burying her face in her hands. "I can't bring myself to feel my subjection as
                     they tell me I ought! I cannot be a slave! Oh! Mrs. Van Broek, you
                     who are so good and kind, help me away. Oh! I am so wretched!"
                  Mabel buried her face in the crimson pillow, unable to bear the sight of such
                     grief.
                  "I feel as if something was gnawing here," laying her hand on her heart; "I
                     feel it night and day. In my dreams it is a weight that suffocates me, and I
                     wake up every few hours strangling, choking—if I could only die then and never
                     wake!" she cried, more passionately, gathering the folds of her white apron all
                     over her face to catch the gushing tears.
                  "My friend," said the Quakeress, in a broken voice, "does thee never look
                     above, in thy anguish?"
                  "I try to," sobbed Lucina; "sometimes I try to think it may be God's will—I
                     pray—I cry—I groan to be submissive and quiet, and then this feeling comes ten
                     times more powerful—the feeling as if I had chains about me and
                        must
                      break them—MUST!" she cried,
                     suiting the action to the word, and for a moment thrusting forth her arm as if
                     the power were there.
                  "And when I think that I never knew a mother's love—never felt a mother's hand
                     upon my head—never laid against her bosom—never heard her say 'my child,' and
                     speak tender words to me—oh! oh! my lot is very hard—very dark—very hopeless,"
                     and again her head fell, and the choking sobs convulsed her frame.
                  "Lucina!"
                  The young slave started—the voice seemed not the same—she looked round, hushing
                     her sobs. Mabel had partly risen; tears were falling from her eyes, those soft,
                     beautiful eyes. Her arms were outstretched; she said, "come hither my
                     child—come to me."
                  Lucina arose, went to her side, and falling on her knees, she was clasped in
                     the arms of Mabel. Close she held her; close to her heart. The trembling frame
                     was gathered for the first time in a long, loving embrace. The weary head lay
                     pillowed as it never had been before. Oh! the content that at that moment
                     sprang up! full, unbounded, sufficient.
                  "My poor, weary dove!" said Mabel, softly passing her hand over the brown hair;
                     "that plaint touched me as nothing ever did before, save the last words of my
                     own dead child. She lay dying, her sweet eyes wide open, fastened upon my
                     face—I striving for composure that the dear lamb might not know my grief.
                  "'Mother!' she said, pressing my hand that she held in her dear little fingers,
                     'won't you love another little girl?'
                  "The words chilled me then—but if ever there was a living voice from the grave,
                     I heard that voice, but now, thrilling through me. I thought how I did love my
                     babe! how she never knew stint of affection. How every act, motion, wish was
                     regarded—how she lay on my bosom by night, and rested there by day. Then I
                     thought what, if my child had lived, and I been taken! She could have called no
                     one mother. Who would be to her as I had been? And then more fearful than all,
                     rushed over me the terrible conviction that joined to this yearning for a
                     mother's voice, thou, my poor homeless dove—had forever before thee, the
                     dreary, hopeless lot of slavery. Oh! my child, stay where thee is, for really
                     and verily, thee shall be my daughter! Yes, don't look so frightened—lay thy
                     head down once again, and listen—I did not mean to tell thee, for fear of
                     raising hopes that might be cruelly dashed, but listen. My brother must sell
                     thee to me—I will free thee and take thee to my own home. While I live thee
                     shall be to me a friend, a daughter. Don't kneel to
                     me!—no!—no!—not to me—to thy God who has inspired me with this
                     resolve. I am but the poor, feeble instrument of His will."
                  Lucina had no words. The soft, sad languor of her dark eyes had given place to
                     a wild joy. It was a great boon that she could not instantly comprehend. Her
                     brain grew dizzy in dwelling on its magnitude. Her lips were parted—her breath
                     grew hurried, and she looked upon Mabel Van Broek as the blind man looked on
                     Jesus, when the great Author of
                     Salvation had restored his sight—with wonder, awe and love inexpressible.
                  It was some time before either spoke. Mabel broke the silence, and told her
                     plans. Lucina was to finish her studies, still with the view of teaching, as
                     had seemed to be originally intended. "Then," Mabel continued, "thee will be
                     independent, though thy home must still be with me, as long as I live. And who
                     knows," she added, thoughtfully, "but thee may be loved by some worthy
                     gentleman, and become his wife?"
                  "Never—never!" said Lucina, sadly, "if there is one stain upon my birth, I will
                     never marry. I long ago made up my mind to that, and the fact that I have once
                     been held as a slave would deter any man from marrying me."
                  "It may be thee is mistaken," said the Quakeress, softly.
               
               
                  PART V.
                  OLD HEPSY'S DREAM.
                  Old Tabby put her white head-gear into the room, to say that mistress wanted
                     "Cina," as the slaves called Lucina, for a few moments, if Mrs. Van Broek could
                     spare her. The slave-girl always dreaded to leave this room—doubly so now, when
                     it had become a heaven to her.
                  Mabel gave a cheerful consent, however, and there was nothing to do but to go.
                     So she entered the equally beau- tiful chamber of the mistress. The air was
                     heavy with perfumes and the scent of aromatic vinegar. Mrs. Kenneth seemed
                     suffering; she had thrown herself upon the bed, and both hands were pressed
                     over her eyes. When Lucina entered, she lifted them a little, and said faintly,
                     "Lucina, will you shut out the sun? I feel quite ill, and Phillis has gone out
                     with the young ladies."
                  The girl closed the blinds, let down the rich curtains, moving about with a
                     noiseless tread.
                  There had been a violent altercation between the lawyer and his wife; threats
                     on one side, tears, pallor, entreaty on the other. Nobody had heard it—very
                     elegant people quarrel so quietly!—but it had left its traces on the
                     tearstained cheeks, and bloodless lips of the wife. She thought she had been
                     guarding a secret; he fancied he had discovered one; hence the trouble.
                  "Lucina," said Mrs. Kenneth, now that the room was darkened, uncovering her
                     eyes, "will you bathe my head? it aches sadly."
                  The slave-girl pitied her mistress. As kindly as she could, she bathed the
                     white, haggard brow, pressing so lightly! so carefully!
                  "Thank you; how cool your hands are; let me hold them! Feel, mine are
                     burning."
                  Lucina could not help thinking how strangely her mistress held her hands—now
                     with one clasped over the other, then as Lucina sat on the side of the low bed,
                     gathering and drawing them near her heart—and continually pressing them as if
                     to gather in her own, their steadiness of nerve.
                  
                  Presently she seemed more comfortable, and recovering. One of the hands she set
                     at liberty, the other she still continued to hold.
                  "You are a good girl, Lucina," she said softly, looking up at her and then
                     shutting her eyes suddenly.
                  The slave tried to thank her, but there was something so absolutely mournful in
                     the voice and manner of her mistress, that she could hardly restrain her
                     tears.
                  "It is very sad—after being brought up as you have been." Mrs. Kenneth's lip
                     quivered.
                  "Please don't talk of it," said Lucina, shuddering all over and turning away
                     her head.
                  "But you must understand that I wished to save you from a worse fate," said her
                     mistress, her eyes still tightly closed, as if to keep back the tears.
                  "I try to think so," said Lucina, mournfully.
                  "That awful wretch! that Boston man—he coming from where they make so great a
                     boast of their benevolence—to do such a black deed!" exclaimed her mistress,
                     with vehemence. "Oh! I would have given him!"——she stopped—opened her eyes
                     suddenly in a frightened way on Lucina's expectant face—closed them again, but
                     did not finish the sentence.
                  "Lucina, come closer to me," said Mrs. Kenneth, hurriedly. The girl obeyed,
                     full of wonder.
                  "Whatever Mr. Kenneth may command you to do," she said slowly, and with some
                     hesitation, "obey with as good a grace as you can. And remember, if worse comes
                     to worst, you shall not be sacrificed!"
                  "What can you mean?" cried Lucina, shrinking away in terror.
                  "I tell you, I will not let them injure you; but you must appear
                     to be submissive," said Mrs. Kenneth again, looking in an earnest, alarmed sort
                     of way towards the door. "My husband, for some reason, has taken a violent
                     dislike to you; I—cannot—of course—tell why! but he declares I shall not help
                     you—and—don't! don't!—I tell you I will save you; yes, I will, I
                     WILL, at the risk of my very life!" she cried wildly.
                  She now sat up on the bed, her bright hair loosened, and falling in glossy
                     waves over her shoulders.
                  "Oh! Mrs. Kenneth!" cried Lucina, in extreme terror, "he has not sold me
                     yet."
                  "No, no; not yet! nor shall he, I tell you!" she exclaimed
                     fiercely. "Sell you to be that man's, mistress! Never! never!
                     never! Oh! my God! give me strength—desert me not! Why should I
                     ask anything of God?" she uttered in a low, strained voice; her eyes had grown
                     bloodshot; her hands worked rapidly together.
                  "Oh! Mrs. Kenneth—oh, Mrs. Kenneth! don't let him sell me! Do you think he will
                     before you see him again? Before heaven, he shall never sell me alive!" cried
                     Lucina, starting to her feet.
                  "No, no, girl! you will undo it all—foil my plan—ruin yourself. I tell you no!
                     He has a will, so have I. He has no motive but revenge—I have a motive——but no
                     matter!——What am I talking about? How strangely my head feels! it throbs, and
                     throbs. Look here, my girl— this
                     will never do for you or me. I tell you, I will save you; will you trust
                     me?"
                  Lucina's pale lips murmured "Yes;" but she was thinking of Mabel's promise—not
                     of the almost incoherent sentences that now fell on her ear.
                  Again the housekeeper's white cone was thrust into the room after a low
                     knock.
                  "Ole Hepsy here on she visit, see missus," she said.
                  "Tell her to come in for a few moments," said Mrs. Kenneth, hastily smoothing
                     her hair, and lying down again, "it will not do to refuse her, I suppose," she
                     murmured in a weary way. "Lucina, you may go—no—on second thought—you may
                     stay," she added, as the sound of the old woman's stick was heard outside the
                     door.
                  "Ky, Missy Kenneth sick dis mornin'," said old Hepsy, pausing as she entered,
                     and leaning on her staff. Her coal-black eyes were fixed upon the pale, dim
                     figure on the bed. Her tall frame, in the thin garments that clung to her gaunt
                     limbs, looked taller than ever—her wrinkled face more weird and witch-like.
                  "Yes, Hepsy, I have a bad headache," replied Mrs. Kenneth, striving for
                     composure.
                  "Mighty dark here—dark room like a bad heart—nobody but God see wha' goin' on
                     dar," said the old African, peering about. Then seeing Lucina, who was gazing
                     at her with fear strongly expressed in her pale features, she said, "Hum! dark
                     no hab eye—take good while find folks; good long while find some
                     folks, I 'spect."
                  "Sit down, Hepsy," said Mrs. Kenneth, wincing.
                  "Thank un, missee; wha' for you go be sick?" she asked, seating herself.
                  "Oh, I hardly know; a slight cold, perhaps," replied Mrs. Kenneth.
                  "Ky! s'pose so—whar's de chill'n?"
                  "Children!" exclaimed Mrs. Kenneth, flushing, while something like alarm seemed
                     to animate her. "Amy, you mean; Amy is out somewhere."
                  "My foolish ole memory!" exclaimed the African. "I t'inks for minute you has
                     more dan one. Ky! ole woman's recommembers ain't oncommon bright—might a
                     know'd."
                  "How do you get along, Hepsy?" asked Mrs. Kenneth, hastily.
                  "A'mighty take good care of ole Hepsy; blessed Mast'r knows she ain't got
                     nobody else take car ob her, s'pees," replied Hepsy, staring at
                     Lucina.
                  "Lucina, go and tell Tabby to send up some cake and wine," said Mrs.
                     Kenneth.
                  "'Deed no—don't want nothin'," exclaimed the African, quickly; "eat plenty fo'
                     I come away."
                  "You had better go down to Mrs. Van Broek," said Mrs. Kenneth, nervously, again
                     addressing Lucina.
                  Lucina left the room, but before she entered that of Mabel, declared to herself
                     that she would not distress her with the recital of Mrs. Kenneth's
                     conversation.
                  Old Hepsy did not stay long with the lawyer's wife. In passing out she
                     encountered Jim, the gardener.
                  "'Clar to gracious!" cried Jim, flourishing his shears, "hasn't seen you fo' a
                        cemetery—derefo' mighty glad to see you now. How's you?"
                  "I's alleys well, t'anks to de Lord," replied Hepsy, stiffly.
                  "Seen our new requisition, I s'pose? Mighty fine piece! My ole woman say she's
                     smart fo' nigger; derefo' I denounce her as smart, 'cause my ole
                     woman mighty bright o' apprehension."
                  "Say, Jim, has yo' Tabby got de cards wha' she tell dreams wid?" asked old
                     Hepsy, with a sudden look of interest, "'cause I'se dreamed a dream!" she added
                     solemnly.
                  "Dunno," said Jim, musingly; "sense de elder say we mus' done gone lose de soul
                     ef we put faith in dem ar t'ings; derefo' I don't use um no mo'.
                     But say, ole Hepsy! wha' yo'dream, hey? 'I's mighty good at turpentining
                     wisions and myster'us sights, I is. Jes yo' tell yo' dream—I turpentine him in
                     a minute."
                  "Sho! you! Thinks you'self better dan folks, I s'poss. Well, I
                     dream mars' Kenneth he die, an' he blood spout all ober from he; deed, 'twas
                        bad sight, anyhow! Den I dream my pore boy, wha' he go sell for
                     cussed soul-driver, be way up in de air ober mars' Kenneth's, wicked head, an'
                     he hab white wings, an' nice, clean white clothes on, an' he face shine; but de
                     light wha' come from it make mars' Kenneth black in de face. An' my Jack, he
                     grow more an' more white, an' he keep growing whiter an' whiter, till by 'n by
                     ole Kenneth be black as iron kittle, an' Jack jest like de sun."
                  This dream she repeated with appropriate gestures. Jim had apparently been
                     consulting his garden shears. He stood crossing them, turning them upside down,
                     then balanced them first on one hand, then on the other, looking all the while
                     very wise and oracular.
                  "Guess massa Kenneth going to die' for dis yer year's up," he said, gazing
                     thoughtfully on his great clouted shoes. "Don' know, howebber,
                        derefo' can't say wid 'special 'zactness. Wha' mars' Kenneth go
                     do, 'sides look very savidge?"
                  "He claw de air jest so," and old Hepsy caught at some imaginary object in a
                     spiteful way, clutching at the empty atmosphere; "an' he jaw fall, an' he eye
                     opum. Clar! 'twas de mos' frightfulles' objic' I ebber seen!"
                  "Laws! ole woman," whispered the gardener, creeping up close to the African;
                     "does ye know dat's de way most all dese yer rich massas dies? D'ye eber hear
                     one ob dem on blessed dyin' piller? Don' dey all hab de horrors? Ain't it
                     onpossible to shet dar eyes and chuck up dar chin? Doesn't ye'member how ole
                     mars' Hollister hang out he tongue? Deed, ole woman, all de doctors couldn't
                     put it back. Debbil hab he finger on it, and dar it stay!"
                  "Oh, yes, I 'members, boy, reckon I does! Didn't I watch ober he? Sho! g'long!
                     Don't ye pertend to be asking me what I 'members, case I 'members too
                        much! 'deed I does, honey. I 'members how dey couldn't do not'ing to
                     dis yer wicked ole house till ole mars' Hollister's sperit laid, 'deed no!
                     Debbil hese'f couldn't keep he fro' tormentin' he niggers, deed no! Debbil set
                     ole Grenge all on fire—s'pec's 'twas de eberlasting fire, not'ing burn up. Ole
                     white mars' souls great flame o' fire! Hope he go to hell! Hope mars' Kenneth
                     go to hell! Hope ebery cussed soul-driver go to hell!" she cried, in fierce, low, eager tones,
                     shaking herself furiously.
                  "Take ear', ole woman, you own chile soul-driver," said Jim.
                  "Yes, an' who make he so? Wha' make he so? Jack jest like lamb in he
                     dispersition. Neber could bar see no suffering. Chicken-heart Jack
                     hab; no bar kill de worm under he feet. An' mars' Kenneth knewed it—an' knewed
                     it would spite he mos', so as not'ing else, to be cussed soul-driver. An' so de
                     Lord, da' Lord God A'mighty!" she cried, lifting her hands and eyes solemnly to
                     heaven, "da' great God what'll take vengeance!—da' great Bein' who made all dem
                     mighty hebbens, sun, moon, an' stars, an' de whole creashun!—made heben an'

                     couldn't bar hurt nobody, an' who made cussed soul-driver' gainst he will. No,
                     no!" and she shook her massive white head solemnly, bowed it on her bosom,
                     folded her, arms, shut her eyes, "no, no! He put ten times more hotter on mars'
                     Kenneth for da' very 'niquity. Send he to de lowes' deep, 'long o', mars'
                     Hollister—deed will my blessed Masr'tr—deed will HE!"
               
               
                  PART VI.
                  OLD HEPSY'S ADVICE.
                  Jim seemed struck with the solemnity of old Hepsy's manner, and tried to find
                     or coin a word large enough to express his sympathy with her sorrow. But he
                     twirled his great shears in vain, and by the time he was ready to speak, Hepsy
                     had marched down the walk, and was already far from the house.
                  She went directly to Hollister's cabin. The "boy" was leaning against his door,
                     which opened in the shop, looking forward in a reverie. The instant Hepsy's
                     white head came in sight, however, the absent expression vanished. A smile
                     broke over his face as he said, "Come in, Hepsy."
                  "Can't stay, honey," replied the old woman. "Hi! y'r face long as mars'
                     Hollister's funeral—wha' ails it, honey?"
                  "Nothing;" said Hollister moodily.
                  "Ho! ho! when bird flap he wing on de ground some-thin' ail he—he wing broken;"
                     cried Hepsy, tapping her stick.
                  "My wings ar'n't broken, they're tied," muttered Hollister gloomily.
                  "Ontie 'em!" growled Hepsy, looking first one side then the
                     other.
                  "'Tisn't so easy," replied Hollister, under his breath.
                  "S'pose I white man like you, I be slave?" cried
                     Hepsy indignantly. "No! no! no! Got no wife—got no chil'n; mighty easy run
                     away, anyhow."
                  
                  "Yes, if it wasn't for one thing, I would," said Hollister, his face growing
                     hot, and his teeth grinding; "Miss Amy struck me—see here;" and he
                     pointed to a scar on the lower part of his cheek. "I'll have my revenge for
                        that, yet. It's the first time!"
                  Old Hepsy began to whistle, making peculiar motions; stooping, bowing her head,
                     waving her hands, then suddenly standing erect, she exclaimed:
                  "Wha' for?"
                  "Because I looked at her, I suppose," returned Hollister.
                  Again old Hepsy whistled, going through her African grimaces; then she said
                     again, in a voice of pretended scorn:
                  "Wha' for nigger any business look at Mars'r Kenneth's daughter? You's
                        nigger, boy! does ye know it? Say, boy!
                     does—yer—know—you's—mar's—Kenneth's—;n-i-g-g-e-r?" she repeated, with accents
                     of concentrated bitterness.
                  "Oh, hush, old mother! its bad enough to know it without being told of it so;
                     but, by heavens! I'm her equal, any way;" he muttered; "I'm a man; she's a
                     woman; neither nothing more nor less."
                  He encountered the keen orbs of the free negress gazing searchingly, with a
                     curious twinkle, in his own, and half turned away, confused and blushing.
                  "Hi! nigger git flogging in old mars' Hollister place, ef dey look
                     in white woman's eye. White woman cry ef nigger look at she—tell ole mars'—he
                     call nigger—'Harry! wha' you dar look at yo' missus fo'?"
                  "I no look missus, massa.'
                  "Wha'! missus lie den, do she? gib him fifty in de calaboose for
                     dat.' Whop! gib he fifty in de calaboose for dat! massa Hollister
                     have reason for not want nigger o' look in missees face! Oh, good Lor'! wha' I
                        could tell!"—and the old woman stooped in an immoderate fit of
                     laughter, while the white "boy" looked on amazed.
                  "What secret have you and Keene got between you?" he asked seriously.
                  "Secret—hi! Look here, yo' Hollis;—nebber ask ladies tell dar secrets—um! Jest,
                     you look at mars' Kenneth's new, white gal; den go look at Fred Keene;" and
                     again she went into an almost convulsive fit of laughter.
                  Hollister recoiled.
                  "Mind! ole Hepsy never tells nothing," exclaimed the African, gathering the
                     white cloth over her shoulders. "Ole Heps' allers was a fool; put a
                        leetle fool and a leetle debbil togedder, shake um
                     up, and wha' dey make, ha? 'Spec dey make ole Hepsy!" and straightening herself
                     up, she shook with another shout of laughter.
                  "What ails you to-day, Hepsy?" asked Hollister, his face changing
                     curiously.
                  "Ails I? I's well as ebber I was, thank blessed Mars'r," she replied, dropping
                     a mock courtesy.
                  "Do you mean to tell me that Keene is that Lucina's father?" he asked again
                     gravely.
                  "Don't ask me no questions, boy," replied the old woman, turning away.
                  "You said as much," exclaimed Hollister.
                  
                  "I don't recomember," said Hepsy, putting her hand to her head, in a
                     provokingly unconscious way; "wha' I say—boy? I's very old; pas' a
                        hundered!"
                  "Who was her mother?" asked Hollister, edging towards her in a confidential
                     way.
                  "Sho! go long, boy!" replied old Hepsy, moving off.
                  "Tell me, Hepsy! I'll do anything for you!" cried Hollister, striving to detain
                     her. The old woman, however, said not another word, but marched resolutely off,
                     leaving Hollister angry and perplexed.
                  "I'll know," he muttered; "Keene shall tell me. There's always been something
                     mysterious about Fred, and I remember now what he said: 'that if Kenneth dared
                     to touch this Lucina, he would have his life."
                  Old Hepsy went on towards a little group of cabins, where lived many of Lawyer
                     Kenneth's factory hands. A stalwart negro, a fellow with an ugly, resolute
                     face, and whose reputation was not good, inasmuch as he was sullen, and when he
                     dared to be, saucy, passed her with a lowering brow and defiant eyes, scarcely
                     replying to her salutation.
                  "Reckon dar's trouble 'tween he an' mars' Kenneth, muttered old Hepsy; "bad
                     nigger any how;—got mighty good wife—too good fo' he."
                  There had been trouble between Sam and his master, which had just
                     resulted in the sale of the negro. As old Hepsy drew near Sam's cottage, she
                     paused outside, for the slave-dealer was already bargaining for another
                     chattel. Hepsy could see the interior of Sam's home. It wore a comfortable
                     look, for Lawyer Kenneth was very careful about the condition of his slaves;
                     they must feed well, dress decently, and live, not quite as well as his horses,
                     for they never won bets for him, but in as decent a style as it would do to
                     allow slave. A pair of black twins sat crowing on the rude floor, six other
                     children from the ages of four up to fourteen, two pairs of them twins, stood
                     about in various attitudes. The mother, wife of Sam, a good-looking black
                     woman, sat crouched in a strange posture, her face expressing the deepest
                     sorrow, except when Lawyer Kenneth turned toward her. Then a look of affected
                     calmness, horribly grim, overspread her features, and she even tried to
                     laugh.
                  "Look here, Kenneth, let me have this boy. He's just the sort of critter I want
                     for a stable-and. Come—I'll give you a good price for him—what's he worth?"
                  "I can't sell him," said Kenneth decidedly.
                  The mother gave a sigh in-relief.
                  "What in thunder is that for?" cried the lawyer, turning fiercely upon her.
                  "Nothing massa," replied the woman, meekly.
                  "Are you sighing and fuming because I've sold Sam?" he asked, in the same
                     sharp, almost fierce tone.
                  "No, massa; Sam belong to you—you perfect right to you own property," replied
                     the woman, trembling with apprehension.
                  "Up with you from the floor, then, and none of your grouty looks, or I'll sell
                        you!" cried the lawyer.
                  It was pitiful to see with what dumb alacrity the woman obeyed; pitiful to see
                     her hold back the tears—keep in the quiver of the lips—shape her features into
                     the seeming repose of resignation.
                     It was well for Hepsy that the lawyer did not notice her indignant gestures.
                     She stood at the door outside, shaking her skinny hand at him, and her white
                     head, and showing, in a sort of frenzy, the few stumps of ivory that yet held
                     their place under her shrivelled lips.
                  They passed out—the lawyer with a careless "ha, Hepsy!" which she did not deign
                     to return—the slave-dealer casting back a yearning gaze on the fine fellow whom
                     Kenneth would not sell.
               
               
                  PART VII.
                  OLD HEPSY'S INDIGNATION.
                  Then Hepsy strode into the room. She walked deliberately up to Susan, the
                     mistress of the little cabin, who, having watched her master out of sight,
                     stood weeping bitterly, and laying both hands on her shoulders, shook her till
                     she was tired.
                  "Le' go my mammy!" cried one of the little blacks, punching the old African's
                     leg.
                  "Only wish I had strength, yo' port, spiritless thing!" cried old Hepsy; "shake
                     your liver an' lights out; would so! Ain't got no sunk, no how; 'no, massa, Sam
                     b'long to you—you perfect right to you' own property'!" she cried, ludicrously
                     mimicking the helpless tones of the other My good Lord! 'tink I'd say da'? I'd
                     put my fist up, so, right under he nose, an' I'd say yo' ole' wretch, you! sell
                     my Sam 'way fro' he wife an' chillen—never git no mo' work out o' me, ole'
                     villin, you! Sell my husban' when plenty fellers got no wife an' chillen!"
                  "Oh! don't, don't!" cried Susan, almost rolling on the floor, in the agony of
                     her grief.
                  "Swar' I'd jes' say my prayers, an' go down to de' ribber an' jump in, ef I
                     hadn't mo' spunk dan dat!" cried Hepsy, shaking her old, defiant head.
                  "The children!" sobbed Susan.
                  "Chill'n!" said Hepsy, "ain't no mo' yours dan dey was befo'! Oh, blessed
                     Marst'r! wish it had been me!"
                  "Needn't say nothin'," returned Susan, sullenly; "had you' own childr'n
                     sold!"
                  "Yes!" shouted Hepsy, springing up like a tigress; "yes! an' I made mars'
                     Kenneth shake in he shoes, 'deed did I!—said my say, 'deed I did;
                     better b'lieve. Yes, 'bury me,' say I, 'for not a stitch o' work ole Hepsy ever
                     do fo' ye, 'gin.' 'Deed didn't I—never, sence den. I's too old to sell, ye see!
                     Didn't dar' to tetch me; 'deed, never nobody dar'd tetch whip-stick to ole

                     Massa say he ten year broking my spirit; didn't do it yet! Sperit made o'
                     somethin' can't be broke—da's so!"
                  "Oh! Sam! Sam!" moaned poor Susan.
                  
                  "He's a spity, bad nigger, anyhow," said old Hepsy, savagely.
                  The woman looked up, the big tears streaming down her cheeks.
                  "I knows he's ugly;" she said mournfully, "ugly 'mong de odder hands. I knows
                     he's been spity ever sense massa sell Ann—but, oh Hepsy! he always good to
                     me—an' he love he childr'n desprit."
                  "Never mind yo', Susan," said old Hepsy, preparing to go—and she broke out in a
                     wild African air— 
                        
                           "Oh! dar'll be mournin', mournin', mournin',
                           Oh! dar'll be mournin',
                           De judgment seat of Christ!
                           Pore ole slave dar', Jesus tell—
                           Massa didn't use he well;
                           Christ send massa down to hell—
                           De judgment seat of Christ!"
                        
                     
                  
                  Accompanying this strange air with a monotonous movement, old Hepsy slowly
                     danced out of the cabin, repeating: 
                        "Oh! dar'll be mournin', mournin', mournin'!"
                     
                  
                  It really did seem a relief to this poor old creature to contemplate the future
                     torture of those who held her race in bondage. She was, as it were, in
                     character and disposition, and embodiment of Africa, mourning its abject
                     condition, powerless to redress its own wrongs, yet, confident that judgment
                     would overtake its oppressors, and continually hurling its curses against the
                     evil, so long, its cruel foe Possessing a most resolute will, strong judgment
                     and unerring good sense, it had been the policy of her owners to subdue her
                     worst moods by artifice rather than force. Like most determined people who will
                     not submit to injury without protest, she was extremely capable—but Mrs.
                     Hollister having been one of the most fragile, gentle and unresisting of
                     mortals, Hepsy had become very deeply attached to her, and during her life, did
                     not feel so gallingly the chains of her bondage. Nor did she show her capacity
                     for revenge, until Lawyer Kenneth, whose anger she once roused, sold all her
                     children—one daughter and two sons—the latter born when she was past fifty,
                     consequently her youngest, and her idol. This outrage, as assuredly it was,
                     roused her African blood, and she poured out the vials of her wrath upon the
                     husband of her young mistress. An unfortunate event had taken place at the home
                     of her old master, involving the members of his household in a most serious
                     disgrace. Hepsy had been cognizant of the fact, and it was partly this
                     knowledge that procured her liberation, though she still held it as a sword
                     concealed, ready at the most favorable time to unsheathe it, and flourish it
                     naked over the head of the oppressor.
                  Hepsy enjoyed her religion—shouted as warmly as the rest her amens and
                     hallelujahs, but she could not comprehend the exceeding beauty of the New
                     Testament code, as many of her brothers and sisters in bondage did. Hence,
                     while they rejoiced that they should be among that blessed number who should go
                     up through great tribulations, she would rather have given up her hopes of
                     heaven, than her longings for
                     vengeance. Hers was a strong heart turned to steel, whereon could be too
                     readily struck the glittering fire of hate towards the oppressor, mingled with
                     no pity.

                           "'Tis LIBERTY alone that gives the flowers
                           Of fleeting life their lustre and perfume—
                           And we are weeds without it."
                        
                     
                  
                  MABEL VAN BROEK looked eagerly in the face of her pro-protégée, as Lucina
                     entered the room. The latter betrayed none of her recent sorrow, but going
                     towards the couch on which the invalid reclined, knelt almost reverently as she
                     said again and again in a passionate voice—Oh! how I thank you!"
                  "Never mind, dear," said Mabel, the tears rushing into her eyes, as she
                     witnessed the emotion of Lucina;" "thee must only promise me that thee will not
                     hint this proposal of mine to a living soul."
                  "Oh! never, never!" exclaimed Lucina.
                  "My brother has been in here since thee went out," continued Mabel.
                  Lucina started; her face grew grave.
                  "He is not the brother I once knew," murmured the beautiful woman, striving to steady her voice.
                     "The wine hath made his eyes so fierce and bright, that I had almost to shade
                     mine. His manner is so reckless and God-defying!"
                  Lucina listened with gaze fixed and lips apart.
                  "I did not ask him," said Mabel, replying to her inquiring look.
                  "It was not a fitting time," she continued. "He seemed restless and excited
                     about some matter, and I thought it more prudent to wait. He asked about thee,
                     however, in such a way that I am confident he designs to sell thee soon. I
                     replied calmly to all his questions, and found that he would not dispose of
                     they fate for a certain time, and that he is determined to adorn the victim for
                     the sacrifice. Nay, do not shudder and shrink so, poor girl," said Mabel,
                     tenderly, as Lucina sank almost prostrate upon the floor, "for now I am
                     determined to have thee at any price—even should it take my whole fortune. My
                     child! thee shall be mine!"
                  "Oh, heaven bless you! heaven bless you, dear madam!" sobbed Lucina.
                  "Yes," said Mabel, her eyes shining with the light of a holy purpose, "I never
                     felt my strength before. I can be resolute. Sooner than they shall
                     sacrifice thee, my child, I will sacrifice my estate!" she exclaimed firmly,
                     the flickering red growing steadier upon her cheek. "Oh! how God has permitted
                     me to see the exceeding sin of slavery! Oh! how He has kindled my soul with the
                     flame from His very altar! Do not I glorify His name for this great privilege
                     of rescuing one human soul from bondage?"
                  "Can I ever, ever repay you for all this peril that you take upon yourself?"
                     cried Lucina, "and for a poor unknown creature whose very birth is tainted!"
                     She shuddered violently.
                  "Hush, my child! God is no respecter of persons. Were there a stain upon thy
                     birth darker than the skin of poor old Hepsy, I would still take' thee to my
                     heart, and call thee daughter. Unnatural must that mother be who could have
                     deserted thee, and deserving of God's anger."
                  "I cannot bear to hear even that," said Lucina, "so much have I longed to see
                     and know her. Many a night have I waked up and wept with anguish because I
                     could not feel a mother's kiss. Oh, no! she may not be unnatural. Perhaps she
                     is unfortunate—perhaps I have no mother!"
                  "Then be to me from henceforth as a daughter," said Mabel, with her own
                     beautiful smile, and a kindling of her dark eye. "Be to me henceforth as a
                     daughter, and I will be to thee as a mother. Whatever thy—I cannot say
                     master—whatever my poor mistaken brother commands thee to do, obey him for a
                     while—my time and God's time will come, never thee fear."
                  "May I have Lucina a few moments, aunt?" asked Amy, putting her face in at the
                     door. "Phillis has gone on an errand, and we are all dressing for the
                     convention."
                  "Certainly, dear," said Mabel. "Go, friend."
                  The slave-girl followed Amy into her dressing-room. The girls were in high
                     glee. A painting stood on an easel, and they were admiring it as she
                     entered.
                  
                  "You must have that down in the parlors, Amy, when, you give your great party,"
                     said Maggie, admiringly.
                  "I mean to," replied Amy, submitting herself to Lucina to have her hair
                     dressed. "Don't attempt to move it. Hat, let me sit and look at it. That's an
                     admirable light."
                  It was a cottage scene. Hattie Goldsmith excelled in figures, and the
                     expression on every face was life-like. The father sat at his cottage door with
                     a flagon in his hand, one knee occupied by a frolicsome child. The mother
                     watched her babe at play; one other child, a boy, was coaxing his canary to
                     sing, another led a pet lamb, and still another roguish face peeped down
                     through the interlacing boughs of an apple-tree. Through the golden distance a
                     hay-cart was seen heaped high with its odorous burden, and the rays of the
                     setting sun lingered on the cottage-roof, kissed the yellow locks of the
                     children, brightened the quaint cap of the mother, and the flowers, the hedges,
                     and the apple-tree with a radiance that made the scene enchanting.
                  "Who do you think the principal figure looks like?" asked the mischievous
                     Maggie. "I was waiting to see if you discerned it."
                  "Why, not at all like Hollister," said Amy, gravely.
                  "Of course not," Hattie exclaimed, "nor anybody else."
                  "Yes it does; it's the image of Marshall Randolph—the express image of him. See
                     Hat's blush! Oh, no, it isn't Hollister; Marshall is good-looking, but
                     Hollister is positively splendid; pity he's a nigger."
                  If she had looked, she might have seen that Amy Kenneth's cheeks matched her
                     cousin's.
                  "By the way, Amy, what is that story they tell about the Hatch woods off here?
                     Phillis gave me a glowing description of ghosts, hobgoblins, unearthly noises,
                     sights and so forth; declared she had heard something herself. Only think,
                     girls, of her hearing something!"
                  "Their stories!" said Amy Kenneth. "There has always been a rumor about that
                     piece of woods; father has forbidden mother and I to go near it; I don't know
                     why, I'm sure. I believe he said that runaway negroes hid there sometimes, and
                     were dangerous. I think he's inclined to encourage the ghost stories among the
                     negroes, at any rate."
                  "Well, he hasn't forbidden me," said Maggie, with a spirited look, "and if I
                     thought there was a bonâ fide ghost on the
                     premises, I'd explore it to-morrow. Let's ride there sometime, Hat; you take
                     Postboy, and I'll have Spitfire."
                  Amy looked up incredulously.
                  "No one on this place has ever dared to mount Spitfire," she said.
                  "Well, I dare. I've ridden a, wild colt and come off with whole bones, and I'm
                     not afraid of any horse living. I'd just as licf mount Spitfire as not."
                  "You couldn't," said Amy, quietly.
                  "Couldn't!" exclaimed Maggie, with a flashing eye; "see if I don't try,
                     sometime."
                  "Who is that, Luce?" asked Amy, as Lucina was placing the last pin in her
                     hair.
                  She went to the window, and returned with an ashen cheek, saying that it was
                     Mr. Randolph, Mr. Baker and Mr. Van Broek; they were just dismounting.
                  
                  "Dear me, what a high-flown darky you are!" exclaimed Amy,
                     contemptuously—"'dismounting!" If I took you in hand, I'd soon break you of
                     that nonsense."
               
               
                  PART II.
                  LUCINA PROTECTED BY MRS. KENNETH.
                  Lucina did not reply. She had learned that patient endurance is better than
                     sullen indifference. She had got through with her work, answered Amy's
                     insulting questions with perfect composure, put by the articles of the toilet,
                     and was dismissed. As she left the room of her imperious young mistress, she
                     caught a glimpse of Mrs. Kenneth, who had been apparently watching some person
                     from the head of the staircase. Her mistress seemed agitated, but passed
                     immediately into her own room; her soft white robes fluttering a moment ere the
                     door closed upon them. Lucina paused also at the head of the stairs. Dole Baker
                     stood immediately fronting the staircase, whipping his polished boots with a
                     delicate a cane. Van Broek and Marshall were talking together, and the dandy
                     taking a deliberate survey. She shrank back again just as Amy Kenneth opened
                     the door of her room.
                  "Listener!" exclaimed the young mistress, her eye flashing with temper—" a
                     pretty piece of business, that our slaves must put their ears to the key-holes.
                     You ought
                        MRS. KENNETH.
                     
                      to have a sound flogging for that
                     piece of impertinence."
                  "I was not listening," replied Lucina.
                  "You know better!" pouted Amy, whose dislike of the poor girl grew day by
                     day—"you know you are a listener, and a great deal worse than that—a"—
                  "Amy!" said her mother, in a tone of rebuke, appearing again—" Lucina, I want
                     you."
                  The girl glided like a shadow into Mrs. Kenneth's room. Her mistress stood
                     before her. It seemed as if some secret care was wearing her life away. The
                     cheeks that had been thin before, were now hollow; the eyes cavernous, and
                     encircled by blue, livid marks; the lips were white. All this Lucina
                     comprehended, while she stood there the second preceding her half-whispered
                     command.
                  "Go down the back stairs, leading from my room, and you can find your way into
                     the parlor without being seen."
                  Lucina obeyed her, grateful that she comprehended her dread, and saved her from
                     humiliation. The thought of Dole Baker filled her with terror and disgust. In
                     his large, lack-lustre eyes of a dead black, she had plainly read the
                     libertine. His sensual face; inspired her with a horror, compared to which the
                     dark dread of bondage was pleasant to contemplate. She also felt a secret
                     presentiment that this effeminate slave-owner was watching for her, as well as
                     an intuitive knowledge that it was all settled between him and Lawyer
                     Kenneth.
                  Quietly and cautiously she stole to the room of Mabel. The Quakeress had
                     learned to know that step, light and
                     crouching, as if spelled by fear. She greeted the young girl, who had become
                     very necessary to her happiness, with one of her own gentle smiles. At that
                     moment Harry came in to talk of a convention about to be held in Haggiston.
                     Lucina, as usual, withdrew into a recess formed by one of the large bay
                     windows, and quietly pursued her work, listening to the conversation of those
                     she felt were friends.
                  
                  "What a noble specimen of Southern manhood Marshall Randolph is!" said Harry,
                     drawing his chair near his mother. "He has the delicacy and refinement of a
                     perfect gentleman, and the impulsive spirit of a reformer. At heart, I believe
                     he abominates slavery. I wish you could attend a meeting about to be held in
                     town; he thinks he shall say something on the subject, there, that will make
                     the old fogies shake in their shoes."
                  "He has a full knowledge of his own abilities, then," said Mabel smiling.
                  Oh! I do assure you, mother mine, there's no self-conceit or egotism about
                     Marshall Randolph. I shouldn't wonder if he makes good his declaration, and
                     launches his first thunderbolt at the sin of his country in this manner. His
                     old father will be tremendously angry, perhaps disown him; but he is willing to
                     risk the consequences."
                  "Thee must bring him here, Harry; I should like of all things to be acquainted
                     with him. Thee knows that my room is free of access to all thee calls thy
                     friends. But has thee had letters from home?"
                  "Yes," replied Harry, "business flourishing, and my partner says I need not
                     trouble myself, nor hurry home; indeed he advises me to stay longer than I
                     intended. Jacobs is a strong, healthy fellow, and in the store is in his
                     element; while I confess to a love for a lounging-place, and plenty of books
                     and papers."
                  "Thee has thy father's tastes," said Mabel, tears gathering in her dark eyes,
                     while she gazed beyond with a yearning tenderness that seemed to hold communion
                     with the dear departed.
                  "Two, by my watch!" exclaimed Harry, springing up; "I expect the girls are
                     ready, and waiting. Good bye, mother. If I can, I'll bring young Randolph here
                     this evening; Dole Baker, a rich young scamp, dogs us for the present. I rather
                     guess there's some trade going on between him and Uncle Everard. If he
                     continues with us, I shan't ask Marshall, for I couldn't, you know, without
                     inviting this Dole Baker, and I cannot so degrade myself as to ask him to come
                     near you. Good bye, dear mother!" he added, kissing her hand gallantly. "You
                     see I am already getting to be quite a Southerner for chivalry."
                  He was gone; his pleasant voice sounded along the hall. The clattering of hoofs
                     sent Lucina away from the window. She dreaded death less than a sight of Dole
                     Baker's handsome, but voluptuous face. She sat down with her accustomed sadness
                     clouding her face, at the side of Mabel.
                  "Now some good book, my dear child. We shall be alone, I trust, the whole
                     afternoon. They are all going to the meeting."
                  Lucina forgot her trouble for the time in the sweet solace of reading.
               
               
                  
                  PART III.
                  MARSHALL AND THE DEACONS.
                  Meanwhile Maggie and Hattie were on the road to the town. Once within its
                     limits, an endless succession of gay sights demanded their attention. The
                     streets were filled with equipages, the walks with ladies richly attired, and
                     men of sleek and portly aspect. The black nurses in charge of their young
                     masters and mistresses, hurried hither and thither with babes in their arms, or
                     in wicker baskets, or wooden and elegant wheeled coaches, curiously tricked
                     out, and adorned with silks and laces.
                  A universal buzz pervaded the place, and hundreds were wending their way to the
                     large meeting-house at the top of a hilly street.
                  Harry's party drove slowly. It was composed of Amy, Maggie, and himself. The
                     carriage that followed was extremely elegant; in fact the most recherché establishment on the road. Hattie and
                     Miss Lufburrow, the latter in a hat of ungainly dimensions, and Marshall
                     Randolph, to whom this splendid turnout belonged, fitted its silk-covered seats
                     admirably. All eyes were attracted towards the beautiful greys (or it might
                     have been Miss Lufburrow's head-gear)—which, seemingly without effort, drew
                     their burden up the toilsome street.
                  The church was nearly filled when they entered, but the thoughtful Marshall had
                     caused some seats to be reserved for the company that now moved up the
                     aisle.
                  It was a noble body of men met for a religious purpose. The aristocratic
                     citizens looked their best. Young and old—the silvered head and the flaxen
                     locks—ranged in long semi-circular rows from side to side of the spacious
                     edifice. The galleries were filled with blacks, some of them in decent bonnets
                     and neat attire, but the majority wore the famous flaming-colored head-gear.
                     Black, olive, yellow, and white, the slaves presented a motley appearance;
                     their eyes, brilliant jets, set in ebony, their teeth white and glistening,
                     they laughed and chatted, and rolled their large orbs from the centre of the
                     church to its circumference.
                  On the platform sat the ministerial delegates, grave and dignified men, looking
                     clerical and sober, as became their cloth.
                  Between the platform and the choir, the gay, soft colors of the ladies'
                     bonnets, their bright, rich shawls and costly laces, formed a varied and
                     flower-like parterre. Marshall had piloted his company to a seat, but was
                     obliged to leave them, as there was not room for him, and the rest of the pew
                     was filled with ladies.
                  He found a place a few slips ahead, and almost exactly in the centre of the
                     church. Harry sat quite near, with Amy and Maggie. The latter, in her volatile,
                     characteristic manner, had begun to make criticisms on several country ladies
                     who were near her.
                  These were by no means ill-natured, only thoughtless, and Harry, who often
                     looked towards the brilliant, mischievous face, said to himself, "If only she
                     were like my mother in spirit, and
                     not a slave-holder, what a charming girl she would be!"
                  The meeting had commenced. A prayer was offered, a hymn sung, and business
                     opened. Many dry speeches were made, many resolutions passed, touching certain
                     religious operations, and the usual etceteras of a body met for the amicable
                     adjustment of matters of importance, and the general good will of the
                     Christians of different parts of the country, were accomplished. A member was
                     on the floor, urging something with regard to fraternizing with some more
                     Northern society.
                  "Amy," whispered Maggie, "do look at Randolph! He seems as if he was longing to
                     pounce upon somebody."
                  Amy glanced towards the seat occupied by the young man. He did, indeed, appear
                     earnestly defiant. He had clutched the moulding of the pew so tightly, that the
                     cords stood out along his hand. His face was pale, but determined; his eyes
                     resolute and almost hard in their stern light. He had brushed up the locks on
                     his fine brow until they fell curling carelessly in thick masses over his
                     temples. Hattie, too, was gazing admiringly, and all were astonished to see him
                     on the floor almost before the delegate had taken his seat.
                  "Mr. President!" the voice was clear and sonorous. The dark eyes had grown
                     luminous with feeling, and threw off electric sparks as he gave utterance to
                     the words he had chosen.
                  All was silence. Many noticed that his look was pecu- liar, and leaned forward
                     to hear their young townsman, who had been so long absent.
                  "Mr. President: I have arisen in this assemby to ask for the exercise of
                     justice towards this church, and towards the religion of Jesus Christ."
                  Profound silence reigned, broken only by his clear, loud voice, that reached to
                     every part of the edifice. The ministers on the stand began to look more
                     earnestly upon this noble young man, who seemed by his manner to have some
                     great issue at stake. He continued:
                  "I call for action to be taken upon the conduct of two members of this church;
                     members in office, of high standing in, the community, but who, nevertheless,
                     have been guilty of a most high-handed and unchristian outrage upon their
                     fellow beings."
                  The interest was now painfully intense. None knew what might come next. Men
                     looked at each other in open-mouthed wonder.
                  "Two days ago," he continued, "I saw a slave-sale in this town. That is
                     probably a common sight. Slaves are doubtless often sold by our good, Christian
                     people. But, my brothers, an unhappy woman lay in frightful convulsions,
                     foaming at the mouth at prospect of separation from her husband. When the sale
                     was effected, I was struck with horror to see upon the auction block, making
                     transfer of these two immortal beings, Deacon Penninton and Deacon Roebuck,
                     members and officers of this Christian body. I submit that these two men be
                     excluded from this church, for inhumanity and unchristian conduct."
                  
                  Long before he had ceased speaking, the whole area of the church seemed swaying
                     with excitement. Terrible was the confusion that ensued. The congregation rose
                        en masse. Faces scowling with rage were
                     turned towards the unflinching Randolph. Gleaming teeth and hissing voices,
                     united in execrating him. Women cried out, and some fainted away. Those men who
                     occupied the body of the house were with furious gesticulations making their
                     way toward him to annihilate him. The two deacons seemed paralyzed with
                     virtuous (?) anger. The negroes, following the example below, began shouting to
                     each other in the gallery, and had it not been for the courage and presence of
                     mind of the pastor of the church alluded to, who instantly descended from the
                     pulpit and forced himself through the crowd toward Marshall, covering him and
                     demanding "order!" with uplifted hands, undoubtedly another outrage had been
                     committed.
                  Meanwhile, a few friends were reasoning with the young man, whose face seemed
                     god-like in its expression. He felt that he had taken a stand for liberty; that
                     he had cried "woe! woe!" to the oppressor. Though he had incurred the hate of
                     the two infuriated deacons, and the ill-will of the whole church, yet he felt
                     calm and strong in the might of HIM whose cause he had espoused.
                  Harry found himself by the side of Hattie Goldsmith, in the confusion outside.
                     Everybody was talking, condemning, arguing, wondering.
                  "Wasn't it grand?" asked Hattie, her face lighted up so that she looked almost
                     beautiful.
                  "What?" queried Harry, smilingly.
                  "Oh, the manner! the expression! the courage! the attitude! the something in
                     his countenance so beyond description! so lofty!" she paused, blushing,
                     conscious that she might have carried her enthusiasm too far, expressed her
                     sentiments too freely. But Harry thought with her, and said so, adding this
                     question:
                  "And what of the subject matter, Miss Hattie? You are a slave-holder, I
                     believe."
                  "But not a slave dealer!" exclaimed Hattie, indignantly. "Slaves were left me
                     on my father's death, and I happen to have a good Christian agent, who takes
                     the whole charge of the plantation. He is so humane that possibly I do not
                     profit as I might by my slaves, but I prefer to make less money and keep all
                     the poor creatures together. I have had many a good offer—but, as I told you, I
                     am not a slave seller; and I try to do my duty by them all."
                  Harry replied nothing, but looked his admiration of the face so lighted up by
                     the sweetest sentiments of humanity, that it seemed lovely with its bright,
                     glorious eyes.
                  "Marshall Randolph," he said, as if speaking to himself, "is a hero."
                  "He's a fool!" said Amy, coming up at that moment, and overhearing his
                     remark.
                  "Possibly, in your eyes," said Harry, gravely; he could not help it.
                  "If he spoke of me in the way he did of Deacon Penninton, and I had been a man,
                     I'd have shot him on the spot!", cried Amy, her lips quivering violently, and
                     losing all com- mand of her temper.
                     "Such men as that would cause us all to be murdered in our beds; he ought to be
                     hung!"
                  "I know a worse punishment than that," said Maggie, laughing.
                  "Well, what?" Amy had leaped into the carriage without deigning to accept
                     aid.
                  "Marry him, and torment him," said Maggie.
                  "I would thank you not to insult me," said Amy, her eyes ablaze.
                  Maggie's cheeks flushed hotly, but she did not reply.
                  "Unfortunate girl!" thought Harry, "she has inherited her father's temper, and
                     is as much to be pitied as blamed."
                  The news of Marshall Randolph's heretical sentiments spread like wildfire. Men
                     were everywhere talking about "the hot-headed fool," as they called him. At
                     street corners, in hotel bars, on church steps, in stores, counting-houses,
                     ware-rooms, at the railroad depot, at the tea table, in the lecture-room—in all
                     manner of places his name resounded. Not with praise. Much as he had been
                     respected before, his boldness in condemning the institution upon which their
                     wealth was supposed to depend, had made every man, and almost every woman, his
                     enemy. Beside, it had raised up hosts of friends for "the poor, persecuted
                     deacons." Men who had no sympathy for the traffic, who would have looked on the
                     sale with almost the same abhorrence as did Marshall and his friend, were very
                     zealous now for the honor of the deacons and their church. It had been with
                     them, they reasoned, a pressing necessity. A man had a right to sell his house
                     if he were poor, or his horse, why not an equal right to part with his
                     "property" in any form? It was a black and scandalous deed, and Marshall
                     Randolph would no longer command that respect which had hitherto been accorded
                     to him. He had stepped beyond the proper limits of his authority; he had
                     meddled in that with which he had no business; he had injured the character of
                     two worthy citizens; he had not minded his own business; he deserved to be read
                     out of the church—out of the community; he should by right have the countenance
                     of no man.
                  The wonder ran high to know how the old General might bear the intelligence.
                     Everybody watched his red old face wherever he appeared; but whatever he was to
                     Marshall, he was stolid and unchanged in society. Men knew better than to
                     question him, or even to hint at the step his son had taken. He was a
                     frolicsome, hilarious old gentleman enough when not interfered with, but ready
                     to construe anything short of extreme civility into an insult, and when his
                     anger was roused, he was like a tiger, hardly to be appeased except with blood.
                     He had twice killed his man in two separate duels, and wounded as many more. He
                     himself bore a pistol wound in his thigh that still caused him no little
                     trouble. "Keep on the right side of old Randolph if you want to keep out of the
                     clutches of the devil," was the saying of his neighbors.
                  Whatever his punishment might be, Marshall bore it remarkably well. He abated
                     not a whit of his manly deportment, did not lower his brow at scowling looks,
                     or suppress his conscious smile at the condescending notice of those who felt
                     themselves aggrieved. He rode over the estate every day, superintending the people who were dependent upon his
                     father; he passed his evenings frequently with Harry and Mabel, nor did his
                     eyes sparkle less brilliantly when Hattie Goldsmith happened to form one of the
                     little company. He saw, admired and pitied Lucina, and looked with reverence
                     upon the beautiful Mabel, to whose face and ethereal figure the destroyer lent
                     strange charms.
                  The very slaves had heard of master Randolph's speech, and discussed it among
                     themselves. Aunt Esty gravely told her son that she hoped he would not
                     countenance such doings among white folks.
                  "Whatever 'pinion you has about it, Lascus, boy, keep it to you se'f," she
                     said, "case it don't do for niggers to talk of what dar massas does or
                     says—'case you see dey has de power, and dey is mostly 'gin mars' Randolph for
                     what he done said—and de biggest part of 'em is what dey calls de marjoram; so
                     niggers must always side wid de marjoram 'cause dey's de strongest power, an'
                     de strongest power can always sell dar slaves down Souf. So, boy, if you don't
                     want to leave your old mammy, what's nussed and tended you, and cuffed an'
                     spanked you to bring you up in de way what niggers ah' white folks mus' go,
                     jus' you be particler and don't 'dorse what mars' Randolph say—'cause proberly
                     he was decited same's your old ma is when she shout glory down to camp meetin',
                     and don't know wedder she's on she head or heels."
                  Alascus listened with becoming gravity except when her head was turned to
                     indulge himself with a pantomimic shuffle from the juba, but as she brought her
                     placid face to bear upon him again, he bent industriously over the saddle he
                     was inspecting, declaring that "mars' Kenneth and Spitfire was de very debbil
                     on de gearing."
                  Old Hepsy heard of it, and her African blood danced in her veins. Seizing her
                     cane, away she marched to Hollister's cabin, her eyes bright with a vengeful
                     joy.
                  "Did you hear it, boy?" she cried, almost before she saw him. "Glory to de Lord
                     God of Hosts! De minister he got it, an' de deacons dey got it, an' de debbil
                     he ran off wid his tail in a snarl, an' he horns spittin' fire. Hy! he neber
                     forgiv' young mar's Randolph trying to upset he kingdom in de meeting-house.
                     Oh, hallelujah!"
                  "Take care," said Hollister, in a low, vexed voice; "master Kenneth is about
                     here somewhere."
                  "Hopes he hasn't got sore ears, then," cried old Hepsy, chuckling, "'cause
                     blisters draws mighty hard, 'specially when dar made o' hell-fire, same's de
                     Bible say of de tongue. Da' Randolph mighty fine young man, anyway—da's
                     so—'deed he is, honey—mighty fine young man, and wishes I'd nursed him—I do so.
                     Oh, good Lor'! to tink how he make de minister, de deacon, an' de debbil dance!
                     Oh, good Lor'!" and she laughed heartily, accompanying with her wild African
                     motions.
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIV.
               IN FIVE PARTS.
               
                  PART I.
                  IN WHICH FRED KEENE DISCLOSES TO HIS HALF BROTHER, HOLLISTER, A
                     DREAD SECRET.
                  
                     
                        
                           "There was a laughing devil in his sneer,
                           That caused emotions both of love and fear,
                           And where his frown of hatred darkly fell,
                           Hope, withering, fled, and Mercy sighed farewell."
                        
                     
                  
                  THE sun had set, and the fair fields were yet red with the beams of its
                     departed glory. The slaves had done their work in field and house, and sat in
                     their huts, many of them pictures of degraded contentment. Soon from the
                     windows of Washington Grange, the red lights began to twinkle. The girls were
                     busy in their room, getting up a programme of amusements for the coming party.
                     Mrs. Kenneth sat in her private drawing-room, wearily writing. Ever and anon
                     she would look toward the door, and seemed ready, at a moment's notice, to
                     thrust the sheet over which her pen glided into the desk. Lawyer Kenneth sat in
                     his own voluptuously furnished chamber, half hidden by the smoke that curled
                     whitely from his amber pipe. Beside him stood a small table, covered with
                     wine-bottles and decanters.
                  Months had glided away since one of his fearful spasms of drunkenness had come
                     upon him. He had kept that remorseless appetite somewhat within bounds, under
                     the restraint imposed upon him by the usual summer sojourn of company. But now
                     he drank recklessly. His servant stood near, motionless and respectful, and
                     filled the emptied glass as often as desired, first from one bottle, then from
                     another. One sure symptom of Lawyer Kenneth's coming hallucination was singing.
                     He never sang unless crazy with passion or drink. It was then a shocking sound
                     to hear—a low, fierce, wild strain—a refrain from some negro melody, or some
                     old, time-honored tune, that contrasted strangely, painfully, with the
                     soul-chilling blasphemy that generally followed. His face was white and
                     haggard, his brow contracted, his eyes glittered like steel, his thin lips were
                     glued strongly to the pipe, and he seemed to suck in the smoke with every
                     hollow contraction of his cheeks. To-night he had ordered five different kinds
                     of wine; he had drained the fourth glassful, when looking, he perceived that
                     his servant had forgotten or neglected to provide the port that was his
                     favorite. Instantly his face changed; his eyes glared, and taking his pipe from
                     his lips, he turned slowly round till he faced his slave; then, in a low,
                     fierce voice, keeping time with his feet, he began: 
                        
                           "If I had as much sense
                           As would balance the straw—
                           I'd choose the one I want,
                           From the picture I would draw."
                        
                     
                  
                  
                  The poor slave trembled from head to foot; he well remembered that mood.
                  "What shall I get, mars' Kenneth?" he asked, striving to turn from those two
                     wild eyes.
                  "Fellow!—slave!—devil!" hissed Lawyer Kenneth from between his set teeth,
                     pressing one finger into the palm of his left hand; "drown you in the lowest
                     depths of perdition! you hell-bound rapscallion!" and he ground his teeth. "Oh!
                     for something to shoot this devil through the heart!" Then he sung, or rather
                     hissed, making head and foot go: 
                        
                           "Dearest, I love thee—
                           List to my prayer!"
                        
                     
                  
                  "Hound!—do you see?" and he pointed to the table.
                  "What, massa?" groaned the terrified negro.
                  Lawyer Kenneth turned paler; his very lips whitened, as giving utterance to a
                     fearful oath, he pressed his teeth together, shook his head impatiently, and
                     again pointing to the table, called God to witness that he would murder the
                     slave outright if he did not instantly perceive the want.
                  The servant ran a hasty glance over the bottles, but he was incapacitated from
                     fright, and did not understand what was missing.
                  "Oh! hell, hell!" cried his master, writhing in his seat like a man suffering
                     the extremest torture; then entirely changing his expression, while a ghastly
                     and demon-like smile broke over his face, he began again:
                        
                           "Good morning Mr. Raccoon,
                           How do you do?
                           I'm very well, my kind sir,
                           And how are you?
                           Raccoon on the rail—
                           Raccoon on the rail!"
                        
                     
                  
                  "Look here," he cried, suddenly springing to his feet, as the negro crouched
                     away—"by all the furies in hell, I'll split your skull open if you don't bring
                     me the wine I want, you black scoundrel; and if ever you forget it again, mark
                     me, now!" he added, with a ferocity that cannot be described, with a volley of
                     oaths that cannot be repeated—"just look in my eyes and see that I'm in
                     earnest—I'll sell you down South, with directions to burn you alive, scourge
                     you alive—kill you by slow torture as soon as you get there. Now, nigger, bring
                     on my port!"
                  The poor frightened creature, who had turned almost pale, hastily did as he was
                     bidden, and with one savage glare at him, Lawyer Kenneth swallowed the wine he
                     had ordered.
                  Hollister was at that moment sauntering toward the house. Fred Keene overtook
                     him before he entered.
                  "Look here! have you heard what Randolph has been about?" asked the latter,
                     slapping him lightly upon the shoulder."
                  "Yes!" Hollister moodily replied.
                  "What's the matter with you?" asked Keene, stepping back a little and surveying
                     his brother.
                  "Oh. I'm out of sorts!" replied Hollister. "I'm hopeless; do you know what that
                     means?"
                  
                  "I have known!" muttered Keene.
                  "Yes, hopeless, dispirited—and something in here keeps calling to me to be a
                     man—to revenge myself!" he said, striking his heart.
                  "Revenge yourself! for what?" asked Keene.
                  "For being made a slave and subject to the caprices of this madman, whom they
                     call my master," replied Hollister, with forced calmness. "Why should I be this
                     man's property? In all but education, I am his superior—yet, because I was born
                     of a woman bought with old Hollister's money, I am doomed to wear my life out
                     as his drudge, less respected than the dumb cattle of the field."
                  "Bravo! Hollister—come to your quarters, and I will tell you a story—but first,
                     is Kenneth threatened with his periodical insanity?"
                  "Yes, from all I see, I think he is; he swore he would sell me to-day."
                  "Sell you! ha, ha! by all that's good, let him try it! I wonder what he could
                     do without you? No, make yourself easy; you earn him too much money."
                  "Earn him money; yes, that's it;" muttered Hollister.
                  "That's where the shoe pinches, is it? You'd rather be earning the money for
                     yourself. Well, I don't blame you. Amy poor devil with a spice of manhood in
                     him would say the same thing. I haven't been giving you lessons for nothing,
                     Hollister," said Keene, significantly. "How does her ladyship treat you
                     now?"
                  "You mean Amy?" said Hollister, interrogatively, while the blood surged from
                     his heart to his temples and back again.
                  "I do mean her—Miss Amy;—be more respectful, sir."
                  Hollister was nervously fingering the cheek that her hand had
                     struck. In the dimness of the twilight Keene saw the action, and smiled to
                     himself.
                  "Hollister!" said Keene, straightening himself, "my mother was a
                     woman possessing beauty, fortune, education, all the graces of body and
                     intellect. Her father married a slave, and dying left all his money to his only
                     child. Oh, my brother! it fevers my brain to think that through some clause—the
                     will was disputed, and my mother reduced to slavery! I dare not tell you what I
                     have heard about it; it would make me mad to repeat it. No matter—God be
                     thanked, she did not live many years after old Hollister bought her; and I
                        have heard it whispered"—he brought his teeth together—"that
                     her death was a violent one. Never mind," he added, after a pause, "we shall
                     all be righted some day. What I was driving at was this, my mother was as good
                     as Amy Kenneth—so was yours—but how have they treated her?"
                  They now entered the shop, and from thence Keene followed his brother up stairs
                     into the room where the latter ate and slept. It was neatly kept; the pine
                     floor white, the little stove polished, the cooking utensils clean and shining.
                     A wide box, covered like a lounge, stood in the corner; it was full of books.
                     Hollister lit a candle, and applying a match to the prepared kindlings in the
                     stove, the fire was soon roaring, and the little kettle hissing and
                     spluttering.
                  
                  "Stay, and take tea with me," said Hollister, bringing a loaf from a tiny
                     pantry, and cutting it in slices.
                  "So that is what you are up to?" replied Keene; "well, come; I"ll spend the
                     evening with you."
                  "Good!" said Hollister, bringing some slices of ham toward the stove, and
                     placing them on the pan he had made ready to receive them. "I'm a fine cook—and
                     as for tea—you'll say there isn't my equal for making it, when you have tasted
                     it."
                  "But look here, Hollister, how do you come by all these luxuries?" asked
                     Keene.
                  "Oh, my master considerately gives me a little bit of my own body
                     for a few hours at a time," said Hollister, with nervous sarcasm. "With this
                     liberty of myself, I earn a little sum, enough to pay Aunt Esty for what
                     perquisites she keeps for sale; and so you see I get them. Come, sit up and
                     take a sociable cup of tea."
                  "Hollister! you—you—are very well off, for—for" he hesitated.
                  "'For a slave!" I suppose you would say. Well, yes—so I am.
                     Ordinarily, I am treated with some consideration by my owner," replied
                     Hollister, "and till within a very few years, my master's daughter condescended
                     to treat me—well—as slaves are not often treated," he added, watching with some
                     interest the changes in Keene's expressive face.
                  "All owing to me," said Fred Keene, sententiously.
                  "To you?"
                  "To be sure; to me. Why do you stare so?"
                  "I don't understand you," said Hollister, amazedly.
                  "Oh, never mind, if you don't now—you shall soon—I promise you."
               
               
                  PART II.
                  THE WHITE SLAVE'S FURY.
                  "You were saying, as we came in, that our mother, it is suspected, died by
                     violence—were you not?" asked Hollister, as they sat together after supper.
                  "I said my mother," replied Keene, with strong emphasis.
                  Hollister looked at him with along blank stare.
                  "Come, get out your books, and we'll have a tilt at mathematics," Keene added
                     impatiently.
                  "Keene, what do you mean?"
                  "Don't stir my memory, Hollister; let the dead bury the dead."
                  "You did not say our mother?" interrogated
                     Hollister.
                  "I said MY mother!" repeated the other.
                  "Are we not brothers, then?" asked Hollister, a shade of disappointment passing
                     over his features.
                  "Yes, by the same father—not by the same mother."
                  "And what of my mother?" asked Hollister, half rising from his
                     seat in his great and sudden anxiety.
                  "Don't be too curious, Hollister," replied the other.
                  "Curious! how can you Keene? When for years I have loved her, unknown and dead
                     though she be."
                  
                  "Dead to you," muttered Keene.
                  Hollister almost gasped for breath, as he sat down again, looking straight and
                     helplessly toward his brother. On a sudden his face lighted all over, as he
                     half cried in a piercing voice; "Keene!—tell me—is my own mother
                     living?—anywhere—anywhere in this wide world?"
                  "Yes, she is living!" replied Keene quietly, though he cast a
                     pitying glance toward the young man. Hollister had grown somewhat pale and
                     changed. The answer seemed to overwhelm him. Tears rushed to his eyes; he laid
                     his head heavily upon his clasped arms over the edge of the table, and
                     sobbed.
                  "Come, come—Hollister! come, come, man!"
                  "And you have kept it from me all these many years;" said the young man,
                     reproachfully, "Oh, how could you, Keene!"
                  "Simply because I knew the knowledge would harass you;—perhaps drive you
                     desperate," replied Keene.
                  "Keene, there is something fearful in your words!" exclaimed Hollister, rousing
                     himself; "you have always talked in enigmas, as if I were a child. I claim your
                     confidence and candor, now; come, brother."
                  His appealing look went to the heart of Keene.
                  "If I have talked before in enigmas, it was because I thought the time had not
                     come to talk differently with you. Now—it has. You shall hear about your
                     mother." He sat himself back, and folded his arms over his chest. The
                     flickering light played upon his features, giving them most expressive
                     changes—sometimes throwing a wild whimsical look on the face, then again a deep
                     pervading sadness that softened as he talked.
                  "You see, I was ten years old when my master bought your mother. My own mother
                     had been dead over two. Your mother was a mustafina like yourself, pure white,
                     and very handsome. Where the old man contrived to find women so beautiful and
                     so well educated, I never could tell, but he was a rich old rascal, with good
                     taste and no scruples of conscience. I don't think at first he intended to make
                     her his mistress, as when he bought her his wife was supposed to be dying, and
                     in fact, did die not many months after. She was at first let out in a private
                     capacity, in a family not a great ways from here; and there she formed an
                     attachment with the oldest son of the house. It was found out, she was sent
                     back, and the young fellow to Europe. Well, it's a short story. Mrs. Hollister
                     died; and he, the old reprobate, did as all such devils do, just as they
                     please. The consequence was, that after you were born, she became a raving
                     maniac, and—is so, still."
                  Keene trembled for what he had done. Hollister sprang from his seat. To
                     describe his appearance is impossible; his attitude—his gesture. It was
                     condensed passion breaking into action. It seemed as if every nerve, sinew, and
                     pulse, artery and muscle, were working for vengeance. He uttered one wild cry,
                     his frame relaxed, and he sank back in his seat again.
                  "There, Hollister! now you see what I've done in complying with your wish."
                  
                  "Keene! for heaven's sake, tell me, where is my mother?" Fred
                     started at the altered voice; his reply was in the form of a question.
                  "Hollister, did you ever go through the Hatch woods?"
                  "Yes!"—the young man shuddered violently.
                  "Did you ever hear—see?"——
                  "Oh!" a cry as of sharp pain broke forth from Hollister's lips, now white as
                     ashes—" that—that fearful thing—Fred Keene—cannot—cannot be my—mother?"
                  Keene could not answer; the absolute misery of his half-brother curdled his
                     very blood.
                  "I saw a—no—not a face—what could it be? It was nothing human. There was long,
                     grey and black hair flying out of the window, something that seemed like eyes,
                     but the rest—the rest!" His head sank. When he raised it, it was changed again.
                     "My mother!" he muttered, "mother—mother—there! disfigured—a maniac—oh! that
                     cry!" he put his hands to his ears, and seemed distracted.
                  "Come, Hollister, it can't be helped; it is one of the accursed fruits of
                     slavery; what is left for us, is revenge!"
                  "Revenge!" shouted Hollister, springing from his seat, and lifting his arms
                     heavenward—"yes, revenge, sweet and full!"
                  "How to destroy this system?" said Keene, low, and thoughtfully.
                  "Blood! blood! we can only be regenerated by blood!" cried Hollister, who, from
                     the moment that he heard to what his mother was reduced, was no longer a tame,
                     submissive slave.
                  "Blood!" he muttered again, "blood! blood!"
                  "They deserve the fate," said Keene, who seemed to be talking in snatches to
                     himself.
                  "Deserve it!" cried Hollister, in accents of the utmost scorn, "the dastardly
                     villains! exulting over a woman's ruin—by heaven! I shan't dare to pray
                     to-night; my prayers would be murder! I tremble at the awful images that throng
                     my mind. Am I Hollister? No! I am lifted out of myself; I am not what I was
                     this morning—I am eternal vengeance, thrusting the oppressors of my race into
                     the flames. Ah! ha! burn, white fiends! burn—burn," and he stamped his foot
                     with a vehemence that startled Keene, who thought that the mother's malady was
                     resting on her son.
                  "Hollister!"——
                  "Don't stop me!—I am young—I have faith—hope—a vigorous intellect. My blood
                     boils to enter upon the struggle."
                  "But listen, Hollister! you must possess the government of yourself, if you
                     wish to govern others; believe that, Hollister; remember that—keep
                     yourself."
                  "Yes, yes! but I am furious now; give me time. I tell you I should like to see
                     the whole South in ruins—covered with dead bodies—a great funeral pyre; nothing
                     else will satisfy me. These are awful feelings, I confess, but if you had heard
                     that cry—my mother's terrible cry; oh! how it rings in my ears!"
                  "But what are you—one man—going to do?" asked Keene, alarmed at the tempest he
                     had raised.
                  "Do what has shortened the lives of many men," replied Hollister, briefly, "use
                     cold steel."
                  
                  "Yes, and so would I, if"——
                  "If!" cried Hollister, passionately, "my ifs are all certainties—I'll kill
                     somebody, if I die for it, and die I should."
                  "Come Hollister, you haven't half the wrongs to redress that I
                     have, and see how calmly I am waiting my time," he added, in low, distinct
                     tones.
                  "You?—you are no slave!"
                  "No, but my child, dearer than my own life, is a slave," said
                     Keene, with compressed lips.
                  "How!—born before you were free?"
                  "Ay! born before I was free;" said Keene, moodily. "Yes, I have more work than
                     you to do; I see her in daily danger of becoming—what?" he struck his clenched
                     fist on the table, and his eyes burnt into Hollister's face, so fiery they
                     were. "I don't talk of cold steel, but I
                        wear it!" Lifting his coat, Hollister saw the shining handle of
                     a sheathed dagger.
                  "And Lucina, then, is your child?" queried Hollister, forgetting
                     his own sorrow, for the moment.
                  "I didn't say it," responded Fred Keene, gloomily.
                  "True, there is a likeness; old Hepsy told me to note it."
                  "Yes, old Hepsy could tell you more, but her lips, as well as mine, are sealed.
                     Hollister, the slave-owners, I mean among the men, are pretty bad scoundrels,
                     often, but the slave-owner's daughter, and the slave-holder's wife, sometimes
                     stoop to folly, as well!"
                  "Keene, you have given me a horrible suspicion," said Hollister.
                  "Keep it, then; let it live in your brain till the day of retribution comes.
                     I'll say nothing, so long as they treat my child well, but if there is an
                     attempt made to prostitute her, then the truth must be told, let the shame burn
                     where it will! for if the truth is known, and can be established, as it can, my
                     child is no slave;" and he struck the table with his clenched
                     fist.
                  "Then you stay here on her account?"
                  "Partly; and partly because I can better the condition of the slaves on General
                     Randolph's estate. I have the old tyrant pretty much under my thumb, any way.
                     For years I have stayed here entirely on her account; but when I heard of her
                     whereabouts, I travelled North to see her, determined never to be known. I did
                     see her; though little she dreamed who I was. I carried news from ——, her
                     mother; but, unfortunate that I was! that visit was the means of bringing the
                     poor child into slavery! Never mind—she has defenders now; and one, at least,
                        dare not, for her life, let the girl go."
               
               
                  PART III.
                  HOLLISTER AND KEENE STILL CONFER.
                  Hollister had grown calmer. He sat silently thinking for some moments. His
                     thoughts were gloomy. At length he shook his head, sadly—muttering to himself,
                     "a hard fate."
                  
                  "God knows it is! my poor brother!" said Keene.
                  "Did you?—well, I will ask the question—did you ever know a slave to aspire to
                     the love of his mistress?"
                  Keene looked at the questioner, searchingly, withdrew his gaze, turning a
                     little to one side.
                  "Yes," he replied, "I think I have."
                  "And what happened?"
                  "In one case, although the woman loved him, and she was a planter's beautiful
                     daughter, he was murdered; and murdered by her father!"
                  Hollister shuddered.
                  "Yes; and he was that man's son, too; the girl's brother, of course."
                  "Well?" said Hollister, expectantly.
                  "The other—one other," Fred Keene continued, "was not so unfortunate, in one
                     sense. She met him stealthily; gave him many opportunities; in fact, she was to
                     blame—not be. Those who knew it said so; and he was offered a priceless boon,
                     his liberty, to keep silence. The silence is unbroken yet."
                  "At your enigmatical talk, again."
                  Fred Keene burst into a fit of uncontrollable laughter. Hollister looked
                     wonderingly—almost angrily at him.
                  "It is laughable—I could't help it—to hear us two 'niggers,' as
                        they would call us, talking like schoolmaster. Well, well, we
                        do know something, Hollister; there's some comfort in that.
                     Lawyer Kenneth himself couldn't beat us in the grammatical line. Come, get out
                     your Shakspeare."
                  "I'm in no mood to read Shakspeare to night; I'd rather act him. Say I
                     personate Othello, for instance."
                  "And aspire to Desdemona, alias, Amy
                     Kenneth," said Keene, pleased that he had diverted Hollister's attention from
                     the horrible.
                  "Yes! I am fool enough to love her to madness," responded Hollister.
                  "You use the right word there—you are a fool to love
                        any one," replied Keene, in a moody tone; "but," he added,
                     "Othello killed his wife!"
                  "Don't—don't be putting any more murderous thoughts into my brain; there are
                     too many there now," said Hollister.
                  "Well, then, to change the subject, you have heard, I suppose, that Kenneth
                     intends giving a splendid party on his daughter's birth-day night?"
                  "Yes," Hollister replied.
                  "Let me see—that will come on the 4th of August. I heard the folks talking
                     about it at the house, and there's no end to the parcels I bring them from
                     town; all sorts of finery. They're to have fire-works, and tableaux, and
                     theatrical scenes."
                  "Yes; I'm to make the frame-work for them, I suppose," said Hollister; "that
                     was the order to-day."
                  "Now, if the legal gentleman has his spree by that time, it will be
                     interesting, won't it? I imagine him dancing into the company, singing and
                     swearing."
                  "What are you peering about my room in that way for?"
                  This question was asked by Hollister, on seeing Fred Keene walking about, looking in every corner,
                     examining the closet, sounding the wall.
                  "Your room is small," said Keene, still looking.
                  "It might be smaller," replied Hollister.
                  "Yes, it might; and that is what I was pondering over; whether, in an
                     emergency, it might be made so without running the risk of its being
                     known."
                  "What are you driving at, Fred Keene?"
                  "How would you feel with a runaway slave about your premises?" asked Keene,
                     going up close to his half-brother, and speaking in a whisper.
                  "Not very comfortable, to say the least," replied Hollister.
                  "You are a clever carpenter. Now, by building a partition on this side, where
                     there is no window, a person might be easily secreted. Does Lawyer Kenneth ever
                     come up here?"
                  "He never was here in his life; seldom in the shop," replied Hollister. "I go
                     up to the house to take his orders."
                  "Hem! that's good news," said Keene, thoughtfully. "Now, the question is, could
                     you do it?"
                  "Do what?"
                  "Build a partition in the way I propose," said Keene.
                  "Do it, of course I could; but"——
                  "No buts; remember your degraded position; you, a man capable, if you set your
                     wits at work, of taking charge of a newspaper to-morrow, and leading and
                     guiding instead of being driven like a dumb ox. You say I'm always planning; so
                     I am. For two years I have been in correspon- dence with a white friend at the
                     North, who, when I have sufficient means, will coöperate with me in the
                     establishment of a paper, that shall advocate the principles of freedom. I have
                     already saved, by strict economy, eleven hundred dollars, and when I have made
                     it twelve, I'm going. But, you know, I must work with great caution. It is only
                     by the most careful measures that I keep myself above suspicion. They think
                     here that I am wedded to the South; that I believe my race was doomed from the
                     beginning to bondage; that I hate the North; that, in fact, I am a silent
                     advocate for their system! 'What else,' they reason, 'would keep such a man
                     among us, when by his talents, he might make a fair living anywhere; and even
                     aspire to white society in any other country?" Hollister! I should have gone,
                     years ago, but for my child; that has been the link that has held me to this
                     rotten stake. First, I used worlds of subtlety to find out where she was—then,
                     by a strange providence, she was brought to me. You can never know, until you
                     are a father, what my anguish has been, at times, to see that gentle, lovely
                     creature, doomed, by no fault of hers, to even the six months of slavery that
                     has so far been her lot. Nor could you, unless you were placed in my position,
                     understand with what torture of self I have been near and yet unknown. Well,
                     Hollister, suffice it to say, I intend to free you, and free my child, without
                     appearing to have any agency in the matter. Keep calm, boy, and I'll give you
                     an opportunity to do more with your pen for our poor, down-trodden people, than
                     you could with cold steel. And remember, 'that you are to conquer yourself!
                     Away with this insane passion for Amy
                     Kenneth; you can never marry her; and it would be a poor gratification to ruin
                     her at the expense of your own honor and peace of mind."
                  "She loves me," exclaimed Hollister, warmly; "she loves me! but she is prouder
                     than Lucifer."
                  "Nonsense, Hollister! you make yourself ridiculous; what a dream! why, you are
                     as crazy as"——
                  "Take care, Fred Keene!"
                  "I was going to say 'crazy as a loon'—pardon me—I did not think," said Keene,
                     hastily, seeing the wild, lowering looks of his brother. "It is eight o'clock;
                     by the way, I have a note here to carry to somebody at the house;" he took it
                     from his pocket. "It is for Mrs. Van Broek!" he exclaimed, changing color; "I
                     am to give it to her myself—I shall see her. Ha! I had almost
                     forgotten—Mr. Marshall sent it by Gumbo, and he didn't give me the right
                     message."
                  This he said while getting his hat and going hastily towards the door. He
                     turned once, however, and seeing the dejected position of Hollister, he paused,
                     then retreated a little.
                  "Hollister, I have been a fool for putting you in distress; you might better
                     never have known it."
                  "No, no!" replied the other, wearily lifting his head; "I'm glad I know."
                  "And you don't blame me?" said his brother.
                  "No! no! I blame no one! don't wait on my account—I shall be well enough,
                     soon!"
                  The tall form of Fred Keene disappeared down the stairway.
                  
                  
                     
                        FRED. KEENE.
                     
                  
               
               
                  PART IV.
                  KEENE MEETS HIS CHILD.
                  Hollister was left alone, moodily musing upon what he had heard.
                  "What a fool I was!" he muttered, "not to ask Fred the particulars. 'After I
                     was born she went crazy.' After I was born! The poor creature has then been a
                     maniac for twenty-three long years! Oh, horrible! horrible!" he exclaimed,
                     rising up and walking to and fro. "Had she been a white woman," he
                     continued—"she was a white woman!—had she been a free
                     white woman, with the control of her own body, this dreadful thing would never
                     have happened; and has she been a loved and honored wife, she
                     would never have been thrust into a piece of wild woods, and imprisoned in
                     along cabin, but placed under medical care; then the broken intellect might
                     have been restored. But, no! no! no! no! my poor mother was A SLAVE! a forced
                     sacrifice—ruined! ruined through the devilish passions of my cursed old master.
                     Oh, my God!" he cried, falling on his Knees; "give me but the power to avenge
                     my mother's wrongs! I ask no more! I will live for nothing else—heaven be my
                     witness!"
                  "And you, Amy Kenneth," he continued to mutter, after he had risen and resumed
                     pacing the floor; you are no better than she was; not
                     a whit; not one whit. Why should not your haughty head be bowed?
                     Why should not the white women of
                     the South be made to taste some of the blessed fruits of slavery?
                     Why should the benefits of this glorious institution be all on one
                     side? Away with such black thoughts! they will tempt me to murder!' he cried to
                     himself, stopping abruptly; "but if Amy Kenneth were a slave and
                        I her master—no! no! it is not in me to do a wrong deed—I would
                     fly with her to the uttermost parts of the world, and she should be my wife.
                     Strange! what a spell she has thrown over me! that, in spite of all her
                     cruelty. I can still love her! strange! strange! Yet there is a consciousness
                     in her face whenever I meet her eye; the blood colors her whole cheek; she
                     turns her glance away like lightning. What! love a slave? can it be possible?
                     Yes; I wish I were as sure of my salvation as I am that she does love me," and
                     he smiled a proud smile. Then suddenly some dark thought shadowed his face—and
                     with a cry of "Oh, my mother!" he threw himself upon his narrow bed.
                  Meanwhile, Fred Keene had crossed the long space between the quarters and the
                     house, and was already ascending the back veranda. Two or three chambermaids
                     sat on the steps, enjoying the still beauty of the evening. The far-off music
                     of a sharp-toned violin told that the slaves were solacing themselves with
                     dances. There was no moon. The fire-files flitted among the tree-branches; the
                     stars looked quietly down; a gentle wind stirred the whispering grass. Long ago
                     the lawyer had mounted Spitfire and ridden off; the girls were frolicking in
                     the parlor; Mrs. Van Broek, who had that day been driving, laid weariedly on
                     her lounge chatting with Lucina. Miss Lufburrow was packing her trunk
                     preparatory to an early departure, and had just come down stairs, as Fred Keene
                     presented himself at the door.
                  "Mercy sakes alive on us! who are you?" she cried, recoiling with the dim taper
                     she carried.
                  "I was only going to ring for a servant," said Fred, almost laughing in her
                     small, weird visage.
                  "Oh! you're a white man! Lud! well, I thought it might be some of those black
                     critters; cousin tells me so much about insurrections, and keeping fire-arms
                     near one, and all that sort of thing, that I'm nigh crazed. I ain't going to be
                     murdered in my cold blood, and so I'm going to the blessed North to-morrow. As
                     my brother, the Rev. Joe Lufburrow, of the West, said to me—says he, 'sister, I
                     wouldn't advise you to go anywhere south of Mason and Dixon's
                     line, for the niggers are getting their notions changed about white folks, and
                     are pretty upstartish anyway. And some day,' says my brother, the Rev. Joe
                     Lufburrow, for he used to lecture on slavery and knows all about it, 'some
                     day,' says he, 'they will be for turning about, and consider it fair play,
                     too,' for, says he, 'it's a shame that the blacks should enjoy the monopoly of
                     such blessings, and he always taken care of for nothing, while their white
                     masters work so hard;' and so it is. I'm sure if I was a slave, I should want
                     my master to be as well taken care of as I was. Pray, sir, who did you wish to
                     see?"
                  Fred Keene stood taken all aback by this long and voluble speech. He had never
                     seen Miss Lufburrow, and (doubt-
                     less it would have been greatly to her astonishment if he had said it), never
                     had heard of that great divine and shining orator, the Rev. Joseph Lufburrow.
                     He had, however, the presence of mind to reply that "he had a note for Mrs. Van
                     Broek."
                  "Oh, jest come along, and I'll tell you where she is. There, that's the door of
                     her room. Poor critter! she's in a deep consumption, I'm afeared, and handsome
                     as a picter. To think of laying anybody with such a complexion in the
                     grave!"
                  In answer to Fred Keene's knock, Lucina appeared at the door. The brilliant
                     light within—the sight of her lovely face—the conviction of her nearness to
                     him, blinded and bewildered him, and Lucina, stepping a little back, waited in
                     vain for his message. At last he took the note from his vest-pocket, and handed
                     it to her without comment. She carried it to Mabel, who glanced through it, and
                     said gently, "Who brought this, dear?"
                  "A gentleman who is at the door," replied Lucina.
                  "Ask him to enter, my friend."
                  "Will thee enter?" asked Lucina, who sometimes insensibly adopted the Quaker
                     mode of speech. Fred Keene moved within. His manner was now self-possessed. He
                     looked and acted the perfect gentleman.
                  "Will thee not take a seat, sir? I will soon answer the note," said Mabel, her
                     beautiful, mild eyes scanning his expressive face.
                  The man sat down.
                  "Lucina, love, will thee roll the writing-desk this way?"
                  The man started perceptibly. A flush of glad surprise mantled his brow; his
                     eyes glittered—perhaps with tears. He cast a grateful but bewildered glance
                     toward the slight, lovely form, and almost girlish face of Mabel—his lip
                     quivered. Was this the way they treated his child? Mabel raised
                     herself a little way as she took the pen in her hand. Lucina's eyes were
                     fastened on the face of this man who was so nearly a stranger to her. The face
                     was familiar; where had she seen it before? not recently, since she had been in
                     the South, but a long, long while ago. Again and again she ransacked her memory
                     for the place and time, when suddenly there came before her mind's eye a scene
                     of her school-days. The large sunny room covered with the beautiful green
                     shining paper that she had always so much admired; the bright desks, the happy,
                     animated groups of girls so intent on their studies under the supervision of
                     their beloved teacher. And while they were thus employed, visitors were
                     announced—they entered—two men—Southern gentlemen. The low-browed husband of
                     their teacher introduced them to the school, and Lucina would have taken no
                     more notice, only once, as she happened to raise her head, she saw Mrs. Wells
                     singling her out among the girls, there by making her an object of particular
                     observation. Then it flashed over heart and brain, that coming from the South
                     this man might bring intelligence from her mother—might unravel the mystery
                     that seemed to enveil her, and all the romantic imaginings that night and
                     contemplation had made familiar to her, assailed her active, fancy. He did
                        come toward her, but he did not
                     say, "I bring you news from your mother."
                  She remembered, now, the peculiar sensation that made her heart throb when
                     those large eyes, so dark, so luminous with feeling, were gazing down into her
                     very soul—that same warmth, and yet dread, pervaded her heart, now as its pulse
                     quickened.
                  It was fully six years since the visit of the Southern gentlemen, so elegant in
                     person and manner, and she could not be mistaken. He was before her now. How
                     was he connected with her destiny? she asked herself; for she felt a strong
                     assurance that it must be so, when she recalled his words on the front veranda.
                     All this passed swiftly through her mind as Mabel penned the few lines she was
                     to send in reply to a kind invitation from Mrs. Randolph, who was yet too
                     feeble to go out.
                  "Will thee give this to thy friend?" she said, with her sweet smile.
                  He arose to take the note; his hand trembled, so much was he overcome with his
                     newly aroused gratitude; he merely bowed in answer to her pleasant words, cast
                     another look toward Lucina, and left the room.
                  "A pleasant gentleman, truly," said Mabel.
                  "Would you think him a slave?" asked Lucina.
                  "A slave!" Mabel smiled incredulously.
                  "He has been, although now free," said Lucina.
                  "And who is he, pray?" asked Mabel, her face betraying her astonishment.
                  "His name is Keene; he is General Randolph's agent and head manager; a very
                     capable and worthy man, they say," Lucina replied.
                  "Keene? I never heard of him. Oh, yes, I remember; Harry was speaking of him—of
                     his having been held in bondage, as thee was saying."
                  The two were silent for some moments. Ever and anon a burst of merriment issued
                     from the front parlor; the girls were enjoying themselves vastly.
                  Presently, Maggie and Amy came in. Lucina drew back as far from sight as
                     possible. They were in high spirits, planning for the party.
                  "Your taste is good, Aunt Mabel; pray do tell us what tableaux would be
                     pretty," asked Amy, all smiles and graciousness.
                  It was on the lips of Mabel to say "A slave sale would make an expressive
                     picture," but she forbore.
                  "What has thee thought of?" she asked.
                  "Oh, numberless common things; an Italian flower-girl—America—Pocahontas."
                  "Those would be beautiful," said Mabel.
                  "Yes, but so often acted before, you see; we want something a little out of the
                     common line—something grand and regal, you know;" and the two girls glanced at
                     one another.
                  "There are plenty of kingly scenes thee might copy from Shakspeare," said
                     Mabel.
                  "Or queenly," suggested Maggie.
                  "Yes, but"—Amy hesitated.
                  
                  "Well, there! I can't come at anything in a roundabout way," said Maggie,
                     laughing a little; "the fact is, we heard that you had a splendid set of
                     diamonds."
                  Mabel smiled.
                  "You see," said Maggie, a little confused, and coloring, "Uncle Kenneth has
                     been telling all about you and Governor Van Broek, and how he had wealthy
                     relatives abroad, in England, peers of the realm, and that one of them, a lady
                     Sainter, I believe, sent you a set of diamonds."
                  "All of which is perfectly correct," said Mabel, quietly. "Another sent me a
                     set of pearls."
                  "Oh, pearls and diamonds!" exclaimed Amy, clapping her hands.
                  "Oh, dear Mrs. Van Broek, please put Amy and myself out of our agony by
                     informing us whether you have brought them with you."
                  "I always take them with me," said Mabel; "Harry wishes me to, for fear of
                     house-breakers. They are put up so compactly that they are no trouble to
                     carry."
                  "Only think of it, Amy! shall you and I turn burglars?" cried the merry
                     Mag.
                  "No necessity for that, dear. I will show them to thee."
                  "Oh, no, no! not on my account," said Mag, with a deprecating look; "we should
                     only covet them, and I know you would not dare to lend them out of your
                     sight."
                  "But I presume thee will invite me to witness thy pleasures," said Mabel,
                     taking a box which Lucina brought to her; "in that case, should thee wear one
                     or the other, they would not be out of my sight."
                  Both girls uttered an exclamation of admiration, as the flashing jewels came to
                     light after Mrs. Van Broek had lifted the satin pad that laid over them.
                  "Beautiful! beautiful! how splendidly you must have looked in them!" cried
                     Maggie.
                  "I never wore them," replied Mabel quietly.
                  "Do you hear that, Amy?" cried Maggie, her eyes starting;—"she never wore them.
                     Is it possible?"
                  "Didn't Uncle Van Broek want you to?" asked Amy.
                  The gentle Quakeress shook her head; her lip was quivering, her eyes were
                     swimming in tears.
                  "He knew my tastes were more quiet," at last she said, sadly; "but once I wore
                     the pearls," and she uncovered the rich milk-white globes whose lustre, though
                     not vivid, was purer than that of the precious stones.
                  "Why, don't you like ornaments at all?" asked Maggie.
                  "Yes, dear—the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit."
                  The girls were silent for a moment, till Maggie blustered out:
                  "Well, if you haven't got it, I don't know who has."
                  "I have another set of diamonds," said Mabel, smiling.
                  Maggie had unbounded reverence for wealth; it was her failing. She looked upon
                     Mabel as if she had been an Eastern princess.
                  "They are strung upon a golden wire that will never wear out, and their
                     brilliancy as far exceeds this as it is possible for the sun to outshine the
                     stars."
                  "And where is it?" asked Amy.
                  Mabel smiled.
                  
                  "A part of it laid for safe-keeping in a city where never thief enters, where
                     never rust destroys. I speak of the love of my Harry—my—husband—and my angel
                     child."
                  Maggie seldom, in her volatile light-heartedness, thought of heaven, scarcely
                     dreamed that her merry existence was not eternal here. As a fountain may be
                     unsealed by the chance displacement of a pebble—so by one well-timed word her
                     heart was touched. Still she gazed on the spiritual beauty of Mabel Van Broek
                     with reverence, but it was of a different kind from that she had just
                     experienced.
                  "You will let us have our choice, I think you said?" whispered Maggie, in a low
                     tone.
                  "Certainly. I would let you take both, but I have use for one," replied
                     Mabel.
                  "Which, Amy—the pearls or the diamonds?"
                  "Who are they for?" asked Mabel, lifting the pearls.
                  "For Amy here, who wants to play the queen," said Maggie.
                  "If she takes the pearls, I have in another box a tiara—the family jewels of my
                     husband's mother."
                  "Then the pearls by all means, Amy; for you must have a tiara, you know."
                  "It is old-fashioned," said Mabel.
                  "Oh, of course; so much the better; say, shant it be pearls, Amy? I know they
                     will become you."
                  Amy wanted both, but as she could not have them, the tiara settled the
                     question. She was willing to take the pearls, but wondered who the diamonds
                     were for.
                  "Mrs. Van Broek looks fatigued; I'm sure it's so kind of you!" exclaimed
                     Maggie; "and we had planned between us to be wonderfully cunning, and bring the
                     subject about so cautiously! I see I should never make a conspirator."
                  "I'm sure I hope not," Mabel replied.
                  "Has mother been in here this evening?" Amy asked.
                  "No, but to-day quite a while; we have sociable times together.
                  "And father—has he made himself visible?" Amy asked, an anxious expression
                     flitting over her face.
                  "No—I have been wondering where he was. I think he was not at the
                     dinner-table," replied Mabel.
                  "No, nor at supper; he is not well," replied Amy. As she spoke the color
                     flickered on her cheek. It had been pale, it was now a fiery red. Mabel thought
                     she saw a look of humiliation, a sense of pain, in the young face, and she felt
                     more tenderly toward her. More tenderly, I say, for she had never been drawn by
                     heart-magic toward her proud little niece; she had not, in fact, though she
                     might not acknowledge it in so many words, really liked her at all. Now she
                     knew there must be some cause for that sudden look of sorrow, and her gentle
                     heart reproached her.
                  "Thee is well, dear, is thee not?" she asked.
                  Amy looked surprised at the question, but answered that she was quite well.
               
               
                  
                  PART V.
                  THE LAWYER'S FREAK.
                  "When is this grand party to come off?" asked Mabel, as the girls were
                     preparing to go.
                  "The fourth of next month," said Amy, counting on her fingers; "a week from
                     to-day, isn't it Mag?"
                  "Yes, just seven days; dear me, what a little time to get ready in, and so much
                     to do!"
                  "Thee is to have a large company, I expert," said Mabel.
                  "Oh, yes!" cried Amy, gaily; "and a whole band of music. We never had that
                     before. If the strolling actors come this way, papa says he shall engage them
                     to play for us. We've all the fixtures, for last summer we got up a tragedy, an
                     artist painted us some beautiful scenery, and we made a magnificent curtain.
                     But then you see it will be much better to hire the actors than to go to the
                     trouble of learning difficult parts, and rehearsing; it's very tedious."
                  "We shall have plenty of fine music," said Maggie.
                  "Oh, plenty! for Dole Baker plays prodigiously well on the flute, indeed, it's
                     about all he can do decently; and Marshall Randolph is perfect master of the
                     guitar, isn't he Aunt Mabel? you have heard him. Then, nearly all the young
                     ladies play well, and if Le Roy, the great pianist, is in town, father says he
                     shall invite him."
                  At the mention of Dole Baker, poor Lucina shivered. The fear that racked her
                     soul from night to morning, was that she was already or might be soon sold to
                     him.
                  "We shall have the little sitting-room converted into a bower for the
                     musicians, won't that be fine? Then father is going to have the partition taken
                     down between the parlors and the large sitting-room, and folding-doors put up
                     there, so that we can get up our tableaux without confusion."
                  "And we shall have the handsome carpenter at work there to-morrow, I suppose—I
                     declare it is a pity for that man to be a slave; he's the only darky with a
                     really fine intellect that I have ever seen."
                  "Is he not a white man?" asked Mabel.
                  "Oh! he looks like one, but of course we must make a distinction, or we might
                     be led into familiarity. I'm sure I wish such a handsome man could come along
                     and make love to me!"
                  Mabel looked shocked.
                  "Oh! you know I mean—why he should be rich, with at least five hundred slaves,
                     or I wouldn't look at him; of course you know I meant a free white
                     man. But come, I wonder what Hat thinks of our staying so long"—looking at her
                     watch—"it is after nine—hark! who is that singing?"
                  Amy glanced from one to the other in a sort of terror, as the clear, manly
                     voice rung out unnaturally loud: 
                        
                           "If I had as much sense
                           As would balance the straw,
                           I'd choose the one I want
                           From the picture I would draw."
                        
                     
                  
                  
                  "Ha! ha! ha! ha! well done, Dole! Did you ever see a horse do better than that?
                     I tell you he's a scion of Beelzebub! Now look here old Spitfire—old devil, if
                     you're up to that sort of trick again, I'll shoot you as sure as my name is
                     Kenneth." Then followed a succession of oaths so shocking as to chill the blood
                     of the listeners—then a stanza—an insane laugh closing the whole.
                  "It sounds like Everard's voice!" exclaimed Mabel, terrified, as she
                     listened.
                  "It is father; he is angry with Spitfire," added Amy. Her cheek had grown
                     deadly pale.
                  "He's a frightful animal," She said again; "I wish father would sell him." Her
                     tones were vexed, and she seemed ready to cry.
                  "Come, let's go into the other room; Hat is waiting," said Maggie, taking Amy's
                     hand soothingly. She had once witnessed one of the lawyer's paroxysms, and
                     pitied Amy, as well as trembled at the recollection of his fury.
                  "Oh! Maggie, that's just the way it comes on," said Amy in a hopeless voice;
                     "what shall I do? father will disgrace us all—I wish he would go
                     away, as he does sometimes; it will kill mother."
                  "He may not be any worse," said Maggie; "he knows that the party is coming off;
                     for your sake, he will not go any farther."
                  "Oh! but that's the way it comes on," said Amy, as another wild shout and song,
                     and burst of maniac laughter rang out, and the steel-like tread of Spitfire was
                     heard as the horse galloped back and forth.
                  "Amy!"
                  It was Mrs. Kenneth calling from the head of the stairs. The young girl went up
                     and followed her mother into her chamber.
                  "You heard!" said Mrs. Kenneth, sinking helplessly into a chair; "heaven knows
                     where this will end! I've been expecting it for weeks. Oh, it will wear my life
                     away!"
                  "Just now, too, when all our invitations are out—oh! mother, what shall we
                     do?"
                  "He will keep quiet till then, Amy—he is this way nearly a month before the
                     worst comes on; that is not what I fear. I wish that Dole Baker was in heaven!"
                     she cried, passionately.
                  "He'll never get there," said Amy; then she added, "do you think he causes
                     father to drink so much?"
                  "Yes, I believe he has treated him to suppers, and led him on till his appetite
                     cannot be controlled—hark!"
                  They flew in fright into the upper hall. Hat and Maggie came screaming up the
                     stairs. Lawyer Kenneth had urged his horse into the veranda—into the hall—and
                     was lashing him furiously to make him mount. The creature reared and
                     snorted—his eyes blazing like two red coals. He would place his fore feet on
                     the stairs, then rear and back. The noise was as near infernal as anything
                     could well be.
                  "Everard!" cried his wife, "keep out of the house, if you are clean mad; my
                     hall is no stable!"
                  Taking off his hat with a graceful movement, flinging back his long hair,
                     looking like a handsome demon, Lawyer Kenneth bowed to his wife, and burst out
                        singing:
                     
                        
                           "Oh! my love is like a red, red rose
                           That's newly blown in June!"
                        
                     
                  
                  His face changed again, and he swore frightfully as be turned his horse's head,
                     and clattered out of the house and off.
                  Mrs. Kenneth went weeping into her own chamber, and the girls, quiet and
                     sorrowful, followed her example. Mabel had been so terrified at this conduct
                     that she had fainted, and Lucina, with one of the servants, was busily
                     endeavoring to restore her to consciousness. She had but just succeeded when
                     Harry came in.
                  "What is the matter, my dearest mother?" he exclaimed, flying to the couch.
                  "Take me away!" was all she could repeat. Lucina explained the cause of her
                     terror; his brow grew dark as he listened.
                  "She shall not stay here another day," he said firmly; but. on the morrow
                     Lawyer Kenneth apologized for his "spree," as he called it; said he had
                     unwittingly drank something stronger than he intended, and it had crazed him a
                     little. He seemed touched at Mabel's sorrowful expression, and so repentant for
                     having disturbed her that she relented and forgave him, talked seriously and
                     tenderly to him—urged him by the love he bore their dear, dead mother, to
                     respect himself.
                  He answered with a look of despair, "Mabel! I was a pretty fair man once; that
                     you know!"
                  "Thee was—thee was—our hope—our pride. Oh, too much our pride!" she said
                     tearfully.
                  "Mabel! I have been fearfully wronged; seldom man is wronged as I have been,"
                     he said. "My very nature is changed; if you knew, you would not wonder."
                  "My brother, there is a balm! my dear brother, if thee suffers, there is a
                     Savior!"
                  "Oh, heaven! don't talk to me of that, or I shall
                     swear here in your presence, and I don't want to do that. Mabel, shall I tell
                     you? I believe in the devil!"
                  "Would that thee believed in Christ, my poor, poor brother!" she said.
                  "And I think," he added, as if he had not heard her last remark, "that I have
                     sold myself to him."
                  "Oh, Everard, Everard, don't talk so wildly! Look at me, brother—I am fading
                     before thee. See this blazing color—see this thin cheek. Everard, I am dying,
                     day by day; oh! I entreat thee, do not lose thine own soul, for I would meet
                     thee up there, where our mother is, brother." She pointed to heaven as she
                     spoke. For a moment he was transfixed with awe, mingled with love, for when
                     himself, he was fond of Mabel. His eye softened—there might be tears there.
                  "Don't talk of dying, Mabel—I wish I had never left you to come to this
                     accursed spot—don't talk of dying; if any one can save me, you can."
                  "Thee says thee loves me," said Mabel, sadly; "let me test thy love. Thee knows
                     how much I wish to buy Lucina."
                  "Oh! no more of that!" cried Lawyer Kenneth, fiercely, waving his
                     hand.
                  
                  "Don't thee refuse me, Everard; my heart is set upon it."
                  "Mabel, you couldn't buy that girl," said her brother setting his
                     teeth together.
                  "I will give thee thy price," said Mabel.
                  "Mabel! the worth of yonder city, and ten cities like it, couldn't buy that
                     girl!"
                  His sister fell back pale and fainting.
                  "Furies!" he cried, springing from his seat, "don't look that way! I will
                     consider it; there! are you better?"
                  "Yes—yes—oh! Everard—I will pray for thee. May God soften thy heart."
                  "I have done with God, long ago!" he muttered, and walked from the room.
                  There was something still left for hope to feed upon. He had said, "I will
                     consider it." Mabel trusted to her power over him. She urged him to refuse
                     wine; set before him the anguish of his wife and child should he so far forget
                     himself on the anniversary of his only daughter's birth; and succeeded in
                     obtaining a promise that he would abstain from the excessive use of the article
                     until that time had passed. With this she was obliged to be satisfied.
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               IN FOUR PARTS.
               
                  PART I.
                  PAST GUILT IS OFT-TIMES INNOCENTLY THRUST IN THE FACE OF THE
                     WRONG-DOER BY THOSE HE LOVES BEST.
                  
                     
                        
                           "But he who stems a stream with sand
                           And fetters flame with flaxen band,
                           Has yet a harder task to prove
                           By firm resolve to conquer love."
                        
                     
                  
                  THE preparations went swiftly forward. Everybody was interested, from the
                     master of Washing ton Grange down to the very blackest baby on the place.
                     Humpbacked Jupiter went capering about on his head from morning till night. His
                     master had promised him a sort of harlequin's dress to perform in before the
                     company, and as he had any quantity of assurance, and plenty of ready wit, he
                     looked forward to the party as an epoch in which he should distinguish himself,
                     with as much eagerness as a newly-fledged General anticipates the day of
                     battle.
                  "The good for noting, imperent, unbearable nigger!" Aunt Esty said, shaking her
                     good-natured turban; "he's got sass enough in him now to keep mar's Kenneth in
                     apple-jack a hundred years or mo'; and to go dressin' him up an' making him more a fool dan he was—'deed,
                     'twas a sin, honey, 'deed 'twas." And the clever old creature fell on her
                     pie-crust with almost savage impetuosity; perhaps in fancy she was flourishing
                     the roller over Jupiter's black hide. The housekeeper with her retinue of
                     chambermaids hurried from room to room with looks full of importance, giving
                     directions, smoking now and then when she could get a sly chance out of some
                     open window, and scolding when she was not laughing, which was very seldom.
                     Jim, her husband, stood in the conservatory with a rueful face.
                  "Too bad, anyway, go spile all o' dem munifercent flowers," he muttered, "jest
                     for one night's fuss—dem cammillas an' japonidas, case I took bettermos' car o'
                        dem, darfo' dey's got to go. Dat jassermine, 't'll all have to
                     be stripped, I spozes; Lord love it! hate to see it
                        nex' day, da's so! Dem ar Russia violums, case
                        dey's very scace now, s'pose dem mus' all go,
                     after all de pains I's taken wid 'em. Dat myrtle, an' de
                     hellumtrope—dear Lord! wishes dey was all artumficial—hate to cut
                     'em off dar blessed stems—likes to see everything da's got to die,
                     die natural defs; do so!"
                  It was hardly to be wondered at that the old gardener dreaded the despoiling
                     hand of fashion, as he gazed about on the perfection of his handiwork. He was,
                     indeed, an indefatigable laborer. He had no children, and delighted to call
                     these beautiful creations his family.
                  "Lord bless you," he would say, "I's got de hansomest, an' de quietest
                        chill'n in de world. Dey don't cry, deyfo' dey don't have to be
                     beat; nor dey can't be beat," he would add, with a "he! he!" at
                     his own smartness. "Dey's all dressed reglar splendid, too, bes' go-to-meetin'
                     bonnets, and silks an' satins, an' dey laffs to see
                        me come, case dey knows I's dar daddywhat gubs 'em
                     'nuff to eat an' drink. Dey don't have to use no scented stuff
                     noder—bress you! when dey wants smell anything nice, dey smells o' dey
                        selfs, yah! yah! yah, yah!"
                  So he stood looking ruefully about when the order came for as many bouquets as
                     there were flowers to make them. He turned to his roses; they bloomed
                     magnificently, and seemed to smile in his dark face; he turned to his lilies,
                     they nodded their superb heads, and almost appeared to dare him to despoil
                     them.
                  "I's got two days, anyway, to spare ye, pore dumb
                     things," he said, looking at each with a sigh, "but you's got to go; 'tisn't as
                     I say, honeys, or you might die in yo' blessed beds, ebery
                        one ob ye. Well, bless de Lord! you's gwine to be
                     resurrectionized, darfo' wouldn't mourn widout no hope; de Lord neber lets
                        noting die but he done gone raises it agin
                     somewhar; da's so!"
                  Maggie and Amy went flitting over the great house, full of joyous life. Since
                     that dreadful night that promised so much disappointment, Lawyer Kenneth had
                     confined his vigils to the great club-room at the hotel in town. Spitfire stood
                     reeking and trembling in his stable nearly every morning, while his master lay
                     stretched in profound slumber from which he would awaken a little querulous;
                     but true to his promise, he drank none at home. Still the frightful disease was
                     brooding in his brain and fevering his veins. He felt its stealthy coming, and often shuddered at the
                     sound of his own wild laugh.
                  Hattie sat painting away some pretty scene for a background, laying on the
                     colors coarsely, yet effectively, and using gorgeous tints, while her cousins
                     were ransacking old drawers and chests for relics of ancient days. These they
                     found in many a faded skirt of rich more antique—many a corsage ingeniously
                     padded—many a piece of elaborate embroidery, and costly yellow lace.
                  "Look here, Mag, here are my great-grandmother's shoes. She was a Virginia
                     lady, and an intimate friend of Lady Washington:—so fond of her that when she
                     designed to build on the ground where this house stands, she said it should be
                     called Washington Grange. That petticoat of yellow satin that you have in your
                     hand belonged to her."
                  "Oh, what thick satin!" cried Maggie, "it feels like a board. Now, if you had a
                     bodice and a head-dress, it would be complete, and we could have a tableau of
                     an old Virginia family."
                  "Mamma has two or three bodices, besides some old flaxen wigs, such as they
                     wore in those days; we could dress them up admirably."
                  "So we could; let's go down and tell Hat; and stop Amy; here's a curious old
                     arm-chair, a table, and this clock; can't we get them down stairs?"
                  "Of course we can, but they'll be in the way."
                  "We can set them somewhere, and the niggers can bring them in when we want
                     them;" replied Maggie, who generally carried her point.
                  "My grandmama had a favorite servant who dressed in livery; she brought him
                     from England with her. He was a white man, and always stood behind her chair,"
                     said Amy.
                  "Oh, yes, we must have the old livery servant—I tell you—Hollister will be
                     complete, and your family coat of arms hung up conspicuously—you are to be
                     great-grandmother," Maggie rattled.
                  "I'd rather not," said Amy, shrinkingly.
                  "Oh, indeed you must, Mrs. Van Broek would decide so, I'm sure, for you see you
                     have the family features; then, Hollister—let me see—how shall we get up a
                     livery? breeches you know, and knee-buckles. What were the colors?"
                  "Hollister never could consent," said Amy.
                  "Him? I'd make him!"
                  "He's a person of entirely too much consideration for that," said Amy, with
                     heightened color; "besides, our slaves are all pretty much their own
                     masters."
                  "But we must have Hollister; he's the only thoroughly white man on
                     the place; if you ask him, Amy, I'm sure he'll consent; besides,
                     he will make such a beauty of a foot-man!"
                  "I won't ask him," said Amy, decidedly; "I should look well asking
                     a favor of him."
                  "Well, then, mayn't I?" queried Maggie.
                  "No, I'd rather you wouldn't. Perhaps mamma will take the character," said Amy,
                     as a bright thought struck her. "There's Keene, he's as white as Hollister, and
                     nearly as good-looking; I should just as lief ask him as not; although he's free he isn't such an affected,
                     proud fellow as Hollister. I'll go right down and see."
                  "Mother!"
                  Mrs. Kenneth started up from the easy-chair on which she had been lounging.
                  "Why, Amy, child, your cheeks are as red as roses!" she exclaimed.
                  "We have decided upon a new tableau, and want you to help us."
                  "Well," Mrs. Kenneth smiled fondly, for Amy, when pleased with herself, was all
                     affection, and had now passed her arm about her mother's neck.
                  "We are going to have an old Virginia family, and you know we have a suit of
                     great-grandmamma Hollister's complete, and we want you to be that
                     character."
                  "Nonsense, child! why should I make a fright, of myself?"
                  "Oh, mother—you know you will look so pretty and quaint in that handsome old
                     dress, with your footman, and I'm to be a young, fashionable Virginian; and—oh,
                     do mamma, say yes; I haven't asked you to do one other single thing."
                  "It seems so nonsensical; but then, if you're bent upon it, why, I suppose I
                     must please you. Luckily we have great-grandmamma's picture up stairs, and can
                     copy her faithfully."
                  "So we have!" cried Amy, clapping her hands; "I had entirely forgotten."
               
               
                  PART II.
                  MRS. KENNETH'S AGITATION.
                  "I, don't know that I can ever get my foot into my grand-mother's little shoe,"
                     said Mrs. Kenneth, laughing.
                  "Nonsense, mamma! you to say that, who have the tiniest foot?"
                  "What are you going to write about, Amy?"
                  The girl had gone toward her mother's writing desk, and was busily fitting a
                     pen.
                  "To Keene; he's to be your servant in livery—you're to be a person of quality,
                     you know."
                  "Amy!"
                  The girl turned quickly round in extreme astonishment, for her mother's voice
                     was changed. Mrs. Kenneth stood upright, her attitude was that of a person
                     frozen into horror.
                  "What do you mean!—what are you thinking of? good heavens! don't you
                        dare do such a thing; he must be put entirely out
                     of your arrangements.——I give up the character; you must find some one else—Hat
                     or Maggie."
                  Amy, still bewildered, stood looking at her mother, whose frightened manner and
                     shining eyes startled her into silence.
                  By and by she said, as soon as she could find voice, "Why, Keene was only going
                     to stand behind your chair, mother."
                  "Never mind, Amy," said Mrs. Kenneth, commanding her voice, as she seated herself again; "I
                     cannot take the character, it is out of the question."
                  "But you said you would, before I mentioned Keene," said Amy,
                     pertinaciously.
                  "It doesn't matter what I said, Amy, I have decided."
                  "Why, how you tremble, mother!—I'm sure I don't know why the mention of that
                     man's name should always affect you so strangely? What is he, pray, to
                     you?"
                  "Will you go out, Amy?" exclaimed her mother, her voice husky, her
                     eyes glittering.
                  "Yes, and glad enough to get out; it's real mean!" she exclaimed, taking pains
                     to bring the door to with a slam.
                  "What?" asked Maggie, who was coming down stairs, her arms loaded with old
                     finery.
                  "Why, mother won't take the character, nor let Keene have anything to do with
                     it!" cried Amy, in a pet.
                  "Well, there's Hollister, she won't object to him, will she?"
                  "I shall give up the tableau."
                  "Oh, no, Amy; I'll take the character, first, and all the responsibility. I've
                     found ever so many old traps that will help out in the livery—knee-buckles, and
                     red velvet, and sashes. I was just going to ask your mother if we might use
                     them."
                  "She wouldn't care," said Amy; "you had better not go in there now; she has
                     sent me off in French style—I don't understand it," she muttered to
                     herself.
                  Amy was not without a fair share of—not feminine, par-
                     
                        AMY KENNETH.
                      ticularly—but universal vanity. She was proud of her ancestors, who
                     came of a good old English stock, with a free sprinkling of nobility among its
                     branches, and it did not suit her that the personation of one of her blood
                     should be undertaken by any one out of the family. So, after much urging on the
                     part of her cousins, and much self-prompting on her own, she consented to
                     appear great-grandmother, and even to speak to Hollister, who was busily at
                     work in the back parlor.
               
               
                  PART III.
                  AMY'S INTERVIEW WITH HOLLISTER.
                  It was not until she had been laughed and dared into doing it, however. Her
                     heart misgave her as she went down stairs. She had not spoken to Hollister
                     since she struck him. She had more than once been heartily ashamed of the act,
                     the misdemeanor that called it forth was so trifling. It was strange that in
                     that short space of time, the past came with its crowd of memories, thronging
                     every corner of her heart. To tell the truth, Hollister had never seemed like a
                     slave till he began to show his preference too warmly. Not that he dared aspire
                     to her attention, but as a strong wind sweeps off the leaves that are ready to
                     fall, sc a strong gust of passion sent out some burning words that were
                     fluttering on his lips. What right had the slave even to a preference, to be sure? True, he was a
                     man—his tastes, appetites, dispositions—his features, sinews, muscles,
                     nerves—his minor senses of seeing, tasting, smelling—were the same—in
                     proportion, perhaps more or less vivid, intellectual, or brilliant—as those of
                     other men. He saw the same heavens and earth, worshipped the same Deity, looked
                     with as much interest upon the flowers, passed as keen a judgment upon the
                     fruits, admired beauty when it came in his way, much in the manner of other
                     men; but where was his right? that's the question. A slave dare to
                     prefer one above another among his owners! The thing was monstrous—he was not
                     even to be called a man, but "boy," a term of derision and
                     contempt, though he were grey-headed.
                  His handsome childhood, when she hardly knew but he was a brother—the bright
                     face and beautiful figure of seventeen, with whom she was always trusted,
                     because he was so grave and careful—the maturer age of young manhood when she
                     began to seek the glance of his dark eyes, and acknowledge his
                     admiration—perhaps, without thinking, allot him a share of her own. These
                     different stages glided swiftly before her mental vision, and almost overcame
                     her resolution of meeting him face to face. Beside, she could not, she dared
                     not deny to herself that something in that noble face would not let her forget
                     it; the throb of her pulse quickened even as she thought of it; her cheek
                     reddened with resentment; she lifted her head more firmly, and curled her lip.
                     Now her hand was on the door.
                  Tap, tap, went the hammer; a rich voice hummed softly an old melancholy air;
                     his mind was full of his mother, whom he had that day seen. Summoning all her
                     resolution, at last she entered. Hollister stood near the door, tapping away at
                     a little piece of wood. He lifted his face; it was all a-glow, and his paper
                     cap was instantly in his hand, though the coming color told his indecision.
                  "Hollister!" She could not help the reddening of her cheeks.
                  "Miss Kenneth," said the slave, with a deferential bow.
                  "You know we shall have tableaux in these rooms."
                  "Yes, Miss Kenneth," said Hollister.
                  "We—we are going to have one in which we may require your assistance." She
                     dared not look in the eyes that seemed reading her soul.
                  "What can I do for you, Miss Kenneth?"
                  It seemed a positive insult at that moment to ask the question—to ask a man—he
                     appeared no slave now—to put upon a form like that the badge of servitude, and
                     Amy wished herself a thousand miles off. She felt and knew that she looked and
                     acted awkwardly, while he stood, with the bearing of a prince, waiting her
                     bidding.
                  "We want a character in livery," at last she said, bluntly. He did not answer,
                     and she looked up. His face was partly turned away, but she saw it mantled with
                     scorn.
                  "This for a slave!" she thought; "yet in him it seems becoming;" and with a
                     manner little like her usual imperious bearing, she added, "perhaps you would
                     object."
                  "I have no right to object," he said mournfully, sighing as he spoke.
                  "It will be only for a moment, you know."
                  
                  "Miss Kenneth—it is your wish—that is enough."
                  At another time Amy would have resented such a speech, and, if possible,
                     annihilated him with a look; now there was a strange dizzy feeling in her
                     brain—a singular sensation in her throat, something like a sob; the still,
                     mournful look and manner touched her deeply, and with a hurried "Thank you,"
                     she glided from the room. No sooner had the door closed between them than she
                     could have hated herself for the small modicum of sympathy she had shown for
                     one who, whatever were his acquirements and accomplishments, was still a
                        slave, and dared to admire her.
                  
                  "Well, I trust you were successful; you have been gone long enough to ask a
                     dozen favors," cried Maggie, who was busily cutting out strips of red velvet
                     for Phillis to sew.
                  "I hope you do not imagine that I asked any favor. I am accustomed to command
                     the slaves," retorted Amy.
                  "Oh, of course you did perfectly right, whatever you did; but come, we want
                     your judgment—which pattern will be best?" holding up two faded
                     fashion-plates.
               
               
                  PART IV.
                  HARRY'S UNEXPECTED FAREWELL.
                  Lucina smilingly busy—Mabel looking quietly out into the garden, upon the white
                     statues and the graceful trees—the rich red lounge—the marble-top centre-table
                     strewn with implements of work—the guitar by Mabel's side—the beautiful
                     pictures living, glowing upon the walls—formed an accumulation of objects most
                     happily grouped together.
                  "How delicately the rays of light play between the waving branches of the
                     trees!" said Mabel, speaking softly.
                  "Yes, and what beautiful pictures there are in the trees themselves!" said
                     Lucina.
                  "Pictures in the trees? why that's a new fancy to me. I can see nothing of the
                     sort," returned Mabel, glancing towards her protégée.
                  
                  "I have been looking up in that maple," returned Lucina, "at the sweetest fairy
                     figure I ever beheld; it dances with such graceful curves of the body! It has a
                     large hat with streaming ribbons, a wand, and a garland of roses in its
                     hand."
                  "And thee sees all that?" queried Mabel.
                  "Just as plainly as I see you," returned Lucina. "Besides that, I see a profile
                     of an aged man. Oh, such beautiful, though stern outlines!"
                  "It must be very pleasant," said Mabel.
                  "I am always tracing figures and groups—even on a plain whitewashed wall I have
                     seen beautiful pictures. In my little room at school—it was unpapered—I left an
                     angel that has solaced me many a cold, dreary morning. I don't think any one
                     else would ever notice the peculiarity of the glazing on the wall. Trying to
                     trace out the wide-spread wings one day for a school-fellow, I only got laughed
                     at for my pains."
                  
                  "Thee might have drawn it with thy pencil."
                  "Yes; but then it would have lost its greatest charm—its ethereal outline.
                     Besides, isn't it always best to leave something to the imagination?"
                  "To such an imagination as thine—yes," replied Mabel, as she moved slowly to
                     the couch and lay down, somewhat exhausted. Harry came in, portmanteau in hand.
                     He had the air of a man striving to put on a manner that was not natural to the
                     mood in which he had fallen.
                  "Well, Harry, will thee stay?" asked Mabel.
                  "I'm going," he said, briefly.
                  "Oh, Harry! why should thee? Thee will miss the party—and I shall be so
                     lonesome here without thee!"
                  "I believe I must go, mother," Harry replied, his face changing to an anxious
                     look. "I must see how they are getting along, and Marshall is going with me:
                     so, you see, I shall be well taken care of. Besides, if possible (and I am
                     inclined to think it will be), I shall return in time, at any rate, to enjoy a
                     few hours of that evening with you. I beg you won't feel unhappy at my
                     absence—and you know," he added, laughingly, "I am to escort Miss Lufburrow,
                     who would be so dreadfully disappointed if I were to stay now, poor little
                     soul!"
                  "Well—if thee must—but still I feel greatly disappointed, I confess. Dear
                     Harry! what is thee going to do with that?" cried Mabel, shuddering.
                  Harry had drawn a pistol from his portmanteau, and laughing heartily at her
                     frightened face, replied—
                  "Leave it with you."
                  "And, why place it with me? thee knows I am no advocate for the use of
                     fire-arms," returned Mabel.
                  "I can't leave you alone without some sort of protection," said Harry; "so I am
                     going to place it here, over the mantel-piece; "you need never so much as touch
                     it, if you don't wish to; and I shall feel that you are safer, for this is a
                     valiant fellow, who, if he don't speak, makes a great show of courage. I have
                     known more cowards than one frightened at the sight of a pistol."
                  "Why, Harry! how strangely thee talks and acts! I never knew thee to carry
                     fire-arms."
                  "I never did at home, mother; but here I was counselled to do so, and,
                     accordingly, in Rome I do as the Romans do. I am going now to call for
                     Marshall, who hasn't had much time to make his arrangements, he having only
                     decided to go this noon. I'll be back in a few moments."
                  Mabel had hardly recovered from the shock of his announcement before Miss Luf
                     burrow came in to shake hands. She had previously been to every person in the
                     house, including Hollister and the chambermaids, shaken hands amiably and given
                     each some parting advice. Mrs. Kenneth she had charged to be kind to her
                     husband 'when he got in them dreadful turns,' quoting Scripture and her beloved
                     brother Joe. Each of the girls came in for a benediction, in which brother Joe
                     said all but the amen; and now she cautioned Mrs. Van Broek to keep very still,
                     avoid getting her feet wet, and on no account to expose herself to the night
                     air, because the dew in that climate was perfect poison (poor little flowers),
                     and hoping that she would be better,
                     if she didn't get quite well, which she didn't believe she ever expected, she
                     turned to Lucina.
                  "And you, poor child," she said, with a manner that however pathetic she meant
                     it should be, was absolutely ludicrous from the importance and conscious
                     condescension with which she looked down upon her, "try to be submissive to the
                     will of the Lord, although, as brother Joe says, I don't believe it
                        is the will of the Lord that white folks should be slaves any
                     more than blacks. Good bye, dear," and the little pale figure, in its pale
                     clothes, vanished, leaving Lucina half laughing, though grateful for her
                     sympathy.
                  "Harry talked of going last night, but I thought it was only talk," said Mabel,
                     uneasily, as the door closed. "The idea of his leaving me, makes me quite
                     nervous. He must have business of importance, of which he says nothing to me. I
                     hope there is no trouble."
                  Mabel was restless all the evening after Harry was gone; and frequently cast
                     uneasy glances toward the pistol on the shelf. Lucina, observing this, asked if
                     she should put it out of sight.
                  "No, dear; I must conquer this foolish feeling. Harry will be back on Thursday,
                     with good news, I hope. I would have gone with him, had he given me the least
                     encouragement—but he did not speak of it. I fear some trouble has hastened him
                     away. But let us busy ourselves with some pleasant task—what selfish beings we
                     are!"
                  "No—not you," said Lucina, gently.
                  "Yes; for I am not happy when he is gone; I need to see his pleasant face—hear
                     his cheerful talk. But we will change the subject—what will thee wear on the
                     coming holiday-night?"
                  "I—I!" exclaimed Lucina, "I am not to go—unless as"—
                  "Not as a servant, my child. Do I not tell thee, assure thee, that I have
                     adopted thee? and as the daughter of a Governor's widow, thee must dress
                     befittingly."
                  "But why am I to go, dear madam, at all? I had much rather stay here with, my
                     books," said Lucina.
                  "My brother has commanded it," said Mabel, firmly; "and I have strong reasons
                     for urging it."
                  "If Mr. Kenneth orders it, it can't be for good!" exclaimed Lucina, looking up
                     in a distressful way, and letting her work fall from her hands.
                  "Nevertheless, good may come out of it," said Mabel, composedly.
                  "Then you wish it?" said Lucina, in a low, faint voice.
                  "I certainly do; and I wish thee, as I said before, to go in a style befitting
                     thy future station. Trust to me, my dear; thee knows I would advise thee
                     nothing to thy injury."
                  "Oh! I know you would not," replied Lucina; "but I dread the sight of
                        that man."
                  "Thee shall not be troubled with his insolence," said Mabel, in the firm but
                     yet' sweet way she used when her mind was made up; "thee does not fear to trust
                     to my judgment?"
                  
                  "Oh, no, no!" Lucina said eagerly, and the smile of entire confidence again
                     wreathed her lips."
                  "Thee has no dresses, I fear, as handsome as I would wish," said Mabel.
                  "Nothing very nice," Lucina replied.
                  "Thee should wear white tulle; let me see, thee is about my size, but I am the
                     thinnest."
                  Lucina looked at the symmetrical figure, emaciated though it was, and wished
                     she were but half as beautiful.
                  "I must send to town immediately for materials, and a dress-maker. I have laces
                     and other trimmings;" said Mabel, quietly. Accordingly, in little more than an
                     hour after Miss Lufburrow had taken her departure, everything was in readiness,
                     and Lucina with a beating heart awaited the result.
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               IN TWO PARTS.
               
                  PART I.
                  THE PARTY.
                  
                     In which it is shown that though the lights flash and the revel grows wild,
                        many a joyous and beautiful face is only a mask to cover suffering and
                        shame.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           "While the perfumed lights
                           Stole through the mists of alabaster lamps."
                        
                     
                  
                  THE eventful night was ushered in most gloriously. A young moon heralded its
                     advent. Sweet as an infant's breath was the bland breeze. The rooms of
                     Washington Grange were filled at an early hour with flowers and evergreens.
                     With the aid of the great mirrors the long vista looked like enchanted ground.
                     Gorgeously-colored lights were disposed about the walks and the garden; every
                     tree dropped flashing almond-like flames; carriage after carriage drove up, and
                     deposited its fair burden. The light laugh of mirth sounded from the open
                     windows; the great suites of rooms up stairs were filled with lively and lovely
                     girls, whose voices mingled pleasantly. At first the band played in the garden,
                     hidden by the trees that were garlanded by the slaves with evergreens. A
                     glorious pageant of bright faces and
                     brilliant dresses succeeded, in the midst of which Amy Kenneth shone
                     conspicuously in a rich sky-blue satin, and a wreath of lilies laid lightly
                     over her dark tresses. All the slaves on the place were in holiday costume,
                     grinning, dancing, always precisely in the very place where they were not
                     wanted, and never forthcoming when they were.
                  Keene and Hollister stood together on the verge of the crowd, looking at the
                     fire-works, as the vivid crimson and gold shot up with startling brilliancy
                     into the clear atmosphere.
                  "Oh, Hollister! Hollister!" muttered Keene, deprecatingly.
                  "She asked me, and I could not refuse her"——
                  "Your head, I suppose, if she wanted it; and you may have to give it to satisfy
                     her infernal pride—yet;" muttered Keene, still more fiercely. "I'd have killed
                     myself rather than have put on any of their symbols of degradation. Oh,
                     Hollister! what shall I call you?"
                  "Call me a fool, when she is concerned," said Hollister,
                     gloomily.
                  "Do you want your liberty?" asked Keene, in a low, constrained voice.
                  "Try me and see," replied Hollister, looking cautiously round.
                  "Would you leave her?"
                  Hollister did not reply. Keene turned toward him, then followed the direction
                     of his eyes.
                  Amy Kenneth stood directly under one of the crimson lustres. A gauzy scarf was
                     thrown lightly over her head and neck; she looked bewitchingly lovely. Upon her
                     Hollister's glance was fastened. Keene gazed fixedly at him for a moment, and
                     then, with a sneering lip, walked away. Hollister was roused by a touch on his
                     shoulder, not unfamiliar to him. Old Hepsy stood behind him, her great mop of
                     white hair making her look unearthly in the flickering light.
                  "Guess mars' Kenneth have to sell some niggers to pay all dis yer 'spense," she
                     whispered. "Tell you wha'!" she said, more savagely; "saw ole mars' Hollister
                     in da' blue flame, shu' as you live; did so, honey! An' he grin on mars'
                     Kenneth. Wish de debbil keep da' ole man to hese'f, an' not frighten honest
                     folks. Hy! Miss Amy look like jes' wha' she ain't; da's an angel. Go long! de's
                     a black heart under da' blue dress; she got bad Hollister blood—bad Hollister
                     temper."
                  "Hush, Hepsy! don't talk so foolishly."
                  "Boy, does ye know I's a hundered?" said Hepsy, drawing her
                     withered visage solemnly up, "'deed de ravens pick yer eyes out, chile, ef you
                     don't 'spect age mor'n dat."
                  An hilarious shout announced the success of the exhibition, and the excited
                     crowd turned their steps toward the house, whither the music was leading
                     them.
               
               
                  
                  PART II.
                  MABEL GIVES WAY TO A LITTLE WORLDLY PRIDE.
                  Mabel Van Broek surveyed her work with sparkling eyes. An unnatural strength
                     buoyed her up. Lucina, too, as she stood before the long mirror, blushed with
                     conscious admiration, aye, even of self; so severely spotless, so classically
                     graceful she looked, attired by Mabel's pure taste. Like a cloud the snowy
                     texture swept about her lovely figure. A lace, richer than loom ever wove, fell
                     from her corsage, and over her rounded arms. It was startling to note the
                     change n her appearance. She had laid aside the subdued posture of the, slave,
                     and stood up nobly beautiful, as a free woman; free in her thought, free to all
                     intent, the daughter by adoption of one whom the world delighted to honor. If a
                     secret misgiving as to the purpose for which Lawyer Kenneth wished to exhibit
                     her, entered her bosom now and then, it was resolutely banished; for had not
                     these dear friends determined that, hazard what they might, she should be free?
                     So, with a sweet confidence in their power, she followed whatever suggestion
                     Mabel made.
                  "My dear girl, thee far outshines any one here I have yet seen," whispered
                     Mabel, pressing a kiss almost proudly upon her, forehead; "I have only one
                     addition to make," and unfastening the box that stood upon the table, she took
                     therefrom the diamonds, and laughing, at Lucina's start backward, began to
                     array her in them.
                  "Oh, they are too splendid!" she cried; "indeed, I dare not wear them."
                  "Indeed thee has promised to be guided entirely by my judgment," replied Mabel,
                     in her calm, quiet way, enforcing her words.
                  "There thee is, oh! so very beautiful!" said Mabel, gazing entranced on the
                     peerless figure; "now a few touches to my plain toilet, and we will go in."
                  By this time, while some were playing, others, in another room near the band,
                     dancing, the tableaux were in course of preparation. Mrs. Kenneth striving to
                     seem pleased, but wearing under her mask of smiles a look of deep dejection,
                     talked volubly with her guests, but her eyes were every moment turned anxiously
                     toward the door.
                  Lawyer Kenneth appeared to great advantage. His restless, brilliant face and
                     excitable manner distinguished him above all the company. He was the whole
                     evening in close communion with Dole Baker, that elegant voluptuary seeming to
                     hold many conferences with him, and exchange many sly looks. Ever and anon Mrs.
                     Kenneth watched this suspicious intercourse, and Kenneth as closely watched
                     her.
                  "She is not here yet, you say," whispered Baker, uneasily; "my curiosity is
                     whetted by the many rebuffs your good wife has given me. Egad, I asked her
                     after this slave, and a—she really gave me a—a sharp answer; yes, 'pon
                     honor!"
                  "She has nothing to do with it," replied Lawyer Kenneth.
                  "You still think a—we shall have to manage it a—by a—stratagem?"
                  
                  "I shouldn't be surprised if we did," responded the awyer; "she will come
                     in—that is' I have given orders that she bring in some of the refreshments. As
                     soon as I see her, I will signalize."
                  "Aw! do so," replied Baker. "Positively splendid!" and up went his eye-glass as
                     the curtain slowly rose. "Very a—magnificent; really-a!"
                  It was as he had said, a picture well executed. Elizabeth signing the
                     death-warrant of Mary Queen of Scots.
                  Amy was Elizabeth, and in her robes of regal shade and shape, looked a most
                     determined queen. She sat by a table, as in the famous painting of the scene,
                     dress and attitude copied with admirable exactness. Everybody applauded.
                     Another and another tableau followed. In one Hattie was the Pocahontas of the
                     bridal ceremony, representing her marriage to her lover; in another, Maggie
                     appeared the Guardian Ange!—the Morning Star; and the last, the best of the
                     series, the Old Virginia Family, called forth the noisiest commendation.
                     Hollister well became his livery. He stood in the act of presenting a spinnet
                     to his mistress which she was extending her hand to receive. An unamiable
                     hauteur mantled the glowing face of Amy, who, in her powdered locks and ancient
                     sleeves, deepened by rich frills of lace, her cunning shoes peeping from under
                     the folds of the heavy moire dress, gave a
                     perfect representation of a lady of the olden time. In truth, she was
                     determined to remove any impression of her recent graciousness on the mind of
                     Hollister, and had in the interim treated him so much like a slave, that his
                     blood was roused again. In this piece the old clock, the antique table, the
                     coat of arms, added a life-like interest to the scene, and Hattie had imitated
                     a piece of faded tapestry so well, that it seemed to hang from the wall. Maggie
                     was the young lady of the picture, and two little boys in knee-breeches and
                     with tiny queues powdered, were seated at the table, primly intent on, a board
                     of draughts that laid before them.
                  Hattie Goldsmith was not in good spirits. She moved around with Belle Randolph,
                     now and then bowing and smiling to those about her.
                  "It's too bad Marshall isn't here!" said Belle, while expatiating upon the
                     tableau that was just ended.
                  "My dear! how you started! Why, there is Marshall! oh, I'm so glad! Don't you
                     think he saw that last tableau? He sees us; he is coming, though they will
                     hardly let him pass. Are you not well, Miss Goldsmith, that you tremble
                     so?"
                  Hattie replied that she was quite well, and was saved farther questioning by
                     the coming near of Marshall Randolph. His whole face lighted up with pleasure
                     as he met Hattie, who gave him a most expressive glance of welcome.
                  Ah, Hat! quiet and dignified, it was a dangerous hour for you when the young
                     hero stood up before God and man, denouncing the traffic in human souls!, The
                     depths of one heart that never were stirred before by the voice of man, owned
                     in that moment as pure and impassioned love as ever maiden bosom cherished.
                  "Where is your friend, Mr. Van Broek?" asked Belle Randolph, drawing her
                     brother aside.
                  
                  "Couldn't return—business urgent—a pity he had not gone before," he replied,
                     thoughtfully.
                  "His mother will be alarmed," Hattie ventured.
                  "No, I am to see her and assure her of his good health. I have just sent her a
                     note by one of the servants. I thought she might be here."
                  "I have been watching for her all the evening, as Miss Goldsmith will testify.
                     You have talked of her so much," said his sister, "that I'm in a real fever to
                     see her. Do you believe"—turning to Hattie—"she will make her appearance
                     to-night?"
                  "If she is not ill, I am certain, she will," Hattie replied. "She purposed
                     coming early this evening, Mrs. Kenneth told me."
                  "The band is gone," said Marshall.
                  "Yes, they had another engagement, unfortunately, so Amy told me," replied his
                     sister; "we shall have to do the rest of our dancing by the piano."
                  A slave announced supper, and Marshall's services were required. "As soon as we
                     return," he said to Belle as they seated themselves at one of the
                     splendidly-arranged tables, "I must go myself and see Mrs. Van Broek."
                  "At one end of the dining-room a small platform was fitted up, and scarcely
                     were the guests seated, when out sprang Jupiter, rigged in a fantastic suit of
                     red and green, a peacock's feather in his cap, and bells hanging from his hump.
                     Everybody laughed as the saucy fellow came down first in a summerset of
                     prodigious agility, and then stood, grinning, no way abashed. Jupiter was what
                     is generally called by white folks, "a smart nigger"—too smart to work—too
                     smart to keep still—consequently he was always smarting for his mischief. He
                     was more than five years older than he looked, being over fifteen, and seeming
                     but nine, his dwarfed stature deceiving everybody; so that he passed for a
                     child.
                  "How is you, massas and missusses?" he cried, abating not his curious and fixed
                     grin; "I's pretty well, tank you! I's come out—I is! I's a curus nigger,
                     condescended from da' nigger wha' boils de tunder in he big iron kettle."
                  "How old are you, Jupiter?" asked somebody.
                  "Laws, mars', I's half-past de years o' discression—I is! Da's de finger wha'
                     pints! to de figger," he added, holding out his left arm, "an' das de finger
                     wha' tells de time," holding forth his right hand, "an' so you sees I'm 'zactly
                     half-past."
                  Delighted with the laugh he raised, Jupiter turned another summerset, and stood
                     some time on his head, surveying the company upside down.
                  "Pity you're black, Jupiter," said Lawyer Kenneth, tossing off a glass of
                     wine.
                  "Laws mars', I's de handsumest color in de world, I is. Don't de ladies wear
                     black gowns—ain't dey got black eyes an' black har? Tinks missy very handsum
                     when she got black eyes an' black har. Don't mars' 'mire black hat an' black
                     coat an; trowsers? Ky! eberyting black nice, but nigger! Misse kiss little
                     black dog—bery pretty! bery fine! kiss little black baby—whew! no git taste out
                     ob her mouf more dan a year—ky!"
                  A shout of mirth followed this last sally.
                  
                  A voice asked: "Can you sing, Jupiter?"
                  "Sing! laws, mars', I sings like nightingale, and whistles like de ——! begs
                     pardon ladies and genlems—was going to say somefin' bery bad."
                  "Mus'n't say bad words, Jupe," said his master.
                  "No, mars'! knows I mus'n't, case de old feller here he-self, maybe." A roar of
                     laughter followed.
                  "Smart little toad, anyhow," said a gentleman near Lawyer Kenneth.
                  "No, I isn't a toad!" shouted Jupiter, "'case when toad run he jump; when he
                     stand he set; when I runs I goes like streak o' lightnum, an' when I sets I
                     squats in a lump."
                  "Oh! go along, Jupiter, you're a thief; you steal my sugar," said Lawyer
                     Kenneth.
                  "I no tief you sugar; me on'y take it; sugar an' self all same ting; both 'long
                     to massa; me don' tief it; me on'y take it."
                  "Don't let me catch you taking it, that's all," returned Lawyer Kenneth.
                  "No, sa! me no let you catch me," returned the boy, cunningly; "have to run
                     long ways, mars'; dis yer nig mighty quick on de trigger."
                  "What do you know about triggers?" asked his master.
                  "Ky! trigger an' nigger mighty like each oder," replied Jupiter, never at a
                     loss for an answer.
                  "Can you dance for us, Jupiter?"
                  "Reckon. I can, mars'. Hab white dance or black dance?"
                  "White dance," was the answer.
                  The hunchback commenced sliding back and forth; then he suddenly paused, and
                     with ludicrous gravity declared he couldn't dance white dance.
                  He was asked why.
                  "White massas allers hab money in dar pocket," he replied.
                  A silver piece was thrown to him. He grinned as he pocketed it and began to
                     slide again. Once more he paused, saying: "Can't dance white dance."
                  "Why not, boy?" asked Kenneth, half angrily.
                  "Too black—too black," replied Jupiter, gravely shaking his head; "black all de
                     way troo;" and throwing his arms up, he began a succession of negro shakes and
                     grimaces and shuffles that were the wildest efforts imaginable—twisting his
                     body into a hundred fantastic shapes till he had worked himself into a frenzy.
                     His eyes rolled, he leaped, he laughed, he chatted, he whirled and sprang in
                     the air, till his master ordered him to desist, for the supper was yet almost
                     untasted, so much had the company been diverted by the boy.
                  "There, Jupiter, stop!—you may go now," cried Lawyer Kenneth.
                  "Mus' say, mars', bery umpolite interrupt a gen'leman when him jes' going to
                     stop! Massa minister no like it when folks go out o' chutch 'fore he say amen!"
                     and with a twist of himself and a ring of his bells, the boy ran out like a
                     monkey.
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVII.
               IN TWO PARTS.
               
                  PART I.
                  WE SOMETIMES LITTLE DREAM WHAT IS TO FOLLOW A SCENE OF BRILLIANCY
                     AND FESTIVITY.
                  
                     
                        "Oh! grief beyond all other griefs!"
                     
                  
                  AMY had been very uneasy during this performance. It did not suit her dignity;
                     and she had scarcely smiled at the sallies of the black, whom she hated most
                     intensely because he had his own way. She was also under constant apprehension
                     that her father, who had emptied glass after glass with a rapidity that was
                     almost frightful, would relapse into one of his strange moods, and startle the
                     stylish gathering more than black Jupiter's aimless freaks. She often exchanged
                     glances with her mother, and now that the excitement was over, wished that the
                     brilliant company were all at home snugly ensconced within their night-caps. It
                     made her miserable to note Dole Baker's intimacy with her father. She had sense
                     enough to despise the fop and his pretensions, thoroughly, and she knew that a
                     man of her father's intellectual abilities could never associate with the
                     brainless fellow unless he were under some obligation to him. What could it be,
                     she wondered, money or services? She knew, from some hints that she had lately
                     heard from her mother, that business was not prospering with her father; she
                     felt fearful that it was worse even than she imagined. It troubled her to note
                     their forced intimacy, and she fancied that her father was aware of her
                     anxiety.
                  The guests had assembled again in the great parlor, some dispersed into the
                     different rooms that had been arranged for the convenience of card-players,
                     singers, and dancers. Amy was asked to sing. She possessed a very sweet, but
                     not a powerful voice, and disliked to display it before friends. But her mother
                     urged, and her father coming up with his shadow following, backed the request
                     with a manner that said he would not take a refusal. So she sat down to the
                     grand instrument. It was turned toward the wall in such a manner that the
                     performer faced her audience. Her father stood at the side, his eye roving
                     restlessly about the room. Most of the company were strolling around, some in
                     the grounds, for it was a lovely night. Groups of blacks stood at the windows
                     enjoying the moving life within. Amy had sung one verse of some sweet air, when
                     she paused; her hand fell listlessly on the keys—her eyes were directed to the
                     further part of the parlor, near the door—and her father at the same time bit
                     his lip, while his brow lowered ominously. Dole Baker, on the contrary, opened
                     his black eyes to their utmost dimensions—his sallow cheek, flashed, his lips
                     parted.
                  "Who is that?" he asked, looking intently toward Lucina, who, with Mabel's arm locked in
                     hers, moved slowly across the room.
                  "Perdition!" muttered Lawyer Kenneth, his features working.
                  "What! no, no, a—Kenneth; a—you must be joking," said the libertine, moving
                     nervously forward.
                  "I am not joking, Baker! that is Lucina," said Lawyer Kenneth, in
                     a cold, stern voice. "Diamonds! diamonds!" he repeated, with a sneering voice.
                     "Amy, why does that insolent wench come in here dressed like her equals? What
                     does it mean?"
                  "I'm sure I don't know," repeated Amy, in a tone of extreme mortification; "it
                     is most absurd," she said angrily; "I shall leave the room."
                  "Is my sister insane? it is one of her freaks," he said, growing livid with
                     passion, and standing there he began to hum to himself, while the set lips and
                     labored breathing told that he was contemplating some act of resentment. He
                     glanced at his wife as he hummed. For a moment there was a flush of pride—a
                     glance of triumph, as she saw the queenly girl with her escort; then a look of
                     alarm succeeded; she met her husband's eye, and quailed, for he smiled a smile
                     that was more dreadful than the blackest frown.
                  Meanwhile, Dole Baker was astonished out of his usual dull equanimity. "Two
                     thousand—a!" he, soliloquized. "I'd a—give five a—to-morrow—a, if I couldn't
                     have her for less." Amy had hurried toward her mother.
                  "Did you know anything of this ridiculous exhibition?" she asked,
                     haughtily.
                  "Of course I did not," replied Mrs. Kenneth. A strange emotion was visible in
                     her face; her lip trembled. "Let us leave the room, Amy," she said.
                  "No! I shall go and command her to retire," exclaimed her daughter; "see how
                     people look and wonder! I will know what this means—whether it is burlesque or
                     insult;" and before her mother could prevent, she was walking swiftly down the
                     long rooms. But her voice was so choked with passion that she could not speak,
                     only point peremptorily toward the door. Lawyer Kenneth followed, with Dole
                     Baker on his arm. Making a full stop before his sister, he bowed mockingly
                     toward Lucina, saying, "Our princess appears, to advantage this
                     evening! Mr. Baker, this is the article you wish to bargain for; everything
                     belongs to me except the jewels, I believe."
                  Lucina turned very pale; so did Mabel.
                  "Brother!" the latter indignantly exclaimed, "has thee no feeling, thus to
                     outrage two helpless women?"
                  "I was speaking of this slave girl!" said Lawyer Kenneth, sternly, "who is
                     sold, or as good as sold, to my friend here. When I sent for her to
                        exhibit her, and wished her to be well dressed, I did not
                     bargain for the jewels."
                  "God will reward thee, brother!" said Mabel. "He may pour out His wrath upon
                     thee by demanding thine only child. Take care, wicked man! thee has forsaken
                     the Father of thy people, and practised iniquity; beware, lest a greater evil
                     befall thee. Has thee a heart of stone, that thee could listen unmoved to the story of this
                     poor deserted child, whom thou darest to call thy slave? I tell thee, she is
                     from henceforth my daughter, and I call heaven to witness that
                     thee shall sell her to no such man as I see before me! I will defend her with
                     my life!"
                  "Hear her! hear her! oh, hear her!" cried Lawyer Kenneth, springing forward
                     with frantic gesticulations. 
                        
                           "O! if I had the sense
                           That would balance the straw,
                           I'd choose the one I want
                           By the picture I would draw!
                        
                     
                  
                  "By heaven and hell!" he shouted, with a voice that dispersed the wandering
                     groups about him—and this he repeated like a madman, seemingly unable to say
                     another word.
                  "Come, a—come, Mr. Kenneth," said the coward Baker, "we'll a—make it all
                     a—right. The ladies are very much frightened; a—your wife a—has nearly fainted;
                     a—Miss Amy a—implores you."
                  "Oh, perdition, I say!" cried the lawyer, in a voice that sounded like a wail;
                     "insulted in my own house!" and he began using the name of has Maker in a way
                     that, for the refinement of blasphemy, beggars all description, every few
                     moments changing his deportment to sing— 
                        
                           "O! says I, I'm coming, coming,
                           O! says I, I'm coming, coming,
                           Get out of the way, get out of the way!
                           O! says I, I'm coming, coming!"
                        
                     
                  
                  The paroxysm was fully upon him; the fearful delirium had struck his brain a
                     strong blow, and reason reeled. The company left in confusion; Amy sat cowed
                     and weeping in her chamber. Mrs. Kenneth walked about distractedly; doctors
                     were hastily sent for from the town; Mabel, paralyzed with fear and grief, had
                     locked herself with Lucina in her own room, and mourned over her own
                     rashness.
                  "My foolish womanly vanity!" she exclaimed again and again, "what was I
                     thinking of?—exposing thee to deadly peril. Ah! I felt too secure in my own
                     pride and judgment, and God has punished me. Forgive me, my poor child! I can
                     scarcely forgive myself."
                  "Don't speak in that way, my dear madam," Lucina said, lifting her pale face.
                     "I have felt calm and composed through the whole. Some power above seemed to
                     sustain me. Neither Lawyer Kenneth nor the presence of that wicked man, to whom
                     he says I am to be—sold"——
                  "Never! never!" cried Mabel.
                  "I was not discomposed by either. I felt so secure—so much faith in God and
                     you!" continued Lucina, after a moment's faltering. "I pity them all; God knows
                     I do. They say that he"——she paused.
                  "I know all," Mabel returned mournfully; "the delirium of the drunkard is upon
                     him. It may be that was the cause of his rashness toward me, his only sister.
                     Alas! I am moved out of myself. I will strive to practise the meekness of my
                     religion. God forbid that I should return wrong with wrong."
                  
                  "Do—you—suppose—he—has paid for me?" asked Lucina, faltering.
                  Mabel was silent, pale, exhausted. These unusual scenes and unwonted
                     excitements were wearing out her life. She had been attacked in the early part
                     of the evening with the most violent symptoms of her disorder, and had laid
                     panting upon the couch in the room which she had taken temporarily to
                     accommodate the company with apartments on the lower floor. Hence, the late
                     hour at which she made her appearance. Even then, it was with difficulty that
                     she walked, leaning on Lucina; but she summoned strength with an almost
                     superhuman will, for she knew that her brother would demand Lucina, and feared
                     that if she went alone she might never return. She was anxious about Harry; he
                     had simply said in the note that she must not expect him till the following
                     week, as his business demanded his undivided attention.
                  The household was quiet at last; but more than one eye could not find the sweet
                     repose of slumber. The physician had calmed the lawyer with strong opiates;
                     Mrs. Kenneth, wretched and haggard, had glided to her own chamber, like a
                     ghost; here and there a light showed where some slave was passing to the
                     quarters—the deserted rooms, in darkness and disorder, gave back no echo to the
                     laughing voices that had lately sounded there.
               
               
                  PART II.
                  THE RUNAWAY SLAVE COMES HOME TO DIE.
                  Old Hepsy, now triumphant, lingered about the premises till after the hour of
                     ten; then refreshments were generously supplied to the slaves, but Hepsy
                     sternly refused to eat or drink a mouthful.
                  "Lord helping her she hadn't never tasted no vittles on mar's Kenneth's land
                     after she was free, an' Lord helpin' her she wasn't goin' to till she dyin'
                     day," she said, in answer to their invitations. So throwing on an old hood, she
                     used her staff vigorously, and was soon on her way to her cottage.
                  What a night it was! dark, but glorious. Every star seemed a ball of fire, and
                     the pines along the road just seen in outline, whispered together of God's
                     loving kindness. The way was visible, so bright were the stars, and the new
                     moon cast a faint, a very faint glow from its far-off place.
                  Old Hepsy, in this sweet and wondrous hush of nature, felt her heart stir
                     within her. Her naturally poetic temperament had not lost all the glow of
                     youth, and unconsciously she exulted in her immortality, as she turned her eyes
                     up toward the holy heavens. Her spirit grew tenderer and softer as she gazed;
                     the old defiant guest that had lodged in her soul's chamber so many years,
                     stole noiselessly out, but left an open door. The wrongs of years melted away,
                     and a calm peace stole over her—a peace to which she had long been a stranger. Her heart
                     grew human, with thoughts of the better land, and of the Saviour who had died
                     for her.
                  "'Pears to me dem heavens up dar is 'full ob de glory ob de Lord,' as Phillis
                     read it dis blessed day. Wonder ef Jerusalem is underneaf 'em, and dey is a
                     great curtain da' lets de light out in leetle chinks? Well, tank de Lord!—dar's
                     a city whar poor slaves never'll suffer no more. Mars Hollister'll stan'
                     outside de shinin' gates an' ole Hepsy be safe inside, 'long her blessed Lord
                     and only Master—'deed will she! Oh, glory be to de Lord! when'll I
                     see da shinin' city!—when'll I tell de Lord Hesef' all my sorrows?" and she
                     began to sing, in a not unmusical voice: 
                        
                           "Oh, Lord o' Israel,
                           Sanctify my soul!
                           Oh, Lord o' Israel,
                           Sanctify my soul!
                           Sinner o' man, you better begin,
                           De gates'll be shut, an' you can't come in;
                           Oh, Lord o' Israel,
                           Sanctify my soul!"
                        
                     
                  
                  "Bless de Lord, I's happy now! Goin' home to glory pretty soon!—feels better
                     when I thinks of poor mars' Kenneth—Lord forgive he, an' make he fit to die.
                     Bless de Lord! light as a feather! ain't got no sorrow—wha's gwine to happen to
                     ole Hepsy
                  "'Pears if I hears somebody a groanin'" she exclaimed, pausing and listening
                     intently, but there was no sound. On she went singing, and giving vent to many
                     a pious ejacula- tion; thinking of the glory to come; forgetting all her
                     wrongs, and griefs, and sorrows, in the new-found peace with God. The little
                     taper she left burning lighted up the window of her solitary dwelling; she
                     hurried forward eagerly as she saw it, and soon reached the gate. Nobody had
                     disturbed it; the latch was just as she had left it in the door. Going up the
                     little path, she gained the entrance, took out the nail that fastened it, and
                     went in.
                  "'Pears if de ole room full ob glory!" she cried, as she entered; "wonder if
                     old Hepsy goin' straight to heaven dis yer night? oh, dear Lord! meet all de
                     chill'n—all but poor Jack—glory! glory!— 
                        
                           "Oh, Lord o' Israel,
                           Sanctify my soul!
                           Sinner o' man, you better begin,
                           De gates'll be shut, an, you can't come in—
                           Oh, Lord o' Israel,
                           Sanctify my soul!"
                        
                     
                  
                  So singing she hung the old hood on its accustomed peg, took her pipe, lighted
                     it, drew a few whiffs, laid it by, and preparing herself for rest, she knelt by
                     her humble couch, prayed fervently, and placing the taper light by the side of
                     the bed, in a chair, a thing unusual with her, she was soon asleep.
                  Night gathered more, closely around the little cabin; the stars looked solemnly
                     down; the woods were darker; the trees had lost their distinctness of outline,
                     and could no longer be seen. Now and then a carriage was driven along, the
                     voice of the reveller sounding on the still air, or a horse's gallop was heard. Nobody saw that black,
                     crouching figure drawing along silently, except when some fierce pang of
                     dissolving nature forced itself to be heard by the listening wind. So painfully
                     it crawled, creeping close to the bars and the hedges, that it was evidently in
                     the last stages of some mortal disease. At length, it rested before the gate
                     that led to old Hepsy's house, laying its thin wreek of a body close up to the
                     paling. So motionless it laid, it did not seem to have life any longer. But
                     life and consciousness were there, though every nerve was pierced with pain,
                     and every breath rasped the chest, and shook the quivering limbs. Presently, as
                     if with a spasmodic effort, it lifted itself sufficiently to open the gate, and
                     feebly moaning at every motion, it reached the door and sunk upon the
                     threshold. Within, the old grey negress slumbered sweetly with a smile upon her
                     aged features. No thoughts of coming sorrow, but rather of heavenly joy,
                     tenanted her bosom; and it was not till the faint raps upon the door had been
                     thrice repeated that she lifted her head wearily, saying, half asleep,—
                  "Who's there?"
                  The knock sounded again.
                  "The Lord has come for ole Hepsy!" she cried, starting erect in the bed; "well,
                     blessed marstr! I's ready, jus' le' me pray once mo'. Sho! da's the same sound
                     I's heard agin.—Guess I's dreamin'—'somebody sick, sartin;" and catching up
                     some of her apparel, she threw it on and hastened to the door.
                  "Who's you?" she called. "I's got a mighty long gun here; if you 'spects to
                     steal anything from ole Hepsy, you's got to be smart, nigger or white man."
                  A voice sounded outside. The old negress threw her head back, gave one loud
                     cry, and with a vigorous push sent the bolt that confined the door into the
                     middle of the room.
                  "Oh, my blessed Lord! oh, my holy Marster! oh, Jack, Jack! my poor boy! oh,
                     Jack! whar'd ye come from dis night! Oh, Heavenly Father! speak to your pore
                     old mammy!"
                  She had fallen on the threshhold, and the black shadow lay in her arms, pressed
                     to her heart, moaning and sobbing.
                  "I's sick, almos, gone," gasped the figure; "hush! dey's after me;
                     don't—let"—
                  As if it were but the burden of a straw's weight, old Hepsy lifted the wan
                     creature and laid him on her own bed then shrank from the sight with a groan of
                     anguish. He was a fearful spectacle. His grey hair was matted, his clothes were
                     shredded up to his waist, his feet and legs bloody, his eyes large, hollow, and
                     lustrous; his cheeks withered to the bone; his figure a mere skeleton. A moment
                     the negro-mother stood shrinking, horror-struck; then closing her eyes, like
                     one who is deadly sick, she turned away, hurried to the closet, took down a
                     broken bottle, and pouring some wine out, put it to his lips. The drink seemed
                     to revive him, and be smiled.
                  "Is you hungry, boy?" the old woman asked, keeping the blinding tears back.
                  
                  "Yes; reckon I's mos' don' bein' hungry, though. Is yer do' fasten'? dey's
                     arter me!"
                  "Who's arter you?" asked Hepsy fiercely, breaking some bread into the wine and
                     water.
                  "I's run away, you knows."
                  "Thank God!" said old Hepsy, fervently.
                  "And dey's huntin' me."
                  "Let 'em dar to come near me!" cried Hepsy, and her
                     eyes glared like those of a she-wolf; "I's locked de do', an' I's got de ole
                     gun yet! You jes' lay still, an' git well."
                  "Never git well," said Jack, faintly; "feel it here."
                  "Sho! de Lord's able," replied Hepsy, in a broken voice.
                  "De Lord's able, I knows; but I's all gone inside."
                  "Sho! jus' you go to sleep; I set here. Dar, take yo'r ole mammy's hand, same's
                     you used to, when"—low, choking sobs prevented her utterance, and she sat,
                     striving for composure.
                  "Don't feel so bad, mammy;" said the negro. Then he added with a grateful
                     smile:
                  "I hasn't seen you mos' twenty years."
                  The old negress sat rocking her body to and fro. Her eyes were on his face,
                     striving to read the lineaments of nearly twenty years ago. He left her erect
                     and stalwart, and here he was lying before her, broken in body and spirit, the
                     ruin of a man.
                  "No!" old Hepsy burst savagely forth, as if replying to the thought. "He didn't
                     do it, de Lord! He didn't do it!—no, no! don't blame de Lord! but curse dem dat
                     did; curse 'em, Lord! curse 'em body an' soul!"
                  "Lord Jesus, forgive an' bless 'em;" said the dying man, raising his clasped
                     hands. "They's been drefful hard on me; 'specially mars' Lewis! Ordered poor
                     Jack to whip he own child. "Couldn't do it, massa," I says. 'Do it, or I knock
                     you' black brains out,' say massa Lewis. "Couldn't do it, massa!" I says agin;
                     'kill me fus, massa Lewis!' So he gib me sixty; an' nex' day he gib me twenty
                     mo' Keep me till I's well; going to gib me sixty 'gin if I no' beat my
                        own chile! Mighty hard forgib massa Lewis; ole debbil fight
                     bad, but I rastle wid de Lord, an' by'm by, de Lord He gib um grace. Neber feel
                     hard no more—heart all full of love for massa Lewis. Going home now—fight all
                     over—work all done—going to victory—Jesus take poor ole nigger to glory!
                     Hallelujah! let um hear now!" he cried, raising his hands in pious ecstasy.
                     "Sees de new Jerusalem! 'sees de angels shinin' dar—sees de streets ob gold.
                     Hallelujah! Suffered de last time;—pore old flesh neber smart no more?
                     Hallelujah!"
                  Old Hepsy sat awe-struck, gazing at the changing features. She knew that he was
                     dying,—he, her only son, her only living child. Not dying as you or I may die,
                     surrounded by those who have ministered to every want—but murdered by cold and
                     brutal degrees. Whipped, starved, hounded, hunted, kicked, cursed, branded,
                     despised! A poor, wronged, helpless being; with a human, tender heart, that had
                     never wantonly done harm to a worm;—a good, faithful, loving heart, that,
                     lacerated and torn as it was, could rise, to a heroism like that of the
                     thorn-crowned CHRIST, and with bleeding lips ask that his scourgers might be
                        forgiven—they who had bruised his
                     life out of him, and ground the soul that God breathed into him into the very
                     dust! Here was a sight that the proud slave-holder might tremble to look upon,
                     and read in letters of blood the answer to his impious declaration "that
                     niggers have neither human flesh, nor blood, nor possess human affections, or
                     immortal souls." There were angels at that bedside of that dying old slave;
                     Hepsy felt their presence. Heaven's splendors fell on that suffering brow, and
                     the great heart of Christ rejoiced at the recompense which he had purchased for
                     that fleeting life of tears and groans.
                  "Mother—I doesn't see you no more," murmured the slave, groping for her hand:
                     "'pears like I'm going into a dark place; but de Lord He won't leave me, nor
                     forsake me! Chill'n," he added, softly; "won't see you' ole father no more;—be
                     good chill'n—an'—I'll wait for you—'de odder side—'dars no mo'—slav—"——
                  Dead!
                  Poor old Hepsy! she felt, the weight of her hundred and ten years now. An
                     inexpressible anguish bowed her frame; she sat looking chillingly—stonily—ever
                     and anon passing her hand down the cold face.
                  The world was dreary enough before; it was a tomb now. It took a great while to
                     realize the change; it had all happened in so brief a space—the waking, the
                     meeting, the parting, and when, at last, the overwhelming conviction flashed on
                     her soul, the paralysis passed, and she uttered one long sharp wail of sorrow.
                     With the rush of her wild emotion came back all her long hoarded hatred of
                     oppression.
                  "Last one gone!" she cried, bitterly, as she performed the offices, for the
                     dead; "Old Hepsy want to die now. Oh, mars' Kenneth—God reckon wid you'fore
                     long! Poor niggers! Bring chill'n into de world—suffers all de misery, an' den
                     has to see 'em knocked and kicked, an' beat an' killed! Oh, Lord!—no, Jack, you
                     wouldn't want me say that—poor boy!—but He will, sure's dar's a heaven—He
                        will!"
                  
                  In the dark hour preceding day, Amy was wakened by Maggie Willis.
                  "For heaven's sake, what is it?" she asked, trembling from head to foot.
                  Amy listened, then started up in bed.
                  "It's the African death-wail," she said; "nobody sings it but Old Hepsy," she
                     added, in a voice of alarm; "they say"——
                  "What? do speak out! I never heard anything so sad in my life. The cold chills
                     are running all over me."
                  "Why, they say it forbodes death or misfortune to whoever hears it."
                  "Oh! is that all? you superstitious child! Do you believe it?"
                     asked Maggy, her voice far from being steady.
                  "Of course, not; but that old Hepsy is such a queer piece. She thinks father
                     has wronged her because he; sold her children, and every year she grows more
                     vindictive. I do think we've got the worst set of niggers," she added, half
                     crying.
                  
                  "What in the world has sent the old creature here at this time?"
                  "Oh, she's a crazy thing," said Amy, with a sigh, for she thought of her
                     father.
                  Mrs. Kenneth, who alternated between her husband's room and her own, nearly
                     every hour through the night, heard Old Hepsy. The sorrowful wail could
                     scarcely make her more miserable than she was, but it came to her ears like an
                     evil omen. Her husband still lay in a stupid sleep, under the influence of
                     opiates; she dreaded his waking—she, knew his first cry would be for wine—his
                     next might be for vengeance.
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               IN FOUR PARTS.
               
                  PART I.
                  MAGGIE, THE SLAVE-HOLDER, BEGINS TO APPRECIATE THE SITUATION OF
                     LUCINA, AND TO FEEL FOR HER THE PITY OF A GENEROUS HEART.
                  
                     
                        "Oh! perjured woman thou dost stone my heart!"
                     
                  
                  NOT SO. Lawyer Kenneth had work to do. He stifled the ravenous cry of appetite
                     and held it down, at least for the time, under the control of a stronger
                     passion. He was deadly pale, and the only memory of the preceding night was
                     that one of Lucina, flashing in jewels. His suspicions had been not only
                     strengthened, but confirmed; the weight of his cruel anger was to rest on the
                     head of an unoffending girl. Lawyer Kenneth was a man of vehement passions, but
                     till within a few years they had been kept in masterly control. He had a high
                     sense of the dignity of the married state, and for his right hand would not
                     have been guilty of infidelity. He had a great regard for the truth; despised
                     deception and petty intrigue; but in every one of these points his honor had
                     been outraged. Hence, as a purely worldly man, though a moralist, he could
                     grasp at no com- pensating
                     blessing—his extreme pride would not allow him to seek for the justice of the
                     law—his rigid regard for truth would not let him live in accordance with the
                     prescribed rules of the marital relations. Everybody knew how it was. He never
                     scrupled to take his friends into his wing of the house—and everybody called
                     him a tyrant and pitied his wife. To one vice he had addicted himself, as the
                     reader has seen—nay, more than one—for he loved the gaming table as well as the
                     bowl. The latter habit was of later growth, however—he played
                     desperately—recklessly, and was alreadily heavily in debt. With his fondness
                     for wine had come its bane—a fiendish frenzy, and fearful disposition to
                     blasphemy. Those who lived near him, and heard him swear in his dreadful moods
                     (for we are dressing up no character of fiction), say that the boldest infidel
                     would shudder at his oaths, the hardest heart kindle with indignation to hear
                     the name of God insulted in such ingeniously wicked language.
                  Never, before Lucina's advent, had, he deigned to more than merely notice Dolan
                     Baker, whose foppish ways and loose morals had always disgusted him. But now,
                     the spirit of revenge seemed to change his whole character; he hated the girl,
                     and determined to make her an instrument of torture to probe the heart that had
                     deceived him. He saw from the first, that his sister, with her Northern
                     prejudices, would become Lucina's advocate and friend. Hence his command that
                     she should serve her, in order that she might feel the change in reserve for
                     her more keenly. He knew that the sensitive heart of Mabel Van Broek would be
                     moved to pity and indignation, but it never entered his mind that she would go
                     so far as to dream of adopting her, of purchasing her freedom! He knew that his
                     wife dared not interfere, but he saw her in constant and deadly terror—saw her
                     cheek grow paler, and her step less steady—and by slow degress, he was looking
                     her to death. Every time his eye met hers, it seemed to flash her coming doom
                     over her soul.
                  He did not call for wine when he awoke on the following morning, though his
                     servant was so confident he would, that he had with extreme pains procured
                     every variety of his favorite beverage. It needed all Lawyer Kenneth's strength
                     of will to keep brain and tongue steady—he was constantly on the brink of
                     madness.
                  With the aid of his servant he dressed himself, and leaning on a cane, went
                     slowly down stairs. Hollister stood in the hall, hat in hand.
                  "You are too early," said his master, gruffly; I can't attend to you now; I've
                     told you several times not to come here before breakfast. If you disobey orders
                     in that way, look out—some fine day you change owners."
                  Hollister turned away—his manner almost defiant, and had reached the door when
                     the lawyer called out:—
                  "Here, boy! come back!" He was in the mood despotic, and disposed to tyrannize
                     a little.
                  Hollister seemed to feel ten thousand invisible cords of iron drawing him
                     through the door, but mastering his disposition to rebel, he turned back
                     shortly.
                  "Sullen, hey?" exclaimed his master, lifting his eye- brows; "come, you white nigger, no airs—now what
                     did you want of me?"
                  Hollister looked at him before he spoke. The glance was not defiant, but cool,
                     steady, intense, as man may look on man when he feels his manhood despised, and
                     Kenneth winced under the gaze. Then the slave said deliberately, "I came to say
                     that there's a runaway on your premises."
                  "You intend to join him, eh? and have come to give warning, perhaps. Well, all
                     I can say is, if any nigger curse runs away from me, I won't run after him—do
                     you hear?"
                  Hollister had never been addressed in this way before, although the lawyer had
                     used threatening language. He drew a long breath as he replied—
                  "No, sir; I shouldn't be such a fool as to give warning, if I did intend to run
                     away."
                  "H'm! do you think you shall study for the bar, or one of the other
                     professions?" asked Kenneth, insultingly, measuring Hollister with cool,
                     ironical glance; "a nigger lawyer would be a devilish pretty sight to see! I
                     advise you to give your attention to theology; the abolitionist girls would
                     adore a nigger preacher, and you might aspire to the hand of a
                        white woman, even."
                  "Will you hear what I have to say, sir?" asked Hollister, respectfully, though
                     his blood ran like melted lead through every vein.
                  "Yes, your reverence; speak on," said Kenneth, laughing lightly.
                  "Old Hepsy's son, Jack, lies dead in her cabin."
                  The lawyer started.
                  "Ah! that is news; did the rascal run away?"
                  "I believe he did," replied Hollister.
                  "Not much of a loss," muttered his master; "he was a lazy scamp."
                  "Keene wished me to see if you had anything to say about the funeral,"
                     continued Hollister.
                  "Funeral! Put the nigger in a box and give him a hole somewhere. Funeral! tell
                     Keene to look after his own affairs. Funeral!—niggers have funerals!"
                  "Old Hepsy is free, sir," said Hollister, quietly.
                  "The devil! so she is; I forgot that—and the nigger—why, he's free too, by
                     heaven!"
                  "Yes, sir; he is free," responded Hollister, turning his face
                     away—"and, as you say, 'free by heaven,'" he added.
                  "No remarks, sirrah! you grow impertinent. Don't presume on your white blood,
                     because there's nigger enough in you to make a good speculation."
                  Hollister did not reply; but he turned as white as a sheet, and seemed not to
                     know what to do with his hands. Kenneth stood back a little as he saw the glare
                     in his eye.
                  "Hepsey may help herself," at last he said; "I'll have nothing to do with it. I
                     wish the niggers were all in hell; do you hear? I have good cause to wish every
                     cursed nigger there! That's your answer;" and he turned abruptly away.
               
               
                  
                  PART II.
                  THE GENEROUS HEART OF MAGGIE WILLIS.
                  Mrs. Kenneth was not at the breakfast table; neither was Mabel Van Broek.
                     Hattie and Maggie appeared pale and spiritless. They wished to leave, but Amy
                     was terrified at the thought. Her mother joined with her in entreating them to
                     stay their visit out, and they had reluctantly consented, chiefly on Amy's
                     account. Breakfast was eaten in moody silence. The lawyer now and then ventured
                     a witty thing, but his mood was so uncertain, that they dared not reply. At
                     last he said, playing with his spoon, for he had no appetite—
                  "Well, Amy, your slave prodigy will have an opportunity of practising her
                     graces elsewhere. I've sold her."
                  "Sold her! Oh, papa! what will mamma say?" exclaimed Amy, innocently. She could
                     not have ventured a, more imprudent answer. Lawyer Kenneth swore a fearful
                     oath, and every dish rattled with the force with which his clenched hand came
                     down upon the table. The girls sprang from their seats; but in an instant he
                     was calm again.
                  "Your mother must submit to my decision," he said.
                  "Of course she will," replied the frightened girl.
                  "I sold her last night to Dole Baker, for a couple of thousand. Dole is a weak
                     fellow, very; but I'm inclined to think he'll make a very
                     indulgent master."
                  The insinuation here was so broad that blushes covered
                        MAGGIE WILLIS.
                     
                      every face, and Mag bounced up from
                     the table, giving him a look from her angry eyes that he winced under, though
                     he laughed.
                  "Oh, Maggie! do remember father isn't himself," said Amy, as Maggie hurried
                     from the room.
                  "He's a wicked man! he's a wicked man!" cried Maggie, vehemently; "selling that
                     girl to such a scamp. I don't care if she is a slave; she's too
                     good for that fate! It's just like poor Dinny, only Lucina is every way her
                     superior. I'm not one of that sort that believe negroes have no feelings, if I
                     do laugh and joke about it sometimes. I say it's awful—its awful! for that poor
                     girl to be sold to a man like that Baker!"
                  Oh, Maggie! Maggie!" exclaimed Hattie, "you make Amy feel dreadfully."
                  "I'm sure I can't help it," said Amy, with tears in her eyes; "I don't like the
                     girl, to be sure, but I wouldn't wish her harm."
                  "Well," can't we stop it some way?" asked Maggie; "can't we reason with him,
                     pray to him? Why, only think what a girl she is! and only think what a wretch
                     that Baker is! Can't we do something to stop it?"
                  "You heard him say he had sold her," said Amy; "it is too
                     late!"
                  "Oh, no! Why won't your Aunt Mabel save her? Why won't she buy her and set her
                     free? She has money enough; your father won't care, so he gets the money, will
                     he? Let's go ask her," cried Maggie, now thoroughly roused; but Amy held back.
                     She did not want to see Lu- cina; it
                     smote upon her conscience. She had striven to influence her father against her,
                     and she had just begun to comprehend that there were motives underlying her
                     father's hostility to this slave that she could not understand, and that
                     involved most serious consequences.
                  "Well, if you won't, I will; I feel brave enough to fight a lion;" and away
                     went Maggie, her charming, bright little face all agitation.
                  She knocked at the door. A faint voice said, "come in." So faint and soft it
                     was, that Maggie hardly dared to enter, for fear a spirit had spoken.
                  Lucina was bathing the white brow of the Friend, who lay back exhausted with
                     the fatigue of dressing, like a snowy lily struck helpless from the stem. Both
                     Lucina and Mabel had passed a sleepless night. Mabel's cheeks, brow, and eyes
                     looked transparent, so fair and of such unearthly light they were. Her
                     breathing was hurried; she was ill—ill enough to need the attendance of a
                     physician, and one had just been sent for.
                  "I'm afraid I ought not to come in," said Maggie, walking very softly, and
                     looking towards Lucina, "but I—I—had a favor to ask."
                  "Sit down, dear," said Mabel, in the same weak voice; "ask what thee will; if
                     it is in my power I will do it."
                  "Well, Mrs. Van Broek, the thought struck me that may be you would buy Lucina."
                     The slave girl's face grew pleased, eager, and then sad again.
                  "Willingly—most willingly would I, dear child. Oh! the Father above knows how
                     willingly!"
                  "Dear Mrs. Van Broek, you make my heart glad. Oh! will you buy
                     her?"
                  "I have offered any price," said Mabel, "but my brother will not
                     listen to me. He tells me that this town and ten others like it, could not buy
                     Lucina. I know not what spite he holds against the poor child, but certain I am
                     it is no common resentment."
                  "It's a shame!" exclaimed Maggie—"it's a heartless, wicked thing!" Mabel's eyes
                     were close shut, but there were tears pressing through.
                  "I'm always saying something wrong," said Maggie, impulsively; "will you
                     forgive me? I forgot that Uncle Kenneth is your brother."
                  "Sometimes," said Mabel, grievingly, "I wonder if he is."
                  Lucina threw herself forward on the foot of the couch—"Oh, that is his voice!"
                     she cried. "Has he come after me? has he come after me?"
                  "Lock the doors," said Mabel, rising.
                  Lucina flew to one door, Maggie to the other. All were pale now. Mabel looked
                     very determined. The moments passed in profound silence. Soon footsteps were
                     heard advancing, then came a rap at the door.
                  "Speak for me," said Mabel, nodding towards Maggie. Accordingly, Maggie asked
                     "Who is there?"
                  "I, Phillis," said a voice; "marst'r wants see Miss Van Broek."
                  "She is quite ill; she cannot see any one," replied Maggie, who, now that she
                     was involved, entered into the spirit of the scene.
                  
                  "Marst'r says he will come in," returned Phillis.
                  "Mrs. Van Broek cannot see any one to-day," returned Maggie, after a short
                     conference with Mabel.
                  "Look here! open the door," said Lawyer Kenneth, "I'm in no mood to be
                     fooled!"
                  "Oh, save me! save me!" cried Lucina, with chattering teeth.
                  "Maggie, dear, will thee look at the window-fastenings?" said Mabel, in a low
                     voice; "then close the shutters below, the ventilators over the doors will
                     admit sufficient air."
                  "Just send Lucina out here," said Lawyer Kenneth; "her mistress wants her."
                  "Must I go?" cried Lucina, with staring eyes.
                  "No! Dole Baker is out there," whispered Maggie. "I wouldn't go if I were you;
                     I'd die first!"
                  "I WILL!" said Lucina, resolutely, and she glanced up to the pistol, whose
                     silver mountings gleamed whitely in the dim light.
                  "Oh, don't thee think of a thing so dreadful!" said Mabel, faintly.
                  "It is killing you!" said Lucina, passionately.
                  "No! God gives me strength," whispered Mabel; "pray to Him—pray silently. Oh,
                     supplicate for His help now."
                  The handle of the door turned impatiently, and a muttered oath sounded at the
                     key-hole.
                  "This is a pretty position for a gentleman to be placed in, in his own house!"
                     cried Lawyer Kenneth, after several fruitless attempts; "this is meddling in my
                     affairs with a vengeance! I'll have that girl if I raze the house."
                  "He has sent for Hollister," said Maggie, her ear at the keyhole, "to see if he
                     can take the door down."
                  Lucina had grown calmer, though she was still white and frightened.
                  "Hollister has come. Keene, from the other place, is with him," said Maggie,
                     reconnoitering through the keyhole by means of a paper tunnel which she had
                     made. "Uncle doesn't say a word about the door. Gracious! you better believe he
                     is white, though. He is talking to Keene, now, and they are all walking away.
                     There! they are gone; now breathe free," she said, turning from the door, and
                     throwing herself into a seat—"at least for a while; the siege isn't over," she
                     added, laughing nervously. Then, turning to Mabel, she exclaimed, "how can you
                     stay here? and so sick, too! Dear! if he was my brother ten thousand times, I
                     wouldn't subject myself to this kind of treatment. There! I'm saying something
                     again."
                  "I am hoping Harry will come to-day," said Mabel, "and I am also hoping that my
                     brother will relent, and sell the poor child to me."
                  "Suppose I go out and see what they are doing now," said Maggie; "I'm not
                     afraid of them, and I can come and report progress. The coast is clear! Lucina,
                     lock the door after me. I shall be back again soon."
                  They sat silently together, the slave and the Quakeress. Ever and anon Lucina
                     would bathe the pallid brow of her friend. The poor girl felt nearly ready to
                     despair; the cause of anguish to one she had learned to love tenderly—the means
                     of making a whole household uneasy—surrounded with mystery—apparently hated by Lawyer Kenneth
                     and his daughter—it was sufficient sorrow to unsettle a stronger brain than
                     even hers. She felt degraded, insulted, shamed; her soul shrank from
                     contamination with impurity, and she knew too well for what purpose she was to
                     be sold. Nowhere now but to Mabel Van Broek could she look for aid, and even in
                     that direction it seemed to have failed her. She could think of but one
                     resort—death; die she would, before she would submit to the ignominous fate
                     before her; the struggle would be but momentary, the shock unfelt, and God,
                     seeing her great strait, her terrible sacrifice, would forgive her. Thus she
                     reasoned to herself in the darkened room. Once her heart leaped at another
                     thought. Could she but throw herself on the protection of some minister of the
                     gospel! She had heard that Lawyer Kenneth had been once or twice dissuaded from
                     some freak of rashness by a Reverend Mr. Ramsey—Elder Ramsey they called him.
                     She had heard of it incidentally, through some conversation of the chambermaids
                     with each other, and she wondered in her mind if it would be possible for her
                     to gain access to him. He was a good Christian man, they said, an excellent
                     holy man, and was called a servant of Christ. He would assuredly
                     look with abhorrence upon a deed in contemplation of so hideous a character.
                     She had been accustomed to rely upon the advice of her minister at the North.
                     She remembered his gentleness, his sanctity, his hatred of wrong and
                     oppression, his readiness to help the afflicted and the down-trodden. The
                     recollection of his mild face, white hairs and saint-like smile, brought the
                     tears into her eyes, and already she had associated Elder Ramsey with all the
                     virtues that belonged to this good and true Christian man. Could she but get to
                     his presence, tell her story, and ask his protection and coöperation with her
                     friends, possibly he could prevail on her master to part with her to Mabel Van
                     Broek. All agitation, she imparted her wishes and hopes to Mabel. The latter
                     listened and encouraged. She, too, in her simplicity, thought the professed
                     servants of the blessed Christ everywhere impelled by the same motives, guided
                     by the same sentiments of Christian love and brotherhood, remembered
                        "them that are in bonds, as bound with them."
                  "We will talk with this little Maggie, here, who has disappointed me very
                     agreeably," she said, after a few moments of thought. "She will no doubt manage
                     to convey thee there. Don't grieve so; thee will kill thyself. Believe that God
                     hath better things in store for thee."
               
               
                  PART III.
                  THE SHADOW OF THE COFFIN.
                  Old Hepsy sat beside her dead. Straight and composed he laid who had not where
                     to lay his head but a few nights previous. The face, though almost frightful
                     from emaciation, wore yet a-smile and an expression of calmness and serenity.
                     He was decently dressed with a new white gown and a black silk neck-tie. Hepsy
                     had in the previous years of her
                     liberty earned something by knitting, and had a little hoard laid by for the
                     expenses of her own funeral. Determined that her "poor boy," as she still
                     called him, should have a handsome burial, she had taken every cent of her
                     savings, and spent all to procure him suitable clothes, a handsome coffin and
                     sufficient attendance. She sat now, brooding over her life of wrong and
                     suffering, and the woes of the man who lay before her, and who had been so good
                     a son to her. As usual, hard thoughts of Lawyer Kenneth were upper-most—aye,
                     even revengeful thoughts. She had attired herself in her best gown and finest
                     white handkerchief—her countenance was composed and solemn—her lips pressed
                     tightly together. Phillis kept her silent company.
                  A rap at the door, and Keene and Hollister came in, bearing a neat coffin. Old
                     Hepsy muttered, as she looked at it: "Pore boy! didn't think of dis yer
                     yisterdy morn'n!"
                  "But how much better, mother, to die here in your arms than down in that cursed
                     South, where he suffered so much?" said Keene.
                  "Tanks to blessed Marstr, yes!" said Hepsy, bowing her body reverently. "Ole
                     Hepsy ain't got much feelin' now—over a hundred!" She shook her head, while
                     blinding tears ran down the seams of her aged face. "I knows he's gone to
                     glory," she sobbed; "but someways I feels, all alone, now."
                  "Here are two stout fellows, ready to do anything for you, mother," said Keene,
                     his lip trembling with sympathy.
                  "But you can't reckon for pore Jack," said the old negress, still sobbing.
                  "I'll reckon for him and myself too, before long," muttered
                     Hollister, savagely.
                  Hepsy's eye kindled through the tears—"been praying that you' eyes be opened,
                     boy. Lord's got somethin' in store for mars' Kenneth! Dar, go way now, chill'n.
                     Stop! has mars' Kenneth rid by dis morn'n?"
                  "No; Spitfire was being brought out as I came from there, just now. Shouldn't
                     wonder if he was along any minute," said Hollister.
                  "Well, you jes' go 'way, boys; leave ole Hepsy 'lone," said the negress.
                  "But we're going to put him in."
                  "You jes' go 'long—come agin—time'nuf for dat—fun'ral ain't till six—go 'long
                     honeys—come agin—don't put he out ob sight yet."
                  Touched by her tears and pathetic manner, the two men left her, saying that
                     they should return. As she saw them leave the gate, she started up, exclaiming,
                     "Come, Phillis, honey, just you take onto toder end, an' help me carry dis yer
                     coffin out dar."
                  Phillis shrank back. "Don't dar tetch it," she cried.
                  "Jes' you take hold, I tells you!" cried Hepsy, vehemently; "take hold, or ole
                     woman's curse follow ye; take hold, I tells ye!"
                  The frightened girl-dared not but obey. Out in the hot, shining sun they went,
                     bearing the coffin, the old negress at its head.
                  "Dar, honey! I blesses ye; set it here on de bench a minit, till I sees how de sun falls," and she
                     went forward, holding out her shrivelled arm.
                  "Mos' twelve," she muttered; "jes move dis yer bench—dar! da's it shu!—Now let
                     he come; good Lord, send he! Ef he horse go on de shadder, den I sing glory to
                     God."
                  The coffin presented a, singular sight. Elevated on the high bench which had
                     been expressly prepared by old Hepsy, it stood slanting a little, projecting
                     from the fence, and its shadow lengthened nearly across the road.
                  "Come in, honey," said old Hepsy, solemnly; "I's done chile."
                  They sat together, Phillis, who had a mortal terror at sight of death,
                     crouching back—old Hepsy near the window looking out through the thin
                     curtain.
                  "Hush! honey, hush! he coming!" she exclaimed suddenly, apparently greatly
                     excited, and leaning forward, a strangely vindictive expression crossing her
                     features, "bless de Lord! da's mars' Kenneth. I knows da' Spitfire's heel!"
                  Nearer it came, and nearer the quick, sharp ring of hoofs, and swiftly the
                     lawyer rode by, never looking toward the cabin. He had not gone a rod before he
                     reined up, checked his horse, turned him short, and cantered back, pausing to
                     look at the coffin that had struck his eye in passing. Old Hepsy stood back
                     with clasped hands, her features expressing the intensity of her satisfaction.
                     "Rode right in de shadder!" she cried, "right through it! right
                        ober it! right up to it!"—then walking directly to
                     the corpse, she exclaimed—"neber mind, Jack, pore soul! you meet he fo' dis
                     year up. De coffin say so!"
                  Phillis gazed toward her, helplessly, as if fascinated.
                  "Needn't look so, chile—mars' Kenneth gone?" asked Hepsy.
                  "No, he jes going," replied Phillis, as the lawyer rode off.
                  "Phillis, does ye know what I's did, chile?" asked the negress, a shade of
                     triumph in her face.
                  "Sure I doesn't," said Phillis, trembling.
                  "Catch he shadder! da's wha' I did—chile, mars' Kenneth neber lib troo
                        dis year; can't do it—it's umpossible."
                  "Oh, Hepsy! you's wicked!" exclaimed Phillis, horror-struck.
                  "Chile!" exclaimed old Hepsy, rising with sudden majesty, "does ye know I's
                     ober a hundred? I's wicked, is I? den wha's mars' Kenneth? Sell all my chil'ln
                     hey! Look dar! an' look dar!" pointing to scars on the face, hands, and neck of
                     the corpse, "look all ober; 'pore soul!—Dem gone kill he; and mars' Kenneth do
                     'em, all same; he kill he! Now chile, I's de wrath ob de Lord. Lord say, 'cut
                     down dat tree; don't b'ar no figs any more; b'ar thorns and thistles—scratch
                     people an' tar' dar flesh—cut down dat ar' tree'—an ole Hepsy hear da' voice in
                     de night seas'n, an' she say 'good Lord, wha' we do?' an' de voice say, 'catch
                     um shaddor, an' make um die; don't let um do no mo' mischief, case killed nuff
                     pore slaves already;' an' so I do as de Lord says—case I's de judgment ob de
                     Lord—da's so! Good many tings de judgment ob de Lord. Sometimes ships sail on sea—great wind comes—storm blows
                     da ship—water drink him up; da ship judgment ob de Lord. Ole Hepsy's slave
                     judgment ob de Lord!"
                  Phillis did not reply; it was logic too deep for her; but she did not object
                     when Hepsy asked her to go and help her in again with the coffin. She stood
                     more in fear than ever of this terrible judgment, with her massy white head,
                     and grim ebon features.
               
               
                  PART IV.
                  THE YEARNING CRY OF THE LAWYER'S WIFE.
                  The clock had struck two. The coffin stood on the table, its tenant within.
                     Hepsy hobbled up and down the room, leaning on her cane. The tall form was
                     bowed—the tearless eyes fixed on the ground. Every few moments some visitor
                     would enter, look in silence upon the dead, and retire, sometimes essaying a
                     few words by way of consolation. At length, a slight figure left a carriage
                     that had driven, up to the gate, and, walking with hesitating steps, came
                     slowly into the cottage. Hepsy did not look up, but kept on her monotonous
                     travel.
                  "Hepsy, I'm very sorry for you," said a soft voice.
                  The old negress turned about almost defiantly.
                  "Oh! it's you, missis, is it?" she said, after a troubled glance, "well—don't
                     matter much, now," and she walked again. Mrs. Kenneth stood in the middle of
                     the floor, her veil thrown back; she had worn no bonnet; her hollow eyes red
                     with much weeping, her pale face seeming almost shadow-like.
                  "Can't I do anything for you, Hepsy?" she asked again.
                  "No—too late now! I's almost home;" replied the old negress, falteringly. "See
                     my chill'n befo' long; 'deed will I, fo' long."
                  "I didn't know it till just now," said Mrs. Kenneth, looking at the corpse, and
                     recoiling. Hepsy saw the motion, and shrugged her shoulders violently.
                  "Da's white man's work!" she exclaimed, going close to Mrs. Kenneth; "dar's
                     none ob de Lord's work."
                  "I'm, sorry for you, Hepsy—I'm sorry for everybody who suffers now;" replied
                     Mrs. Kenneth, in a subdued voice.
                  "Ky! 'pears ef you's changed," said old Hepsy, gazing at the face before
                     her.
                  "Yes, Hepsy, I am changed! I'm weary, weary of the world—I wish I
                     laid there, where he is," and she covered her eyes, from which the
                     tears were falling again.
                  "Sho! honey, 'pears if you look like your pore mother, 'fore she die; she lay
                     her head on my shoulder, an' say, 'oh, Hepsy! I's drefful tired of livin'—an'
                     she sigh in such a way, make my ole' heart ache.
                     Well—honey—doesn't wonder, 'deed I doesn't; mighty bad world—mighty bad peoples
                     in it—'deed dey be, honey."
                  "Oh, Hepsy, do comfort me—do!—I'm dying for some one to say a
                     comforting word to me;" gasped Mrs. Kenneth, through her tears. "I'm all alone,
                     Hepsy, all alone—my heart is
                     famishing, perishing! Oh, Hepsy, let me lay my head on your shoulder, as my
                     mother did, and die there!"
                  "Bless de Lord! pore, dear missus!—lay head on ole Hep's shoulder, an' welcome.
                     Ain't got nothin' 'gin' you, heavenly Marst'r knows, if I has had
                     I's sorry for it, 'deed I is, honey. Pore chile, go to de Lord; He's mighty
                     good when Hepsy's ole heart ache like to kill—He's mighty comfortin',
                     chile—neber need sorrow 'thou hope, 'deed you hasn't, chile, dar's a heben at
                     de end for all de weary—yes, chile, I sees it as plain as I sees you,
                     sometimes—dar's a restin'-place—hallelujah to de Lord, don't cry so,
                     honey."
                  She had gathered the child of her mistress to her bosom, tears ran down her
                     furrowed cheeks, her eyes were raised heavenward. The lawyer's wife leaned
                     heavily upon the old negress, sobbing; but resting—sweetly resting against a
                     heart that beat with sorrow and sympathy for her. Oh, how precious that moment
                     of communion! though one was a poor, despised African, and the other mistress
                     of a hundred slaves, and the wife of a wealthy man. Never had a human voice
                     sounded so like music, as Hepsy's, now that she understood the want of her old
                     master's child. It was touching to see this communion in the presence of the
                     dead. The sun streamed in at the little window, and lay over the worn features
                     of the slave, now and forever at rest. A holy calm fell on the two suffering
                     spirits, and Mrs. Kenneth, with one heartfelt sigh ceased her tears, and looked
                     with a grateful smile into Hepsy's black face.
                  "You have done me so much good," she said in a low voice, "when you spoke of my
                     mother—oh! I did so long to throw myself into your arms, and if it were God's
                     will, die. Oh, help me, Hepsy, help me to bear the burden of life."
                  "Look up dar!" said Hepsy, solemnly. "Oh, missus," she added,
                     keeping her raised hand pointing skyward, "if you knows de Lord Jesus once,
                     honey, you won't want no ole Hepsy to gib you comfort."
                  "Oh! Hepsy—I don't know—sometimes I think God has forsaken me," said Mrs.
                     Kenneth, mournfully. "I'm so harassed!—so much afflicted!—I don't know which
                     way to turn."
                  "Turn to de Lord, honey! 'Sides which, de Lord don't forsake nobody, chile.
                     Lord sticks close to dem wha' sticks close to He—'deed do He, honey!—better
                     b'leeve. Ef you goes off from de Lord, honey, you wanders 'way from His kingdom
                     into de wilderness; He doesn't promise take car any one don't want He to; deed
                     no—don't drive nobody; Lord isn't slave-owner, honey! He don't have nothin' but
                     'sciples, an' dey's all dar own mars'trs."
                  "Well, Hepsy, I must go now. If there is anything I can do for you, tell me,
                     won't you? And come up and see me, Hepsy, and talk to me about mother. She died
                     a good Christian, didn't she?"
                  "Bless you, honey! 'pears if angels all round when she die—jes' as dar are
                     debils 'bout some folks' beds. Oh! my pore Jack! I dream, honey, small time
                     ago, I see he all in white robes. Well, blessed Mars'tr put white clothes on he
                     wid he own blessed hands, I 'specs. 'Deed, I'se bery lone some now—bery lonesome now. But den I's glad he

               IN TWO PARTS.
               
                  PART I.
                  IN WHICH A MINISTER OF THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST COUNSELS A
                     POOR HUNTED SOUL TO BEAR THE LOT GOD HAS PLACED UPON HER.
                  
                     
                        
                           "The funeral made the attraction,
                           And the black the woe."
                        
                     
                  
                  THE chairs were carefully ranged about the little cabin; seats were
                     extemporized when the crowd began to gather, for a burial was a great treat to
                     the slaves, and the circumstances connected with the death of old Hepsy's son
                     had created much excitement in the neighborhood. Outside and in were white
                     people and colored, some standing at the windows, many gathering about, the
                     doors, all respectful and quiet. Old Hepsy had stationed herself by the side of
                     the coffin. She wore no mourning; her face was composed by grief into a solemn
                     melancholy, that on one so venerable seemed more touching than the wildest
                     emotion. She sat with head slightly bowed, hands crossed upon her lap, and eyes
                     cast down and nearly closed.
                  "The will of the Lord be done," said the clergyman.
                  
                  Hepsy looked up once in his face, then her eyes fell again, and her hands were
                     clenched more tightly.
                  "'Twasn't de will ob de Lord!" she muttered, and relapsed into
                     silence.
                  A hymn was sung, by the aged mother's request, the air of which was so wild, so
                     plaintive, so heart-broken, that it moved many a one to tears, unused to
                     weeping. The negroes closed their eyes, swayed their bodies, lifted their hands
                     back and forth, and with the manner peculiar to the race, giving themselves up
                     to the sorrow or the transport of the moment, they sang: 
                        
                           "Done an' gone to glory.
                           To glory;
                           Done an' gone to glory,
                           Poor saint's at rest;
                           Leanin' on dar Savior's breast,
                           Poor saint's at rest.

                           By an' bye;
                           Oh! we'll all git thar—
                           By an' bye.

                           Poor saint's at rest.
                           Oh! we'll all git thar—
                           By an' bye;
                           Oh! we'll all git thar—
                           By an' bye.

                           Oh! we'll all git thar—
                           By an' bye;
                           Oh! we'll all git thar—
                           By an' bye."
                        
                     
                  
                  The old negress moved head and hands devoutly. Her eyes were closed, and when
                     the chorus broke out— 
                        "Oh! we'll all git thar,"
                      she joined, sobbingly. Hollister and Keene stood near the minister, two
                     well-dressed men, with proud brows and easy grace of manner. Elder Ramsay had
                     consented to lead the services at the slave's funeral, through respect to old
                     Hepsy's venerable age, though he considered it a great act of condescension,
                     and took care to impress the negroes with the idea that God punished those who
                     ran away from their masters either with great suffering or death.
                  "You all see before you an example of the vengeance of the Almighty," he said.
                     "This man, at whose funeral we have met to pay the last solemn rites of
                     humanity, had a home, and everything comfortable about him—a good master,
                     plenty of food to eat and clothes to wear. But he began to allow foolish
                     thoughts to enter his mind; he
                     thought he could take care of himself better than his master could of him—and
                     the moment he allowed such fancies to control him, the Lord forsook the man.
                     Then all began to be darkness, trial and peril. Fear spread her black wings
                     above him; he dreaded the very light of day. He crept into dark corners, and
                     longed, like the poor prodigal, to go back to his master's house, where there
                     was enough and to spare; but a foolish pride prevented him. 'He'd, rather
                     starve than go,' as we sing sometimes. And now you behold him with his doom
                     upon him, a warning to every one of us—for me, not to forsake my
                     master's service" (lifting his eyes piously), 'for you, not to run
                     away from your masters, but to serve them faithfully, so that the
                     great God may say 'Well done! good and faithful servant,' or, as it should be,
                     'good and faithful slave, enter thou into the joy of thy
                     Lord.'"
                  Hollister's brow grew dark. Keene looked straight at the floor, but his lip
                     took an unconscious and scornful curve. Old Hepsy sat bolt upright, moving
                     mouth and fingers nervously, and Elder Ramsay hurried on to the prayer. It was
                     not long, for the day was hot and the cabin uncomfortably warm, though what
                     little wind stirred came directly through the room. The services over, the
                     procession was arranged, and the coffin lifted. Elder Ramsay went up to Hepsy
                     before he left the room, saying—"The Lord comfort you."
                  "Hopes He will," said Hepsy, rocking herself faster; "needs it after such a
                     'scourse as da'; good Lord knows I does."
                  "An ungrateful task to do anything for these niggers," thought the minister,
                     "bond or free, they will be nigger."
                  "I was obliged to make an example of him, you know," he said, smoothly.
                  "Yes, I knows!" cried Hepsy, though in a low voice; "an' I'll be 'bliged to you
                     if you go out o' my cabin! 'Vengeance ob A'mighty,' ha? A'mighty cut he face
                     an' score he back? A'mighty gib he sixty, case he couldn't beat he own chile?
                     jest tell me dat! Oh! go long layin' dese yer tings to God, jes' if He old
                     slave-driver! go! go! go!" and shaking hands, head and body, she motioned him
                     away. He hurried from the place with a frown on his brow, and a red spot on
                     either cheek.
                  The funeral over, Old Hepsy returned to her home. It did not seem the same
                     cabin that she had taken so much pride in, and in which she had become
                     accustomed to, and fond of loneliness.
                  "Better dar dan dis yer ole place, certain, an' de Lord's been bery merciful in
                     'stainin' ob me," she said to Aunt Esty, who had stolen a few moments while the
                     family at the Grange were at supper, to walk up to the cabin.
                  "Wha' we do ef 'twan't for de Lord?" exclaimed Aunt Esty, clasping her hands;
                     "we's got no foot ob land, no money, no chill'ns, dat is, ef massa want to sell
                     'em, we's got notin' 'cept de blessed Lord Jesus, an' He 'specially speaks of
                     dem da's poor, an' don't know where to lay dar heads."
               
               
                  
                  PART II.
                  LUCINA'S CALL UPON THE MINISTER.
                  The elder was moody at the tea-table, and his elegant little wife, noting the
                     change, inquired the reason.
                  He repeated the incidents already related.
                  "Better have listened to me," said Mrs. Ramsay, with a way that wives will put
                     on. "I told you I would have nothing to do with such trash. Why, the fellow was
                     a runaway," she added, "you might get the ill-will of every slave-owner in the
                     place. And to think of that old heathen treating you in such a way, after you
                     had given your services."
                  "Sh! Sh! Carry, she isn't a heathen," said Mr. Ramsay, "though she's got some
                     queer notions. The fellow was her son, and I suppose she felt much the same as
                     we should feel under the circumstances."
                  His wife broke into a little, musical laugh.
                  "Much the same as we should?" she exclaimed, "it's
                        so funny of you to say that!" she added, with
                     another musical laugh; "the idea of those old Guinea niggers
                     thinking of their children and loving them the same as we do ours? Oh! you're
                        too comical!"
                  "Why, the very brutes love their offspring," said the elder, gravely.
                  "Yes, and I contend, just in the same way that these, slaves do; that is, it is
                     mere instinct; there's no intellect about it."
                  "I question whether the intellect has much to do with it, anyway," replied her
                     husband.
                  "Why! Mr. Ramsay, what has got into you?" exclaimed his wife.
                  "She's a saucy old thing," was his only reply, as he sauntered from the
                     supper-room, folding his splendid dressing-gown about him, and entered a
                     beautiful library, fitted up with every appliance, so that it was luxury only
                     to look about.
                  Elder Ramsay drew up his great easy chair, and lounged, still thinking of Old
                     Hepsy's impertinent speech. He was the picture of a well to do, contented man.
                     His wife was pretty, his children were obedient, his church attentive and
                     appreciative. They gave him a good salary, and many beautiful presents, of
                     which latter commodity his kitchen could furnish several in the persons of
                     sleek slaves. One of them came in just at that moment to light the large study
                     lamp.
                  "I hardly think I shall trouble myself much to night with books," he said to
                     himself, as he was left alone again; "I'll go in with Carry, and get her to
                     give me some music, and devote the evening to recreation."
                  A slave announced a visitor.
                  "Who is it, Charley?" asked Elder Ramsay, his brow clouding.
                  "Deed, I doesn't know, sir! It's a young lady, I 'bleeves."
                  
                  "Oh, well! ask her to come up. Some poor penitent, I suppose. My last Sabbath's
                     discourse must have told somewhere," he muttered, as Charley went out.
                  The young lady was ushered in. She sat down as invited; seemed much agitated,
                     and for some moments not a word was spoken on either side.
                  Throwing her veil back, at last, she disclosed the sweet, fair face of Lucina,
                     which, the minute it was divested of its veil, crimsoned with modest
                     blushes.
                  "My dear young lady! you seem laboring under some distress of mind," said Elder
                     Ramsay, with the courtesy of language and manner for which he was
                     distinguished.
                  "Oh! indeed, sir, I am very, very unhappy."
                  "My dear young lady!" continued the elder, gently, gazing with much admiration
                     on the lovely and expressive face, "state your case to me, and if it is in my
                     power, I will give you consolation. Did I not see you at church last Sabbath?"
                     he asked at a venture.
                  "No, sir," replied Lucina, "I have never attended church here."
                  The elder drew a long breath, somewhat disappointed that it was not the sermon,
                     after all. Strange, very strange, he thought, while Lucina gathered courage,
                     and after a great effort, told him her story.
                  It would have been amusing had it not been humiliating to note the instant
                     metamorphoses that passed over the elder's face and manner. He turned about in
                     a stately, chilling way—there was no more "dear young ladying,"
                     but—"Ah!—well—that is unfortunate; but I do not see as there is
                     any help for you but to submit! I am not very particularly well acquainted with
                     Lawyer Kenneth, and besides, it is going out of my province to have anything to
                     do with such matters. If you are his property, of course he has a
                     right to dispose of you as he pleases. The Bible, my—the Bible—ahem! young
                     woman, sets that question at rest, and advises thus, if you
                     remember: 'servants, obey your masters in the Lord.' Slavery, my—slavery is
                     sanctioned by divine authority; the tenth commandment proves this assertion:
                     'thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor his
                     man-servant, nor his maid-servant'—plainly showing by the classification of the
                     decalogue that the man or maid-servant is as much property as the ox; and
                     modern translators think that the word 'servant' would be more properly
                     expressed as slave! You see that Divinity always contemplated a
                     distinction of races, young woman, and I have no authority to countermand His
                     design."
                  Lucina sat, leaning forward, nearly stupefied. She had not surely heard him
                     aright.
                  "You do not—you cannot—think that the Word of God condemns me to perpetual
                     servitude and to a life so horrible that I would die to-morrow to escape its
                     humiliation?" said Lucina, faintly.
                  "Young woman! you are rash, very rash. What! take the life that God has
                     bestowed on you?—rush willfully into His presence, a self-murderer? condemned
                     beforehand? No! no! bear the lot that He has portioned to you, with becoming
                     meekness and patience."
                  
                  "I cannot think it is God's will!" exclaimed Lucina, her voice broken with
                     tears.
                  "Beware, beware young woman! how you speak of God's Word. You appear to be more
                     enlightened than many of your race, and you should understand yourself better.
                     Do you not read of Christ that He denounced idolatry and every other evil? If
                     slavery had been sin in His sight, would He not have condemned that also?
                     Unfortunately, your stay at the North has been adverse to your spiritual
                     growth. The South alone, my"——('dear young lady' he would have said, for when
                     he glanced at her face, so sweet and yet so full of intellectual beauty, he
                     forgot himself)—"the South alone interprets the Holy Scriptures as they were
                     intended to be understood. God's spirit dwells more specially among us, seeing
                     we come nearest the Patriarchal dispensation, being fathers of great and happy
                     households in the truest sense of the word."
                  "It seems to me that Jesus rebuked oppression, when he said, 'do unto others as
                     you would that they should do unto you,'" said Lucina, tearfully but
                     quietly.
                  "No! no! different application intended, entirely; no reference to anything of
                     the kind; God made the African race to be bondmen, and servants
                        forever," he said, nervously.
                  "But, sir, I am not an African," said Lucina; "you surely would
                     not consider me an African?"
                  "It is getting late," said the minister, coldly, taking out his watch; "I
                     promised myself a leisure evening!"
                  Lucina arose to go, when there tripped in a pretty little woman with blooming
                     cheeks, who would have retreated, but the minister said, "come in, my dear.
                     This is a young woman of Lawyer Kenneth's, who entreats me to save her from
                     being sold to some one to whom she has taken a great dislike. You will bear
                     witness that I have really no power to do anything of the kind; that I have
                     often been called upon to perform similar offices, and that I invariably
                     decline; though I certainly consider this a very unfortunate case, very!"
                  Lucina grew pale, faint and dizzy. She staggered forward blindly and groped for
                     the door, then fell extended at the minister's feet, and lay like one dead.
                  "Dear me! let me call one of the girls," cried Mrs. Ramsay; "poor thing! why,
                     Henry! she is quite white, I declare!" she added pityingly, summoning
                     assistance.
                  "We shall have Lawyer Kenneth here after her, the next thing!" said the
                     minister, turning away impatiently; "he is not the sort of man I should wish to
                     get a blessing from; besides, it would appear as if I was meddling with his
                     affairs. The girl is his 'property,' and ought to know her place better than to
                     come to a stranger's house, and involve him in difficulty."
                  The slaves who had been summoned had laid Lucina on a couch, and were chafing
                     her hands. It was a sorrowful sight to see her extended helpless and suffering,
                     as fair as the lady who directed the negroes in their efforts; her cheeks
                     deathly white, her lips pale as marble, her eyes closed. Slowly, very slowly
                     she became conscious, raised herself shudderingly, put back the heavy locks
                     that had fallen over her face, and
                     only said with a piteous accent: "Let me go home."
                  "Go, and tell Charley to return with her," said Elder Ramsay, to one of the
                     girls.
                  "No! no!" gasped Lucina, faintly, "I came with a friend."
                  "I must insist upon it," said the elder, remarking as he turned to his wife:
                     "if she should take it into her head to escape, and it was known that this was
                     her last stopping-place, it would injure my influence beyond all account. I
                     must insist that my man see you safely home," he added, addressing Lucina,
                     almost sternly. White and weak, the poor girl, chilled to the very heart, moved
                     from the room, the black man following at a little distance—for he appeared to
                     respect her grief.
                  Three or four squares distant around a corner, Maggie sat in a carriage,
                     holding the restive horse who had been taken from a good meal of oats to do the
                     bidding of this imperious little woman.
                  "Be quiet, Postboy!" she said, "a minute longer—here she is."
                  Charley lifted the trembling girl into the carriage, and Postboy started
                     off.
                  "Well?" said Maggie, interrogatively.
                  A choking sob was the only answer.
                  "No good by going there, then! Why, he preaches such beautiful sermons! I
                     thought, to be sure, he would do something to help you. The hard-hearted
                     monster!" exclaimed the indignant girl, when Lucina had related parts of her
                     interview; "I'll never hear him preach another sermon as long as I live, that I
                     won't. Never mind, keep up your heart; you're not so very far from the North
                     but what a good smart run for it would clear you, and then you know you can
                     take the cars from New York, and go right over into Canada. Come, now, this is
                     fun, isn't it? a slaveholder conniving at the escape of a slave; but, then, I
                     don't believe you are a slave—not a bit of it."
                  "Oh, God bless you! thank you!" exclaimed Lucina, gratefully.
                  "And if I could help you to get off to Canada, I would."
                  "I am sure you would; but I should be at the mercy of every one I met; I am as
                     ignorant as a child about travelling."
                  "Pho! you have only to put a bold face on the matter, and drive through. I'll
                     lend you a trunk with my initials on it, if that would help you any, I could
                     rig you up so that your own mother wouldn't know you. By the way, where
                        is your mother, and what do you know about her?"
                  "Nothing," said Lucina, quietly. "I never recollect to have seen her."
                  "Is it possible? That's sad; I have no mother, but then I had the satisfaction
                     of having one for sixteen years; she died three years ago. But about this
                     Canada business."
                  "Joyfully will I go—though I should never know what to do with myself; and I
                     have no money."
                  "Money—oh, that's a small affair. I could let you have seventy dollars in gold; I have it with me,"
                     said the generous-hearted girl, "and there's Mrs. Van Broek, who would double
                     that, I know. After you get there, you might set up school, or teach
                     embroidery, or music—something or other—and then you'd be a heroine, too, and
                     marry nobody knows what great personage. Dear me! you have a chance to make a
                     fortune with that face of yours."
                  Lucina's heart beat high; she felt as if she could lay her life down at the
                     feet of this impulsive, high-souled Maggie Willis, who, though the holder of
                     several slaves, had yet so generous and womanly a heart beating under its rich
                     vesture.
                  They drove into the yard, and Maggie peered about for Jupiter, whom she had
                     cajoled into her services for that night.
                  "Is all right, Jupiter?" she asked, as the boy stole softly up to the side of
                     the carriage.
                  "Yes, miss, all right but I, an' I's left. Ebony he gone off to t'oder place to
                     see his wife, consequemply I's left alone. You hasn't bin gone long,
                     missus."
                  "Is your master at home, Jupiter?" asked Maggie.
                  "'Specs he isn't; Spitfire gone," replied the boy.
                  "Here"—Maggie slipped a half dollar into the boy's hand, for which he turned a
                     summerset, throwing his heels in Postboy's face, and startling the horse so
                     that he sprang forward, and had very nearly run the chaise against the side of
                     the house.
                  "Jupiter, if I owned you I'd give you a flogging for such tricks," exclaimed
                     Maggie, losing her temper in her fright.
                  "Laws, miss, I's ought to be beat, da's a fac'; I's an outrageous nigger—I is.
                     Mar's Kenneth don't do he duty by dis yer chile—da's so! Ought to hab a dozen
                     ebery day, missis, but den can't git nobody to do it on dis yer place. Ebery
                     ting go to ruin whar dar ain't no whippin'; nigger made to whip—da's so!"
                  "Now, hold that horse properly while we get out," said Maggie, half laughing;
                     "if he breaks our necks you'll have to be hung for it."
                  "'Specs I deserves, it, missus. I's an unfortnight nigger, anyways; 'specs I
                     hang, heels up, afore dis yer night's through; practizes it ebery
                     day on de barn-door—case I don't know how soon I may hang todder way, an' I's
                     trying to be prepared—I is."
                  The girls sprang out, and Maggie leading the way softly, Lucina followed into
                     Mabel's room, which, at a signal, was unlocked by the Friend herself, who
                     looked very pale in her white robes. She took Lucina's hand in hers as she
                     walked back to her seat. After fastening the door, and looking in her eyes, she
                     read her disappointment and dejection there.
                  "Poor soul, thee is still hunted!" she said, "but put thy trust in the Father's
                     of mercies. He will not, oh! He cannot fail thee. Our earnest prayers must be
                     answered!"
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XX.
               IN TWO PARTS.
               
                  PART I.
                  SLAVERY, REFINEMENT AND FOOLISH SUPERSTITIONS.
                  
                     
                        
                           "An undefined and sudden thrill,
                           That makes the heart a moment still."
                        
                     
                  
                  HATTIE GOLDSMITH was far from being quiet in the midst of all this excitement.
                     She wished to return home, and yet, strangely enough, was unwilling to leave
                     Washington Grange, in spite of the discomfort and unhappiness of the place. She
                     took it upon herself to solace Mrs. Kenneth, who seemed wearing away to a
                     shadow, and frequently carried her easel and painting materials into her aunt's
                     room, and sat with her all the morning. Hattie painted with the perseverance of
                     an enthusiast. She had already adorned the parlor of Washington Grange with two
                     choice pictures, and had she had the advantages of poverty for a few years,
                     would have competed with the eminent of the other sex. As it was there was a
                     finish, a softness of tone in the coloring that were really remarkable, and
                     gained her the admiration of distinguished amateurs. When anything troubled Hat
                     she always flew to her canvas, and painted with redoubled assiduity. So now;
                     the probable fate of Lucina awoke in her the most sorrowful feelings, and she
                     sometimes ventured to plead for her with Mrs. Kenneth, who, poor woman! really
                     appeared desirous of assisting the hunted girl. Amy, on the contrary, was
                     effectually hardened against Lucina, and "hoped in her heart that Dole Baker
                     would get her to take down her pride," she said to herself, "for she was an
                     upstart and a slave, and not worth making such a fuss about."
                  The morning after Lucina's unsuccessful application to Elder Ramsay, Amy
                     entered the room where Hattie Goldsmith and her mother were sitting together.
                     Amy seldom visited her mother's chamber; unlike Hattie, she hurried away from
                     the sight of suffering, and busied herself in her own selfish pursuits. When
                     she did come, it was invariably to bring some complaint, as it was in the
                     present instance.
                  "What do you suppose Phillis has been telling me, mamma?" she exclaimed,
                     petulantly. "The silliest story; and yet it provokes me. The old witch—she
                     ought to be burnt."
                  "Pray, what is the matter, Amy?" asked her mother.
                  "Why, by dint of coaxing and threatening, I've got at what Phillis has been
                     hinting at the last two days. I made her tell me to-day, and she said Hepsy
                     caught father's shadow with a coffin. Did you ever hear of anything so
                     absolutely ridiculous?"
                  "Nonsense!" said Mrs. Kenneth, faintly. "It's an old African superstition, that
                     has no force here, nor anywhere else."
                  
                  "And Phillis declared she said that father would die before the year was out,"
                     continued Amy; "and I almost believe she'd poison him, and so fulfill her own
                     prediction—the old witch!"
                  "It's all Phillis's talk," said Mrs. Kenneth, leaning back again in her great
                     rocking-chair. "Hepsy felt particularly aggravated, and might have done some
                     such foolish thing. Let her enjoy her freaks; she is a poor, ignorant creature,
                     you know—but Hepsy has a good heart."
                  "I should think so!" responded Amy. "Here she has, been practising her old
                     witcheries, scattering powder about the house, and uttering her maledictions in
                     all sorts of ways, besides coming here before daylight and singing her African
                     howl. I think she's awful; and for my part, I almost begin to believe in her
                     predictions; for of all unfortunate years, this is the most unlucky, so
                     far."
                  "Well, Amy, if God sees fit to punish us for our pride, our shortcomings, and
                     our sins, we ought to be very humble under His chastisements," said Mrs.
                     Kenneth.
                  Amy looked at her mother with almost open-mouthed astonishment. Sentiments of
                     religion, resignation under affliction, were things she had never heard, from
                     those lips at least, before.
                  "Well done, mother!" she exclaimed, in tones not very respectful, "you are
                     really growing pious! Who would have thought of it?"
                  "I wish I truly were," returned her mother; "I have thought"——
                  Here the conversation was interrupted by the shouting laughter of the lawyer,
                     who came toward the house at a rapid rate. He seemed, as usual to him of late,
                     much excited, and was talking in his gayest tones to Marshall Randolph. It was
                     not long before his foot was heard ascending the stairs. He came through the
                     upper hall and stood in the door of his wife's room. He glanced about for a
                     moment, hummed a tune lightly, and then exclaiming, "Hat, I've got a husband
                     for you," he sauntered into the room. Hattie's cheeks were covered with
                     blushes.
                  "A splendid fellow, Hat; although I'm afraid he's going to be an infernal
                     abolitionist, if he isn't that already. What do you say to Marsh Randolph—eh?
                     Hat?"
                  "Don't ask her, father," said Amy, sneeringly; "if she feels at all as I do,
                     she has the most thorough contempt for him."
                  "Contempt—oh, no!" said Hattie, earnestly, and then bent over her canvas to
                     hide her conscious face.
                  "By the way," said the lawyer, lightly, "I have some thoughts of letting my
                     sister have this white piece of goods of mine, after all."
                  Hattie's face lightened all over, and Mrs. Kenneth, clasping her hands
                     together, exclaimed, in her excited, eager manner—
                  "Oh! have you, Everard?"
                  "Now, don't, don't!" cried the lawyer, holding his hands mockingly toward his
                     wife, his countenance undergoing a curious change; "don't smother me with
                     thanks—don't overwhelm me with kisses—because I'm not accustomed to either. I
                     couldn't bear up under the infliction—indeed I couldn't!" Then, moving forward, he said
                     slowly—"By the way, Mrs. Kenneth, I found an emerald yesterday, and I am
                     anxious to know whether it belongs to your set. I paid fifteen hundred dollars
                     for that set of jewelry, and a good, healthy negro into the bargain; just get
                     them for me, will you?"
                  Mrs. Kenneth sat rooted to the seat, gazing at him with a distressful, helpless
                     look. They had gone in part payment for Lucina.
                  "Come—you will oblige me by showing me the jewels," said Lawyer Kenneth,
                     sliding along gracefully, and shaking his watch-guard impatiently; "it seems to
                     me a year, at least, since you wore that set. Beautiful emeralds; the rarest
                     and most costly in the market."
                  Still his wife sat moveless, saying only in a frightened way—"I haven't them by
                     me, Everard."
                  "Oh, perhaps they are in another room! Amy would, no doubt, oblige you by
                     getting them, as you seem quite indisposed; suddenly so, no doubt. My dear, do
                     you know where your mother's set of emeralds is?"
                  "It—isn't in—the case," replied Amy, irresolutely, looking from one parent to
                     the other, and frightened at her mother's wild, pale features. "I don't think
                     I've seen them since you went to Virginia, mother."
                  "Oh, 'um! 'haven't seen 'em since you went to Virginia,' madam, your daughter
                     says," repeated Lawyer Kenneth, with a visage that was terrible to behold, and
                     in a low voice he commenced his favorite air—
                        
                           "If I had as much sense
                           As would balance the straw,
                           I'd choose the one I want
                           From the picture I would draw!"
                        
                     
                  
                  The moment he commenced to sing, Hattie left the room, and Amy retreated to the
                     passage.
                  "Perhaps you've lent the jewels, my dear Mrs. Kenneth!" he said, drawing his
                     voice in as lengthened cadences as possible; "perhaps you have"—he hummed a
                     line before he concluded—" sold them!"
                  His wife moved not, spoke not; she seemed as one turned into stone.
                  "Are they in your possession, madam?" he asked, in a stifled voice, "or does
                     their absence prove your"——
                  He was arrested by one little sentence that issued faintly from her white lips:
                     "Spare Amy!"
                  He said not another word, but with one withering glance at his wife, turned and
                     left the room.
               
               
                  PART II.
                  SUPERSTITIONS OF SLAVERY.
                  Proceeding directly to his sister's parlor, Lawyer Kenneth was admitted. Lucina
                     was not to be seen. Mabel changed color as he entered, and her dull cough for
                     the moment smote upon his heart.
                  
                  "Do you hear anything from Harry?" she asked, anxiously.
                  "No; but I bring what you will consider equally good news."
                  She did not like the gleam in his eye—it was sardonic; but she believed him,
                     and her brightened face questioned of him what it might be.
                  "Well, sis, I think, after all, I'll sell this girl Lucina to you for the same
                     price that Baker would have paid. He consents to it on these terms, that if you
                     cannot pay the money you will say nothing to my transferring the girl to
                     him."
                  "Oh! certainly, certainly," said Mabel, joyfully; "but of course there is no
                     fear about the money; I can pay thee in gold as soon as Harry comes. Oh!
                     brother, I knew it was not in thy heart to be so cruel; I knew thee would
                     relent, for I have been praying the Father for thee, and he has most graciously
                     answered my prayers. Oh! thee has made me so happy!" and she fell back upon her
                     pillow, while a radiant smile lighted up her sweet face, and made her look
                     angelic.
                  Lawyer Kenneth turned aside for a moment, but what his countenance expressed is
                     impossible to be told. Mabel, however, innocently trusted him; he was her
                     brother—her only, once her idolized brother—and though sin had changed his face
                     and hardened his heart, she yet loved him most dearly, and believed him
                     implicitly. Lawyer Kenneth went out, chuckling and humming to himself, and
                     presently Lucina emerged from her hiding-place. It was not a very secure
                     one—only a closet, from which she had heard all. Her emotions were also changed
                     from the most profound anguish to unmixed joy. Lawyer Kenneth seemed now as an
                     angel of light to her; she could not say too much in his praise. Her very face
                     seemed transfigured as she stood before Mabel, striving to realize the great
                     blessing that had been conferred upon her. Once more she felt free. Oh! the
                     gushing tears that fell as she spoke the magic word "FREE!" The bondman only
                     realizes the full force and beautiful significancy of that word. The eloquence
                     of genius has made men's hearts leap as it portrayed the pleasures and the
                     blessings of liberty. Thousands have listened spell-bound to the tragic
                     representation of the patriot, who, feeling the free blood coursing through his
                     own veins, has moved his country to the heart's core, and caused her to unloose
                     the chains of trampled millions. But only the man who has been fettered body
                     and spirit—only the man who has felt in his soul the stirrings of an anguish
                     pen never can describe—who has seen all pursuits denied him, all hope snatched
                     from him—who has felt that his life was a blank, useless and despised, and put
                     on a par with that of a horse, a mule, or a cow—only he can feel
                     the burning beauty of that word, freedom! He knows what it means. Ask him, and
                     you will see its undying lustre in his eye—its unfading color upon his
                     cheek—and hear its oracles, like those of a god, leaping living from his
                     lips.
                  All the inmates of the house seemed pleased at the turn matters had taken—only
                     Maggie shook her head, and looked very wise, saying, "I don't understand it;
                     'tisn't a bit like Uncle Kenneth—not
                     a bit; I'm afraid there's some underhand motives, for since I have been here
                     this summer my eyes have been opened wider than they ever were before. Still, I
                     hope it's all right." On which Mrs. Van Broek read her a minute sermon on the
                     beauty of charity, and Lucina's face took on the cloud again.
                  "Oh! I know you can't help being charitable, and good, and all that, but
                     I"—
                  "My dear, what is the matter with thee?" asked Mabel, hastily, for the volatile
                     girl had turned partly away, and applied her handkerchief to her eyes.
                  "I—I've got a fit of the dumps, I believe—I don't know what ails me, but I do
                     feel that I must leave this house if I ever want to get home alive. I never had
                     such awful dreams and shocking presentiments in all my life. I believe that old
                     Hepsy up there, with her witcheries, has done it all. Some way I'm in mortal
                     fear of that creature; and then you know she has been treated badly, and she
                        is a very strange woman, no one will deny that."
                  "Thee is only nervous dear," said Mabel, whose cheeks had flushed with the
                     deadly fever of her disease; "I can hardly wonder that thee is so, either."
                  "Well, I wonder, for there you lie sick and suffering, and more
                     involved in the excitements of the house than I have been, a great deal, and
                     yet you are as calm and quiet as if you had never known trouble. I don't see
                     through it."
                  "Lucina will tell thee," said Mabel, with her heavenly smile; and the girl,
                     rising, immediately brought the Bible, opened at the 23d Psalm, and in a low
                     voice, sweetly modulated, read it through.
                  When she came to the words "Though I walk through the valley of
                     the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thy rod and Thy staff they
                     comfort me," Mabel clasped her hands more closely to her bosom, and murmured
                     softly, "yes, yes; oh, how they comfort me!"
                  Maggie gazed upon her through blinding tears. A sensation of awe crept along
                     every fibre of her frame; it was as if she saw a heavenly inhabitant already
                     before her. At last she said, as Lucina closed the book:
                  "I'm not used to hearing much about religion at home; father don't profess,
                     though he's a dear good father, and Uncle Storrs is a Nothingarian, and as cold
                     and formal as a stone. My mother died of a rapid fever, so I was not allowed to
                     see her at all, and though I'm inclined to think she was a Christian, she never
                     talked about it to me at least. Well, (with a sigh) I suppose I shall turn out
                     a Christian some day. Dear me! I wish I was like Hat. There she is, always just
                     so calm, just so philosophical, just so quiet. Now I don't believe the fuss we
                     have been having has worried her at all. She's got an enviable
                     temperament."
                  "Dear friend, believe me, thee will find Jesus a present help in every time of
                     trial; in thy youth and joy, it will be sweet to have Him for a friend, but oh!
                     in thine hours of anguish His dear companionship is beyond all price."
                  Maggie gazed again toward Mabel, whose clear eyes were looking in her own with
                     such an anxious, yearning gaze.
                  
                  "I believe you," she said, then added, "my old nurse is always talking about
                     heaven, and sometimes I've thought that many of our poor, despised slates on
                     the plantation would go to heaven, and I be left behind; I wish I was a
                     Christian."
                  "I believe God is calling thee," said Mabel, solemnly.
                  "What! you don't think I'm going to die?"
                  "Oh, no, clear," replied Mabel, smiling at her look of alarm; "I mean, I
                     believe He is calling thee by His Spirit to become a Christian."
                  "Oh!" exclaimed Maggie, with a sigh of relief; "because; I've thought so much
                     of dying lately. What, with being wakened by strange noises in the night, and
                     hearing old-Hepsy's death-croon, I've grown dreadfully superstitious, and there
                     was no need of that; I was bad enough before."
                  "Thee superstitious?" exclaimed Mabel, faintly."
                  "Dear me; I've been nursed in superstition;" replied Maggie; "my old mammy was
                     a dear, good Christian, but she believed in witches and ghosts, and second
                     sight, and signs, and naturally I became indoctrinated. The old creature
                     actually thought she saw the spirits of the dead, and told me so many stories
                     of haunted houses, and haunted chambers, that both my brain and my heart became
                     haunted, and I feared to move without somebody close to my heels. And although
                     since I have tried to shake off some of these fears, and have gone boldly into
                     the dark, yet they cling to me like burs. For instance, yesterday I went to
                     town, shopping. Well, I ordered twelve yards of white ribbon, among other
                     things. I took the parcel when it came, car- ried it up stairs, got out my
                     white dress to see how it should be trimmed, opened the paper, and out fell a
                     great roll of black ribbon on my bed. You can't think how I felt! I was faint
                     with dread, and to crown all, Cousin Amy cried out, 'oh, that's a bad sign!
                     somebody's going to die!' Of course, I felt as if that somebody was me."
                  "Thee ought to be scolded a little, dear," Mabel replied, gently.
                  "Well, suppose you scold me; I'll take it from you. Come, do let me hear you
                     scold," said Maggie.
                  Mabel shook her head, smilingly.
                  "How does thee account for the black ribbon?" she asked.
                  "Oh, the man was stupid and forgot—knew it was either white or black, and
                     reckoned it was black."
                  "But shouldn't you have felt badly?"
                  "I cannot say; I think not," Mabel replied.
                  "Then, there was that old death-croon, the other morning; did you hear that?"
                     asked Maggie.
                  "No—Lucina told me about it; she heard it, I believe; did thee not, dear?"
                  Lucina replied in the affirmative.
                  "I broke Amy's mirror yesterday," said Maggie, with an air of hesitation;
                     "that's a sign of trouble or death.
                  "Poor child! How many deaths does thee think lie at the doors of these false
                     superstitions?"asked Mabel. "I dare to say mirrors have been broken before, and
                     black ribbons sent to the wrong place, and old Africans sung death-songs
                     without the following of such serious conse- quences; thee is too much of a woman, Maggie, to
                     notice such idle things."
                  "I know it's foolish of me; but remember they were almost born with me, as you
                     might say; indeed, I dare declare that my mother was brought up in just such a
                     fashion. I know she put great faith in dreams and omens. The slaves in that
                     thing are our teachers and masters; they impregnate the whole white population.
                     I don't believe there's a Southern man, woman, or child but is always more or
                     less under the influence of superstition."
                  "A very sad state," replied Mabel, whom the long conversation was wearying.
                     Maggie looked at her watch, declared that she had almost forgotten an
                     engagement, and hurried out, first craving the liberty of pressing a kiss upon
                     the waxen forehead before her. Then exclaiming, "Good bye, and good news from
                     Harry—the postman is coming," she hurried through the hall, and up stairs into
                     Amy's chamber.
                  The two girls had planned an expedition among themselves, which was to be a
                     secret. Hattie sat reading to Mrs. Kenneth, being somewhat indisposed and
                     willing to remain at home. The lawyer had gone off on Spitfire; Postboy stood
                     patiently harnessed to the chaise in the yard below. Presently Maggie and Amy
                     appeared equipped in gay dresses and long green veils. They entered the chaise,
                     Maggie taking the reins, and drove off. Maggie drove purposely past Hollister's
                     cabin; the slave was not visible, but black Hercules was making the air resound
                     with his athletic strokes upon the glowing iron, and his son had just plunged
                     some red hot metal into a brazier full of water at the door. The old blacksmith
                     came to the entrance a moment at the sound of wheels, and the younger one
                     touched his hat, though scarcely glancing at the passing vehicle.
                  The morning air was sweet with perfume. As they emerged into the road, the
                     beautiful wayside flowers sent up their incense, though it was not so fresh and
                     delicious, since the dew had dried on their leaves. The girls drove on till
                     they could see Hepsy's little cottage, and the white head of the old negress
                     itself bobbing about among the bean-vines. She was picking vegetables for her
                     solitary dinner. The sun shone hotly on her silvery locks and now and then she
                     turned herself about, now and then glanced up ward to the sky.
                  "How weird she looks!" exclaimed Maggie; to which Amy only replied, "she's a
                     frightful old thing;" and changing their course to the turnpike that led
                     farther into the country, they rolled rapidly on. Some beautiful farm-houses
                     stood back on the road surrounded by chesnut trees; cattle roamed lazily
                     through the fields; the sheep were huddling under the shadows of the fences and
                     the trees, for the day was growing very warm. Sometimes a bare-footed boy met
                     them, and turning, walked backward on his heels to gaze after them: sometimes a
                     sun-burnt girl with a milk-pail on her arm. The farmers were at work in
                     different meadows, little brown-birds flitted from hedge to hedge, and
                     everything within the circle of vision told of peace, contentment and beauty.
                     They had gone a long way without speaking, when Maggie asked,
                  
                  "How far off now are the Hatch woods?"
                  "The timber-land just ahead," replied Amy.
                  "Oh, is that the place? then we're most there. Do you see two horses standing
                     there hitched to the trees?"
                  "Yes, I see them," replied Amy;" "I wonder who is there? please drive more
                     slowly."
                  "What? you're not afraid of two horses, are you?" asked Maggie, at the same
                     time slackening speed.
                  "I had rather turn about and go home," Amy Raid, anxiously.
                  "Nonsense! now we're in for it, we might as well go right through; I mean to,
                     for if I drive you home, I shall come back again alone. I'm going to cure
                     myself of my foolish notions."
                  "One of those horses is our old grey," said Amy, reconnoitering; "I should
                     think some of the men had come for wood, but there's no sign of a cart."
                  "Shall I drive up?" asked Maggie, her face aglow with excitement.
                  "Yes," Amy replied, slowly; "yes, you might as well; we can go round farther,
                     driving leisurely, till whoever is in there comes out and goes off."
                  "See!—some one is coming now; don't you see the white clothes in there? good
                     gracious, if it should be the ghost! But don't be frightened—you know it's a
                     woman, and that is a man. Oh, if Hat was here, wouldn't she go into raptures
                     with the masses of light that fall in through those great branches? what a
                     superb place to live in! I declare I've a good mind to be a ghost myself, and
                     take up my residence here. What beautiful turf, and what a prospect!"
                  It was a sylvan spot. To the left stretched the green meadows and a glistening
                     river, bounded by noble hills. To the right there were clumps of wood-land;
                     here and there a pretty little farm-house, cultivated grounds, rising into
                     hills and declining into valleys; behind them the long, smooth road, before
                     them the deep, green growth of the forest, whose countless leaves and swaying
                     branches murmured a monotonous, but by no means unpleasant song.
                  The girls were moving slowly along in the direction of the two horses, when Amy
                     exclaimed, catching at Maggie's sleeve, "Oh, turn back! turn back, Maggie,
                     there is Hollister!"
                  "And what if he is?" exclaimed Maggie, "somebody else is with him; I hope
                     you're not afraid."
                  "I do not wish to be seen here by him; I had rather not," cried Amy.
                  "But there's no use now; he has probably seen us, and we might as well go on.
                     Come, don't wear such a cowardly face, or I shall think you are really afraid
                     of your own shadow; what do you suppose they have been there for? That other
                     one is Keene, isn't it?"
                  "Yes—let us ask him, then, if the path we see there is practicable—I—didn't
                     want to see Hollister—that's all."
                  Keene and his half brother now emerged into the road. Hollister looked white
                     and bewildered, as if stunned with some great sorrow. Keene seemed to be
                     consoling him. They both betrayed surprise when they saw who the two girls were, sitting in the chaise,
                     and Postboy trying to engage the old grey in conversation, by whinnying very
                     softly.
                  "We have a great desire to walk a little way in the woods; is the road plain
                     enough?" asked Maggie.
                  "I would advise you not to go," said Keene, slowly.
                  "Why?" asked Maggie.
                  "It is not considered"——
                  "Oh, never mind what the slaves say about it," broke in Maggie; "it is for the
                     very reason that the place is reported to be haunted that we want to go."
                  "Young ladies, you would see a sight there that would haunt you to
                     your dying day," said Keene, in the same serious tone, while Hollister, setting
                     his lips together, turned away.
                  "For pity's sake, let's go home," exclaimed Amy, catching at the reins
                     herself—"I'm half frightened to death."
                  "What is the nature of the sight? can't you tell us that?" asked Maggie,
                     restraining the other.
                  "No," said Keene, briefly; "should I do so, you would dream of slow murder,
                     madness, and starvation, for a year to come." Hollister groaned.
                  "Maggie, I protest against your going," said Amy, still more frighted at the
                     peculiar voice and manner of Keene; "father would be very angry; he has
                     forbidden everybody in the house to come this way—do turn for
                     home!"
                  Maggie did as she was desired, saying to herself, "it shan't prevent me from
                     coming out here again, alone, at any rate," and turning the horse's head, they
                     rode swiftly back, hearing for some time the sound of hoofs behind them.
                  "What a speech!" she said aloud after they were nearly home; "slow
                     murder—madness, and starvation!"
                  "Oh, he always talks in that dramatic way," said Amy, whose fear vanished as
                     she felt the protecting vicinity of home; "he's the strangest kind of a darkey,
                     full of sentiment, quoting poetry, putting on such ridiculous airs—to be sure
                     he is called as smart as a white man, and he is smart in his way.
                     But then he may thank his white blood for that."
                  Lawyer Kenneth rode in just then in great haste, and Maggie heard him give
                     orders that Spitfire was to be fed, but not to have his saddle and bridle
                     removed, as in the course of an hour he should want him again.
                  A wild thought entered the brain of the gay girl as she saw the handsome
                     creature standing in the yard. She forgot warnings, solemn speeches, everything
                     but the one engrossing desire to ride this fiery horse.
                  "I'm sure he seems gentle," she said, softly, going near the head of the
                     animal, but almost instantly recoiling at the eye that looked with something
                     like fiendish ferocity into her own.
                  "Pshaw! I must be getting cowardly. I tamed Napoleon at home, and it would be
                     glorious to subdue this great fellow. I'll do it. Ebony, does an hour mean an
                     hour here?"
                  "I'specs I don't understan', miss," said Ebony, who had just come up with a pan
                     full of oats with which to lure Spitfire into the stable.
                  "When your master says he may want to use his horse in an hour, does he always come after him when
                     the hour is up?" asked Maggie, who was in one of her merry moods.
                  "Oh! I—I doesn't think he does dezactly, miss; he's alles a leetle
                     hindermost."
                  "Well, Ebony, I'll give you a dollar if you'll help me mount Spitfire."
                  The black's eye-balls seemed starting out of his head.
                  "Wha'? ride Spitfire? why, missus, he am de debbil!"
                  "I'm not afraid of him," said Maggie, whose courage rose in proportion to the
                     seeming danger; "come, Ebony, give him his oats and be out of the way for half
                     an hour or so, and I'll give you the dollar, besides taking all the blame if
                     there is any to be taken."
                  "But missus can't ride on da' saddle," said Ebony, regarding the shining silver
                     in her hand.
                  "I can't—I could ride him without any—but I suppose there's a side saddle in
                     the stable?"
                  "Oh! yes, missus, two or tree; but me don't hardly dar' to put he on."
                  "Nonsense! such an easy way of earning a dollar and you don't dare; I'll give
                     you two dollars, Ebony, and take all the blame if there should be any. Go right
                     into the stable now, and change the saddle."
                  The black grinned as he felt the clinking silver, and carefully led the fiery
                     animal, by dint of much management, into his accustomed place, and as
                     cautiously equipped him in his new accoutrements. When he came out again,
                     Maggie stood there dressed in her riding-gown and hat, which she had hastily
                     donned, and holding a light whip. Spitfire, as if conscious that his rights
                     were to be invaded, regarded her with a sullen mien, frequently turning his
                     splendid head, and gazing at her with a cool, defiant eye. She stood, pale but
                     determined. During the interval which she had occupied in dressing. it had
                     occurred to her that she was to attempt if not an impracticable, at least a
                     foolish thing. She reflected on the desperate character of Lawyer Kenneth, and
                     as she thought of his God-defying oaths, a fear came over her that chilled her.
                     She had heard him remark that if he had a mortal enemy of whom he wished to
                     dispose, he would give him a five minutes' airing on the back of Spitfire. The
                     creature had already flung two or three of his riders, one of whom, at least,
                     had died of his injuries. But a spirit of reckless bravado possessed her; she
                     would not retreat ingloriously, she thought, though she almost hoped that the
                     animal would be too intractable to allow her to mount.
                  Not so, however. After a little neighing, a springing coquettishly from side to
                     side, the creature started off like an arrow. Maggie turned her laughing face
                     once toward the house and was away.
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXI.

                           "But no, 'tis in vain! the grand Impulse is given,
                           Man knows his high charter, and knowing will claim,
                           And if ruin must follow where fetters are riven,
                           Be theirs who have forged them the guilt and the
                              shame!"
                        
                     
                  
                  MABEL was watching for a letter. None had arrived in the morning for her, only
                     for Lawyer Kenneth, and she was almost counting the minutes till the postman's
                     round should come again. The fever that was now her daily visitant had
                     attenuated her fearfully within the last two weeks. Rarely did she sit up
                     beyond a few hours at a time, or extend her walk farther than through the
                     beautiful conservatory, leaning upon the arm of Lucina or Harry. It was evident
                     that she was wasting away. She longed to return to her pleasant Northern home,
                     longed to be free from the hideous surroundings of slavery, to see the dear
                     faces of familiar friends, and amidst such blessed associations, breathe her
                     life away. She often talked about it. Lucina had learned to think of her final
                     departure to the better land with composure, though a vision of a shroud, and
                     those clear eyes veiled, often brought the tears to her eyes. But when Mabel
                     herself, in her own gentle voice and heavenly manner, dwelt upon "the glory to
                     come"—the sweet employments in which she longed to be engaged—the Savior she
                     was ready to meet, her mind grew more elevated. Self was forgotten, and she
                     longed to spread the wings of her spirit and bear her company. They had been
                     talking about heaven when the postman's knock was heard. The man was in the
                     employ of Lawyer Kenneth, not of government, and always attended to the
                     disposal of the letters of the household.
                  "I feel as if there must be news from Harry," said Mabel, "and I know not why,
                     but I look for evil tidings."
                  Lucina hastened to see, and returned smiling, bearing a letter. Mabel seized
                     it, tore open the envelope, but her fingers trembled so that she could scarcely
                     hold the missive, and she said sadly to Lucina. "Thee will have to read it,
                     dear. Stop, love, read it to thyself first, and I will gather strength from
                     prayer."
                  Alas! poor Lucina. Her head grew dizzy as she read. Mabel, looking up, saw the
                     color forsake her cheek, the lips quiver, and catching her by both hands, she
                     exclaimed, "Harry—Harry!"
                  "He is well, I should think, dear Mrs. Van Broek," said Lucina, struggling for
                     composure; "but, shall I read it? it is bad news."
                  "Read it!" said Mabel, tersely, closing her eyes. And Lucina read:
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 PHILADELPHIA, Aug, 185-.
                                 "DEAREST MOTHER:
                              
                              "What fitting words can I choose to tell you that which you must
                                 ultimately know? My dearest mother—that God may give you strength
                                 to bear it!—we are pecuniarily ruined. The failure of several long
                                 established houses, and the rascality of my partner, who has
                                 disappeared with all my available funds, have rendered us literally
                                 penniless. I would not write you; would, God knows, keep this
                                 terrible business from you, till, with the assistance of friends, I
                                 can swim ashore again; but it was yesterday announced in the
                                 papers, and I feared that the intelligence communicated in that
                                 manner would shock you more than if I wrote. But, my own darling
                                 mother, though cast down I am not discouraged—now your lessons of
                                 trust and faith stand me in hand. I shall try to save the house and
                                 furniture in some way, though it looks very doubtful whether I
                                 shall be able so to do. Thank Marshall Randolph for his kind offer
                                 and his cheering letter, which has just come to hand. I have good
                                 and staunch friends, but in this terrible commercial crisis I
                                 cannot depend upon anything but my own exertions. Meanwhile, I am
                                 not contented to leave you at my uncle's. Colonel Ely's house here
                                 is open to you, as you know, and my father's old aunt, Mercy
                                 Campbell, entreats me to bring you there. What do you say, mother?
                                 Don't fear for me; I am in the best of health, and but for anxiety
                                 on account of your dear sake, should be all right though poverty
                                 assail me. The thing that troubles me most"—here Lucina's voice
                                 broke down, and with one anguished sob she turned away. Mabel,
                                 whose hand did not tremble now, but who seemed stunned into
                                 calmness, finished the perusal. "The thing that troubles me most,"
                                 it went on to say, "is that we must give up the cherished wish of
                                 setting poor Lucina free. I would gladly sacrifice as much as I
                                 have lost to do that—but—I am powerless. Is there no practicable
                                 way for her to free herself by escaping? I do not feel as if I do
                                 wrong in suggesting such a thing, for I know that man has no right
                                 to hold a human soul in bondage, nor am I or any man to blame for
                                 showing to the slave unjustly held the road to freedom and helping
                                 him there. I know you will not blame me, my dearest mother, though
                                 I blame myself when I think of the hours I have idled away, and in
                                 which I might have prevented, at least, the mischief my rascally
                                 partner has done me.
                              "Farewell, mother. Expect to see me very soon. You shall not
                                 suffer, whatever are my necessities. I would work my fingers to the
                                 bone to prevent that.
                              
                                 "Farewell and much love.
                                 "Your affectionate son,
                                 "HARRY VAN BROEK."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  "I don't care for myself—but for you, my poor child!"' her voice faltered, she
                     hid her face in the lounge, and the handkerchief which she carried to her face
                     was crimsoned with life blood.
                  "I must go!" exclaimed Lucina, with sudden resolution.
                  "Where, my child?" asked Mabel.
                  "Away—anywhere. Don't you see," she added, huskily, "don't you see that Lawyer
                     Kenneth must have known this before
                     he made you that offer? must have seen it in the paper this morning?"
                  "O! my Father!" exclaimed Mabel, startled into anguish, and lifting hands and
                     eyes heavenward, "can this be so?"
                  Lucina stood irresolute, her eyes fixed upon the floor.
                  "Child, lock the doors again!" exclaimed Mabel, in a, voice much agitated, "my
                     hope has forsaken me, as I fear God has forsaken my poor brother. Waste no
                     time; lock every door and window. I hold no more faith with him; hasten!"
                  Lucina did as she desired, then sank upon a seat, calm and tearless. She had
                     done with tears; she was determined now to act. This last fiendish deed had
                     nerved her up to desperation.
                  "If my brother could be guilty of such an abomination, he has probably placed
                     spices about us. Oh! I am thankful that Harry wrote me. They wished to put thee
                     and me off our guard—then thee had been hopelessly seized. The God in whom I
                     trust will not forsake me now in this my extremity," she cried, lifting her
                     glance with holy confidence heavenward.
               
               
                  PART II.
                  MAGGIE THROWN.
                  They sat in silence for an hour, when Spitfire's peculiarly ringing hoof
                     sounded on the lawn in front. Lucina sprang to a chair, and, lifting herself to
                     the upper blind, looked over.
                  "It is Spitfire, without a rider," she said; "he has a side-saddle hanging over
                     his flanks, and oh! how wicked he looks!"
                  Mabel had undergone too much excitement to feel astonishment at any
                     announcement. She was striving to realize the difference in her position. Vain
                     effort! The only bitter drop in the cup of poverty to her was the reflection
                     that she could not now free Lucina.
                  Presently, Ebony came running toward the house in a state of the wildest alarm,
                     waving his hat and shouting as he sprang from side to side.
                  "Throwed her! throwed her! knowed he'd do it! Oh, good Lord!—Miss Maggie killed
                     for sartin. Ebery bone in she body smashed!"
                  Amy, Hattie and Mrs. Kenneth came flying down stairs in an instant, crying out
                     in terror "What is it, Ebony? Who is killed?"
                  "Oh, Lord, misse, 'specs Miss Maggie killed dis yer minit!" shouted the
                     frightened slave. "She come out here an' 'clar she ride Spitfire; say mars'r he
                     tell she so, an' I 'bliged to put on de gear! Oh, de Lord! mars' sell me down
                     Souf for dat, I 'specs."
                  By this time a whole crowd had gathered at sight of Ebony's curious antics. The
                     news ran round, and various exclamations of horror succeeded, followed by a
                     raising of hands and rolling of eyes, and cries of "No hope for her if she ride
                     dat ugly debbil-beast."
                  
                  "Some one go and see!" said Amy, who had almost lost the power of speech. She
                     stood wringing her hands; "Oh! will nobody go and see?" she cried again.
                  Lawyer Kenneth appeared in their midst, looking angrily about.
                  Uttering an oath, he exclaimed "What's the fuss here?"
                  Amy told him; her lips had grown white, for Hepsy's words rang in her ears.
                  "Well, if he knocked her brains out, I was going to say he served her right,"
                     growled her father. "Any one who will mount Spitfire after the warnings I have
                     given may be considered dead beforehand. The girl must have been an idiot. Eb,
                     come here!"
                  The frightened black came forward.
                  "You're sold down South! Alascus, take Postboy, and ride down the road toward
                     town; get two or three of the other niggers to go in different directions. Does
                     anybody know which way she went?"
                  "To the Hatch woods," cried Amy.
                  The lawyer turned about with a frown; Amy shrank back.
                  "How do you know?" he asked, fiercely.
                  "Because we—we rode up that way this "morning; she wanted to go
                     in, but I would not; so she told me she should return alone, for she was
                     determined to see if there was anything there."
                  "Maniac!" mattered the lawyer; then going towards his horse, which, till his
                     arrival, had been moving restlessly to and fro, he gave him a slight tap on the
                     cheek, saying, "What have you been doing, you brute? Do you know you have
                     perhaps killed some one? I believe you do," he muttered, as the horse drooped
                     his head and hung his ears. "Come, my sweet fellow! to the stable, and if you
                     have been doing mischief to any of my company, you shall have a cowhiding,
                     sir."
                  The horse followed at a slow gait, and poor Ebony, thoroughly miserable, sat
                     down on the grass, and boo-hooed like a child.
                  Alascus had hurried off on Postboy, the others had taken different horses, and
                     were away, some toward the town, others to the Hatch woods. Alascus was among
                     the latter. As they turned off from the straight road, Old Hepsy stood at her
                     gate, watching them. One or two of the slaves paused to speak with her, and ask
                     if she had seen one of the young ladies of the house riding past on
                     Spitfire.
                  Her answer was that she had seen Spitfire once going by toward home, but "he
                     hadn't no young lady on he back," she added. Alascus, with one other of the
                     boys, proceeded directly to the haunted place, as they called the woods. They
                     had begun to ride slowly, for their superstitious fears would hardly allow them
                     to near the outskirts, when they saw a group coming near them with a litter, on
                     which Lay an apparently lifeless body. In a few words they gained the
                     information they wished.
                  "She's pretty badly killed," said one of the bearers, a rough half-white.
                  "No, she ain't killed," responded the other; "I felt her heart beat a little, and she groaned when we
                     took her up. That was a bad throw, that was. I saw the horse all the way from
                     the corner, and he acted like a devil. The girl had a powerful bit of courage,
                     though; she laid about her on all sides, and got him pretty much her way of
                     thinking, when all at once, going as slick as cider, he sheered and threw her,
                     just as if she was a feather. I reckon she thought she'd cowed him right smart,
                     for she 'peared to be looking round easy, like she felt secure."
                  "Her head was throwed on a heap of rocks," said the other, as they paused for a
                     moment. "There, did you hear that? Every time we move her particular, she
                     groans; that ain't a good sign. I think we'd better carry her right into old
                     Hepsy's; they kin get the doctor easier there."
                  "Yes," said Alascus, "if she's bad hurt, and got to die, she better die there
                     than 'stract the nerves of the missus; an' if she ain't bad hurt, she can be
                     easy moved."
                  "Hallo! boy," exclaimed the other, taking up the litter, "who taught you to
                     reason in that ar way? You're a bright child, you are."
                  "Yes, I's my mammy's own chile," said Alascus, laughing; "and as to taughting,
                     I' specs I taughted my own se'f."
                  The men took up their burden again, and went forward in the direction of old
                     Hepsy's cabin.
                  "Who's you got dar?" cried the negress, who had been standing at the gate
                     watching.
                  "Miss Maggie Willis, up to de house—compery—what's hurt bery bad indeed, an' we
                     tinks she's better be brought in to your cabin till we goes arter de doctor,
                     case mars' Kenneth told I to go arter de doctor if we find her bad hurt," said
                     Alascus, removing his hat before he spoke.
                  "Poor soul!" said Hepsy, pityingly, "bring her in, but you knows, boy, I's ober
                     a hundered—nussin' days all ober long go. Lord knows I wouldn't send her to dat
                     onlucky house; 'spec ebery body die dar 'fore long," and so muttering, the old
                     woman preceded them, as they laid the senseless form upon her neat bed, and
                     Ebony hastened for the doctor. News came to the Grange, and all the ladies of
                     the house, with the exception of Mabel, hurried off to old Hepsy's cabin. The
                     doctor was there; the principal injury, he said, was in the head; it might be
                     fatal—might not; couldn't tell for a day or two. The skull must undergo
                     trepanning, as, though the skin was not broken, the bone was fractured in two
                     or three places. She was to have skilful nursing; he recommended that if there
                     was no change for the worse on the morrow, that she had better be carried to
                     the Grange. Mrs. Kenneth installed herself as nurse by the side of the
                     insensible sufferer, thankful to vary the monotony of her existence, even by so
                     sad a duty. Amy dreaded to go back to the Grange, but no one could attend to
                     her father's comfort as well as she; and Hattie concluded to keep her aunt
                     company. Very reluctantly Amy started for home. She remembered the prediction
                     she had spoken of to Maggie when wakened to listen to the death-song, and here
                     was, to her superstitious mind, its fulfillment. Maggie, struck down without a,
                     moment's warning, never, perhaps, to rise again. The Grange seemed deserted, as
                     she entered its portals. The noon
                     work was done, and the slaves had met at their different cabins to talk over
                     the sad casualty. Some reported that the young lady was dead, others that she
                     was dying, and all declared that the horse, Spitfire, was what they had often
                     called him before, the devil's own horse. Amy wandered from room to room; it
                     seemed so strange to see her mother's chamber deserted. She would have gone
                     into Mabel's parlor, for the sake of seeing some one to whom she could talk,
                     but her pride recoiled at the reflection that she must sit there with Lucina,
                     whom, strange to say, she hated without a cause. She went into the
                     conservatory. Old Jim was clipping off the superfluous grape-stems from a
                     beautiful vine. He stopped his work, however, and came forward, shears in
                     hand.
                  "Well, Missy Kenneth," he said, respectfully, "'anyt'ing ole Jim do for
                     you?"
                  "No, Jimmy; I only came in to see the flowers. That oleander is in fine
                     bloom!"
                  "Yes, miss, da's mighty pretty chile, dat is. Laws!
                     t'ought de frost took him las' fall, derefo' cut him,
                     an' bleed him, and 'spec never to see him come up
                        'live agin; now he younger an' more bloomier dan
                     he eber was afo.' 'Deed, chile, 'tinks, when I sees you, Miss
                     Maggie dead an' gone to glory. Was jes goin' to show you de japonicums—five of
                     'em—jes like dey was ready for a funeral. 'Deed, 'twas a lemicholly
                     circu'stance tink ob dat poor chile bein' t'rown head fore-mostest an' mashed
                     all to jelly."
                  "Not quite so bad as that, Jimmy," said Amy, more pleasantly than was her wont,
                     for the accident had softened and subdued her; "she may be dangerously injured,
                     but the doctor hopes not."
                  "I's glad to hear dat," said the old man, "glad to hear dat. Someways I's been
                        'specting a funeral, case dese yer lib forebbers
                     all dead, ebery blessed pot on 'em. Dear Lord knows I try my best to keep 'em
                        live—but no, dey wouldn't live, derefo' dey's all
                        gone."
                  "Your oranges look pretty well," said Amy, anxious to change the subject.
                  "Yes, Miss Amy, I 'specs dey be ripe enuf to eat, some of dem, if dey
                        keeps on de bush, but dey all falls
                     off, some way. Yes, I's put mars' Kenneth's 'servatory long side
                        any other gen'lam's 'servatory in dis yer county.
                     Dar's a bunch ob grapes up dar, which I spees am ripe;
                        derefo', shall I git dem for you? Dey mostly is goin' to mildew
                     dis year, I 'specs. Unfortnit year—da's so!"
                  "No," Amy said, thanking him, to her own surprise, a moment after, and she
                     turned to go in the house.
                  The long afternoon wore away. Marshall Randolph called to offer his services if
                     they were needed, and hearing that Hattie was at Hepsy's cabin, rode off again
                     in that direction. His father, he said, had been very sick, which was an excuse
                     for his not calling. He asked also after Mrs. Van Broek, who had been all day
                     too ill to see any one. For a moment Amy wished there was somebody who would
                     call especially to see her. When she had wished that, she went into the
                     housekeeper's room. The old woman had just come in, donned a clean head-dress,
                     and sat smoking complacently. She started up from her low seat when Amy came
                     in, and her pipe had nearly fallen
                     from her hand. Amy had not been in the housekeeper's room for several months,
                     and the old negress gazed in astonishment at her pale young mistress.
                  "Wha's happened?" was the first exclamation with her customary courtesy.
                  "Nothing; but I was lonesome, and lounging over the house, and seeing the door
                     open thought I would walk in," said Amy.
                  "Laws, honey, you's welcome!" exclaimed old Tabby, bustling about and arranging
                     seats; "dar, you jest set down; mars' gave me dat chair for my own se'f, and
                     it's a real easy one."
                  Amy declined the chair and sat down behind a low screen at the window, from
                     which a beautiful prospect was to be seen. Presently there came a tap at the
                     door, and Hollister entered. Amy could see through the thin screen how sad his
                     face looked, and how care-worn. She caught herself watching his
                     features—colored, bit her lip, and turned away.
                  "Tabby, have you got an old piece of nice linen, something about half a yard
                     square?" he asked. His voice was so melancholy that Amy shuddered; his dark eye
                     moved languidly.
                  "Laws! I don't know, Hollis, you's a mighty sight of trouble anyway;" exclaimed
                     the old woman, not knowing how to act in this emergency, while her young
                     mistress was present. Her eye was directed toward Amy, who nodded her head in
                     approval.
                  "Yes, I spose I's got it—mighty hard work though—go all de way up stars. You
                     Jule!—you Kate!—all dem ar' lazy gals off, ov course. Wha' you want of it, eh?
                     Hollis! make nightcap for youse'f? he! he!"
                  "I don't wear nightcaps," replied Hollister, his voice never losing its
                     sadness; "I want it to do a charitable deed with, Tabby. The head that lays
                     down for the last time needs no covering," he said in a lower tone, as the old
                     housekeeper, seizing her cane, went to look for the linen. Amy was in a fever
                     of apprehension, lest Hollister should come that way and discover her, but
                     there he remained immovable; his arms folded, his eyes bent gloomily on the
                     ground, and heaving every now and then a sigh that told of the deepest woe.
                  Amy could not keep her glances from the face of the slave, who stood turning a
                     little aside, so that his profile only could be seen. Perhaps unconsciously she
                     wished that he were free—her equal: for with the sentiment of pity that of love
                     is sometimes united, and even her heart could not, in all its casing of pride,
                     be wholly indifferent to suffering. She wondered what he meant by saying "the
                     head that lays down for the last time needs no covering;" and without knowing
                     why, connected it with the scene of the morning when she saw him with Keene
                     coming out of the Hatch woods. Tabby now entered, holding a full yard of linen
                     in her hands, which she offered to Hollister, giving him a searching look at
                     the same time. He took it with a moody thank you, and left the room.
                  "Don' see wha' de fellow wants of it," Tabby said, com- ing toward her young mistress. "Laws! I'll tell
                     you all about it. Fust he comes in to see if I's got any old night. gown to
                     spar; den he wants piece o' white tape an' par o stockins'! So I gives up to
                     he, for you knows, Miss Kenneth, we's alles plenty such ole truck to spar in do
                     Grange—an' now he's come for de linen. Well, it's mighty cur'us; can't tell
                     what to make of it, can't so! Thought fust might a wanted for da' pore Miss
                     Maggie; laws! do tell me ef she putty near killed, poor chile!"
                  Amy explained how it was, and wandered off again restlessly into the parlor,
                     seated herself at the piano, and played almost unmeaningly till supper time.
                     Nobody sat at the table but herself. The waiters stood gravely in their
                     accustomed places, and oppressed with loneliness, she could not eat. Then she
                     locked herself in her own room, with Phillis, and tried to while away the time
                     with books and needles, but neither diverted her attention; and throwing
                     herself upon the bed, she soon forgot her weariness in sleep.
                  At that hour Keene was wide awake. He had embraced the opportunity when
                     Washington Grange was left almost alone to get possession of his daughter.
                     Finding that it was not possible to obtain admittance, the usual way, he went
                     round to the front piazza, and tapped upon the window. But the frightened
                     inmates were wary, being apprehensive that the lawyer would set some trap to
                     obtain possession of Lucina. Presently a voice was heard outside, saying, "I am
                     Keene! your friend! open the window that I may slip in a note."
                  The request was immediately complied with; for that voice restored Lucina's
                     confidence; she would almost as soon have doubted heaven as Keene. On the paper
                     which the girl tremblingly carried to the light were written the words:
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "Allow me to hand you a bundle in which you will find a disguise,
                                 and then I will lead you to a place of safety for the present, and
                                 as soon as practicable take you to the North. Trust one to whom
                                 your welfare is as dear as his own, one who would be as a father to
                                 you. Burn this note. Time is precious!
                              
                                 DOUGLAS."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  One hurried consultation with Mabel, and Lucina's course was decided upon. Half
                     wild with the many conflicting emotions that labored in her bosom, the girl
                     reduced the paper to ashes, lifted the window again to receive the bundle,
                     dressed herself, took a hurried and tearful leave of Mabel, and stepped from
                     the window into the protection of one whom she fully trusted.
                  Silently and in the dark, for it was a moonless evening, he guided her. The
                     path seemed very long and circuitous, as Keene had taken every precaution to
                     avoid the huts of, the negroes. On the way, he explained to her the
                     disadvantages under which she would be obliged to labor for a time, housed up
                     in a narrow aperture, under continual apprehension, though he assured her that
                     he thought there would be no chance of discovery. He did not tell her that she
                     was to be under the same roof with Hollister, fearing it would shock her
                     delicacy; but managed with great caution to introduce her into the building,
                     still in the dark, in such a manner
                     that she might not suspect. If she did shudder and tremble going up the narrow
                     stairs, she yet clung confidently to the hand that guided her. She felt so
                     secure in his protection; it was the first moment that she had experienced
                     unalloyed confidence since she had been placed in the condition of a slave.
                  With some little delay, Keene removed the panel which was to admit her, and
                     still groping in the dark, Lucina went in, while Keene procured a candle and
                     entered also, shutting the panel again. When he had struck a light, she glanced
                     around her in astonishment. She was in a long, narrow room, or rather closet,
                     for it was scarcely five feet across. A small mattress entirely filled up one
                     end. Along one side were ranged a very narrow pine table (made to hang against
                     the wall when not in use), two chairs, and a sort of bench, on which books were
                     piled. That was all, save that a narrow strip of carpet was laid the whole
                     length of the floor. Above were two windows in the ceiling to admit the light
                     by day. This was Hollister's work, aided by Keene. The former had stolen many
                     an hour from rest in order to accomplish this labor of love, and here it was,
                     done—well done. No one could have suspected that so much space was stolen from
                     the original room, and Lucina was almost as safe here as if she had been a
                     thousand miles away.
                  "Whatever you wish for," said Keene, "while you remain here, which I hope will
                     not be long, write in pencil upon a slip of paper, and the friend who is almost
                     always here, will receive it at your meal-time. Prison regulations," he added,
                     smilingly, "but better those than what might be!"
                  "Oh, a thousand times!" exclaimed Lucina, looking up at him through tears of
                     gratitude; "how can I thank you for showing so much kindness to a
                     stranger?"
                  Keene bit his lip hastily; the tell-tale tongue was ready to confess, but
                     prudence whispered "no."
                  "Not quite a stranger," he said, stepping back a little, for nature prompted
                     him to take her to his heart, but he repressed the desire, and with a quick
                     "good night," and another caution, she was left alone. Her first impulse was to
                     throw herself upon her knees, and in a fervent prayer pour out her spirit
                     before her God.
                  "It is Thy holy hand that has led me," she cried, in a low, passionate whisper;
                     "I will never doubt Thee again, though the waters rise over my soul."
                  And in the Christian's sweet forbearance, she prayed for her enemies, and asked
                     for blessings upon the head of Lawyer Kenneth, cruelly as he had tortured
                     her.
                  This spirit of forgiveness she had learned to cherish from a constant
                     association with Mabel Van Broek. Through her instrumentality, she had found a
                     hiding-place—a refuge—a Savior; and, like the blessed Jesus, she was ready to
                     cry "Father, forgive them, they know not what they do." Then, with
                     many a thought of Mabel, and many a sigh and tear at the conviction that
                     possibly they might not meet again in this world, she resigned herself to
                     rest.
               
               
                  
                  PART III.
                  HAGAR WASHINGTON.
                  On the following day it was found impracticable to remove Maggie Willis, who
                     still remained insensible. Mrs. Kenneth returned to the Grange for some
                     necessary articles, intrusted the superintendence of the house to Amy, and was
                     about hurrying off, when she bethought herself of Mabel, and wended her way to
                     her room. To her alarm, she found her very ill, scarcely able to move from the
                     pillow, and alone.
                  Her first inquiry was for Lucina.
                  "I have not seen her since last evening at eight o'clock," Mabel replied,
                     faintly.
                  "She has not gone—you don't mean to say that she has left the place?" exclaimed
                     Mrs. Kenneth, wildly.
                  "I fear she has," Mabel replied.
                  "Oh, heavens! then he has got possession of her!" said Mrs. Kenneth, looking
                     ready to fall.
                  "No—no!" said Mabel, with a grateful glance upward, "she hath by this time made
                     her escape. God grant she may be free forever from the captivity of her
                     people."
                  A sudden gleam of joy darted across the face of Mrs. Kenneth, but it was
                     succeeded by a sad, almost hopeless expression, as the words—"What will my
                     husband do?" sprang from her lips.
                  "He must submit!" said Mabel, with more vehemence than Mrs. Kenneth had ever
                     heard before from her gentle lips.
                  "Oh, how very providential that I was not here!" exclaimed Mrs. Kenneth,
                     repressing the tears that welled to her eyes; "but you must not be left alone,"
                     she added, suddenly remembering the feeble situation of her sister-in-law; "Amy
                     will stay with you, and when she cannot, Phillis will wait upon you."
                  "Thank you—I want very little attention now," replied Mabel, smiling sweetly,
                     "one or the other of the servants is calling quite often, and your gardener
                     sends me delicious, fruit."
                  "I am glad of that. I feared there was none eatable," Mrs. Kenneth replied,
                     rising to go.
                  "Maggie is very badly injured, is she not?" asked Mabel in a whisper.
                  "Her recovery is doubtful," was the sad reply.
                  Mabel thought how full of joyous life she had left her the preceding day, and
                     when she reflected on her own apparent uselessness—her feeble life permitted
                     yet to linger on, tears filled her eyes, and she felt that gladly would she
                     have given her fading existence to save one so young, so bright and
                     beautiful.
                  Mrs. Kenneth had been gone but a little while when Marshall Randolph came in,
                     commissioned, as he said, by a letter from Harry, to see that his mother was
                     comfortable, and to say, also, that he intended to take up some money, for
                     which he had no present use, and go into business with her son.
                  
                  Mabel's eyes sparkled at this announcement.
                  "It is a private arrangement," said Marshall; "I am to be a silent partner,
                     and, God willing, I shall turn my attention now more than ever to the
                     emancipation of my father's slaves. The old gentleman, is feeble and irritable,
                     and opposes every plan that I suggest, but still he listens to me, and that is
                     more than he has ever done yet. The dread of coming death softens him, and I
                     give him nearly all my time. But I do not see your servant—perhaps I should
                     say, your friend, here," he remarked, looking about him.
                  "The prey hath escaped!" said Mabel.
                  Marshall bent forward; his lips parted in a glad smile as he exclaimed, "thank
                     God!" In a few moments he added, confidentially, "I heard Mr. Baker boasting
                     yesterday to some of his companions, that he had bought the handsomest slave in
                     the market, and that in a couple of days he would give them a chance to commend
                     his taste. I was at the hotel with our agent, Fred Keene, and I feared then
                     that he would make his word true. But you are alone. This must not be; you are
                     ill, and require the constant attention of an experienced nurse."
                  "Harry will cure me when he comes," said Mabel, with her accustomed
                     gentleness.
                  "Harry would never forgive me, if I left you thus alone," he said; "and, by the
                     way, mother is going to dismiss the nurse who has been with my father; a very
                     celebrated woman in sickness; she was given her freedom by her last master on
                     his dying bed, in consequence of her faithful services. Her name is Hagar
                     Washington, and she is a kind, compan- ionable creature, ready for any mood,
                     gay or serious. I shall take the liberty of sending her up here as soon as I
                     return home."
                  "Thee forgets," said Mabel, and her voice faltered.
                  "I know to what you would refer—not a word of that, if you please—I am
                     accountable to Harry for the health in which he finds you. I am very sure it
                     would distress him to know you were alone."
                  Mabel could not reply, but her heart was overflowing with gratitude for his
                     thoughtfulness and kindness. Beside, she really needed a nurse, for her
                     strength failed rapidly, and every day she felt herself weaker. Harry's
                     cheerful letters had alone kept her courage up, but she longed for some
                     stronger arm to lean upon; she felt the absence of Lucina Keenly, though the
                     poor girl had rendered but little real aid during the past few days, so
                     absorbed had she been in her own troubles.
                  Amy came in professedly to keep her company, but the silent room depressed her.
                     She was anxious about her father, who had not returned the preceding night, and
                     communicated her apprehensions to her aunt. Altogether, Washington Grange
                     presented a lonely and even melancholy appearance. The clouds had gathered
                     since morning, and it was raining monotonously. The slaves, now that the
                     mistress was away, worked or played at their own will, setting the threats of
                     the housekeeper at defiance. It soon began to be noised about the house that
                     Lucina was not at the Grange, and various were the surmises indulged in, though
                     the prevalent opinion seemed to be that she was sold. Amy said nothing about it while in the
                     room with Mabel, although her mother had told her, but dawdled over her
                     embroidery, and felt thankful in her own heart that she was spared the
                     annoyance of seeing one whom, though she could not tell why, she thoroughly
                     detested.
                  In the meantime Marshall had hurried home, engaged the nurse, and before an
                     hour elapsed she stood beside Mabel. An ordinary looking woman at first sight,
                     she became more prepossessing as the day were on. She began to talk almost as
                     soon as she entered. Her voice was marked by those soothing, magnetic tones
                     that sometimes fall by chance upon the ear, and once heard are never forgotten.
                     Hagar Washington was as famous for her voice as her nursing. She often sang to
                     her invalids, and invariably charmed away care. Mabel soon found herself lying
                     on a spotless counterpane, her cheek resting on a fresh, cool pillow, her
                     burning hands moistened with some sweet-smelling lavender water, her
                     disarranged hair smoothed back, and her whole being refreshed with those minute
                     attentions which only experience, united with a kind heart, can give. Hagar was
                     so clean and bright a negress, that it was not possible to look at her without
                     pleasure. Her plump person was encased in a dress of brown linen; a white
                     handkerchief elaborately creased was pinned over her bosom; a white apron,
                     spotless as the snow, nearly inclosed her gown; a white handkerchief, worn low
                     on the forehead, and more in the shape of a turban than was usual with the
                     blacks, set off her mild eyes and pleasing smile to the greatest advantage.
                  Hagar saw in a moment that the delicate invalid before her needed the most
                     careful nursing, and that her mind required change of diet as well as her body
                     needed change of air. She did not, therefore, cease to talk, but after she had
                     placed the room in most perfect order, so that it seemed as if the sun were
                     shining, instead of the dull, murky storm there was, she took out her knitting,
                     and rattled on cheerfully.
                  It was now noon. Amy had gone on a flying-visit to old Hepsy's cabin, whither
                     Ebony drove her. The little lunch which Hagar had prepared with her own hands,
                     and which was delicious both in taste and arrangement, was disposed of, and
                     Mabel, with glowing cheeks, looked so well and so lovely, that Hagar flattered
                     herself she should soon have her patient up, for she thought, "after all,
                     perhaps, it's only a ladyish sickness—the poor thing is tired doing nothing."
                     The rain beat with a heavier rattle against the panes, the wind blew violently,
                     as Mabel lay watching the face that, in spite of its dead black complexion,
                     grew every moment more interesting.
                  "Then thee has been a slave for many years!" she said, in response to some
                     remark of the nurse.
                  "Yes, missis," replied the woman, whose language was nearly free from the
                     African idiom; "I has been a slave till within six months forty-seven years and
                     a half, ma'm, yes'm, forty-seven years and a half I tasted the bitter fruit of
                     slavery. I wouldn't say this to you, but you tells me ma'm, you're a Northern
                     lady."
                  "Yes, thank God! I live where there are no slaves," replied Mabel. "Tell me thy own experience in
                     slavery; thee was raised in Georgia, I think thee said. I want to hear what
                     thee has seen with thine own eyes, and what thee has heard."
                  "Deed, 'm, ef you believe all you hear, might as well eat all you see, an' dat
                     would be mighty hard to do. As to tellin' you what I's seen, my heart! I can
                     tell you thousands; you's hardly believe some things I could tell you, ma'm,
                     what I seen with these own eyes, an' hard with these own ears, an'
                     I darsent lie, 'cause got to give an account to God of everything I say, and
                     lying's mighty wicked. Yes, ma'm, I lived with master French sixteen year—nurse
                     all his children, and thar's whar I come to know poor Charlie."
                  "Who was poor Charlie?" inquired Mabel.
                  "Master's son, ma'm, by the housekeeper. You see marster's oldest son, George,
                     and this Charlie, were born on the same night, and I nursed master George when
                     he was four year old, with a very bad fever. Little Charlie was given to master
                     George, and you never see two such fine little boys in your life, ma'm. My
                     heart! how they did keep together, them children, yes, clear up till they'd got
                     to be young men of twenty-two. George was handsome, so was Charlie; but though
                     I don't want to 'pear to favor my own color, Charlie was the handsomest, and a
                     light fellow too—not much darker than master George.
                  "Well you see, ma'm, niggers is bad about one thing. Poor things—they don't git
                     no larnin', you know, and they don't have no privileges, nor power, so if they
                     gits mad with each other, they does tell of each other, ma'm, to spite them—if
                     I must talk against my own, ma'm, it's the blessed truth.
                  "So one of the women that knowed all about this, worked on the next plantation.
                     And I wants to tell you, ma'm, the slaves on my mistress' plantation didn't dar
                     to set down in presence of their master or mistress, but the mistress, she
                     would let some of the slaves from t'other plantation come in and talk to her,
                     and so we slaves would go and talk with other missuses on other plantations.
                     That would keep order, you sees, and the slaves would know their place on their
                     own plantations.
                  "So, as I say, Sally, on the next place, she got a spite agin our housekeeper,
                     and one day she tells the whole thing to my missus. But my missus didn't
                     believe it, and Sally says, says she, 'Just call 'em in and look 'em in the
                     face.' So missus, she got her jealousy roused up, and she says to George—
                  "'George, how you grows! I wonder which is the tallest, Charlie or you?"
                  "'Oh, Charlie, mother, by a full inch; he has to have all my cast-off clothes
                     made bigger,' says George.
                  "'Well, now, I think that you're the tallest,' says his mother.
                  "'I'd wager with you, mother,' says George, laughing, you see, 'I'm certain
                     Charlie's the tallest.'
                  "'My curiosity is up,' says his mother, pretending to be in fun, you know,
                     'just call Charlie in, and let me see.'
                  "Well, Charlie was called in. I was in the room, and knew all about it, 'cause
                     Sally had told me too. I was taking
                     care of the youngest child, some five year's old then.
                  "Charlie,' says Mrs. French, 'you just stand up thar, side of your master—no,
                     not head to head—but shoulder to shoulder; I can tell best that way.' So they
                     stood so, and they was a handsome pair, but, my heart! so much alike. The poor
                     mistress she only said, 'Charlie is the tallest, oh, my God!' and
                     fainted right away. She couldn't help seeing, you know.
                  "Well, poor Charlie, she hated him then, and said he must go. She raved and
                     took on so that master French he had to sell him. He wanted money that time, so
                     he sold me too—sold us both to the same man, though he made a bargain that
                     Charlie should be a house-servant, and not worked too hard. I never was sold
                     for anything but a nurse.
                  "Poor Charlie! master Woodruff bought him, but instead of keeping him for a
                     house-servant he put him in a saw-mill. Many a time, ma'am has I seen his hands
                     swelled out like puff-balls, and the skin all broke and runnin'. Many's the
                     time I made poultices for them, and when he showed 'em to master Woodruff—
                  "'Humph!' he says, 'hands putty bad—yes—well; jest you work away till you cure
                     'em! and so he did.
                  "One day master Woodruff went away; but before he went, he called Uncle Bobby,
                     the overseer, and showed him five long rafts on the river, and, says he, 'Look
                     here, I'll be back in two weeks; that's got to be sawed, split and piled, or
                     thirty for each, and a hundred for you.'"
                  Mabel shuddered.
                  "Oh, he was a cruel man! leave five great rafts o' wood to be done that way in
                     fourteen days—'deed was it; for 'member, they's got to be handled, dried, and
                     then sawed. My heart! makes my old bones ache to think how dey did work. Saw,
                     saw, saw, all day, all night, all day, all night—saw, saw, saw—Sunday, jes' the
                     same, saw, saw, saw—take a mouthful, take a swaller, an' then saw, saw, saw.
                     Thar was them saws going fourteen days and nights, and when master Woodruff
                     come home, one cord not finished. Well, ma'am, Charlie he just run away;
                     couldn't stan' the fear o' that Whippin'; Uncle Bobby got thirty with the
                     rest—master Woodruff didn't dare hurt him too much, 'cause he worth a good
                     deal.
                  "Poor Charlie, they got him, and brings him back to master Woodruff. Thought to
                     my soul I should die when I heard of it! 'cause I could see that master
                     Woodruff was bad man.
                  "Poor Charlie! Never seed a finer-lookin' young man—'deed I never did. Tall,
                     straight, nice features, pretty smile, and genteel as the next one; but marster
                     Woodruff' he look at him and smile so that he show all his teeth. Mighty bad
                     sign that was, ma'am; and then he says to Uncle Bobby,' Tie him down, and give
                     him one hundred and thirty on his bare back!"
                  "Now, ma'am, I sees this; I don't tell what I hears, but I sees this, and it's
                     true as living Gospel. Back of master Woodruff's house, not far from the
                     saw-mill, and from a little chamber over the shed—'deed could I look right in.
                     First they stripped poor Charlie, and lays him on the floor, face down. Then they pull his two hands up to a
                     steeple driv in de floor, and fasten 'em; then they pull his two feet down to
                     another steeple, till he stratched straight—almost stratch his bones out—and
                     den master Woodruff he stand by to see that he give it good.
                  Poor old Uncle Bobby! didn't like to be soul driver—nice soft heart had old
                     Uncle Bobby; but don't make no difference; cruel masters makes thar overseers
                     do thar business straight. Master Woodruff he stood over Uncle Bobby to see
                     that he 'cut the white devil up right,' he said. Oh, ma'am, it was an awful
                     thing to hear them groans! I stood it till I counted sixty; and the moans they
                     growed fainter and fainter, and then I took sick like, and couldn t har no
                     more. Putty soon Uncle Bobby comes for a great wash-kittle. 'What you want of
                     that?' I ask him. 'Oh, no matter,' he say, and he wiped the tears off of his
                     eyes, and says, 'give me a peck of salt.' So we give him the salt, and he got
                     water from the river and throwed in the salt, and carried the big kittle of
                     salt and water, and had to pour it all over that back. Missis, the skin hung in
                     strips, and the blood"——
                  "Oh, don't, don't!" cried Mabel, shuddering from head to foot.
                  "'Spect it isn't right for you to hear such doin's," said the nurse; "reckon
                     I'll stop thar."
                  "No, no; go on now—only don't tell how he looked," said Mabel; "I can imagine,"
                     and she shuddered again.
                  "Well, they pour it all over his back, then throw on horse-blanket, and then
                     they leave him all night."
                  "Not all night—not leave a poor wretch in that condition a whole night!" Mabel
                     cried, with looks of horror.
                  "Yes, missus," exclaimed Hagar, solemnly, "they did so, and I is knowing to it;
                     they did—'deed they did leave poor Charlie in jest that ar' way the whole
                     blessed live-long night, 'cause Master Woodruff he had thirty more lashes to
                     give him in the morning."
                  "Oh, cruel! cruel! cruel!" cried Mabel, as the tears ran down her cheeks.
                  "Ah, missus, what'll such masters do in the judgment day?" exclaimed Hagar,
                     impressively.
                  Let the whole South ask itself that question!
                  "Well, missus," resumed Hagar, "morning come, an' I was in the kitchen when
                     master Woodruff he came through and say to old Uncle Bobby, 'come, hurry up;
                     git your breakfast with the boys, and then go and give that little white devil
                     his breakfast.' He meant poor Charlie, mam. Uncle Bobby looked mighty sorry—the
                     old man, he look m-i-g-h-t-y sorry; and he sat down to the table, and try to
                     eat, but he couldn't, 'cause food choke him. The boys, you sees, missus, must
                     always stay to table till the oversees done, anyhow, and Uncle Bobby—he kept
                     putting off, and putting off, and making b'leeve eat and drink, for his heart
                     was agin that job; but master Woodruff wouldn't give him no peace. Says he, 'ef
                     you don't hurry Bob, I'll give you the thirty, and thirty added onto it.' So by
                     and by, uncle Bobby he gits up with a face that was dreadful sad, and he walks
                     as slow as ever he can over to the mill, and he takes his jacket off, just so,"
                     suiting the action to the word with
                     an imitation of pulling a coat off very slowly, "and master Woodruff he kept
                     calling him to hurry up, damning him all the time, and cutting the legs of poor
                     Charlie with his whip full a dozen times, cursing because 'the devil wouldn't
                     speak.'"
                  "Presently Uncle Bob he got his jacket off, and he walked very slow to the peg
                     and hung it up, and he took down his thongs, and he stood back to measure—this
                     way."
                  Here Hagar, who was a consummate actress, stood up to imitate the motions of
                     Uncle Bob. She placed a folded paper on the floor to indicate the position of
                     the beaten slave. She pretended to lift the blanket to measure the distance,
                     first explaining that if Uncle Bobby failed to cut the flesh in the requisite
                     manner, in consequence of being too far from the body, his master stood ready
                     to give him a cut for every time he failed.
                  "Well, missus, old Bobby he got ready, an' he turns to master Woodruff and say,
                     'Shall—I—gib he de thirty, or take out wha' you strike he, mars?"
                  "'Give him the whole thirty, the obstinate nigger! I'll make him speak!' says
                     mars' Woodruff. So uncle Bob he goes up to measure, and he stoops down, and his
                     heart fail him—he gets up again. Then he stoop again, and he touches poor
                     Charlie, and when master Woodruff swar at him for being so long, he look round,
                     dis yer way, and says he, 'mars'—mars'—Woodruff—I—I—reckons—h e's —dead!'"
                  "Master Woodruff he comes up, kicks at him with his foot till he turn the face
                     up, all frothed and bloody."
                  "'Why, so—he—is!' says he, with an ugly laugh—'who'd a thought that little
                     whippin' would kill the young devil? ha! ha!—who'd at hought such a little
                     whipping as that would a-killed the young devil? Bob, go down to the shop and
                     get an old box—throw the nigger in somewhere hereabouts, and cover him up; lost
                     my money on that cussed piece of flesh, any how—but had my revenge out of his
                     hide.'"
                  Here Hagar paused, and seemed lost in deep thought; and after a while she said,
                     "Laws, missus, I could tell you worse things than that, ef you wanted to hear
                     'em."
                  There was a strange fascination in the talking and acting of this black Hagar;
                     it threw a spell over Mabel, who was certainly not in a fit condition of mind
                     or body to listen to stories of the horrible; but nevertheless, she could not
                     resist the desire to hear more, particularly as she felt by her narrator's
                     earnest, most solemn language and manner that she was not drawing upon an
                     excited imagination, but from the stores of truth—of stern, dread reality. It
                     was this feeling that prompted her to say, "Go on; tell me more; I would know
                     the extent of this iniquitous wrong. They are human and suffer—why should I
                     shrink from hearing? this moment some poor wretch is doomed to torture."
                  "Ah! missus, little you knows!" said Hagar with a sigh "Sometimes," she added,
                     "a slave gits ugly, and keeps it in till a chance comes, and then wreaks it
                     out.
                  "There was one in Orleans where I lived once; her name was Anne. Anne had a
                     dreadful missus, who used to burn her with the poker when she got mad at her.
                     Anne was burnt all over; great scars up and down her back, great scars on her legs, arms, neck, face—all
                     covered with;em, great ugly scars. She was tall and thin, Anne was, and her
                     missus was a little woman, littler than you, but savage—ugly she was. Anne
                     didn't seem to have no spunk, no spirit, but just beared all her trials till
                     one day, when they was ironing in the kitchen she burnt somethin', jest
                     scorched it a little, you know; her missus smelt the scorch, and come tearing
                     into the kitchen.
                  "'You she devil!' says she, 'what have you burnt?'
                  "Anne jest stood back, scared and pale; she was a yaller girl. Missus seen it
                     was her nightcap, and she jest went to the fire and clapped up a red hot iron,
                     and at Anne with it. All at once the gal jump like lightnin', and says she,
                     'don't missus, don't burn me agin—better not missus, don't make me do it—don't.
                     Satan he put it in my head so many time—and I put it away from me; don't do it,
                     'case maybe I can't stop no longer.' Anne talk so strange, missus she stan'
                     still for a minute, but couldn't do without her revenge.
                  "Well you see it was a great fireplace in the kitchen—mighty big fire, red hot,
                     great coals and great blaze. So as missus fly at Anne, she all at once look
                     wild and wicked, and she spring up with a great scream!—take missus in her arms
                     and throw her right in the fire—'deed she did—I saw my missus afterward; help
                     lay her out; couldn't honey, no way—couldn't straighten her at all; had to bury
                     her double—'deed they did!"
                  "Oh! horror!" cried Mabel, "did she really burn to death?"
                  "Yes, missus, 'deed that Anne hold her till she burn herself so
                     that she die next day. People all turn out, want to kill Anne, but
                     she burn so bad, no use—died and was thrown in a hole, nex day after.
                  "Then there was Prissy," continued the nurse—"Priscilla was very handsome,
                     people called her a beauty. Her master thought a great deal of her, and she had
                     one little son by her master, a dear little boy. Many's the time, missus, I's
                     taken that child in my lap and thought I never seed anything so much like de
                     angels. Well, missus, the man have to help to pay the minister his
                     salary—wanted to keep his name up in de church, and couldn't spare any slave so
                     well as Prissy. So he tell her he must sell her and keep the boy. Poor thing!
                     it made her nigh crazy to be sell away from that child. She cry, and she beg
                     and she scream, and I never hear such prayers as she, put up to her master,
                     'nough to make a stone shed tears, 'deed it was. Well they carried her to the
                     block—she crying an' screamin', and when they sot her up, she say, 'needn't any
                     gen'lem buy me—never do no work again—don't bid for me, gen'lem—I swar I'll
                     never work for you!" But she was handsome, and the auctioneer he praise her
                     beauty, and she knocked down for nine hundred. Well, missus, she laughed, she
                     did, and sing, and bowed to all the company, and danced a minit on de block,
                     and then crying out, 'Willy, Willy,' the name of her little baby, she took a
                     pistol out she had got someway, and shot herself right through the heart. Oh,
                     'twas awful sight—'deed it was. Thar she lay right in the street, and the man
                     what had jest bought her, damning and swearing, and 'claring he'd have the law on her master;
                     'deed 'twas an awful sight, honey, as ever I did see.
                  "Dar was ole Toby, too—they starved him to death 'cause he helped to clar his
                     daughter; and thar was poor Dilly—her baby eat up by the rats; and thar
                     was—laws, honey, I's killin' ye, talkin' so much." As she looked up, Mabel was
                     holding out both hands with an entreating glance, that seemed to say, "Don't,
                     don't tell me any more—I've heard all I can bear." The nearer cause of the
                     distress painted on her face, however, was the arrival of Lawyer Kenneth; for
                     Spitfire's tread resounded through the premises.
                  Mabel trembled in her dread of meeting him, especially as by the manner of his,
                     arrival and by his voice, she knew he was in one of his frightful moods.
                  But before this interview with Hagar closed, Mabel asked her:
                  "Thee says, Hagar, thee has been over forty years—I think thee said nearly
                     fifty years—a slave?"
                  "Yes, missus."
                  "And does thee indeed know all these things in thy own experience?"
                  "Yes, missus, I does."
                  "And are there no exceptions, Hagar?"
                  "Yes, missus, many 'ceptions; and I wouldn't dar say no, to git all o' my color
                     out of slavery. I'se known many a kind master; many a kind missus. But, den,
                     ma'm, 'twan't slavery made 'em kind; 'twas the love of the blessed
                     Lord in their hearts, and they couldn't help being kind, anyhow. Den, ma'm,
                     dere's the power; it's the power what makes em cruel.
                     Seem's to me, ma'm, it's that turns their heads; that's what makes their hearts
                     grow harder than de nether millstone. Bless ye, missus, many on 'em would be
                     mighty clever, if it wan't for slavery."
                  "Yes," said Mabel, to herself, "it is even so. And what can be the cause of
                     this sad state of things? The people of the South have the same nature with us
                     of the North; why, then, should such outrages as these be thus committed among
                     them? There is a reason."
                  Lifting from her table a book that belonged to Governor Van Broek's library,
                     she read, in silence and deep thought, from WASHINGTON'S Letters:
                  "The native vigor of the soul must wholly disappear, under the
                     steady influence and the demoralizing example of profligate power and
                     prosperous crime."
                  Mabel remained thus thoughtful and silent for some moments.
                  "THERE IS NO REMEDY FOR SLAVERY," said the Quarkerness, "BUT EMANCIPATION."
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXII.
               IN FOUR PARTS.
               
                  PART I.
                  LAWYER KENNETH, GOADED BY WINE AND DEMORALIZED BY HIS OWN
                     PASSIONS, FILLS THE CUP OF HIS SORROW TILL IT OVERFLOWS.
                  
                     
                        "Around her, crowd distrust and doubt and fear."
                     
                  
                  AMY met him with heartfelt pleasure. She had been so anxious on his account
                     that she forgot all fears as to his condition. She sprang down the hall stairs
                     and out on the piazza."
                  "A pretty piece of business!" he exclaimed, as he met his daughter; "some one
                     has got that girl off, hey? Two thousand dollars out of my pocket," and then be
                     began to swear, and walk up and down the hall, mad with passion. "Your Aunt
                     Mabel contrived it, I suppose, and your mother was privy to it, and you knew
                     all about, and my whole household has conspired against me! oh! 
                        
                           "If I had the sense
                           That would balance the straw,
                           I'd choose the one I'd want
                           From the picture I would draw!"
                        
                     
                  
                  Then he stopped short, and with hands uplifted, writhing like wounded snakes,
                     he began to curse his wife, Lucina, his sister, and his Maker, in the most
                     revolting language that blasphemy could invent. Suddenly he changed his mood,
                     inquired after the servants, said there were three slave-dealers in town, and
                     he meant to sell off every slave in his possession; declared that he would not
                     have one on the premises; ordered Phillis off to the cabins, sent word to the
                     housekeeper not to let herself be seen while he was around; ending by
                     exclaiming to Amy, "I'm going to give your mother HELL!"
                  Amy fled, frightened, up stairs sobbing to her chamber, while the lawyer
                     hurried off to his sister's room. His lips and cheeks were white with rage.
                     Mabel started up in deadly fear at his appearance, then sank down pallid and
                     fainting upon the couch.
                  "Madam!" he began, "I require my property at your hands! I left her in your
                     charge; where is the girl?"
                  At first, Mabel formed her lips to speak in vain. They quivered so violently
                     with the excitement of her frame, that she could not utter a word. While he
                     stood there glaring upon her, she said "The poor dove is at last beyond your
                     power!"
                  "Oh, hell!" shouted the frenzied man, "don't talk about doves to me! The girl
                     was my property, and I would have lost"—he paused for a moment ere
                     he added—"yes, I would have lost my soul rather than lose
                     her!"
                  Mabel shut her eyes, shuddering
                  
                  "Where is she?" asked the lawyer, sternly, going toward his
                     sister.
                  "It is not in my power to tell," she replied.
                  "Mabel! you lie; you know you lie!"
                  It was said in a low, wicked voice, and it almost broke the fluttering heart
                     that had already borne far too much.
                  "The man who says my mother lies is a coward and a villain!" exclaimed Harry,
                     who had suddenly appeared in the doorway, bespattered with mud, a travelling
                     bag in his hand, his eyes flashing fire.
                  Another moment, and Mabel lay upon his bosom, and the lawyer exclaiming, "You
                     insolent scoundrel!" and casting a look of wrath toward him, seemed undecided
                     whether to kill him outright, or to let him live on a little longer. Harry's
                     attention was, however, wholly occupied with his mother. Ill as he had left
                     her, he was not prepared for such a change. He laid her tenderly back upon the
                     lounge, whispering words of endearment, and inwardly accusing himself for not
                     having carried her home with him.
                  Lawyer Kenneth stood beating his foot, his whole manner indicative of drunken
                     ferocity.
                  "As for you, uncle," said Harry, turning toward him, "I cannot believe you
                     would use such language toward my mother and your own sister, unless you were
                     under the influence of something widely different from reason. I shall leave
                     your house, and so shall my "mother. We have received an invitation to go over
                     to General Randolph's, and I shall avail myself of it at the earliest
                     opportunity. If it be any consolation, know that you have driven your own
                     sister from your door in a wild, inclement night."
                  "Oh, Harry! Harry!" exclaimed Mabel, in a deprecating voice.
                  "Let me say my say, mother; you have suffered enough under this roof; I have
                     heard all about it, and as I know there is a just God, I dare not stay here
                     another night. Nurse, get her shawls, wrap her up, it is only damp out, not
                     cold; see that she is well protected from the rain."
                  Lawyer Kenneth folded his arms, and surveying him icily, said, in that
                     indescribable voice of his, so filled with passion and yet so wonderfully
                     mastered: "It is well you are going, young man! let me tell you, well you are
                     going;" to which, Harry did not deign to reply, and the lawyer, humming
                     fiercely to himself, left the apartment. He immediately commenced walking from
                     room to room, occasionally calling "Amy!" and urging her, in despairing
                     accents, not to leave him alone.
                  By the time the lamps were lighted, Mabel Van Broek was lying in the chamber of
                     Mrs. Randolph, who, though herself an invalid, watched her with the most loving
                     assiduity. Marshall was well pleased with this arrangement, as his father had
                     seemed more seriously ill after the nurse had gone. He missed her soothing
                     presence, and now it was arranged that Hagar should divide her time between the
                     two. Marshall and Harry sat down together to talk over their plans for the
                     future. Marshall had been shown his father's will. Twenty-five valuable slaves
                     were to fall to his lot. These, he said, if they ever came into his posses- sion, he should immediately free,
                     and as they were among the most valuable of his father's property, and most
                     intelligent among the slaves, he hoped thus to stimulate others to sacrifice,
                     whom he knew to be in favor of emancipation, though still halting between
                     expediency and interest. If his example might serve his country, though at some
                     far future time, he was content to suffer.
                  He told Harry a touching story of old Jordan, who had died within a week. Just
                     as the breath was leaving the body of the aged saint, Marshall rushed beside
                     his poor bed in the cabin, and lifting the cold hand placed a folded paper
                     within.
                  The slave raised his dim eyes, and turned them toward Marshall with the words,
                     "wha' da' massa?"
                  "Your FREE PAPERS!" said Marshall, in a choking voice. "You are your own man,
                     Jordan, a pitiful gift to you now."
                  "Don't say dat, sweet massa Marshall. I's alleys wanted to die free!" and
                     lifting both trembling hands, he grasped the blessed paper and brought it
                     reverently to his lips. The tears rushed to his eyes; yet while they ran down
                     his cheeks in round heavy drops, he smiled, and sobbed to himself in a soft,
                     coaxing tone, "Is I free? Yes, I's free—I is free!
                     Lord's too good to pore ole Jordan!"
                  The next day they buried him, but Marshall with his own hands laid his free
                     papers over his withered heart, saying, sorrowfully, "I wish I could have
                     placed them next to a living heart twenty years ago."
                  The young man also confided to his friend his love for Hattie Goldsmith. It was
                     pleasant to learn that she had decided to give up her slaves, not for his sake
                     only, but because thoroughly convinced that it was an outrage upon liberty,
                     justice, truth, and God himself, to keep human souls in degrading bondage.
                  They talked of laughing Maggie Willis, of whose sad state Harry had been
                     shocked to hear.
                  "It seems as if the Grange was fated," said Harry, whose thoughts had been
                     reverting to the past few weeks of his life.
                  "They said a curse hung over it during old Hollister's life," responded
                     Marshall. "If all the stories told about him are true, he was wicked enough to
                     bring a curse on any place."
                  "I am not superstitious," said Harry, but it seemed to me as if something told
                     me not to stay in that house another day. When I placed my foot on the
                     threshold this evening, I felt a revulsion of spirits worse a thousand times
                     than that occasioned by my business losses. The air of the place was upas-like.
                     I breathed it with discomfort, and judge of my feelings when the first words I
                     heard were, that my mother was a liar! What a fiend that man is!"
                  "He is verging fast on to maniacy," Marshall said; "I don't know what has kept
                     it off so long. The doctors declare his next attack must be fatal.
                  "What do you say to going up to old Hepsy's cabin?" he asked, suddenly rising
                     and unloosing the heavy curtains at the windows, as a slave brought in the
                     astral lamp.
                  Harry assented, though he felt some repugnance to behold the insensible girl
                     whom he had left so bright and blooming. He had been delighted with Maggie, her
                     truthfulness of character, her merry
                     winning ways; but looking upon her as a thoughtless, fashionable girl, and
                     particularly as a slave-holder, he had not committed himself by more than a
                     harmless admiration: and if ever thoughts of a warmer attachment had intruded,
                     his failure had put them all to flight.
               
               
                  PART II.
                  THE WIFE DENOUNCED.
                  The night was dark and stormy, as the day had been. Marshall and Henry were
                     driven up to the door of old Hepsy's hut. Mrs. Kenneth had watched all the
                     night previous, and having sent for Amy, lay upon one of the three cots that
                     ranged about the room, trying to sleep. Their meals had been brought from the
                     Grange, at regular intervals, and old Hepsy was just finishing her supper by
                     herself. Hattie sat almost immovable beside Maggie. She, too, was weary, having
                     been all day employed in writing letters to friends of Maggie in different
                     States. Her father had been telegraphed, and was expected in the course of two
                     or three days. Old Hepsy alone seemed unchanged. Her great mop of hair
                     glistened just as whitely in the candle-ray; her weird, singular visage had
                     lost not a whit of its solemnity of expression. Her form was at times a little
                     more bent, her manner a little less stately; but her prophetic words were as
                     cautiously uttered, and seemed to have lost none of their force. She was still
                     Africa, denouncing the oppressors of her country.
                  "'Deed, honey," she said in reply to a remark of Hattie's, "mustn't go back to
                     da' house; 'deed no, chile; I feels oncommon strange dis yer night; I does so!
                     I's heered all manner o' noises, an' seen all manner o' sights, and las' night
                     I dream I see old mars' Hollister's sperit! Better b'leeve, honey, when I dream
                     dat ar' dream, something's going to come, mor'n or'nary way; da's
                     so—sartain!"
                  "But poor Amy! she must be lonesome;" said Hattie.
                  "Never you mind dat, chile. Lord's ways ain't as our ways; guess He knows how
                     to take car' o' her, 'sides which we's sent for her; better b'leeve, honey,"
                     she said in a lower voice, pointing to the form of Mrs. Kenneth, "she don't dar
                     go; she's warned; she is, chile."
                  Hattie turned uneasily, and gazed upon the fair, unconscious girl beside her.
                     Not one whit altered was Maggie Willis. Her cheeks and lips were tinged with a
                     faint carnation, the curls were swept back from her white and beautiful
                     forehead, and the dark, thick lashes rested against the pearly whiteness just
                     underneath. She had not moved, opened her eyes, or spoken, since she was laid
                     on Hepsy's bed. An operation had been performed on the skull, but no traces of
                     consciousness had followed. There she lay, lovely as a dream, and there, it was
                     possible, she might lie for weeks; so her medical attendants said.
                  In the noise of the tempestuous wind they had not heard the carriage stop at
                     the gate; now a low knock sounded at the door, and old Hepsy ushered in
                     Marshall and Harry. The latter
                     recoiled at sight of the senseless figure, thinking at first that death had
                     fashioned that immobility of feature. But when he saw how it was, he said, "how
                     beautiful!" and folding his arms, stood gazing at her. The merry, laughing
                     Maggie who had always hailed his arrival with a smile and a jest—strange,
                     strange to see her lying thus, so quiet, so like death, utterly insensible of
                     his presence. Hattie greeted Marshall modestly but cordially, inquired after
                     Mabel, and expressed great satisfaction when she heard that she had gone from
                     the Grange.
                  "Someway I cannot bring my mind to return there," she said; "since Maggie was
                     injured I have had the greatest dread of the place. It is a very foolish
                     feeling, I am perfectly well aware, but I find it impossible to conquer it. I
                     am very anxious about poor cousin Amy; we sent for her before dark, but we have
                     not heard from her since."
                  "Suppose we bring her up here?" said Marshall to Harry.
                  "Pray do," said Hattie, earnestly. "Tell her, if you please, that there is very
                     good accommodation here, and that to-morrow, if I can possibly make up my mind
                     to do so, I will return with her to the Grange. How the storm rages! I thought
                     I heard a step; perhaps Amy has come."
                  It was not Amy who entered the door, but Lawyer Kenneth, his brow dark and
                     stormy as the night without.
                  He glanced round him with a frown as he asked the question, "Where's my
                     wife?"
                  Mrs. Kenneth sprang up from her sleep, and turned her half-open eyes toward
                     him. It was no dream. There he stood, fearful as he had appeared toward her the
                     last two months; there he stood, glaring upon her. Both Marshall and Harry,
                     fearing violence, had started to their feet.
                  "You sent for Amy," he said, pointing toward Mrs. Kenneth. "She can't come;
                        I have come instead. Where is Lucina?"
                  "I—I don't know," gasped his wife.
                  "I ask you again—where is Lucina?" he said, in a higher tone.
                  "Upon my soul, Everard, I do not know!" cried Mrs. Kenneth, shrinking, white
                     and coward-like, back from his eye.
                  "Upon your soul!" sneered Lawyer Kenneth; "I wouldn't give a
                     farthing for your soul! Gentlemen," he added, turning toward Harry and
                     Marshall, "that woman is not to be believed on oath. Eighteen long years she
                     has carried a lie in her heart. It is unmanly in me to expose her, is it? Look
                     at her, then! I need say nothing more; only, it is a pity the girl is gone; she
                     was nothing to me except in the way of dollars and cents, but a great deal to
                     her in the way of flesh and blood! Oh, I won't say anything! I
                     won't tell you the story that came into my head as I drove hither—a curious
                     story—which would form the staple of a thrilling book; mind you—a story not of
                        my invention—a story of a planter's daughter, whose father gave
                     one his liberty and another money to hush up the truth and save the honor of a
                     wild girl. Pho! it was not worth saving; there was nothing to save; it was
                     gone, absolutely! You have seen a
                     broken piece of furniture aptly put together, and sold as good as new; so was
                     she; but the flaw was there though concealed from the purchaser.
                        Purchaser I said! yes, for he gave in return heart, body and
                     soul—a great price, gentlemen, for a worthless bargain!"
                  His wife had sat, crouched in a guilty heap, upon the side of her bed. Now she
                     looked forth from her hollow eyes, and stammered out, "Will not years of
                     remorse and terror, repentance and expiation, atone for that poor creature's
                     guilt?"
                  "No, never!" he replied, sternly. "Henceforth she is repudiated! Henceforth she
                     must never see more her husband or his child! Henceforth she must live branded
                     with the mark of shame—unless FRED KEENE takes care of her!"
                  With one wild cry, Mrs. Kenneth stretched forth her hands toward old Hepsy.
                        "You will not desert me!" she cried, brokenly. Hepsy hurried to
                     her side, sat upon the bed, and threw her sheltering arms about her old
                     master's child. Tears, an unusual thing for her, rained down her aged
                     cheeks.
                  "Lord knows I won't, poor lamb!" she faltered forth. "Lord knows I'll stay by
                     you, an' cling to you, while ole body last. 'Twon't be long you'll be
                     persecuted, honey; hand ob de Lord on his house. Spirit dat won't forgib,
                     chile, worser dan one dat sins, I'spect. Soul dat grows hard an' wicked under
                     trouble, God take Heself away from. Sure as you live, honey, God deal with he!
                     I knows all about it, poor lamb! an' I pities ye, and has pitied ye, eber sence
                     poor Jack die. 'Fore dat time, 'deed I' was mighty "savage, an' I curse de
                     whole house an' land. Hopes de Lord forgives me." She bowed her white head over
                     the shattered frame in her arms, entirely broken down.
                  "A scene, gentlemen! a scene!" shouted the lawyer with his fearful laugh,
                     followed by a wild air, sang to negro words. Then, snapping his fingers and
                     yelling a chilling oath, he went out.
                  Marshall and Harry had stood silent spectators of the sight that seemed so
                     unearthly in the presence of apparent death. Not wishing to witness the anguish
                     of the deserted wife, who was now weeping bitterly, they immediately took their
                     leave.
                  "This is a new aspect of slavery," said Harry, sheltering himself as quickly as
                     possible within the carriage.
                  "Harry Van Broek!" exclaimed Marshall, his voice choked with emotion, "these
                     are the things that make one great brothel of the South. I myself have known in
                     this very town slave-owners send their young daughters from home to keep them
                     away from the slaves. It is a system full of abominations. It corrupts the
                     daughter as well as the son—the mistress as well as the master—though the
                     criminals are supposed to be comparatively fewer in the former cases. Still
                     they do occur, and no one will attempt to deny it."
               
               
                  
                  PART III.
                  HOLLISTER OUTRAGED.
                  Lawyer Kenneth left the cabin in a mood of mind by no means enviable. How to
                     obtain a clue to the missing girl was his fierce and oft-repeated query.
                     Thinking that Keene and Hollister had been seen together often of late, he bade
                     Ebony drive to the carpenter's cabin. The rain rattled so loudly, and the wind
                     blew so fiercely, that the carpenter, at work within by a feeble light, did not
                     hear the arrival. Ebony struck the door with a whip-handle. Hollister's pale
                     face appeared at a narrow aperture, as he did not venture to open the door
                     wider.
                  "Here! I'm coming in," shouted Kenneth, one foot already on the carriage step;
                     "open that door!"
                  The slave obeyed, trembling with apprehension, while his cheek had turned yet
                     more ashen. Hollister stood and endeavored to hide with his body, and by
                     artfully disposing the light, a large object, with a cloth thrown over it.
                     Kenneth's quick eyes discovered his purpose. He lifted the candle, and with the
                     remark, "You are disregarding rules, boy, burning candles at this hour," he
                     went directly to the cloth, and threw it back, recoiling as he did so. It was a
                     coffin.
                  "What in perdition does that mean?" exclaimed Kenneth, turning and eyeing
                     Hollister, who had retreated against the wall. "Is that for you or me?" he
                     asked, fiercely.
                  
                     
                        HOLLISTER.
                     
                  
                  
                  "Neither, sir," replied Hollister, whose eyes shone like two fires on his
                     pallid cheeks.
                  "Who then?—come, no fooling! What, in the name of all that is infernal, are
                     these strange things going on about my house for? Trying your hand at a new
                     trade, eh? A smart coffin, painted and varnished; who pays you for this?"
                  "Nobody, sir," returned Hollister, meekly, though as soon as he had spoken he
                     pressed his lips together tightly, and folded his arms over his chest, as if to
                     keep down the indignant pulses.
                  "Nobody, sir," mimicked Lawyer Kenneth; "and I suppose you made it for 'nobody,
                     sir," he added, in provoking tones. "Come, boy!—no fooling! Why do I find you
                     using my time and materials, and my strength, as to that—yes, my bones and
                     blood—in doing this sort of business? Who is that concern for?"
                  "Nobody that you care about," said Hollister, defiantly, stung almost to
                     madness by his taunts.
                  Lawyer Kenneth stood one moment, paralyzed by this speech, then slowly
                     advancing toward him, till he held the candle almost against his face, he
                     said:
                  "You insolent devil! will you answer me as you should or not? Who did you make
                     that coffin for?"
                  "I made it for my mother, sir!" cried Hollister, passionately.
                  Kenneth fell back. "Your mother?—your mother!" repeated the delirious man,
                     slowly, with a short, light laugh." "I didn't know as you fellows ever had
                     mothers; had an idea that you sprung
                     up like mushrooms! Oh! I understand; that old nuisance out here in the Hatch
                     woods is dead, is she? Well, that's the best news I've heard to-day. My hogs
                     will get better feed now."
                  Hollister almost sprang up in the place where he stood, and shook with rage,
                     and wounded pride and blasted love, from head to foot. Even his master, half
                     crazy though he was, recoiled a few paces at sight of his set lips and wild
                     eyes.
                  "Come, none of this acting," at last he said; "and as for the crazy old
                     nigger—she's gone, and I'm glad of it; I wish every black curse on the place
                     would follow her—I do, I swear! You just cut that coffin for fire-wood for my
                     kitchen stove to-morrow, and take an old box from the mill, and cover her up.
                     Remember! you can't have your way. She died a slave, and you're a slave yet, my
                     boy!"
                  "Lawyer Kenneth!" said Hollister, moving forward a little way.
                  "Lawyer Kenneth!" cried his master, with a frown; "do you presume to treat me
                     like an equal? What do you mean, boy? Say master."
                  "Master Kenneth, then," responded Hollister, in a stifled voice.
                     "I have always done my best to please you"——
                  "There, that will do! Needn't make any apology to me; when I've
                     said it, I've said it. I tell you that rotten thing shan't be buried in a
                     coffin. Is that enough?"
                  "Very well, sir," replied the slave.
                  "And you obey me! Now, where's Keene?"
                  "I don't know, sir," replied Hollister, doggedly.
                  "I more than suspect that both you and he are implicated in abducting my slave
                     girl, Lucina," the lawyer said, his hand on the latch.
                  Hollister made no reply.
                  "Have you heard him speak of it?" asked the lawyer, pausing again.
                  "Yes, sir," responded the slave.
                  "You have—have you? And do you think he knows of her whereabouts?"
                  "Yes, sir," Hollister replied, still sullenly.
                  The lawyer came further into the room.
                  "And do you know where she is?"
                  Hollister looked up. One flash of triumph shot from his eyes as he answered, "I
                     do, sir."
                  "You do, eh? Well! just oblige me by divulging," said the lawyer, all
                     expectancy.
                  "That I am not at liberty to do," replied the slave.
                  "Not at liberty to do!" cried the lawyer, with a long, loud laugh, after having
                     contemplated his slave in dumb silence for the space of a few moments. "Oh!
                     that is too good! 'Not at liberty!" Pray, my dear
                     sir," and he made a low, mocking bow, "may I be so bold as to inquire
                        why you are not at liberty to, sir!"
                  "Because I please not to," almost yelled Hollister, straightening
                     himself up.
                  The lawyer, still holding his hat off, surveyed him from head to foot, and
                     began to sing—looking him over, moving his head, tapping his foot, then, with
                     another rapid change of countenance, he exclaimed, "Look here, boy!—you're sold! You're sold down in Georgia,
                     my fine fellow!—common field hand; slave-dealer down town offered me a fair
                     price this afternoon; wants some niggers to work up—you understand! I shall
                     drive down there as soon as I leave here, and seal the bargain. Just about make
                     up my loss on the girl. Cash down for you and Ebony. Look here, my boy!"
                  Hollister neither moved nor replied.
                  Lawyer Kenneth drew a pistol out of his breast pocket.
                  "I'll just show you that I'm not going to be trifled with," he said coolly,
                     putting it back again, then turning to the door, he ordered Ebony to leave the
                     carriage, and bring Hercules back with him. Ebony obeyed, and soon the stalwart
                     blacksmith stood inside the cabin, looking about wonderingly.
                  "Now, my fine fellow!" said Kenneth, motioning Ebony to step inside, also,
                     "walk out here, or I swear I'll shoot you down like a dog!"
                  Hollister obeyed, and moved with as erect a mien as he could to the middle of
                     the floor, where he stood eyeing his master.
                  "You say you know where Lucina is, at this moment?"
                  "I do," replied the slave.
                  "You say you won't tell me where she is? or, in other words, you
                        'decline?'" "Another mocking bow.
                  "I do, sir," said Hollister, deliberately.
                  "Well, now, you white cur! I never whipped a slave in my life. It has rather
                     been my boast that I never soiled my hands with their hides, but I
                        swear! in addition to sell- ing you down South, I'll whip you
                     till your back is blistered, if it makes the difference of a thousand dollars
                     in the sale! STRIP!"
                  Hollister remained immovable.
                  "Hercules, strip him," said Kenneth, turning to the blacksmith.
                  The man dared not disobey, though he moved forward with extreme reluctance.
                     Hollister, however, submitted without opposition, and his back was bared.
                     Lawyer Kenneth took the heavy coach-whip from Ebony's hands, and lashed the
                     creeping flesh of Hollister till the fine, smooth skin was cut in fifty places,
                     and the blood streamed from as many wounds.
                  "There!" exclaimed Kenneth, "now, to-morrow morning, if you don't tell me where
                     the girl is, I'll shoot you, as sure as hell!"
                  He was the more incensed that Hollister, with stoical firmness, had never once
                     winced, groaned, or given any sign of physical pain; but, as he turned toward
                     him, eyed him with the same determined glance that he had before shrank under.
                     "Hercules, you may go!" said the lawyer, as Hollister coolly resumed the
                     garments that had been stripped from him.
               
               
                  
                  PART IV.
                  THE LAST MOURNFUL INTERVIEW.
                  Hollister was alone in his cabin. With folded arms he stood immovable, looking
                     toward the door his master had left. His calmess, under the infliction of such
                     an outrage was fearful to witness. It was like the awful hush that reigns
                     before the devastating tempest. His lips were locked, and his eyes were like
                     steel. Not a muscle seemed to move; he was totally unconscious that his back
                     was bleeding, or that fierce, acute pain stung every nerve. Then he slowly
                     lifted one clenched hand heavenward, and shook it as slowly as if registering a
                     deliberate vow. There was not a shade of living color in his cheeks; all was
                     dead, ashen white.
                  Turning toward his bench, he took from an old tool-box a short, dark vial, and
                     held it up toward him.
                  "The time has come!" he muttered; "what a glorious night it will be! and what a
                     day will follow! I have called him master for the last time, as he has called
                     me slave! To-morrow there will be no one to call him father. Yes! my mother's
                     voice urges me on! I hear it outside in the wild voice of the wind—'Revenge my
                     wrongs, my son! revenge my wrongs!' Yes, mother! to-night! to-night!"
                  "Sold down in Georgia! Ha! ha! ha! ha! Lawyer Kenneth, you're losing money
                     fast—ha! ha! ha! ha! Sold down in Georgia!" Making a sudden gesture of pain, he
                     cried, "Sure enough; I had forgotten the whipping— for which you, Lawyer
                     Kenneth, shall pay dear. Life—life shall be the price!—dear life—precious
                     life!
                  "Why don't Keene come? My candle is almost burned out. That's his step! You are
                     late, Fred," said Hollister, as his foster brother entered.
                  "Yes, but the old man wanted me. Now he is sick he's afraid of his shadow, and
                     has an idea that some of his slaves want to murder him!"
                  Hollister laughed so wildly, that Keene watched him with some surprise.
                  "You should have been here before," said Hollister; "we came near having a
                     tragedy; Kenneth has threatened to shoot me!"
                  "Why so?" asked Keene.
                  "Because I told him I knew where Lucina was."
                  "Hollister!" exclaimed Keene, angrily, "you never were so imprudent!"
                  "So I advise you," continued Hollister, as if not heeding the remark, "to take
                     Lucina away to-night. The storm will favor you. Besides, they will probably
                     search the premises to-morrow."
                  "Hollister, you are crazy!"
                  "Yes, I think you're right, Keene," replied the young man, moodily striking his
                     forehead, "I believe I am—I believe I am, or going to be."
                  "Hollister! Hollister! this is foolish, this is unmanly," exclaimed Keene,
                     striking him lightly upon the shoulder, at which Hollister sprang quickly
                     back.
                  "Unmanly! am I a man, Fred Keene? I was, but I have been stripped of my manhood to-night! Do
                     you know I am going on a little pleasure-trip? Kenneth has sold me, or is
                     selling me now, down in Georgia."
                  "You're joking," said Keene.
                  "God's truth!" replied Hollister, solemnly; "but I hardly think I shall attempt
                     the journey."
                  "Run for it, to-night," said Keene; "you couldn't have a better time."
                  "I shall be a good way from here to-morrow, Keene."
                  "Good on your head, my boy!" exclaimed Keene, striking him as usual upon the
                     shoulder, smarting with its recent laceration. Hollister winced with pain, and
                     again recoiled under the blow.
                  "How strangely you act to-night, Hollister!" said Keene; "with liberty so near,
                     you ought to be in another mood. Once gone, I don't believe Kenneth would
                     attempt to hunt you, for he is next to insane; and I believe your loss would
                     upset him. Come—you ought to be getting ready."
                  "My mother!" shuddered Hollister.
                  "I will attend to that," said Keene, soothingly. "She shall have a
                     decent burial. The old people who are taking care of the corpse will see that
                     no harm comes to it. She shall be buried in that coffin; I swear
                     that!" he added, passionately, when Hollister told him of Lawyer Kenneth's
                     declaration.
                  "It occurred to me once or twice," said Hollister, with a light laugh, "that I
                     might be finishing that box for myself."
                  "Nonsense!" cried Keene; "you are excited and feverish; come, man, we are
                     losing time. You know the route well enough; the only thing to do is to avoid
                     the patrols, and"—
                  "Yes, yes, I know all that," said Hollister, impatiently.
                  "Then as soon as you are safe, write me, and I will come on immediately with
                     Lucina. I have fifty dollars with me; that sum will last you a week"—he
                     proffered the money, which Hollister took—"I have plenty of cash in safe
                     keeping, twelve hundred or so, and we will live like gentlemen, and be as happy
                     as we can. Come, look up, Hollister!"
                  Hollister replied with a grim smile.
                  "As for Lucina, I shall risk taking her over to the Randolphs' for the little
                     time she remains here, a night or two. Mrs. Van Broek can keep her safely in
                     her room, and no one be the wiser if we manage rightly. I'll go over now and
                     arrange it. It's a capital night."
                  "Keene!" said Hollister, in some trepidation.
                  "Well!" Keene turned back a moment.
                  "Only good bye!" returned Hollister, holding out his hand.
                  "Well, sure enough! you ought to start off," said Keene, extending his hand.
                     "Why!—Hollister—I shall see you again sometime!" Fred said this smilingly, for
                     the former had thrown himself upon his shoulder, and clung to him for a full
                     moment.
                  "Maybe not!" returned Hollister, gloomily.
                  "None of your superstitious fancies, my dear brother!" Keene said, playfully;
                     "God bless you and give you success."
                  Again Hollister seized his hand in both of his own, and the look he gave him
                     then, Keene never forgot.
                  
                  Throwing on an old cloak which had once been Lawyer Kenneth's, Hollister gave
                     one final glance about the cabin, placed the vial in his breast-pocket, and
                     lifting the latch, faced the wild night. Never had the equinoctial, come before
                     its time, raged more furiously than did the storm which he now breasted. Slowly
                     he worked his way in the direction of the kitchen. Through the two windows a
                     light streamed gaily, showing the descending torrents in its vicinity, and
                     looking more welcome from the contrast without. Aunt Esty was a privileged
                     person, and allowed to use candles later than the other slaves. Sometimes a
                     burst of merriment sounded from the inmates of the kitchen, and then all was
                     silent again. Hollister paused a moment before he threw the door open. His tall
                     figure, wet and dripping cloak and slouched hat, caused a simultaneous scream.
                     He took off his hat and advanced among them.
                  "Oh! ef I didn't 'tink to de blessed Lord 'twas mars' Kenneth," said Aunt Esty,
                     her good-humored countenance radiant with smiles; "well, Hollis," she
                     continued, "you's paid me quite an honor—come an' see me dis bad night!"
                  "Felt a little lonesome; thought I would come where there was good company,"
                     said Hollister, seating himself, maintaining his composure in a wonderful
                     manner, while the fever of his wounds was so violent that he had bitten his lip
                     till it throbbed with pain.
                  Nearly all the household servants were grouped about the expiring fire in the
                     great fire-place. The old house-keeper sat erect, with her pipe in her hand.
                     Three or four stout girls filled up the place between her and the table.
                     Alascus stood leaning idly against the jambs, gossiping lightly with Phillis,
                     who, as soon as Hollister made his appearance, turned coquettishly away, in
                     order to display her charms to the new comer; and the old gardener sat in the
                     opposite corner.
                  Hollister as he seated himself, still with his wet cloak on, said that he could
                     not stay long, as he intended going up to the house.
                  "Ky!" exclaimed the housekeeper, "guess you can't git in thar—mars' Kenneth
                     drove we all off, and lock up de house when he go way."
                  "No, he didn't drive me away!" exclaimed Phillis, pertly, with an arch glance
                     toward Hollister; "come myself."
                  "What! has he left the house entirely alone?" asked Hollister.
                  "'Deed he has," said Phillis; "not a livin' soul thar 'cept Miss Amy."
                  "Miss Amy in that great house alone!" exclaimed Hollister, half rising, while a
                     strange expression crossed his features.
                  "'Deed is she," said the housekeeper, chiming in; "never saw such
                     doings all my life; 'deed now. Dars Miss Maggie, good as killed—she's off; dars
                     Missis Kenneth and de toder young lady—da're off; dar's da' lady wha's got de
                     consumpshun—she's off; dar's mars' Kenneth hissef—he's off: Lord knows when he
                     git back. Den case Missis Kenneth send for Miss Amy, an' she want to go mighty
                     bad, mars' lock she in she own room, an' lock Phillis in room' under neaf—good
                     Lord knows wha' for—Phillis she git out ob de winder—gib good jump, come smash in de mud, an'
                     run ober here screaming like wild-cat."
                  "I didn't scream—I laughed!" said Phillis, poutingly.
                  "How could you leave Miss Kenneth alone?" asked Hollister, fingering his cloak
                     nervously.
                  "Ky! Miss Amy no car for I—I no care for her," said Phillis; "'sides which, I
                     doesn't dar stay in dat house; Old Hepsy 'witched it."
                  "You say you got out of a window," said Hollister, rising; "which one? It won't
                     do to have the house exposed that way. I must go and see to it."
                  "Settin' room winder—back of de parler," replied Phillis; "specs mars' Kenneth
                     kill me ef he know I got away. Can't help it—couldn't stay in dat ar ole wicked
                     house—couldn't so."
                  Hollister had arisen, replaced the slouched hat on his head, and now he went
                     toward the door. Every fibre in his frame was tremulous with the excitement of
                     revenge. It was not long before he stood in the sitting-room of Washington
                     Grange, applied his frenzied strength to the door, bolted on the inside, and
                     burst it open. Then he gropingly ascended the stairs.
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               IN ONE PART.
               RETRIBUTION.
               
                  Slaves sometimes revenge their wrongs, as it is to be feared you and I might,
                     reader, if our liberty were taken away, our right to manhood and womanhood
                     trampled upon.
               
               
                  
                     
                        "Though I am lost,
                        Think not that guilt, that falsehood made me fall;
                        No, no, 'twas grief, 'twas madness did it all."
                     
                  
               
               AMY had been locked in her own room, as the servants said. Lawyer Kenneth
                  happening to be present when the message was sent from her mother, declared she
                  should not go—that if it was in his power, she should never see her mother again.
                  Upon her weeping and entreating to return with the messenger he had locked her in
                  her own chamber, fully intending to remain in the house. But his restless mood
                  prevented that. He drove to old Hepsy's cabin, as the reader has seen, thence to
                  Hollister's, and from there to the city, where it was probable he would remain the
                  greater part of the night, drinking to drown his care. The hours had been spent by
                  Amy in self-torture. It seemed as if, while the rain dashed drearily against the
                  windows, and the gale howled and shrieked around the corners, wailing in at every point at which it could
                  find ingress, all her life passed in review before her. Mabel's stay beneath that
                  roof, quiet as she had been, and seldom as Amy had sought her society, had
                  nevertheless impressed the haughty girl with the idea that a character brightened
                  by the beautiful rays of Christianity was more lovely than the selfish existence
                  which she had till now frittered away in foolish pride, aimless ends and
                  unsatisfying amusements. Never had she seemed to herself so useless, so arrogant,
                  so selfish, as in those two long hours of loneliness. Why was it so? she asked
                  herself. What led her to hate Lucina? Her superiority, whispered conscience. She
                  trembled for what might be in store for her. All her mother's variable moods—her
                  gradual decline, her horror at certain things, her care for the slave-girl when
                  she first came—thronged her mind, as she listened to the storm shrieking and
                  raving wilder and louder as the time went wearily by. Her father's threatened
                  delirium, and she alone! The thought was agony. "He might kill me in his raving,"
                  she whispered. "Oh! if he should come back in that awful state! What
                  could I do, alone?"
               She shuddered with mortal fear, as a thousand fancies, each more vague and
                  terrible than the other, assailed her imagination. Something seemed to say to her
                  it is well to pray at such a time; to ask the protection of that Great Being, who,
                  in all their extremities, never deserts His suffering creatures when they call
                  upon Him. The thought of prayer was as bewildering as it was new; she never
                  prayed. Morning and night had followed in succession for seventeen years, and she
                  could not remember the time when she had put up one hearty, honest prayer to God.
                  How could she pray now? But more and more surely did that strange
                  terror creep over her faculties, and she was compelled by the horror that seemed
                  to over shadow her mind to throw herself upon her knees, and bursting into tears,
                  her cry was "Oh! God!—forgive—forgive!"
               Starting at every, sound deadly pale, her locks dishevelled, tears falling from
                  her eyes and rolling unwiped down her cheeks, hands clenched together, she formed
                  a pitiable picture.
               The noise of the bursting door sent her to her feet again. That was
                  surely different from anything she had heard before. Standing so near the hall at
                  the foot of the bed, she distinctly heard steps coming up the stairs, and knew not
                  whether to be glad or terrified at the approach of her father, whom she thought it
                  was. More noise, a fumbling, as if from room to room, and unlocking other doors,
                  then the key applied to her own! She stood like a statue, her heart beating almost
                  to suffocation as the lock turned, the door opened, and Hollister, haggard,
                  suffering, wrought up to the highest degree of mental and physical excitement,
                  stood before her.
               "Hollister! HOLLISTER!" she exclaimed, shrinking back toward the
                  wall; "what does this mean? how dare you come in my chamber?" He was
                  looking the door on the inside, and securing the key.
               "I had a strange dream!" said Hollister, gazing upon her as if spell-bound; "I
                  dreamed you loved me!" His voice was
                  low, full of passion; it seemed as if his very soul were, condensed in its wild
                  pathos.
               In a moment the horror of her situation flashed over her, paralyzing every
                  faculty. Doubtless not a soul was in the house beside Hollister and herself; and
                  she feared everything from his manner.
               "You would not harm me, Hollister!" she said, her voice almost inaudible from
                  fright. "You must, you will leave me!"
               "Never!" said Hollister, repeating the word, "never, unless!"—
               Amy waited with whitening cheek for the rest of the sentence.
               "Unless you consent to accompany me, fly with me from this place, and become my
                  wife!"
               "Monstrous!" cried Amy, the vivid red returning to her cheek; "boy! slave! do you
                  know to whom you make that proposition?"
               "To one not a whit better than myself," he replied, coolly; "to one who, I am
                  certain, were I but free, had I been born free, had I been placed as near you as I
                  was, had I been possessed of wealth, you, with all your soul, would have been
                  proud to love."
               "Insolent! insolent! insulting wretch!" cried Amy, forgetting all caution; "to ask
                  me to unite myself with such a fate! You, my father's slave!" she added choking
                  with pride and passion; "how dare you?" Do you think I would stoop to
                  look at such as you?"
               "Your mother did," said Hollister; his eye gleaming with a more frightful light,
                  "LUCINA is her child, by a slave!"
               All the terrible suspicions that had floated unformed through her brain, now took
                  tangible shape, as Amy uttered one wild cry of horror and fell fainting to the
                  floor. Hollister lifted the insensible form, sprinkling water on the pallid brow,
                  then seizing a tumbler, he poured in some of the powerful liquid he had brought,
                  filled it with water, and patiently waited for the first signs of convalescence,
                  when he placed it to her lips. She tasted it, opened her eyes, and encountering
                  Hollister's triumphant smile—the glass in his hand—she dashed its contents on the
                  floor with a wild cry—"You have poisoned me! you have poisoned me!"
               He retreated from her.
               "Oh, is there no help? father! mother! come to me!—come to me, I am dying—Oh, my
                  God!—not yet—I can't die now! Oh, Hollister! how could you?" she
                  cried in her anguish, seizing his hands imploringly; "tell me it will not harm
                  me!—tell me this pain is nothing—only fright. Tell me you did not poison me, and I
                  will do whatever you say. I will be your wife! anything to live. Oh, life! life! I
                  cannot die now!"
               Hollister shook his head and pressed his white lips together.
               "We must meet somewhere as equals!"
               "It is true, then! Oh, my God! Father!" she shrieked, dashing to the window and
                  throwing it up, "where are you? Oh, my father! where are you? How could you leave
                  me? Mother! come to me; oh mother! mother!" She laid her head on the sill of the window, while the
                  drenching rain fell fast upon it.
               "Come away from there," said Hollister, lifting her up. She did not resist him;
                  the quick and subtle poison had done its work. The deadly faintness was upon
                  her—her heart was growing icy—her head rested against the bosom of the slave—her
                  breath grew shorter. One moment more—all was over! He carried her to the lounge
                  and placed her upon it; smoothed the dress and laid it in folds about her form;
                  pushed back the heavy hair from the brow, all wet with the damp of death. "Heaven
                  knows my love was pure," he said. Then he drank off the very dregs of the poison,
                  stretched himself on the carpet beside her, and with the exclamation,—"This sin be
                  on your head, Lawyer Kenneth!" he died.
               And so, in madness and despair, slavery had sent these souls before their
                  Maker!
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               IN TWO PARTS.
               
                  PART I.
                  IN WHICH THE SLAVE-HOLDER SEES A VISION.
                  
                     
                        
                           "Hist! I've seen to-night,
                           What angels know not of—so foul a sight,
                           So horrible! Oh, never mayst thou see
                           What there lies hid from all but hell and me."
                        
                     
                  
                  THE night wore away and the grey lowering morning broke in the east. The storm
                     had spent its fury and now lay languishing in long drear clouds and drenched
                     meadows ever and anon giving sob or sigh, as if recalling the pleasure of
                     vanished triumphs. Lawyer Kenneth had returned about two in the morning, so
                     drunk that his valet who had accompanied him, and Eb the driver, were obliged
                     to carry him to his room. There he lay in heavy slumber, while the dead slept
                     all unconscious under the same roof. The astral lamp still burned dimly under
                     its shade in the mournful chamber. Hollister had not shut the window, and the
                     rain had beat in upon the table where lay the poor girl's sewing, and the books
                     from which she had vainly tried to cull some amusement, wet and discolored. On
                     her face was still the sorrowful expression with which she had met death—on
                        his a strange, half mocking
                     smile. Whiter and whiter grew the light in the east, streaming in ghastlily
                     upon the dead, up-turned faces.
                  Lawyer Kenneth had fulfilled his threat—the slave-dealer had agreed to give
                     fifteen hundred down for the carpenter, whom he had several times before wished
                     to purchase, and six hundred for Ebony who thus expiated his negligence in
                     allowing Maggie to mount Spitfire.
                  The lawyer's vengeance satisfied, he would immediately have returned and
                     prosecuted the search for Lucina, but once tasting the fatal draught that was
                     luring him to perdition, he could not restrain his appetite; and as there was a
                     jovial company at the club, all willing to listen and ready to sympathize, he
                     talked and drank, till, with the majority of the party, he became insensible
                     from inebriety. Dole Baker was present, and that young gentleman was pleased to
                     throw out sly suspicions, aside, of the lawyer's complicity in the matter of
                     the abduction.
                  "Look a—how lax he has been in a—the search!" he said between his cups; "see
                     even a—now how coolly he takes it, talking about to-morrow a—and to-morrow.
                     I'll venture to wager a—that the sly old fox is keeping her for himself!—Egad!
                     I'll see about it to-morrow—Do you know he borrowed a—three thousand of me?
                     Ah!—I'll find how we stand to-morrow!" he added, shaking his empty head.
                  "To-morrow came:—and what a morrow!
                  The night of the storm had been an eventful one in the cabin of Old Hepsy.
                     While Hattie sat watching, and the old negress started up every little while,
                     and Mrs. Kenneth sat crouching in utter misery at the foot of the bed—once when
                     the wind shrieked with superhuman sound, Maggie had moved and spoken.
                  It was when the hands of the little round clock on the corner of the
                     mantel-piece were on eleven and ten minutes. She had started violently,
                     exclaiming, "There comes Amy! How sorrowful she looks!" and then had relapsed
                     into silence. Mrs. Kenneth, Maggie, and the old negress were instantly bending
                     over her, begging her to speak again, to give some sign, but there was no
                     compliance; she neither spoke nor moved.
                  "Strange!" said Mrs. Kenneth, with white lips, clasping her hands violently
                     together; "I'm afraid harm has happened to Amy—if she is dying—she
                     sees, it may be, some act of violence. Oh! Hattie—if he should be attacked
                     to-night—and—murder—her!"
                  She fell back exhausted; her strength departed as the vision passed before
                     her.
                  "No, no, don't think such dreadful things!" said Hattie, who had just been
                     lifting and chafing the hands of Maggie. "Amy is safe in her bed, no
                     doubt—there are the housekeeper, old Jimmy, Phillis, and plenty to keep her
                     company—besides, to tell you the truth, I don't think your husband will be at
                     the Grange to-night—I wouldn't worry." She pitied from her good heart the sad
                     and exhausted woman whose life had been so beclouded by her own misdeeds.
                  Six o'clock.
                  
                  Old Hepsy had risen from her bed on the floor, and was proceeding to make the
                     fire for breakfast.
                  Hattie Goldsmith turned with a "hush!" Maggie was slowly moving her
                     hands—evenly—gracefully as if to the sounds of soft music. Then suddenly her
                     eyelids flew open—she drew a long, long breath, and looked wonderingly up in
                     Hattie's face.
                  "Do you think they will let me stay?" she asked.
                  "Stay where, Maggie, dear?—you are with us, you know—your aunt is here."
                  Maggie shuddered from head to foot.
                  "I thought they were going to keep me in that strange place," she said; "I
                     wonder if Amy will stay—Amy had just come when I left."
                  "Where was it, dear?" asked Hattie, gently, and Mrs. Kenneth knelt in
                     breathless silence.
                  "I don't know," said Maggie, faintly; "it wasn't in heaven—it was a dreadful
                     place—and oh! I felt so there!—it seemed as if my heart was breaking. Why!
                     could it be a dream? No—no—not a dream!—a real sight—real
                     persons—real, real—everything so real!"
                  "You have been ill, Maggie."
                  "Have I?—I have been there, too; I'm sure I was there. Oh, Hat!
                     let's you and I free all our slaves—if you had seen what I have seen!" and she
                     shuddered again.
                  Hattie and Mrs. Kenneth looked at each other with blanched faces; the manner of
                     the sick girl was strangely impressive.
                  "They went by, two and two—slave-holders that I have known—and know now. Uncle
                     Jeffries was among them. They looked like people just dead—their eyes staring
                     and mouths open. They moved their hands with strange clutches at the air—they
                     were loaded with chains. Oh! Hattie—my own father seemed to be there! sometimes
                     it was him and sometimes Uncle Jeff. There was a dark red, intense light that
                     came full in their faces from below: and as they marched, their chains clanked,
                     and a voice sounded so near me! "They held souls for whom Christ died in
                     darkness and in chains; they bought and sold the heritage of Christ.' And I
                     thought I saw, as in a long panorama, the stripings and the scourgings, the
                     cruel deaths and the tortures and indignities to which the slaves had been
                     subjected, for ages; and this panorama will move eternally; and these men march
                     eternally, forever witnessing the cruelties they have helped perpetuate! Oh!
                     you can't think, indeed you never could imagine, how awful it was, if you had
                     not seen it!"
                  "But, my dear—it was only a horrid dream—forget it!" said Hattie, her poetic
                     imagination much impressed with the recital and Maggie's earnest gestures.
                  "No!" said Maggie, solemnly, "it was no dream!" then she added,
                     with remarkable emphasis: "I was there! If my body was here—my
                     soul was there! And just before I came away, Amy was brought in,
                     and I cried out—' Oh! there comes Amy! How sorrowful she looks!" I remember it
                     gave me such a feeling of relief to see her."
                  Again Hattie and Mrs. Kenneth exchanged frightened glances.
                  
                  "De Lord tells us how we shall see visions," said old Hepsy, standing behind
                     Hattie's chair. "I hasn't no doubt, mysef—but I's 'fraid o' dem tings now—case
                     I feels more charity in my old heart. But 'deed, chile', de Lord He mighty
                     just! Don't let one o' old Hepsy's grey hars fall 'thout seeing it—tink He
                     going to hear tousand prayers every day from pore ole slaves, an' not punish
                     dem wha' treat em' worse dan dogs? Deed no, chill'n—specs you don't like to
                     hear dis yer kind o' talk from old nigger, over a hundered—but I tells you de
                     Lord God ob hebben—He mighty just!" saying which, she went back to her kettle
                     over the fire.
                  "Oh! if somebody would come from the house!" exclaimed Mrs. Kenneth, anxiously.
                     "My brain is almost wild with apprehension."
                  "I am very weak, Hattie," Maggie said, opening her eyes drowsily.
                  "Yes, dear, you must keep quiet till we can remove you to the Grange," Hattie
                     replied.
                  "Where am I?" asked Maggie.
                  "In old Hepsy's cabin—and Mrs. Kenneth is here with us."
                  "You are very kind," Maggie responded. "Where is Amy?"
                  "Safe at home," said Hattie.
                  "God grant it!" exclaimed Mrs. Kenneth, fervently.
                  One of the slaves came, according to previous orders, with a carriage, to take
                     Hattie to the Grange.
                  "Hepsy, will you attend to Miss Maggie? I must go up to the Grange—but I will
                     return immediately," said Mrs. Kenneth.
                  Hepsy promised to sit by the young lady—and Mrs. Kenneth to be back in time for
                     the doctor's visit.
                  So they were both driven to Washington Grange, one, all fear and trembling,
                     shivering in every joint, though the morning was not cold, and saying
                     repeatedly that she couldn't think what oppressed her so strangely—or how much
                     she dreaded to meet her husband. She had, however, previously ascertained that
                     he had not probable arisen yet, but that did not make the presentiment of evil
                     less strong.
                  There were signs of life about the house, but none of death. Slaves were going
                     to and fro between parlor and kitchen, bearing dishes for the breakfast. The
                     old housekeeper was busy—the little negroes were laughing and sporting—the sun
                     came out brilliantly—the whole place wore an air of animation and bustle that
                     was pleasant to behold. Mrs. Kenneth encountered Phillis in the hall. The girl
                     was standing with an abstracted air at the foot of the stairs, her hand on one
                     of the carved banisters. She looked up in a startled way as Mrs. Kenneth came
                     forward, and asked if her master was at home.
                  "Yes, missis, mars' Kenneth fast asleep. Guess Miss Amy's faster; can't make
                     her hear no ways. Laws! missis, da' Hollister ought to be punish—leave de
                     settin'-room winder wide open; rain in on de cloth and de corpet; "pletely
                     spile ebery ting."
                  "What do you mean, Phillis?" Mrs. Kenneth had sprung past, and, with Hattie, was striking at
                     the door and calling "Amy!"
                  "God of mercy! she can't be in here. It's time she was up. What do you see,
                     Hattie?"
                  Hattie was trying to look through the key-hole.
                  "Nothing; the key is on the inside."
                  "On the inside? Have you looked all over the house, Phillis?" she asked, in
                     low, concentrated tones.
                  "'Deed I has, missis; 'deed did I see mars' Kenneth lock she in she room, an'
                     now how dat ar key got inside?"
                  "My heart fails me," whispered Mrs. Kenneth. "This door must be opened. Go for
                     Hollister immediately, Phillis."
                  "'Deed, missis, Hollister ain't to ways to be found. Went myself to he shop dis
                     yer morning for Aunt Esty, 'case she wanted somethin' done; den Lascus go, and
                     'clar he search everywhar. Hollister no been dar all night, 'case he bed all
                     smooth—ky!"
                  The girl had started back in terror. Lawyer Kenneth stood before them, his
                     dressing-gown hanging loosely about him, his eyes ominously blood-shot.
                  "What are you here for, woman?" he cried, scowling upon his wife.
                  "Everard, open that door; Amy is sick—or—dead!"
                  Her look—her words overawed him. He applied his foot and burst a panel
                     through—then his shoulder, and away went the door. The noise disturbed not the
                     sleepers. Oh! that sight of horror! Reason fled from the brain of the
                     distracted mother. Lawyer Kenneth turned livid, and dropped like a stone to the
                     floor.
               
               
                  PART II.
                  SPITFIRE AND HIS DYING MASTER.
                  Old Hepsy moved slowly about the rooms of Washington Grange. Her hands had
                     shrouded the form that lay in still white state in the great parlors. And ever
                     and anon she muttered, shaking her old grey head, "De judgment ob de Lord is
                     tarrible!—tarrible!"
                  Mrs. Kenneth had happily forgotten all her troubles in a state of harmless
                     lunacy, in which she did nothing but sit quietly, with her eyes on the floor,
                     and her hands folded.
                  Lawyer Kenneth had been watched for twenty-four hours by strong men. His
                     ravings were frightful. Mania-a-potu; in its worst form, had assailed him, and
                     now the more violent moods had been quieted he lay in a stupor, from which he
                     was never to recover.
                  Hollister was watched over by Keene, who had also laid him out, and for the
                     first time he saw the lacerated back of his poor half-brother. There he knelt
                     down, by the very coffin of which Hollister had said the thought crossed him
                     that he might be making it for himself, and vowed a vow to the Almighty that he
                     would never rest till he had done
                     what he could for the abolition of this accursed AMERICAN SLAVERY.
                  Maggie Willis was recovering, but her character was thoroughly changed. Her
                     father had come, bringing with him an only brother, Charlie, much younger than
                     herself. The first words she said, as she greeted both, were, "Father, I can no
                     longer be a slaveholder!"
                  The night on which Lawyer Kenneth died, he called repeatedly for Spitfire.
                     Strange to say the creature neighed and snorted in his stall, burst his tether
                     at last, dashed out of the stable, and, to the terror of all who saw him, flew
                     round the house, stopping at almost every window, neighing and standing,
                     pausing at the doors with terrible cries, dashing back and forth on the piazza,
                     and acting like a beast under the influence of frenzy. No one, of course, dared
                     approach him. Old Hepsy cried, as she watched him from the chamber, "'Clar, ef
                     I don't tink he's de wicked one hisself, now; mars' Kenneth gone to die now,
                     sure. Lord help he. Ky! see da' critter! Bar's mars' Marshall, an' toder mars',
                     an' Miss Belle, all coming to see Miss Amy, pore chile, an' dey dassn't git
                     out. Oh! good Lor'! look at dat critter; he eyes like coals ob fire—look at he!
                     'Clar to heaven ef he haven't broke dat ar winder clear troo! Good Lor'! keep
                     us from de debil an' all his works!"
                  A sound of crashing glass told that Spitfire, in his rearing, had sent either
                     head or hoofs through the window. Various were the attempts made at a distance
                     to lure him into his stable, but he would not heed them. It seemed as if some
                     mysterious connection had been established between owner and horse, and that
                     the brute comprehended in some way that he was to lose his master. Kenneth's
                     cries for Spitfire were so imperative and agonizing, that for some moments it
                     was debated whether it would be possible for the beast to find his way to the
                     chamber of the dying man. But the proposition seemed so monstrous that it was
                     overruled.
                  Mabel, at the house of General Randolph, was in so critical a state, just
                     hovering between life and death, that they dared not communicate to her either
                     the dread doom of Amy or the frightful situation of her brother. Lucina had no
                     longer any cause for fear. Her sweet face lighted up the chamber of disease;
                     her prayers, her gentle voice, reading aloud from favorite authors, helped to
                     dispel the gloom of approaching dissolution. Mabel, in all her sickness, had
                     never looked so beautiful as she did now that she was nearing the confines of
                     eternity.
                  "I cannot call it dying," she said, "it is only passing away to enter that
                     glorious and holy habitation where no sight of sin or sorrow shall grieve God's
                     chosen ones. If I may use my influence there, I will be among the band of the
                     purified, praying for the redemption of the slave. Come, Lord Jesus, come
                     quickly. Lucina, my child, my daughter, stay by me till I go."
                  Lucina was about to promise, when Harry came in, his face lighted up with
                     unwonted animation.
                  "God news, dear mother, good news—our old home is still our own. They have
                     apprehended Jacobs, and found upon him the eighty thousand dollars of which he
                     robbed me."
                  
                  Mabel expressed her great joy, and added quickly, "Now I can have the boon I
                     have desired so fervently.
                  "And what is that, mother? You shall have anything it is in my power to
                     procure," said Harry, kissing the white forehead.
                  "To die in peace," replied Mabel.
                  "Mother!" exclaimed Harry."
                  "And in order to die in peace I must go home immediately, my dear Harry."
                  Harry started back. "Oh, mother!" he cried, "in this feeble state—certainly
                     not. Wait a little; you will be better now that you are freer from excitement.
                     Wait only a little while."
                  "My son, I beg thee won't flatter thyself with the hope of my being better,"
                     Mabel said, feebly. "I am dying—yes, even now; but I cannot draw my last breath
                     in the atmosphere of slavery. I cannot, Harry—I must die in the land of
                     freedom. I shall live to return, I am certain; and there in the room where
                        he died, in the home that he hallowed, I shall die
                     in peace. This is my last request, dear Harry! Will thee take me home?"
                  He gazed at the frail ethereal form, the shadowy brow, the luminous eye, the
                     thin cheek blazing with the hectic red, the hands white and transparent—the
                     whole being speaking so plainly of the approach of that dread presence we call
                     death—and his very soul shrank from the idea of subjecting her to the transit
                     of carriage and car—the changes of weather, and the rude stare of the stranger.
                     But that eloquent, imploring gaze spoke to the love he cherished for her, the
                     homage he had always paid to her slightest command, and he said, "Yes,
                     mother—you shall go; your heart is set upon it. I will make immediate
                     preparations." A carriage was soon in readiness, with a bed, and Lucina
                     accompanied her. Keene remained behind to superintend the funerals of the
                     unfortunate slave and his mother, while Marshall attended to the obsequies of
                     Lawyer Kenneth and his daughter.
                  It was a singular and solemn event. Mabel, unfortunately, through some
                     unnecessary delay, encountered the funeral train. Whose could it be? Lucina
                     knew but dared not tell,—and Mabel said, impressively, "I am bidding farewell
                     to my poor brother"—and she never mentioned his name again.
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXV.
               IN TWO PARTS.
               
                  PART I.
                  IN WHICH THE WRITER BIDS FAREWELL TO THE READER.
                  
                     
                        
                           "Last scene of all
                           That ends this strange, eventful history."
                        
                     
                  
                  NINETEEN years previous to the commencement of this story, the daughter of a
                     grey-haired planter returned to her, Southern home. She had been sojourning at
                     a school in the North to which her father had sent her for five years, on the
                     death of her mother. At school she had been somewhat noted for recklessness and
                     imprudence.—She was what is generally called a wild girl, and had been kept
                     under the most guarded and careful restraint in consequence.
                  As she stepped from the cars a young man of extremely prepossessing appearance
                     met her respectfully, and informed her that her father's carriage was in
                     readiness. Bewildered for a moment, she cried out, upon recognizing him, "Why,
                     Fred, is this you? You've grown so handsome I didn't know you!"
                  The young man blushed, as he called to recollection their former intimacy. Miss
                     Hollister had taught him to read and write while at her own childish studies.
                     She had encouraged his precocious talents by helping him with her own books,
                     and the facilities with which she was liberally endowed as the only daughter of
                     a wealthy planter. He remembered her kindnesses gratefully, and could not but
                     feel flattered with the abrupt and hearty compliment which she had just given
                     him. She also admired his finely formed figure, his handsome features, and
                     intellectual face and mien, and in school-girl fashion, without reflecting upon
                     the consequences, that might result by her encouragement of look and
                     word—forgetting also the great distance in their comparative stations—entirely
                     ignorant, besides, of his near relationship, fell in love with him, as the
                     romantic phrase goes, and allowed herself to think too much of the elegant
                     slave.
                  Old Colonel Hollister, her father, was widely and openly known as a man of
                     immoral character and dissolute habits. He owned more slaves than any other
                     holder in the country—possessed many who were very beautiful—and, report said,
                     kept a secret harm, and gained his enormous wealth by the sale of his own
                     children for the most revolting purposes.
                  Holy writ, among many remarkable passages, contains none more startling than
                     the following: "The sins of the father shall be visited upon the
                     children." Reason as we may upon this declaration, we cannot fail to see that
                     it is proved daily and hourly—whether directly, as a judgment from heaven, or
                     as a certain result, consequent upon the passions and temperament of one person
                     being transmitted to another.
                  
                  Mrs. Hollister, the wife of this bad man, was one of those gentle spirits
                     ordained to bear sorrow, and to grow purer with every stroke of affliction. Her
                     heart was broken long before she died with that peculiar suffering which many a
                     proud Southern woman bears with imperious resolution and an iron will—not
                     disposed even to acknowledge that she is outraged, betrayed and insulted
                     without the power to redress her wrongs. His child by marriage was, it may be,
                     constitutionally injured; but, be that as it may, there was a terrible fall in
                     the house of the proud and fierce old Colonel—a shame that eventually caused
                     his death. To be sure, the affair was hushed up. The offending slave was bought
                     off with a large reward, and his liberty given him to keep silence for ever,
                     and sent away. The unoffending, helpless babe was carried to the North and
                     consigned to a relative, who, instantly feeling compassion and love for the
                     little stranger, resolved to adopt it for her own. No one save old Hepsy was
                     ever known to be cognizant of the fact. It was given out that the daughter was
                     travelling; suspicion had never been excited, and everyone went on as before,
                     except the old Colonel. His spirit was bowed to the earth with the disgrace;
                     perhaps, as in a mirror, he saw his own iniquity, and felt weighed down with
                     the enormity of his sins. Be that as it may, he died a hapless death just as
                     his daughter was on the eve of marriage to a young Northern gentleman, whom she
                     had captivated in a visit to Philadelphia—the distinguished lawyer, Everard
                     Kenneth, son of a Friend, but a recreant from the forms and principles of the
                     society. For three years their union was one of unal loyed happiness; then,
                     strangely enough, floating rumors reached the husband's ear which he endeavored
                     to resist, but which, unfortunately, a spirit naturally very sensitive, high
                     strung, just and jealous, would not allow him to cast aside. Suspicion aroused
                     set him on the watch, and he saw, or imagined he saw, enough to confirm the
                     vague reports that had strung him. Unable to satisfy himself—too proud to
                     accuse and too jealous to confide any longer—his character gradually changed.
                     Unhappy at home he began to seek pleasure abroad, and found it in boon
                     companions and wine—found at least a sufficiency for the present moment, and by
                     degrees became a hopeless convivialist.
                  Mrs. Kenneth meantime made occasional journeys to the North, from which she
                     returned so changed in manner that he could not fail to notice the difference.
                     Little by little, probably self-accused and self-tortured, she withdrew herself
                     from his society, and found her only solace in the company of her child,
                     devoting herself to her education. A few years Fred Keene remained at a
                     distance; then he presented himself as an agent for old General Randolph, and
                     then commenced the most acute torments of the planter's wife. Always fearful,
                     always desponding; doomed often to see the father of her absent child, her
                     whole life was a series of troubles, agitations and aggravations. She was
                     constantly cautioning her little daughter Amy against using any freedom with
                     the boy Hollister, but Amy was one of those children who love, and will do
                     whatever is forbidden, and her mother's moral force was too weak to guide
                     her.
                  In never occurred to Mrs. Kenneth, in the midst of all her sorrow, that her husband
                     suspected her virtue, or even dreamed of her deception. She considered his
                     alienation an especial punishment from heaven, as indeed she had cause to do,
                     but trusted to carry her secret with her to the grave. His manner when he so
                     unexpectedly saw Lucina alarmed her for the first time, and made her powerless.
                     From that moment she fell; she knew that in his eyes her doom was sealed. When
                     she told him for what reason she had purchased the girl, to redeem her from a
                     life of prostitution, she knew by the gleam in his eye, by the slowly uttered
                     words, by every movement of his frame, that at that moment his revenge was
                     determined on—that there was henceforth no peace for her but in the grave, and
                     that Lucina was to be his instrument of torture.
                  We have followed her to the melancholy end—never to know again the love of
                     friend or child; she sits in a dumb and hopeless maniacy, her only attendant
                     old Hepsy, who has lived to see the ruin of the house she hated, because of the
                     wrongs inflicted on herself by the sale of her own children into hopeless
                     bondage.
               
               
                  PART II.
                  OLD HEPSY'S LAST DEED.
                  Maggie Willis returned home with her cousin, her father and brother, as soon as
                     her recovery was established. Hattie had promised herself to Marshall when he
                     should have
                        OLD HEPSY.
                     
                      become successful in his new business.
                     That was his stipulation. Her guardian put it out of her power to form any rash
                     plan with regard to liberating the slaves she owned, and altered his will,
                     deeding all his people to a young Southerner, whom he was desirous she should
                     marry. But daughters sometimes execute wills of their own, though in a
                     different way, and Hattie was royally above the possession of mere vulgar
                     wealth, and looked forward to her liberation from the South with quiet,
                     philosophical resignation. Maggie Willis, on the contrary, battled for her
                     rights, succeeded in giving twelve slaves their freedom, and liberated so many
                     by aiding and abetting in their escape, that her father had serious thoughts of
                     a straight jacket, and laid her lunacy to Spitfire. Nor, so willful was the
                     spirited little thing, that he did not much grieve, when, after a long
                     negotiation by way of letters, Harry Van Broek carried her North to become the
                     mistress of his splendid house and keep fresh the memory of Mabel, who
                     slumbered in the church-yard.
                  Marshall Randolph became a Northern merchant, and is known as a worthy and
                     enterprising citizen of Philadelphia. His mother and two sisters, who followed
                     his way of thinking, came to reside with him on the death of the old
                     General.
                  Washington Grange was sold, and the present owner purchased many of the
                     house-slaves, among them Aunt Esty, the housekeeper and gardener, who still
                     lives surrounded by the sunny exotics, his children, and still flourishes the
                     great shears. Phillis and Alascus are wedded, and show a bright yellow baby
                     with great glee.
                  The Hatch woods contain the bodies of Hollister and his mother. Keene has caused a simple stone to be
                     erected, and a railing placed around; and still they say the place is
                     haunted.
                  
                  In a comfortable and pleasant home, farther North than Pennsylvania, a father
                     and his daughter live quietly together. They seem to be happy and contented in
                     the society of each other. The father has under his control an ably conducted
                     journal. His office is in the house; and while he sits and writes, Lucina
                     either clips from the numerous papers that carpet the sanctum, or sews by his
                     side. At morning, at noon and at evening, father and child are together. He
                     rarely goes out unless she accompanies him. They receive but few visitors; they
                     are happy, save that one shadow rests on both lives. Every moment the hands,
                     heart and soul of Fred Keene are at work for the cause of liberty. Many read
                     his effusions with burning cheeks and beating hearts, who feel that they, too,
                     are united in this glorious cause. "Down with Despotism!" is the watch-word of
                     his paper, as it shall yet be the watch-word of the world.
                  Old Hepsy, to whom the friends of Mrs. Kenneth intrusted the poor wreck, for
                     the sake of the past, furnishing the cabin with ample accommodations, had
                     watched the child of her master for a year with unfailing attention, but her
                     own frame was wearing out, her faculties were growing fainter and weaker.
                  One day the new family of the Grange were sitting, mother and daughters, in the
                     room back of the parlors, when looking forth, they espied a strange object
                     coming toward the house, and cried out in alarm.
                  It was OLD HEPSY, bearing the form of her mistress, attenuated to childish
                     proportions. She came staggering into the sitting-room, and laid her burden at
                     their feet.
                  "I's done my duty," she panted, sinking down upon a seat. "I's watched her,
                     days and nights, till old frame cant stan' it no longer. I's givin' out—feel
                     dredful strange dis yer mornin', and 'pears to me I's going to die. So I takes
                     my missus—case ef I died maybe folks wouldn't know it—an' brings her to her old
                     home, an' asks you for de love of de Blessed Lord Jesus give her some room for
                     her pore head in dis yer house, whar she were born. Twon't be for long, honeys;
                     den when you—hears—de—judgment cry—her voice grew low, and her words came
                     slowly—you'll say—Lord's—I's—taken car' one ob—yer—pore lambs—an' de Lord 'll
                     say—well—done"—
                  The sentence was never finished. The heroic old woman laid her weary head
                     back—and breathed her last, while Mrs. Kenneth sat crouched up at her feet
                     gazing on cancy.
                  She did not need their care but a few days. Then they laid her by her husband
                     and her child.
               
            
            THE END.
         
      
      
         
         

            THE IMPENDING CRISIS OF THE SOUTH: HOW TO MEET IT.
            BY H. R. HELPER, OF NORTH CAROLINA.
            A handsome 12mo. volume of 420 pages. Price $1.00.
            
               From Hon. William. H. Seward. "I have read 'The Impending Crisis of the
               South' with deep attention. It seems to me a work of great merit, rich, yet accurate,
               in statistical information, and logical in analysis."
            
               From Rev. Theodore Parker. "It is an admirable work. No man has
               hitherto made so complete a collection of the facts, and none put them in such
               'magnificently stern array.'"
            
               From Hon. Cassius M. Clay. "It is just such a work as is needed in the
               present array of political antagonisms. The statistics are compact, lucid, and
               logically presented. The tone of the author is manly, outspoken, and patriotic. I
               regard it as the best compend of all the arguments against this our country's
               greatest woe, Slavery, yet published. No intelligent citizen should fail
               to place it in his library. The bookcraft of the work is of very fine style, and
               creditable to the publishers.
            
               From Hon. Joshua R. Giddings, of Ohio. "It is a manual for the times,
               calculated to meet the popular demand for information upon the great question of the
               age."
            
               Extracts from a review of 8 columns in the New York Tribune.
               "Fortunate, indeed, are the non-slaveholding whites, that they have found such a
               spokesman; one who utters no stammering, hesitating, nor uncertain sound, who
               possesses a perfect mastery of his mother tongue, who speaks as well from a long
               study and full knowledge of his subject as from profound convictions, and in whose
               vocabulary the words fear and doubt seem to have no place."
            
               Extracts from the New York Evening Post. "The author has collected, in
               a volume of some four hundred pages, the most compact and irresistible array of facts
               and arguments, to prove the impolicy of Slavery, that we have encountered.
            
               From the Jeffersonian (Ohio) Democrat. "It is the greatest Anti-Slavery
               work ever issued from the American press."
            Ten large editions of this masterly work have been sold.
