                  Near the fire-place, where naught but a little ashes and well-charred bark
                     remained, half-reclining in a large wooden chair, lay the beggar-boy. His cap
                     had fallen on the ground, and his dark curling hair fell clustering over his
                     extended arm, as his head rested on it. He had seemingly fallen asleep the
                     night before, for his thin summer clothes were on, and his basket, yet filled
                     with the fragments of broken feasts, remained untouched at his feet. I put my
                     hand upon his beautiful head: it was icy cold! PAGE 204

            PREFACE.
            AT the close of the sixth volume of a journal as original, and with an object as
               extraordinary, as the Scalpel, "a successful attempt," as one of our cotemporaries
               has expressed it, "to popularise medicine by the attractions of tragedy, comedy, and
               the strategy of literature," when the entire charge of filling its pages and
               sustaining its large pecuniary outlay had rested for six years upon one man, immersed
               in the cares of an arduous surgical practice, and when its unfortunate title rendered
               it well nigh hopeless, even, in the face of more than sixteen thousand notices of the
               press, to disabuse the public of its medical repulsiveness, and to convince them of
               its adaptedness to instruct the intellect and improve the heart—the public may judge
               of the gratification of the Editor, at the request of Messrs. De Witt &
               Davenport, that he would permit the selection of a volume for popular instruction and
               amusement from its pages. He at once acceded to the handsome terms offered by those gentlemen, and hopes that their
               anticipations will be realized. The didactic matter he is sure will be found
               unobjectional, however largely the kindness of the reader may be taxed by the manner
               in which it is conveyed.
            To Dr. Dewees, of this city, for his beautiful Scenes in Northern and Southern
                  Practice, to Dr. Richmond, of Jefferson, Ohio, for his Scenes in
                  Western Practice, the editor expresses his deep obligations. For the
               Scenes in City Practice and all the other articles, he alone is responsible. In
               explanation of their defects, he can only say, they were often written at the
               midnight hour, after the toils of daily practice: or at the bedside, whilst watching
               with the objects which suggested them.
            It may interest the reader to know that the facts of every scene are actually true;
               the words often differing very little from those used by the patient on the occasion
               of the scene related; it has been generously conceded that, by virtue of his
               profession, the surgeon is destitute of human sympathy; so far as its more familiar
               manifestations are concerned, it ought to be so; for tremulous hands and tear-blinded
               eyes are but illy calculated for surgical duties; but I think it will be found that
               surgeons enjoy no immunity from the ordinary emotions of the body and heart. It may
               be thought that some of the scenes are too trivial and ephemeral to occupy the
               serious attention of the reader; and yet they are the everyday language of human
               life; in the physical as in the moral world, nothing is lost; the spark arises and
               scintillates for a moment, by the lightness of the elements that produced it, and
               then falls, a little ashes, into the mass of its predecessors—the bubble seeks the
               surface of the stream in obedience to the same law, reflects for an instant the
               sunlight, and its elements are added to the great store-house of nature—even the
               tear, as its sources in the overcharged heart are unlocked, and it falls to the
               earth, is not lost, but its salts are treasured there till given back, perhaps, in
               some form of beauty and gladness. Let me then hope that whatever truths, useful to
               humanity, may be found in these pages, will not perish, but live for a little while
               after the hand that sketched them has been resolved into its elements.

               OF all men, the physician is most likely to discover the leading traits of
                  character in his fellow-beings; in no other condition than that of sickness, do
                  they present themselves without those guards upon the countenance and tongue, that
                  an artificial mode of life has rendered indispensable to their comfort, if not
                  their existence, in city life more especially. So universal is this habit of
                  caution and hypocrisy in order to find out and flatter, or at least not to offend
                  the weaknesses of our fellows, that the cunning physician often cultivates it with
                  wonderful success in procuring wealth, and exciting the almost superstitious
                  reverence of his patients for fancied skill. With ordinary powers of observation,
                  and knowledge of the customary symptoms and consequences of the existing disease,
                  and the use of inert medicines and seasonable anticipation and announcement of
                  results he can often foretell with certainty, he soon gets up an envied reputation
                  and secures the luxuries of life: but he never gets the love or the confidence of his patients. The
                  secret recesses of the heart are never opened to his view: nor is it desirable, so
                  far as regards his own comfort, that they should be. The confiding patient often
                  hangs, as it were, on the conscientious physician with oppressive weight; if
                  afflicted with a sympathizing soul and a light pocket, adieu to his happiness; his
                  heart will bleed for distresses, both bodily and pecuniary, that he cannot
                  alleviate, and he often gives up in despair a profession which, on this very
                  account, will so severely tax the nervous system as to render the best medical
                  talent comparatively useless. The young physician must fortunately begin practice
                  with the children of poverty. Wealth and arrogance would season him to human woe:
                  but hopeless poverty and helpless disease, when borne with a woman's patience,
                  often break the heart long before the poor body finds the repose of the grave! To
                  witness this is the young physician's sad lot; what wonder then that his habits
                  often become gloomy and morose, when he is forced into the festive scene? Instead
                  of music and wine lie is far more familiar with the cry of anguish and the
                  wretched substitutes for food, hastily prepared by hands but ill-spared from the
                  needle; the wan face of a dying mother or child is a sad contrast to the smile of
                  love and beauty; and if his heart be that of a true man, he feels guilty when
                  compelled to mingle with the giddy throng, and utter the vapid and foolish remarks
                  that so badly harmonize with his feelings.
               In the earlier part of our professional life, we were so situated as to afford us
                  ample opportunity of studying human character, and soon learned the full extent of
                  our misfortune in possessing a frank and unsuspicious nature. A levity, too often
                  careless of the patient's feelings, elicited a degree of freedom that would never
                  have been used before a more austere character; an utter contempt for the pedantry
                  of our profession, which, with the weak-minded, often deprived us of the respect
                  necessary in the treatment of a tedious case, would nevertheless open the heart
                  and mouth of the patient; and on more than one occasion, the gravity of a medical
                  consultation was often utterly destroyed by a hearty peal of laughter, that did
                  the patient more good than all the physic he had swallowed for weeks.
               In recalling from memory the scenes of our experience in drumming up practice, and
                  by and by some of our student's life, we wish it distinctly understood, that they
                  are literally true; in fact, often scarcely differing from the actual words that
                  were used, or may have been supposed to be used by the patient; and never, we
                  trust, whether for joy or sorrow, detailing an emotion to which some chord in
                  unison with what is read, will not answer within the bosom of the reader. "Laugh
                  and be merry," says the philosopher; "it purgeth away the black bile from the
                  secret chambers of the liver, it quickeneth the secretions, and lighteth up the
                  human countenance; it is, moreover, the most distinctive difference between man
                  and a monkey." "Sorrow chasteneth the spirit and strengthens the bonds of human
                  sympathy; the crystal drop, as it falleth from the windows of the soul, gives
                  evidence of the purity of the inner chamber, and leaves a far more lasting
                  impression of the goodness of the human heart, than all the prayers of the
                  righteous." 
                     
                        He gave to misery all he had—a tear.
                        He gained from Heaven—'twas all he wished—a friend."
                     
                  
               
               Grey understood it. In our own sex, we have often thought tears a better evidence
                  of manhood, than all the sternness and compression of the muscles that could ever
                  be thrown into the countenance; and if laughter be the most distinctive active
                  characteristic between man and the monkey, its converse, the agony of grief, is
                  not less so, for it shows a far higher moral emotion, and one equally generic: it gives us, as we think, a reliable
                  cudgel for Lord Monboddo and his foolish proselytes.
               Why is it that the soul refuses its profound sympathy with the uneducated and
                  vulgar? Often have I felt guilty of seeming neglect of a common mother's grief for
                  her dead child, when I was only wondering whether she felt as some other one
                  would, under similar circumstances, or as I could have felt for her had she wept
                  less; and yet there are scenes to which the grief of even the most refined and
                  sincere for a child's death, are to myself as nothing: that gentle and trustful
                  creature, who but yesterday laid the little being who but a short week before
                  nestled closely to her bosom, and gladdened the young mother's heart with its
                  sweet smile—in all the agony of her grief—when the last fond kiss was imprinted on
                  its cold and waxen lips—never presented half so sad a picture to myself as the
                  silent tearless look of anguish, when her eye first met my gaze on the discovery
                  of her husband's dreadful failing of drunkenness. 'Twas my first and painful
                  scene; twenty-five years have closed the grave over the sweet suffering child of
                  sorrow, and him who swore to love and cherish her; and now 'tis no matter how her
                  heart was wrung. We will relate it just as it occurred; it may benefit some erring
                  creature, and save another heart from breaking.
               Mr.—and his young wife took up their abode in apartments near my first residence.
                  I owed my acquaintance to an introduction at a course of lectures, in which I was
                  associated for the benefit of one of our dispensaries. Anatomy and physiology of
                  the viscera were my subjects, and I observed from his excessive paleness, that he
                  was afflicted with some internal congestion, or that his circulation at any rate
                  was not of a high order. A great degree of curiosity on the subject of enlargement
                  of the liver from the excessive use of brandy, with a desire to know the earliest
                  indications rendering abstinence indispensable to preserve life, gave me a hint of
                  the reason of his listlessness, and the cause of his inattention to business. He
                  was a lawyer, and had a few years before been actively occupied in the lower
                  courts. Going home one night at a late hour from one of my midnight visits, I
                  observed him staggering before me in such a manner that I feared my aid would be
                  necessary. He was excessively proud and tenacious of his character, and I
                  therefore avoided his observation, walking slowly behind him until a violent fall
                  compelled me to interfere, and raise him; being obliged, indeed, almost to carry
                  him to his house, a small and barely-decent residence, to which his habits had
                  reduced him, and the rent for which, as I subsequently learned, his delicate wife
                  paid by painting maps and prints for the booksellers. My first impulse was to
                  leave him as soon as I should hear the approach of the servant in answer to my
                  summons. I did not anticipate the possibility of the absence of the single servant
                  I knew they had some time kept; but their poverty bad obliged them to discharge
                  her, and the bell was almost instantly answered by the gentle being who knew, poor
                  child, the nature of the summons. She was in her day-dress, and had not removed
                  it, as she told me, for several nights; having been obliged to watch the return of
                  him who should have been her hope and her ark of refuge, and whose strong arm
                  should have interposed between her and all harm. Alas! drunkenness had dimmed the
                  lustre of that eye that once looked so kindly on her, and withered the arm that
                  should have protected her, and naught remained for both but the quiet grave. We
                  none of us imagined how near it was. Never shall I forget the look of heart-broken
                  anguish with which her gaze met mine, as the flame of the hall light fell upon us
                  Those tears are imprinted on my very soul; nor do I think any man, with a spark of
                  humanity in him, would not have answered them in kind. I carried him to his
                  chamber, and after examining and dressing the wound on his forehead received
                     from his fall, and knowing that my
                  absence would be most acceptable to the true wife, I took my departure, begging
                  her instantly to send for me in the event of any trouble or new misfortune. I did
                  not repeat my visit, well knowing what her sufferings must have been, and that she
                  wished to bear them unnoticed and alone.
               "Twas some days before I again saw them; and I fondly hoped, from a short
                  appearance of renewed attention to business, and seeing his wife occasionally
                  walking arm-in-arm with him, plainly but respectably clad, that he had turned over
                  a new leaf in the blackened and defaced volume of his life. But, alas! he soon
                  relapsed into a lower state than ever; and often staggered by my office,
                  occasionally looking in, and uttering some maudlin nonsense. I was powerless; he
                  was like many others addicted to the loathsome vice, and had not mind enough to
                  appeal to. He resented the least hint for reform; and once gave me to understand I
                  would do well to concentrate all my mental powers on my own business, assuring me
                  (and God knows I felt the truth of the remark) I would find no superfluous
                  ability. The poor fellow never forgave me for carrying him up stairs, though his
                  suffering wife' avoided mentioning my name to him unless in a medical light.
               A few months after the incident which brought me into this family, the cholera of
                  '32 came on. It was soon apparent that the disease confined its most fatal ravages
                  to the wretched and debilitated. None will forget the sickening and heart-rending
                  scenes of that awful visitation. The Angel of Death did, indeed, spread his wing
                  on the blast; but he did not always fan away the demon of pain from the couch of
                  poverty, as I have often remarked. True, the flight of the spirit was often
                  fearfully speedy and painless in the wretched and intemperate, but the strong man
                  struggled fearfully against the terrible and unknown enemy, and the nerves of the
                  dying frame were racked, and let loose the strong muscles, till they played
                  terrible antics before the powerless physician. One often thought of the Laocoöon,
                  but looked in vain for the serpent.
               One evening, at five o'clock, or thereabouts, I had thrown myself exhausted from
                  my horse into my office chair, after a visit to my little deaf mutes at the
                  Asylum, and was indulging in my favorite luxury, a cup of green tea, which I
                  preferred taking away from my family, for the simple reason, that no man whose
                  heart was in his profession, could take time to make himself an acceptable guest
                  at the tea-table, with such fearful music still ringing in his ears; few of us,
                  indeed, paid needful attention to our own personal comfort. Whatever be our
                  quarrels, to our credit be it said, we shrink not when the "seals that close the
                  pestilence" are removed, and the poor demand our aid. I was hastily sipping my
                  tea, when my poor young friend, with his feeble body and sickly laugh, thrust his
                  head into the office door, and carelessly asked how the cholera came on;
                  remarking, with the usual flippancy of the thoughtless, he supposed that we were
                  "not particularly desirous of its disappearance." Poor man! his remark grated upon
                  my ears, for I knew the condition of his delicate wife, and that their chances
                  would be at zero from the first, should they be attacked. Something about his
                  face, that every experienced medical eye could at once detect, told me that the
                  fiend was at work within him. I arose, and asking him to be seated, and take some
                  tea, questioned him a little, and intended to advise a remedy. He soon detected my
                  fears, and jeeringly desired me not to be "looking so sharply for business." Alas!
                  such business was not desirable; our fees were mostly paid in tears. I made my
                  evening visits, and on my return found a message from his wife, requesting my
                  immediate presence, as her husband "had been attacked an hour before." Not one
                  hour could have elapsed since his conversation with me! Why prolong the tale?
                  Everything was clone that three of us could suggest; one or other of us was with him till midnight, when he died; his poor
                  wife closed his eyes, herself as tearless, and almost as corpse-like, as the cold
                  form before her. Anticipating trouble, from her evident feebleness, I asked her
                  condition. She replied calmly, and with that perfect self-possession, only to be
                  accounted for when the soul, subdued by extreme sorrow, and triumphing over
                  apprehension, looks for death as a boon from heaven; "she was perfectly well, and
                  as soon as we had performed the last sad offices, she would try and get some
                  rest."
               The next day, on my return from the cemetery, where a few of the neighbors
                  conveyed him, I called in to see the widow, and found her already past the first
                  stage of the frightful disease. She had informed no one, and evidently wished to
                  die. Oh! how expressive was her sad smile when I questioned her. Again I summoned
                  my brethren; again we went through the hopeless routine. Scarce a groan escaped
                  her, her only seeming anxiety being the trouble she gave us. Poor child of sorrow!
                  her young dream of life was indeed early clouded. Before midnight she also found
                  rest in heaven.
               Surely the Great Author of Nature has decreed that there shall be the broadest
                  contrasts in the nervous organisms of men and women, as well as the joy and sorrow
                  so often depending upon them. How calm and peaceful is the soul in one—how fierce
                  and turbulent the still chafed spirit in another? We have often thought that sleep
                  tells the story of the soul with more truth than wakefulness. Look upon that
                  placid brow, those lips parting as if in prayer for the loved one at her side—it
                  is the first-born of luxury and innocence. The absence of every movement convinces
                  us that the soul is at peace with itself, and like the warm and mellow earth under
                  the dews of heaven, is waiting to give forth the breath of love as soon as the
                  senses awake to consciousness. Again we see the knit brow, the oft-compressed lip,
                  the hurried respiration', the dilated nostril, and clenched hand, Of that
                  impetuous- spirit, that seems under the influence of some fearful dream of wrong
                  or crime. She is, alas! a child of sorrow and misfortune. Yet what is there within
                  the human breast that Often fascinates the soul with intense admiration for such a
                  turbulent spirit, especially if it animate a beautiful form? Such predilections
                  are true we fear of all who are accustomed to the study of that fearful poem—human
                  passion. Yet the history of the drama proves that the broadest contraste delight
                  its worshippers. Lady Macbeth, Desdemona, and Ophelia, with all the lesser and
                  intermediate shades of character, were the work of on master spirit, and it is but
                  reasonable to suppose the same influences operate upon meaner minds. We confess a
                  strange fascination for such studies, and think them the legitimate province of
                  the practical physician.
               The incidents we shall now relate, will serve to show the influence of that
                  loathsome spirit of selfishness and brutality Upon a generous and noble nature,
                  that actuates the bosoms of those Who live upon the profits literally wrung from
                  the heart's-blood of the poor sewing girls, employed by hundreds in those dens of
                  death, the immense work-rooms that supply the Broadway shops with the finer
                  articles of women's and children's clothing. I received both of them from my
                  patient's own lips; and although a more fiery or passionate soul never agitated
                  the human breast, a nobler spirit never animated the form of woman. Alas! the
                  grave has effaced the memory of her errors, and brightened that of her virtues in
                  the hearts of all who knew her.
               One of four sisters, daughters of a respectable citizen, who early in life became
                  reduced in circumstances, she enjoyed no facilities for acquiring accomplishments
                  other than those of a domestic character. She became a proficient in the use of
                  the needle, and having a natural incentive to beauty of form, wherever visible,
                  excelled in embroidery. Noble and
                  generous, she could not see her mother and father suffer, and soon turned her
                  acquirements to account in ornamenting children's garments for the stores.
                  Beautiful and graceful in person, with a fine constitution, and a glorious eagle
                  eye, with nostrils denoting a fiery spirit, and lips on which the glad bee might
                  have lingered, half baby's and half woman's, and a swan-like neck and bust, she
                  did not suffer in health by this pursuit, and attracted the admiration of a young
                  man, who shortly, and I could not but think too hastily for their mutual
                  happiness, for they were very unlike, married her. In a few months he left her,
                  and never returned. Ere long, it became apparent that she was likely to increase
                  the cares and diminish the comforts of their humble home, by herself requiring
                  those attentions she knew to be due to a sick father. This her generous nature
                  would not allow; and after continuing her employment most assiduously till a very
                  late period of gestation, she sought the house of a poor, but kind woman, to pass
                  the period of her accouchment. The extraordinary powers of her constitution, and
                  an elastic spirit, greatly abridged the period, and in a couple of weeks she
                  returned to her father's house with her infant, perfectly restored, with the
                  addition of that nameless, yet apparent charm, that is so rare in the young mother
                  whose occupation is that of the needle.
               During her short absence, her family had so sensibly felt the want of the daily
                  pittance she had brought from her labors, that she resolved instantly to resume
                  them. Leaving her baby to her mother's care, hastily bestowed in moments stolen
                  from the needle, she left her home at seven o'clock in the morning, taking with
                  her such nourishment as the house afforded, and in company with a sister who was
                  employed in the same establishment, with fifty or sixty others, in a single room!
                  Seated in that polluted atmosphere, they remained for twelve hours, with the eye
                  of their task-mistress, and occasionally that of her husband, con stantly upon
                  them. Profound Silence was the rule, as these and heartless people are well
                  advised of its influence in increasing the product of the work-room. Think of the
                  weariness of soul that such an atmosphere, and such occupation and restraint, must
                  produce upon the young girl, and wonder not at her pallid countenance. Yet, amidst
                  all this, my poor patient retained, as she expressed it in her usual style, "such
                  glorious health," that she was the envy of all her companions. At the end of a few
                  weeks the spring approached, and business increasing, the demand of the shops for
                  the fine work of this establishment, warned the girl of the customary increase of
                  hours; they already worked twelve hours for fifty cents!—and no new hands were to
                  be procured, for there was no more room. The additional labor was to be wrung from
                  the sixty, with no increase of pay! For twelve weary hours there they sat, with an
                  interval of half an hour in which to snatch the morsel of food they had brought,
                  and to merely straighten the body, for exercise was out of the question with sixty
                  in one room.
               Every mother, every physician, will imagine the condition of my poor patient, on
                  reflecting that she was a nursing mother, in full health, and had nourished her
                  infant at seven o'clock m the morning. As she expressed it to me—"I used to bound
                  from my seat to the desk for my half dollar scattering the poor girls like a
                  maniac. My sister could scarce keep up. with me, as I rushed home to my baby boy,
                  and (don't laugh at me) to my dinner, for I was very hungry, and liked not my
                  bread and water lunch Flinging my hat on the floor, with my child in my lap and
                  dinging ravenously to the breast, my dinner on a chair before me, and my feet on
                  the bottom spoke I devoured a quantity sufficient for a plowman. Only think of my
                  condition; my poor baby and myself half starved since morning, and half a dozen
                  towels about my breast to absorb his
                  dinner. I could not wait, even a moment. After we got through, our respective
                  performances, I either made some little article of dress for him, or helped my
                  mother with her work till twelve o'clock, for I required no more than six hours'
                  sleep, in consequence of the stupid life I led. One evening I had done more than
                  my usual day's work (and I was admitted to be one of the most profitable hands in
                  the room), and at the first stroke of seven o'clock I bounded with my work to the
                  desk, when I thought I observed an unusual expression in our task-mistress's eyes;
                  they were very beautiful, and I used to gaze on them as though I were her lover.
                  Never shall I forget the dialogue that followed. It was my last day in that
                  workroom.
               "'You seem to be in a hurry, Miss—, even for you; and you are not the
                  most gentle in your movements.';
               I can imagine the look of my poor patient; for when offended, she was exceedingly
                  dignified. I do not wonder at the conclusion, with such a commencement of the
                  encounter.
               "'Pardon me, madam; I am unfortunately rather hasty, but you know my anxiety to
                  reach home.' She well knew my meaning, for she was herself the mother
                  of five children.
               "'Oh! I beg your pardon, Mrs.—; I had forgotten you were
                  married.'
               "I could not account for the wicked sneer with which this was uttered; yet at that
                  very moment, such was my admiration for the beautiful, I was fascinated with the
                  unwonted expression of her lovely eyes.
               "No sooner, however, had my ear caught the sneer, conveying almost a doubt of my
                  marriage, than my very soul was on fire; and had there been a weapon at hand, I
                  could not have answered for the consequences. In an instant my father's and
                  mother's wants, and our dollar, were before me, and I choked down my rage.
               "'You cannot,' said she, 'till even o'clock; there's over-work to-night, and will
                  be for a month to come.'
               "'But, madam, I cannot stay; you know I am a mother and have not seen my child
                  since seven o'clock.'
               "I had unconsciously placed my hand on my breasts, which were exceedingly painful;
                  and when I thought of my own baby boy and hers (for she, too, had an infant), I
                  actually forgot my rage, and awaited that sweet forgiving smile that I had often
                  seen on her beautiful face. But the love of gold will harden even the soul of a
                  mother. I do not wonder at my conduct, though I sometimes think I must have been
                  really demented. She quietly assured me that she made no favorites, and I would
                  have to remain.
               "My fingers were at the top of my dress, a cheap and slight muslin, and with one
                  clutch I tore it from my distended bosom; and forgetting in my rage, father,
                  mother, money, and all, I replied—"Look! You, too, are a mother; would you have me
                  stay?" Not awaiting the answer, and spurning the half dollar, I hastily drew my
                  shawl around me, and blinded by bitter tears of rage and wounded pride, sought my
                  home my child—a solacc for all my grief."
               Alas! poor M—I must be permitted to let her further history be resumed at a future
                  time, and will give the following nearly in her own words:
               "At the same establishment there was a pretty and delicate girl, who was a capital
                  workwoman, and much beloved by us all for her quiet dignity and gentleness. She
                  was the only stay of a widowed and sick mother, and was herself afflicted with an
                  ominous cough; this cough was to me a most distressing affair; it jarred my very
                  soul, for I knew it to be a prelude to her death; and then her poor old sick
                  mother! That thought, when I recollected my love for my own dear, good mother, and
                  her patient, uncomplaining toil, would often actually choke me with grief.
               
               "I used to bring candies and gum for her, because I knew she could not afford
                  them. One day her paroxysms of coughing had been very violent, and she was pitied
                  by all of us very much; even our mistress, as she examined her beautiful work, and
                  the unusual amount of it, wondered how she could have accomplished so much. Poor
                  child! it was her last: she had worked with desperation, to keep her situation,
                  fearing she would lose it in consequence of her cough.
               "On that day, this dreadful exercise was so violent, that I felt relieved to see
                  her untie and pin up her apron, as we all did when leaving off work, and deposit
                  it in the closet. The next day her seat was vacant. Madam observed that 'the poor
                  child was probably too ill to come; and though she embroidered beautifully, she
                  would not regret it if she stayed away for good, for that dreadful cough really
                  made her nervous.'
               "Two more days elapsed, when our mistress desired one of us to call and see how
                  she was, as her seat could not remain vacant, and there were many applicants for
                  work.
               "I was requested to call, as my attachment for her was known. Nothing but my poor
                  boy had prevented my calling before, though she lived on the east side of the
                  town, and I in the west: and you know how I must have felt at seven o'clock. I
                  found her laid out and draped for her last rest, with her sick mother, surrounded
                  by her kind and poor neighbors, and very clean 'but wretchedly poor apartments,
                  happily unconscious; her brain could not stand the shock and she was mercifully
                  crazed.
               "The next day, on unpinning her silk apron, the towel in which she had brought her
                  dinner was found saturated with blood; the violence of the cough was explained;
                  she had broken a blood-vessel!"
               It is often difficult to understand our Irish patients; so strangely do the tragic
                  and the comic seem to be combined in their erratic natures. A scene I once
                  witnessed, will never be erased from my memory. I have repeatedly had my gravity
                  overcome by it upon some serious occasions, and have more than once been obliged
                  to hide my face in my hands, to pass muster as a sane man.
               A young Irish girl, with a wild shriek and an och hone, and ah, murther, and
                  hulla-loo—a—hulla-loo—poor Terry! Ah! why did I tase ye? burst into my office one
                  evening, upsetting the servant, and actually laying hold of me with her hands,
                  "Ah! Docther, Docther—come now for the love of the mother that bore ye—come this
                  minute; I've killed poor Terry, and never again shall I see him. Ah, murther!
                  murther! why did I plague ye?" Trying in vain to calm her, I hastily drew on my
                  boots, and almost ran after her to a wretched tenement some quarter of a mile off,
                  and found the object of my patient's solicitude alive and kicking, with his lungs
                  in the best of order, standing on the stairs that led to his miserable chamber,
                  with a broken scissors and a teacup in his hand, stirring busily the contents. It
                  seems that he had been courting my fair guide, and after the period she had fixed
                  for giving her final answer to his declaration, she had bantered him with a
                  refusal, which her solicitude for his life plainly showed was far enough from her
                  real intentions. Before she came for me, he had swallowed an ounce of laudanum,
                  which he had procured of an injudicious druggist, and was now mixing a powder
                  which he had obtained from another, who knowing of his love affair, it will be
                  seen acted more judiciously, as Terry let slip enough to show what he wanted to do
                  with the "rat's bane" for which he inquired; and Biddy, a true daughter of Eve,
                  had made no secret in the neighborhood that she valued her charms beyond the poor
                  fellow's bid. As soon as she came near him, he by some in-opportune expression,
                  re-excited her wrath, and she declared she wouldn't have him "if he went straight
                  to the devil."
               
               Poor Terry, in his red shirt and blue stockings, and an attitude of the grandest
                  kind, but covering, as we soon found, a desperate purpose, flourished his tea-cup
                  and stirred Up its contents with the scissors, constantly exclaiming, "Ah! Biddy,
                  will ye have me?" "Ye'll have me now, will ye not?" "Divil a bit will I let the
                  docther come near me till ye say yes! shure, weren't we children together, and
                  didn't we take our pataties and butther-milk out of the same bowl, and yer mother
                  that's dead always said ye were to be my wife! and now ye're kapin' company with
                  that dirty blackguard, Jemmy O'Conner: divil taak him for a spalpeen—ah! Biddy,
                  will ye have me?"
               Biddy's blood was up at this disrespectful mention of Jemmy's name, for he had a
                  winning way with him, and she now declared with great earnestness "she would never
                  have him;" when, with an awful gulp, poor Terry rolled up his eyes, and with a
                  most impassioned, yet ludicrous look at her, drained the cup, and fell upon his
                  knees on the step; Biddy fell down in strong hysterics! The whole affair was so
                  irresistibly ludicrous, that I could scarce forbear shouting with laughter. On
                  observing the ounce bottle, however, labelled "laudanum," and looking into the
                  bottom of the tea-cup and finding a white powder, I went to the druggist's on the
                  corner to see what it was, and to send his boy for my stomach-pump, and procure a
                  chemical remedy also, should it really prove to be arsenic.
               To my great relief, he informed me that he had given Terry a quantity of chalk and
                  eight grains of tartar emetic! as he said he was already in possession of the
                  ounce of laudanum, and all the neighbors knew that Biddy had driven him almost mad
                  by flirting with Jemmy O'Conner. The young man had judiciously told him that the
                  powder would make the laudanum sure to operate effectually. Terry inquired
                  carefully, "how long it would take," and bagged all for use when the refusal
                  should come.
               
               
                  
                     "Ah! Terry, Terry! dear Terry! I'll have ye. Yes, I will; and I don't
                        care who hears me. I always loved ye; but that divil's baby, Meg, always
                        kept tellin' me ye'd love me betther if I didn't give in to ye too soon. Ah!
                        Terry, dear Terry, only live, and I'll go to the end of the world for
                        ye!"—PAGE 25
                  
               
               My course was now clear; I was in for sport. Sending the druggist's clerk for my
                  stomach-pump, in case the emetic should not operate, I awaited the result; for
                  eight grains of tartar emetic, taken at a dose, would almost vomit the potatoes
                  out of a bag. As for Biddy, I let her lie, for I thought she suffered justly. My
                  heart was always very tender towards the sex, and I generally expected. a "fellow
                  feelin'."
               In a short time it became evident that Terry's stomach was not so tough as his
                  will; and he began to intermingle long and portentous sighs with his prayers, and
                  to perspire freely. 'I gave, him a wide berth, for I knew what was coming; and I
                  was anxious Biddy should revive time enough to witness his grand effort, for I
                  expected more fun. But Terry was tough, and held out. Shortly she revived, and
                  suddenly starting up, ran towards him.
               "Ah! Terry, Terry! dear Terry! I'll have ye. Yes, I will; and I don't care who
                  hears me. I always loved ye; but that divil's baby, Meg, always kept tellin' me
                  ye'd love me betther if I didn't, give in to ye too soon. Ah! Terry, dear Terry,
                  only live, and I'll go to the end of the world for ye! Ah! what would my poor
                  mother say if she was here? Och! hone, och! hone; docther, now, and what are ye
                  doin'? A purty docther ye are; and ye pumped out yer own countryman, that didn't
                  die sure, and he tuk twice as much as poor Terry. Up wid ye now, and use the black
                  pipe ye put down the poor craythur's throat over the way last summer. I'd take it
                  meself, if 'twould do; but, God knows whether I'd be worth the throuble."
               As Terry had not yet cast up his accounts, and the stomach-pump, all bright and
                  glittering, was at hand, I determined to make a little more capital out of the
                  case; and thrusting the long, flexible India-rubber tube down poor Terry's throat,
                  with his teeth separated by means of a stick, and his head between my knees, I
                  soon had the satisfaction of depositing
                  the laudanum and emetic in the swill-pail, the only article of the toilet at
                  hand.
               After years proved Terry and Biddy most loving companions. He never, even when
                  drunk, more than threatened her "wid a batin';" and she never forgave "that
                  divil's baby," poor Meg, for her cruel experiment on her heroic and devoted
                  Terry.
            
            
               LEAVES PROM THE LOG-BOOK OF AN UNFLEDGED ÆSCULAPIAN.
               FISHING IN A FASHIONABLE NEIGHBORHOOD FOR PRACTICE—CLERICAL
                  PATRONAGE—FIRST VISIT TO MRS. MACKEREL—DESCRIPTION OF MRS. MACKEREL—A MIDNIGHT
                  SCENE—AN IMPRESSIVE INTERVIEW.
               IT is instructive to compare the different views with which young men of different
                  temperaments enter upon the study and practice of our arduous profession. To the
                  quiet observer, who has been accustomed to realize the comforting influence of
                  that doubly-blessed apophthegm, "Blessed be those who expect nothing," &c.,
                  what can be more entertaining and instructive than to watch the different phases
                  and transmutations in the mental and bodily condition of two or three of his
                  brethren, and to compare with her influence upon himself, the manner in which Dame
                  Fortune showers her kicks and coppers? Of all earthly individuals, a medical man
                  is so completely the child of chance, and his success or failure depends upon such
                  insignificant and often laughable combinations of circumstances and trifles, that
                  it has always afforded us a fascinating occupation to look back upon the histories
                  of a few of them, and to compare the results of their operations upon the public
                  with those of an individual, whose mental constitution and good qualities we
                  cannot define more particularly without incurring the imputation of
                  favoritism.
               Accustomed as we have ever been to admire independence, even to a slight dash of
                  obstinacy of character, we may, perhaps,
                  say, without impropriety, that we are wont to view the character of the medical
                  subject of the present sketch with some admiration, because of a slight
                  resemblance to—a certain professional wolf we wot of. He has, to our knowledge,
                  from the first, like that roving animal, laid his own course over the unknown
                  regions of medical experience, and paid little or no attention to the charts of
                  his predecessors. We hope often to give to our readers some of his descriptions of
                  the little green islands in the great ocean of human life to which his erratic
                  bark has guided him; these have often presented over the social board, a charm to
                  the medical Crusoe imagination, and we trust they will please a certain class of
                  our readers. In the year 1830 I was sent forth, like our long-suffering and
                  much-abused prototype old grandfather Noah's crow, from that ark of safety, the
                  old Duane street College. I pitched my tent and set up my trap, in what was then a
                  fashionable up-town street, inhabited almost exclusively by merchants. I hired a
                  modest house, and had my arm-chair, my midnight couch (reader, did you never think
                  what a melancholy thing a doctor's couch is?), and my few books in my melancholy
                  little office, and I confess that I now and then left an amputating knife, or some
                  other awful-looking instrument, on the table, to impress the poor women who came
                  to me for advice. These little matters, although the "Academy" would frown upon
                  them, I considered quite pardonable. God knows I would willingly have adopted
                  their most approved method of a splendid residence and silver-mounted harness for
                  my bays, but they were yet in dream-land eating moonbeams, and my vicious little
                  nag had nearly all his time to eat his oats and nurse his bad temper in his
                  comfortable stable: it always seemed he took particular pains to be obstinate and
                  ungrateful. In this miserable way I read over my old books, watered my
                  rose-bushes, sometimes with tears, drank my tea, and ate my toast, and now and
                  then listened to the complaint of an unfortunate Irish damsel, with her customary
                  account of "a pain and flutterin' about me heart." At rare intervals I ministered
                  to some of her countrywomen in their fulfilment of the great command when placed
                  in the garden of Eden (what a dirty place it would have been had there been any
                  Irish women there!): And thus I spent nearly a year without a single call to any
                  person of character in the neighborhood., I think I should have left it in
                  despair, if it had not been for a lovely creature up the street. She was the wife
                  of a distinguished fish merchant down town, and with a wealthy neighbor came to my
                  rescue when approaching actual despair. Very soothing were the occasional tokens
                  of recognition this lovely lady vouchsafed to me. Mr. Tip Tape,- also, her
                  husband's friend, an eminent dry goods merchant, would now and then salute me in
                  market, though his near-sightedness prevented his seeing me in Broadway. But more
                  grateful than all to my feelings, was the confidence of Mrs. Mackerel when she
                  condescended to inquire at my very door, what I thought of the chances for life of
                  a poor widow I was attending, and who had been accustomed to "do up" her laces and
                  receive a bounty of broken victuals at her hospitable door, and perhaps to be
                  remembered in the universal prayer for the wretched at the end of the service on
                  Sundays. At an occasional period of remarkable amiability, the lovely creature
                  would condescend to inquire of the health of my family.
               All this, however, I feared was preparatory to- the anticipated necessity of
                  calling me in to see Bridget or Molly, should the health of these interesting
                  young ladies suffer in the service of her ladyship; and I used to rehearse the
                  impressive manner in which I would decline the proffered fee of a few shillings,
                  in place of the check given the family physician for attending upon herself and
                  the little Mackerels, and to imagine the liberal measure of her regrets in her private circle at my poverty and
                  unbecoming pride. Dear Mrs. Mackerel, how unjust I was! It is true, moreover, and
                  I ought to confess it, I used sometimes to try her patience. I would occasionally
                  array myself in my best suit, and having rather a formidable exterior, enjoy the
                  start with which the lady would recognize me, as my old wind-dried gig would
                  rattle past her window—a street where I had no occasion to go; and I confess I
                  used sometimes purposely to go out of the way to buy my dinner, emerging from the
                  market-hall, just round the corner from her elegant mansion, with a pair of
                  chickens or a beef-steak, purposely held on a skewer at a right angle with the
                  body, by the left hand, and the right one ready to give her a most impressive
                  salutation as soon as she should raise her eyes. Alas! poor dear Mrs. Mackerel! I
                  even thus early suspected your unfortunate alliance, and pitied you heartily when
                  the naughty sheriff came to to take away all those lovely little china Madonnas
                  and dolls, and beautiful tea-cups, and embroidered cats and dogs, that used to be
                  scattered in such elegant profusion about your classic parlors; for I got there
                  one night I will tell you how, reader, if you'll give me time: you must take my
                  reminiscences as they come—fitfully.
               Before I was preferred to the distinguished honor of feeling the pulse of my
                  charming patroness, I had received a most expressive inkling of an explosion of
                  clerical wrath that was about to fall on my devoted head, and put me for s a time
                  out of the pale of fashionable religious patronage. My morning audiences with my
                  Irish patients, were usually interrupted by the presence of the venerable sexton
                  of a neighboring church; a gentleman who evidently labored under a most impressive
                  estimate of the oratorical and intellectual ability of his employer—a worthy
                  little man, who defended the doctrine of priestly supremacy in an edifice of some
                  architectural pretension, the result of the paternal beneficence of his commercial
                  progenitor. That astute gentleman early perceived what parental affection so often
                  prevents, viz., the inequality between the benevolent impulses of the heart, and
                  the more mature product of the head of his clerical offspring. This prompted a
                  pecuniary outlay, that the sagacious merchant perceived his commercial neighbors
                  would have been disinclined to vest in a religious speculation, resting upon such
                  an intellectual substratum. The son was therefore duly installed into a beautiful
                  little edifice, usually so important an adjunct to clerical success. Finding a
                  pastor and an edifice prepared to their hand, our commercial friends could do no
                  less than give their pecuniary support and the countenance of their families to
                  the undertaking.
               I fondly supposed that my religious predilection for the plainer demonstrations of
                  worship of my Quaker friends, would render any other contributions unnecessary,
                  than the Epsom salts and Elixir Pro. with which my clerical neighbor was wont to
                  reduce the grossness and strengthen the reins and stomachs of his own and his
                  sexton's household; but I was soon given to understand that the pastor calculated
                  upon material aid oft a far more substantial character; in short, that it was
                  necessary I should make a selection from three pews which had been kindly proposed
                  for the modest occupancy of myself and family. They were considerately chosen by
                  the vestry near the door; doubtless to facilitate my egress in case of my
                  professional services being required during the service; or possibly with a
                  benevolent eye to the facility with which I could cure the catarrhs, that might be
                  consequent on a stray draft of air, that might perchance enter the only door of
                  entrance immediately behind us. What influence a recent sight of my better half by
                  Mrs. Mackerel might have had, in wishing to keep that lady away from her own
                  contiguity—Mr. Mackerel was in the vestry—I will not pretend to determine. To do
                  that lady justice, however, she was a
                  very lovely woman, and may therefore be supposed above the necessity of such
                  selfish considerations. And yet, I cannot say, for it is natural to be partial to
                  one's own, and I observed a marked increase of the deference with which she
                  saluted me, after observing the entrance of the mistress of my affections into the
                  street-door of our modest mansion. Be that as it may, at the time the sexton made
                  me the confidential communication about the pews, I was laboring most impressively
                  under the inconvenient and unfashionable idea, of the necessity of close attention
                  to the preservation of my professional character by paying for my bread and meat,
                  rent and horse feed; and had other delightful responsibilities of a more poetical
                  character in prospect. I certainly saw no probability of fulfilling all these
                  requisitions, and likewise enjoying the expensive luxury of an entire pew in a
                  fashionable church. I therefore entered into an explanation with my venerable
                  friend, and gave him to understand that I could not think of incurring so great a
                  responsibility. He heard me out very dispassionately, but quietly assured me it
                  was "expected by the vestry," and expressed himself very significantly that I "had
                  better do it." I did not, however, accede to the proposition; and soon placed
                  myself entirely outside the pale of clerical beneficence, by declining to draw a
                  couple of teeth from two of the pastor's sons, being preferred to that dignified,
                  and to me unwonted exercise of chirurgical skill, by a venerable medical gentleman
                  who enjoyed the honor of attending the pastor's family. It was the last visit his
                  reverence ever paid my modest office, and I soon had the satisfaction of being
                  relieved from the espionage of his worthy coöperator, the sexton. I state these
                  apparently trifling incidents, to show our aspiring young friends the path they
                  are expected to travel, if they would attain the dignity of attending the families
                  of gentlemen of a certain order of professional intellect, and that they are
                  expected to take sides on all questions involving religious and political
                  speculations and pecuniary outlay in their respective neighborhoods.
               To return to the lovely Mrs. Mackerel. I will explain how it was that I was
                  summoned to her ladyship's mansion, and even at my first visit enjoyed the
                  pleasure of seeing that distinguished operator in South street, Mr. Mackerel, of
                  the firm of Mackerel, Haddock & Dun. One bitter night in January, it happened
                  most fortunately that I had been to a wedding party and returned very late, clad
                  in the highest style of fashion; a very unusual circumstance, to be sure, with me,
                  but one which every young Æsculapian should occasionally attend to, particularly
                  if he has a fine figure. Just as I was about to retire, a furious ring at the
                  front door made me feel particularly amiable. A servant announced the sudden
                  alarming illness of Mrs. Mackerel, with the assurance that as the family physician
                  was out of town, Mr. Mackerel would be obliged if I would immediately visit her.
                  As this was my first call m the neigborhood to any lady of position, I resolved to
                  do my prettiest. Accordingly I soon found myself in the presence of the
                  accomplished lady, having, I confess it, given my hair an extra touch as I entered
                  the beautiful chamber. Never having had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Mackerel
                  before, I had not hitherto been able to diagnosticate a very important item in
                  professional attendance on married ladies; I allude to that delicate matter, the
                  precise position occupied by the gentleman in the domestic ménage, and whether he
                  had been accustomed to harmonize with Madam in her æsthetic predilections for
                  jewelry, Italian greyhounds, Honiton lace, and other elements of domestic
                  happiness. A single glance, as he appeared at the hall door, convinced me that the
                  gentleman was but paired to his beautiful mate. He was, indeed, a very gross and
                  obtuse person, presenting a marked similarity to a species of the article to which
                  he owed his reputed wealth, and the
                  irreverent name I have given him.
               His entire physiognomy, all but the disposition of the eyes, presented a marked
                  resemblance to a codfish; the forehead and chin evinced the same disposition to
                  retreat from the nose, and had the locality of the eyes been changed to the
                  forehead in a well-developed specimen of one of those innocent victims as it lies
                  on the market-stall, having escaped the process that renders so many of its sleek
                  brethren the subject of commercial operations similar to those of Messrs.
                  Mackerel, Haddock & Dun, their expressiveness would have admirably rivalled
                  those of the senior partner of that most respectable concern. We are aware that
                  Mr. Mackerel's personal peculiarities might have admitted of much simpler
                  description, by the observation that he was utterly destitute of all point;
                  indeed, there would have been a double advantage in using that term, for it would
                  have been equally expressive of his unwillingness to yield to the persuasive
                  eloquence of his lovely wife, on the necessity of an equipage suited to their rank
                  and condition. Mrs. Tip Tape had just procured a new one, and her own charms were
                  greatly superior to that lady's; but Mr. M. remained deaf to her entreaties, even
                  in all the ravishing eloquence of her midnight toilette. Indeed, so obtuse was
                  that human impersonation of his professional piscatorial coldness, that on his
                  utter refusal to "point," a hysterical burst of grief and convulsive sobs,
                  followed by speechlessness, was the cause of my being summoned to the bed-side of
                  the patient; this I subsequently learned from a mutual friend. Until I knew Mr.
                  Mackerel's pecuniary embarrassments by the sad dénoûment of her existing illness, in the collapse of the firm of
                  Mackerel, Haddock & Dun (when the latter article of their merchandise, in the
                  opinion of a wag of a neighbor, became expressive of their unenviable notoriety),
                  I was so impressed with his evident coolness and obduracy, that I confidently
                  believed a post-mortem, should the opportunity
                  offer, would actually disclose a single ventricle in the heart, and give a
                  physiological clue to his wonderful resemblance to the article in which he dealt.
                  Throughout the entire fortnight of my attendance, he displayed the most provoking
                  indifference to the sufferings of the lady.
               Now let me indulge in a little medico-physiologico-moral philosophy on ray
                  interesting patient, for the especial benefit of aspiring mammas and their
                  daughters. Mrs. Mackerel was not a bad-tempered woman; she was only a beautiful
                  fool; nothing less, reader, or she would never have married Mr. Mackerel. Her
                  charms would have procured her a husband of at least a tolerable exterior, and no
                  one could well have been more stupid than Mr. Mackerel; besides, he was only a
                  fish-merchant, and fish are, at best, but a migratory sort of animal, as Mr.
                  Mackerel soon proved: they are here now, and next minute nowhere. Mrs. Mackerel
                  did not balance, when making a choice, her prospective advancement in the circle
                  of fashion, with the unavoidable incumbrance of Mr. Mackerel's phlegm and personal
                  appearance. Besides, he chewed and smoked; and the combination of the united aroma
                  of his favorite luxuries, and the articles of his merchandise, must certainly have
                  been most uncongenial to the curve of such lips and such nostrils. Every day she
                  would be mortified by his presence; and should she give an evening party? what
                  could console her for such a partner? As long as his ability to gratify her pride
                  lasted, she had some consolation; but when it was becoming rapidly apparent that
                  the funds were decreasing, Mrs. Mackerel's nerves took the alarm. When Mr. Tip
                  Tape purchased his new establishment, matters became desperate; that palpable
                  evidence of prosperity and fashion had long been the lady's goal of ambition, and
                  when a flat refusal followed her urgent appeal to add it to their existing
                  glories, Mr. Mackerel's personal and intellect tual deficiencies stood forth in all their genuine
                  deformity.
               I was received by Mr. Mackerel in a manner that increased observation has since
                  taught me is sufficiently indicative of the hysterical finale of a domestic
                  dialogue. Mrs. and Mr. M., like some of their more humble neighbors, had just
                  returned from a party; and although It may not become me to say it, I trust that
                  my little queen had not quite as many causes of mortification in her spouse, as
                  poor Mrs. Mackerel. I neither smoked nor chewed; besides, I actually kept my
                  equipage, and a pillbox and lancet would have been a far more passable coat of
                  arms, than an equally emblematic professional crest, upon the panels of the
                  longed-for equipage of my luckless patient.
               It has been alleged by the admirers of tobacco, that it is a soul-sustaining
                  solace in deep grief and financial or domestic embarrassments. We have even heard
                  it asserted that it will greatly aid a professional diagnosis. To gay the truth, I
                  should judge from the intellectual developments of most of my professional friends
                  who use it, that their cerebral efforts require a little help. Mr. Mackerel was
                  evidently convinced of its power to sustain him, whether in grief or domestic
                  annoyance. He used it with the utmost freedom of expectoration, and with the
                  equally elegant and expressive position of his hands in his breeches pockets,
                  attempted an explanation of the lady's condition.
               Now Mr. Mackerel was sufficiently acute not to let me into the true cause of his
                  wife's nervous attack, and his own collectedness; and yet he felt it would not do
                  to make too light of it. Mrs. M. was a well-educated woman, and he was thoroughly
                  astonished at the first display of what he had sense enough to perceive was a
                  violent hysterical paroxysm, and which she had probably given him to understand
                  was an outburst of long-suppressed disgust; he therefore thought it would prove as
                  well to give me a hint of the matter. He assured me that the lady had been in her
                  usual health up to the period of her attack, and as he felt obliged to give some
                  cause for the suddenness of my summons, and the speechless condition of the
                  patient, he said he supposed that the dancing, the warmth of the room, and the
                  supper combined, must have produced exhaustion of the nervous system, &c.,
                  &c. Having often witnessed the inclination of ladies and gentlemen at
                  supper-parties to make a "melody" (medley) in their stomachs, as one of my old
                  English patients is wont ambitiously to express herself, I was fully prepared to
                  realize the powers of ices and creams, cake, oranges, punch, chicken salad,
                  oysters, champagne, and sugar plums, to produce such a consummation, and had
                  almost concluded to dispatch the servant for an emetic of ipecac, before I had
                  seen the patient; this, however, I prudently avoided, and accompanied Mr. Mackerel
                  to his wife's chamber.
               It is now, alas! twenty-five years ago, and although the toils of professional
                  life have, in some degree, chilled my admiration for the beautiful, I shall never
                  forget the extreme beauty of my patient, and the strength of the instantaneous
                  conviction, that it was to her unfortunate union that the hysterical attack was
                  due. Aside from the improbability of excess of appetite, through the portal of
                  such a mouth, being the cause (I speak with decision on my power to diagnosticate
                  this particular case, though I would not advise the precedent in similar ones),
                  the lovely color of the cheeks and lips utterly forbade a conclusion favorable to
                  Mr. Mackerel's solution. The roses and the lilies seemed contending for supremacy,
                  and the entire effect was admirably heightened by the rose-tinted light reflected
                  from the pink silk curtains, completely lining an exquisite lace exterior,
                  beautifully edged with a tracery, "light as the foaming surf, that the wind severs
                  from the broken wave." Although accustomed to self-control, I found it somewhat
                  difficult to command my feelings as I
                  placed my fingers on the wrist of the delicately-jewelled and exquisite hand. "All
                  seemed calm as the sepulchre, or the thoughts in an angel's breast." I was
                  nonplussed. Could any tumultuous passions ever have agitated that bosom so gently
                  swelling in repose? The canvas and marble of the sculptor might try in vain to
                  emulate such perfection. Mr. Mackerel, on his entrance, had simply announced my
                  presence to the lady; no token of recognition on her part followed, nor did the
                  slightest movement, or an additional breath seemingly indicate a knowledge of my
                  presence. The lady continued profoundly passive whilst I felt the pulse,
                  interrupted occasionally by Mr. Mackerel's expectoration, as he ejected the
                  surplus of his delicious luxury, with that peculiar sound, the dynamics of which I
                  could never quite understand, but which seems to be only attainable in its highest
                  elegance by devoted tobacco chewers. Mr. Mackerel's presence was by no means
                  desirable, and it occurred to me that as it probably caused the silence of the
                  patient, the only way I could get quit of him, and speech from her, was to ring
                  for the servant and request her to perform some unimportant service, and to summon
                  me should the lady desire to see me, as I knew she was quite aware of my presence.
                  I then withdrew with Mr. Mackerel.
               The curious questions, touching my medical Sagacity as to his wife's condition,
                  received about as satisfactory a solution as most of the questions that are put to
                  me on the causes and treatment of disease, and when the gentleman was tolerably
                  befogged with opinions he could not quite as well understand as the respective
                  qualities of his merchandise, I was pleased to receive the anticipated summons;
                  requesting him to remain, as I should probably need his personal services to
                  procure medicine, I again sought my patient.
               What an effort I made to preserve a calm professional exterior, as I ascended that
                  stairway and opened that door! The united influence of the countenance and
                  surroundings of my patient, had given me a tumultuous agitation, even in the
                  presence of Mr. Mackerel, when the eyes of my patient were closed; but when she
                  raised the drooping lids, and the full soul came welling up from the depths of
                  those blue orbs, and with a sweet smile she regretted the consequence "of Mr.
                  Mackerel's anxiety," and assured me she had only been overcome with the fatigue of
                  the party, and would cheerfully take any domestic restorative I would direct, as
                  she did not wish to cause any further trouble, I felt intuitively that the poor
                  child had made up her mind to endure her fate, and feared that she had required my
                  services for the first and last time. I remained a few minutes and took my leave,
                  feeling that the most acceptable service I could render a well-bred woman whose
                  infernal position had allowed her woman's nature to overcome her, would be to
                  leave her alone with her own feelings.
               My impressions, however, were incorrect with regard to a future summons, as I had
                  been fortunate enough to appease Mr. Mackerel's fears by my learned description of
                  the action of the probable causes of his wife's attack His own professional
                  sagacity being constantly exercised on the product of "bait," he lulled his
                  suspicions to rest by the apparent innocence with which I answered his leading
                  questions, and arrived, like many others, at the conclusion most desirable to him,
                  viz. that I was a fool; a conviction quite as necessary, in some nervous cases, as
                  its opposite, to the husband, if the physician wishes to retain possession of the
                  patient.
               So pleased was Mr. Mackerel with the soothing influence of my short visit, that he
                  very courteously waited on me to the outside of the door, and desired I would call
                  in the morning, leaving me in no doubt of his friendly intentions, though not
                  equally certain that their manifestation did not extend to the deposit of his
                  surplus luxuries on my new coat.
               
               In the morning, after my usual office diversions of investigating "a pain and
                  flutterin' about me heart," and "I'm kilt intirely," &c., &c., I called on
                  Mrs. Mackerel, and had the pleasure of finding her quite composed and in
                  conversation with her friend, Mrs. Tip Tape. Fortunately for me, I passed the
                  critical examination of that lady unscathed by her sharp black eyes, and was
                  pronounced quite an agreeable "person," as an acute Quaker lady subsequently
                  informed me the lady always called me. Mrs. Tip Tape was the daughter of a retired
                  milliner, and had formed an appropriate union with Mr. Tip Tape, the eminent
                  dry-goods merchant. They will require a separate notice, as I subsequently
                  received some "patronage" from them, and they were people of consideration in the
                  neighborhood.
               Poor Mrs. Mackerel, notwithstanding her efforts to conceal it, had evidently
                  received some cruel and stunning communication from her husband on the night of my
                  summons; her agitated circulation during the fortnight of my attendance showed to
                  my entire conviction, some persistent and hidden cause for her nervousness; but
                  her conduct was most unexceptionably that of a dignified woman, determined to bear
                  to the utmost every discharge from the quiver of her relentless fate. Once, and
                  once only, on my apologizing for the lateness of my evening visit, as I had been
                  for the first time to take my little queen and our new gift an airing, she
                  observed with a slight smile, "Your wife is, I hear, a great pet with you,
                  Doctor." A slight tremor and a convulsive cough told me a story I had long
                  suspected. I replied in a manner calculated to produce a comparison as little
                  painful as possible, and directed the conversation in as cheerful a channel as
                  occurred to me. That evening she assured me that she felt she should now rapidly
                  recover, as Mr. Mackerel had concluded to take her to Saratoga for change of
                  scene. I gladly assented, though I had not been asked for my opinion. I took my
                  leave, and in a few days, a final one, of the lovely Mrs. Mackerel; the poor child
                  departed for Saratoga. The ensuing week there was a sheriff's sale, and my
                  diagnosis of the cause of her disease received confirmation not to be
                  misunderstood.
               After the departure of the Mackerels, Mr. Tip Tape honored me by requesting my
                  professional advice. Either from the fact of my being under a temporary cloud,
                  because Mrs. M. did not instantly recover, owing to my inability to procure a
                  carriage and horses, or because Mr. Mackerel was anticipating my bill, and wished
                  to cheapen my services,—or because they did not wish to have their own
                  condescension lessened by example, the Tip Tapes had held themselves magnificently
                  aloof. Now, however, I seemed about to enjoy the full warmth of their patronage.
                  The very next day after the Mackerels' departure, Mr. Tip Tape did me the honor to
                  inquire after the health of my family; and the following week, Master Tip Tape
                  having fallen and bumped his nose on the floor, I had the felicity of soothing the
                  anguish of his mamma in her magnificent boudoir, and holding to her lovely nose
                  the smelling salts, and offering such consolation as her trying position
                  required;—but of them anon.
            
            
               
               THE NERVE POWER.
               WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE NERVE POWER?—ITS ACTION ON OUR BODIES
                  UNDER THE VARIOUS STIMULI—ITS POWER OVER THE CONTRACTION OF THE MUSCLES—THE
                  INFLUENCE OF PROLONGED INSPIRATION IN CURING DISEASES AND GIVING STRENGTH TO THE
                  BODY—HOW DOES IT COMPARE WITH OTHER SYSTEMS OF CURE?
               
                  
                     The brain is the electric battery: the nerves the telegraph: the face the
                        dial plate of the soul.
                  
               
               WHAT, then, is the nature of this power that holds us in just relation with the
                  universe? What is the origin of that force that marshals into life the plastic
                  atoms of the insect, and sends it forth murmuring on its perfumed way into the
                  glancing sunbeam? What causes the forest to reecho with the voice of the feathered
                  songster? What is it that sends up from the depths of the troubled and frigid
                  ocean the mighty breathings of the great leviathan, with his heat-producing heart?
                  What animates the ponderous elephant as he moves majestic over the plains; or the
                  lithe tiger and lordly lion, as they leap tremendous, and make the heart falter in
                  its beat by their unearthly roar? We have watched with microscopic eye, the
                  earliest indication of life in the egg or the womb, before the formation of a
                  visible nerve; we have seen the willing atoms obey the unchangeable law of
                  creative power, with the same precision that the living and independent creature,
                  under the influence of its nerves, performs its voluntary and appropriate actions.
                  We feel that all our reliable investigations into the nature of the nerve power,
                  can only commence in the second stage of animal existence.
               We receive the palpitating creature perfect from the hand of nature. We
                  interrogate and catechise its nervous convulsions, as we expose and subject its
                  muscles and their animating threads to our knife; but we only approximate the
                  truth in our experiments on animals. We must verify our observations by the
                  appreciative and intelligent utterance of our own species, as sickness or casualty
                  gives us the opportunity to strengthen our theories by analogy, or prove them by
                  facts. It is this necessity that gives the medical philosopher the character of
                  impassive want of feeling, when he is entitled to esteem and respect for his quiet
                  investigation; for he well knows, and by virtue of his daily pursuits has ever
                  present to his remembrance, the conviction that he, too, is but another atom on
                  the shore of time, to be swept into that great ocean of death beyond. Let us
                  calmly, then, read with him from the page of nature, even her cry of agony, and
                  endeavor to gather truths that may serve us in attaining the legitimate period of
                  our limited existence, when we can calmly take our appointed chamber in the silent
                  halls of fate.
               Although electricity will produce most of the phenomena of muscular life, even in
                  the body recently dead, and upon muscles governed by a nerve detached from its
                  natural connections with the still living animal, still there is one experiment
                  that would seem conclusively to prove that electricity is not the sole power that
                  governs our bodies. When a ligature is tightly drawn around a nerve, its
                  functions, as a conductor of nerve power, are paralyzed; it can no longer animate
                  the muscle to motion, whilst it is still capable of conveying electricity! This
                  would seem to be conclusive, that some other property was possessed by the nerves;
                  moreover, mechanical and chemical irritants will cause contractions of those
                  muscles governed by the nerve to which
                  the irritation is applied. This is the way that anatomists have discovered the
                  functions of the various nerves. Even the criminal, when recently executed, and
                  still possessing warmth and pliancy, can be made to exercise the muscles of
                  respiration, and of the face and limbs; and that, too, in a most emphatic and
                  expressive manner, when the various nerves governing the muscles appropriated to
                  perform those movements, are subjected to galvanic action.
               Our present object will be chiefly to show the influence of the natural stimuli on
                  the nerves and contractility of the muscles and their power of preserving and
                  restoring health, but in a special manner the influence of prolonged respiration,
                  for several minutes at a time each day. We have observed enough, and are prepared
                  to show from data, sufficient to prove to any intelligent observer, that it will
                  prove more effective in restoring lost or failing health, than any other means
                  whatever, even in the hands of the most conscientious and intellectual man; and
                  that when compared to the various other suggestions that have been dignified with
                  the names of systems or pathies, they shrink into immeasurable littleness behind
                  the hungry and heartless faces of the impostors who have palmed them upon a
                  thoughtless world. If the person who reads this be easily smitten with a name, let
                  him call it VENTUPATHY; but think not that it is a new pathy. No, no; it is as old
                  as the moment when God breathed the breath of life into the nostrils of our great
                  progenitor. Nor is it necessary that it should be prescribed by a solemn-looking
                  gentleman in black, in cabalistic characters and bad Latin, and purchased of an
                  ignorant apothecary, or dispensed from a little bottle of attenuated falsehood, or
                  soaked and drenched into your feeble carcass with a dirty wet sheet. It coats none
                  of these humiliating sacrifices to ignorance and rascality. You take it from the
                  same glorious source whence the eagle gets it, as he sails under its
                  life-inspiring influence, on unwearied wing across the rolling deep, and screams
                  wildly his cry of delight to the great source of his power.
               From the moment when the first impression of the air on the infant's skin causes
                  the first effort of the muscles that raise its ribs and let into its lungs the
                  life-continuing and nerve-restoring fluid, to the last sigh that escapes us in
                  death, there is not a moment in which we are not reminded of the power of this
                  great renovator of life. Let us but enter a close and unventilated room—let us be
                  for even a few moments engaged in animated conversation—let any depressing emotion
                  overtake us, and we are reminded by the involuntary sigh, that nature required
                  more of her renovator. The sigh is but a long and convulsive inspiration, to make
                  up for the partial inflation of the lungs, or the reception into them of air too
                  highly charged with the carbon exhaled from the lungs of the occupant of a close
                  room or a large assemblage in a public congregation.
               The lassitude and exhaustion so invariably consequent on these occasions, is
                  generally ascribed to weariness of the subject or simple fatigue, which, with
                  almost every one, signifies nothing beyond the simple word which expresses the
                  feeling. Now, let us for one moment examine the steps nature takes to restore us
                  after one of these periods of exhaustion. We do not desire quiet; on the contrary
                  relief is felt by walking. We cannot walk or use any of the muscles of the body,
                  without an increased supply of air. "Let me have a good sniff of the air," says
                  one. "How delightful is the glorious air," says another, &c., &c. Soon the
                  sense of muscular exhaustion vanishes, the headache departs, the ideas become
                  quicker, and the person, if he possessed an inventive or inquiring mind, would
                  have made a discovery of priceless value. He has only to reduce this little hint
                  to a system, and he would be saved many a headache and fit of indigestion; for the
                  want of air, though it first shows itself in the debility of the muscles, will
                     soon reach the stomach, bowels and
                  liver, and thus cut off the other great source of strength, viz. a wholesome
                  digestion. The person will become a dyspeptic.
               Hear Dr. Carpenter, the physiologist: "There can be no question that in the living
                  body, the energy of muscular contraction is determined by the supply of arterial
                  blood which the muscle receives. It is well known that when a ligature is applied
                  to a large artery in the human subject,, there is not only the deficiency of
                  sensibility in the surface, but also a partial or complete suspension of muscular
                  power, until the collateral circulation is established "—i. e. till
                  other small vessels coming off from the trunk that is tied beyond, or on the heart
                  side of the ligature, are forced to enlarge by the wants of the limb from which
                  the blood has been cut off, and by the action of the heart.
               The influence of this supply of arterial blood is twofold. It supplies material
                  for the nutrition of the tissues of the limb, to which the artery is distributed;
                  and it furnishes (what is, perhaps, more immediately necessary) the
                  supply of oxygen, required for that change in the tissue, which, doubtless,
                  accompanies every action of the body, and which is essential to the production of
                  its contractile force. "As all this oxygen is taken through the lungs, we should
                  expect to find a very close correspondence between the amount of muscular power
                  developed in an animal, and the quantity of oxygen consumed in its respiration."
                  All experience proves this. Look, for instance, at the inconceivable velocity of
                  movement in the wings of insects and birds; the bee and the mosquito—the
                  humming-bird and the sea-bird—which remain, with few intervals, for an entire day
                  on the wing! We know that they are rapid breathers, and we know that the muscles
                  could not move without a constant renovation by oxygen. Of course the supply must
                  be proportionate to the demand of their constant exertion. The heart itself, and
                  all the chief muscles of organic life, as well as the great circular muscles which
                  close the bowel and bladder, furnish two other examples of muscles in constant
                  action; and both equally dependent on a constant supply of blood; the former will
                  continue to move, and the latter to close the bowel, long after the muscles are
                  powerless from difficult breathing. This is a wise provision of nature,
                  originating in their greater irritability and capacity for stimulation, by blood
                  containing less oxygen; were they not so susceptible, often in cases of fainting,
                  the person would die, because the heart's action cannot be entirely intermitted
                  but a very few seconds, without imminent fear of death. Even in cases of
                  apparently profound fainting, there is yet a little motion, and nature, by
                  incapacitating the person from standing, gives the greatest facility for the blood
                  to resume its flow, and the heart its action, because blood can flow along a
                  horizontal tube, when, of course, it could not rise against its own gravity when
                  the person has fainted.
               We have only to study the results of the moral emotion, familiarly called "low
                  spirits," to see the influence of full inhalations on the heart's action. That
                  organ is immediately dependent on the blood for its stimulus to action, just in
                  proportion as the blood demands a rapid transmission through its four chambers, as
                  it passes through the lungs, precisely in proportion to the vigor of the heart's
                  contraction. It matters not whether the heart be deprived of blood from fainting,
                  or poisoned with carbon- in either case, it immediately responds to the unwonted
                  condition.
               Dr. Cartwright, of New Orleans, has lately been making some very remarkable
                  experiments on the alligator, to prove the lungs to be the true motor power of the
                  blood. They are of a most impressive character as detailed by him; but it seems to
                  us quite unnecessary to prove what no one, since the time Harvey discovered the
                  circulation of the blood, has denied—the lungs, of course, furnish the power of
                  the heart's action, by oxygenating its blood. By the power inherent in the heart, it will still continue to
                  contract, though more and more feebly for some time, even after the windpipe has
                  been tied; but, like a person deprived of food, it becomes weaker and weaker in
                  its pulsations, till death occurs from starvation.
               A good deal of speculation has been spent upon the comparative value, as a
                  stimulant to the action of the heart, of the nerve power, when compared to the
                  oxygen imparted by the lungs. Benjamin Brodie tried the experiment of tying all
                  the great blood-vessels of the neck in a dog, and then cutting off the head, so
                  that there could be no influence of the nerves of the brain, nor even of the
                  nerves of respiration, exerted on the lungs; nevertheless, this animal continued
                  to breathe for two hours and a half, under the process of artificial inflation of
                  the lungs with a bellows; so that it would seem that respiration was more
                  immediately important to life than the nerves themselves. Of course, the organic
                  nerves remained in this experiment, and the reader must remember that the heart
                  has inherent life, derived from the Great First Cause, whilst in the womb and long
                  before respiration can take place. It will, therefore, be remembered by the
                  unprofessional reader, that the blood itself must contain the only stimulus for
                  the heart's muscular action, before it becomes necessary for the movements of
                  independent life. The heart can receive no direct stimulus from the oxygen of the
                  air before birth, as the child when inclosed in the womb does not breathe at all;
                  it receives its oxygen and blood from the mother. It is only when increased motion
                  requires extra stimulation, that we are obliged to breathe rapidly, as can soon be
                  proved when we are compelled to flee from danger or pursuit.
               Here might come in legitimately the subject of alcoholic stimulation. Every
                  physiologist knows that fat and spiritous drinks afford hydrogen for the lungs,
                  and that gas, when associated with oxygen, forms the elements of the watery part
                  of the blood, without which none of the more solid constituents could circulate
                  throughout the body. We do not intend yet, however, to discuss the subject of
                  spirituous drinks. Enough has been thoughtlessly written on that subject, to
                  astonish the physiologist at the ignorance and boldness of the writers.
               Whoever ascends a hill without paying attention to his respiration, will find that
                  he will be fatigued in a precise ratio with the deficiency of air he allows
                  himself. In all the movements of mechanical life, and in running and swimming, the
                  same will be found to be the case. Partial respiration only admits the inflation
                  of the upper half, and perhaps a little more of each lung; while the whole of each
                  lobe was intended by nature to perform full duty, if the air-cells are not
                  compressed with tubercular matter deposited between them, or solidified by other
                  deposits from the blood, the result of neglected inflammation. It will, therefore,
                  most assuredly be found, that sedentary people, such as sewing men and women,
                  book-keepers, schoolmasters, and students, who are almost habitually poor
                  breathers, measure less around the lungs, and are far more easily fatigued, than
                  those whose avocations demand free exertions, more especially in the open air.
                  This is the secret of the benefit derived from riding on horseback and driving out
                  in the morning air when the person has breakfasted, and the surface of the body is
                  well protected, so as to diffuse the blood over the surface of the skin, and thus
                  avoid loading the internal organs with it. Our cunning friends of the water-cure
                  establishments well know this; some of them are wise enough to compel their
                  patients to run and go up hills; and some patients who have been advised by honest
                  physicians have had manly resolution enough to drive a cart or a stage-coach, and
                  thus have whipped up the waning life-powers, exhausted by confinement or
                  dissipation.
               Dr. James Stewart, the author of a beautiful little tract on Consumption, informed
                  me, that after his fortieth year, when
                  the bony framework of the body is usually supposed to be permanently set for life,
                  he increased the capacity of Ms chest over three inches, by forcing himself to
                  show to those patients whose lungs he was obliged to examine for life insurance,
                  what he meant by a full inspiration. The reader will observe that those whose
                  lives are to be insured, must have sound lungs as well as other organs; and if
                  they cannot inflate them fully, they are supposed to have disease, such as
                  tubercles, or else condensation of the substance of the luugs, called hepatization
                  (from HEPAR, the liver), because the lungs assume the solidity and appearance of
                  liver.
               Some fifteen years since, when attending a Dr. Sutherland of this city, then often
                  called "the breathing doctor," for a lingering consumptive affection, I witnessed
                  the surprising results of prolonged respiration, in a number of patients afflicted
                  with dyspepsia and numerous other complaints. Their sole treatment consisted in
                  passing a handkerchief about the lower portion of the chest, for no other earthly
                  reason than to convince them there was some peculiar art in the process; and then
                  slowly and fully inspiring air into the lungs, and as slowly expiring it. This
                  process was continued for several days, and the patient amused with the Doctor's
                  earnest conversation, and then dismissed, with instructions to continue the
                  process for several weeks, and to resume it whenever the unpleasant symptoms
                  returned. Hundreds have felt the benefit of this simple, yet most efficient
                  passive exercise. It is the sole explanation of Ram-mage's breathing tube, and
                  every other device of the kind 5 they are all money traps.
               And what does prolonged respiration do, but send an increased supply of the
                  life-force to every muscle in the body? What sustains the glorious eagle, as he
                  sails on unwearied wing, bathed with that ocean of life-giving force day after
                  day, even to a hundred years of existence? I stand upon the mountain top and shout
                  for freedom, 'mid the grand wild wind that wanders where it will. The air inspires
                  me; my muscles have gathered their life-force by the exertion; my perception of
                  God's goodness is quickened; and as I feel the warm current of life run through my
                  frame, my thoughts enlarge their sphere, my benevolence expands, and I scorn the
                  contemptible trickery of any profession, and wonder that one can be found so base
                  or so thoughtless as to oppose the instruction of the people in the laws that
                  govern their existence. Be strong, then, in mind and body; be strong; your
                     muscular contraction governed by air and the nerve-power, is the
                  great index of the human temperament. It is printed by the finger of God upon the
                  face of man, as the expression of his power over animate and inanimate nature. It
                  plows the ground; it builds the ship; it hurls back the oppressor. It yields up to
                  the physiognomist the covert purpose of the villain, as its tell-tale lines lurk
                  about the eye. It impresses the countenance of the upright man with his letter of
                  credit and bond of sympathy with his fellows. Its absence, also, is expressive. It
                  speaks to the lover the impression on the heart of his mistress. It tells the
                  mother's new-found life, when she hears the first cry of her infant. It assures us
                  of the Christian's hope when the lines of agony relax into peaceful radiance—as
                  the life-spark is restored to the great undiminished source whence it derived its
                  being.
            
            
               
               PATHOLOGY OF A LADY OF FASHION.
               
                  
                     "But aching head, though on a sofa, may I never feel."
                  
               
               BY pathology, we mean the systematized knowledge or science of disease. By a
                  fashionable lady, we mean a woman who has been brought up, and lives in, the
                  habits, practices, and pursuits of that portion of society, whose aim and end is
                  to please and be pleased. If a man and woman were in their right moral and mental
                  condition, to please and be pleased would be the true end of their existence; but
                  as mankind are not in their proper condition, their pleasures may be very
                  injurious.
               Health, whether of mind or body, consists in the complete soundness of the
                  organization, and the appropriate performance of the functions. A flaw or defect
                  in the one, or a failure in the other, is disease. As there are laws which, when
                  obeyed, produce health, so there are laws "which, when complied with, produce
                  disease. Fashion, which of all things may seem to be capricious and lawless, is
                  subject to, and educes laws, as certainly as any other phase of society.
               Every human being is possessed of a triple nature, and each part requires its own
                  culture and employment. The highest part is the spiritual, which gives the
                  feelings or intentions. The next part is the mental, which gives the ideas or
                  knowledge. The third part is the physical, the acting portion of our being. When
                  each of these parts is in order, health and happiness are the result. When one of
                  them is out of order, and still more, when all of them are, disease and misery are
                  the inevitable results.
               The first element of fashionable life is the negative one of abjuring all
                  labor—the abstinence from doing anything for subsistence or use. Thus a
                  fashionable lady would be ashamed to do anything in her kitchen-garden for the
                  purpose of producing food, as planting corn, sowing turnips, hoeing or weeding a
                  vegetable bed, or fruit-trees. She will attend to her flower-beds and
                  blossom-trees, and do as much work as if she were in her kitchen-garden; but it is
                  not accounted labor. There is no necessity to do it. It is
                  optional-fashionable.
               She would not for the world be known to do anything in her kitchen, because that
                  would be accounted labor-necessary work; but she would perform twice the quantity
                  of actual work, in the arrangement of her drawing-room or boudoir, because that is
                  entirely optional and conventional. To spend a day in the useful offices of
                  washing and ironing, would be death to her reputation; but to spend one-third of
                  every day in the fatigues of the toilette, would be a mat of course and
                  consequence.
               To be seen for a few hours in the occupation of shirt-making, or mending
                  stockings, would be an unspeakable disgrace; while to be engaged for weeks in
                  curious netting, working lace, or embroidering, would be matter of proud
                  satisfaction, and a laudable object of ambition. To paint, to color, or to
                  whitewash any part of her house, would be a degradation never to be recovered; but
                  to paint flowers or scenes, persons or places, would be an art sought after, with
                  the avidity and cupidity of a search for an El Dorado.
               Now, in all those employments which they disdain, there is a satisfaction in their
                  performance, which is a source of mental, moral, and physical health to millions;
                  while in the occupations which they adopt, there is an emptiness in their course
                  and a weariness and dissatisfaction at their end, which are a fruitful source of misery and disease
                  to thousands.
               We were consulted some time ago by an elegant lady of fashionable life, on account
                  of two of her beautiful daughters, who were as sylph-like and symmetric as fashion
                  could make them, but who showed too plainly that their forms and constitutions
                  were as frail as debility could mar them, without actually manifesting some
                  specific form of disease. "Oh, what shall I do for my beautiful girls!" exclaimed
                  the mother. "Give them strength." I replied. "And how shall that be done?" said
                  she. "Let them make their own beds, carry their water up stairs and down, and
                  sweep their own rooms, and perchance the parlor and drawing-room, go to market and
                  bring baskets of provisions home, garden, wash, and iron I "Looking at me with
                  surprise, she said, "What sort of minds would they have, what sort of bodies?" I
                  answered, "They would have as healthy and happy ones as your servants. You now
                  give all the health and happiness to your domestics. Be merciful to your
                  daughters, and let them have a share."
               Work, without useful aim or end, is not occupation, nor employment. When the
                  tread-mill was introduced as a mode of punishment, the wretched prisoners felt
                  themselves more degraded by "doing nothing," as they called it, than by their
                  crimes. How many ladies in fashionable life are doomed for years to feel the
                  bitterness of "doing nothing!" What wonder if they are nervous, irritable and
                  diseased. Useful work, or satisfactory employment, is as essential to the health
                  of the mind, as to that of the body.
               The first and strongest principle of our nature, is that of rectitude, or what
                  ought to be. Every human being is possessed of this lofty, but awful feeling—the
                  deep sense of rectitude or propriety. A feeling which is never satisfied, is a
                  perpetual source of misery, like hunger unappeased, or appetite uncatered for. Can
                  any woman, surveying her body, or considering her mind, seriously and
                  conscientiously conclude, that she is not called upon for any useful work, or
                  necessary contribution to society;' and that to be adorned and admired is all her
                  duty and her destiny? This would exclude her from the republic of mind and morals,
                  and class her with pet animals and flowers.
               The same error which leads her to avoid all the useful occupations, induces her to
                  escape all the useful pursuits. That sort of knowledge, which can be usefully
                  applied, and only usefully displayed, is an undesirable attainment in her
                  estimation; and therefore entirely neglected, or only so far sought as it may
                  subserve the end of her being—display. Science, therefore, or systematized
                  knowledge, is not any part of her desire.
               The employment of the intellect, without a satisfactory direction, is one of the
                  most common errors of the day. To obtain some knowledge of languages, without
                  making them available, as means of instruction and improvement; to acquire some
                  skill in music, without intending to employ it as an instrument of emotional
                  purity and elevation; to attain to excellence in the arts of drawing and painting,
                  without aiming to enrich our ideas and thoughts; to cultivate the powers of speech
                  and writing, without using them benevolently and didactically; and to move
                  elegantly and gracefully, without any other end or aim, than that of p [easing and
                  being pleased, are as unsatisfactory mental attainments and professions, as those
                  of conjuring and fortune-telling. None of them affords the mind the slightest
                  satisfaction on reflection.
               The mental pursuits, therefore, of a fashionable lady, however pleasant they may
                  be for the passing moments, have no satisfaction at their termination; and
                  although they may delude with the promise of hope, they conclude with the payment
                  of disappointment. Perhaps no pursuit is more vexatious than mere novel-reading.
                  There is rarely anything to comprehend,
                  but little to learn, and that often not worth the learning; plenty to enjoy while
                  reading, and an abundance to suffer when read.
               The minds and feelings of writers and readers of novels, are constantly upon the
                  rack. Silken, silver, or golden, it may be, but it is the rack, and minds that are
                  frequently racked, like bodies, are not capable of being in health. We never yet
                  knew or heard of a novelist, whether writer or reader, who was of healthy mind or
                  body. Nothing disqualifies any one so thoroughly for the enjoyments and duties of
                  the world in which we live, as the living in imagination in a world of an entirely
                  different sort. The world of fiction is as far off the world of fact as Jupiter is
                  from our planet.
               Now, those who thus artificially stimulate their minds and feelings,
                  preternaturally wear and weaken their brains and nerves, the organs of
                  sensibility, and become excitable, nervous and hysterical. They have been moved
                  until mobility, not stability, is the law of their being. An ordinary impression,
                  such as persons in good health and sense can easily employ, modify, or resist,
                  overpowers them, and throws them into fits, or paroxysms of extravagant and
                  uncontrollable emotion.
               Such persons are constantly disordered. Every change of temperature is to them an
                  endurance, equal to that of persons in health, passing from one zone or region to
                  another. The light of a bright sunny clay blinds them; darkness of a lowering
                  cloudy day, buries them. The misfit of a dress is "horrid," the inconvenience of
                  it is "dreadful." Plain, wholesome food is tasteless or distasteful. Everything,
                  except the most exciting food, is either insipid or nauseous. The ordinary
                  enjoyments of life are the dullest of all stupidities, and the ordinary
                  inconveniences and accidents of life are the most unendurable of miseries.
               The blood which flows to the brain, gives out the caloric of its composition in
                  the mode of galvanism, and it is either employed in the pursuits and occupations
                  life, or it accumulates and causes disease. If a lady living on tolerably
                  substantial food, do little or nothing with her brain, except receive a succession
                  of pleasing sensations, which require a very slight expenditure of the caloric of
                  the blood, commonly called "nervous fluid," she will undoubtedly suffer from what
                  are vulgarly designated "nervous headaches"—vapors and hysterics.
               The other organs of her body will suffer in like manner, if not properly employed.
                  There being little expenditure of the blood by the muscles and brain, the fresh
                  supplies from the stomach will be but slowly taken up, and the process of
                  digestion will be very tardily carried on; for, as in political economy, so also
                  in physiological economy, the supply will be regulated by the demand.
               Indigestion, therefore, or dyspepsia, is an almost necessary concomitant of
                  fashionable life, which is inevitably exposed to the evils of repletion and
                  inaction. Perhaps nothing is more distressing than dyspepsia. To have no appetite,
                  is almost equal in misery to having no desire; but, in addition to the privation
                  of appetite, there is the positive infliction of ill-assimilated chyle for the
                  renewal of the blood, and by consequence a defectively organized condition of the
                  blood, and degenerated sensation.
               For the same cause that the stomach is incapable of performing its functions
                  rightly, the liver, spleen and pancreas, and the whole length of the intestines,
                  are very liable to disease, yea, even the blood itself. Thus, every part of the
                  body may have the sensations deranged. In health, there is a general pleasantness
                  of feeling, or rather absence of feeling in the body, it being only an instrument
                  of feeling for the mind. In disease, there is a constant sense of uneasiness,
                  which makes us conscious of our organization—a feeling which often amounts to
                  intense agony.
               
               Some years ago, during an attack of epidemic influenza, we endured a species of
                  torment which was so entirely new to us, and so incomprehensible, as well as
                  inexplicable, that we could not solve the mystery of it, except by resorting to a
                  greater mystery—the malignant operation of evil spirits. The torment consisted in
                  the consciousness of motion and sensation in every portion of the brain. We felt
                  the circulation of the blood through the brain, as distinctly as we could feel the
                  twisting of a worm in our hand, or the crawling of an insect over our skin.
               An amiable and philosophic Methodist minister of our acquaintance was for some
                  time afflicted with this disorder, but in a more aggravated form every part of his
                  body being, in his own vivid and graphic words, "crawling and creeping alive." He
                  said, "I felt myself alive all over, and I often used to think that, let damnation
                  be what it might, nothing could exceed the horror of being conscious of our own
                  physical organization and functions, and the only proof to my own mind that I was
                  not damned, was, that I could pray."
               Now this is a feeling, or disorder, very commonly experienced by fashionable
                  ladies. Their blood is ill-assimilated and composed; their brain and nerves are
                  overcharged with their-unspent caloric, in the form of galvanism, rendering them
                  susceptible of the most complicated and acute sensations; and their disordered
                  minds, distractedly directing, not controlling, their disordered brains, they are
                  fearfully conscious of the ill-working of their organic machinery—miserably
                  sensitive in every part.
               In the most active, vivid, and creative state of the mind, we do not feel that we
                  have a mind. We feel power and energy, but not substance. When the brain is in a
                  good, healthy condition, the fit minister of the mind, there is no sensation of it
                  as an instrument or machine. We may feel a glow, a thrill, an elevation, a
                  grasping, or a soaring, but we do not feel a brain. The moment that we feel we
                  have a brain, we are conscious of weakness, disorder and disability.
               There are few fashionable ladies who are not miserably conscious of possessing not
                  only a brain, but various parts of it, as well as many organs of the body. How
                  constantly are they made sensible of the possession of a stomach, a liver, and
                  bowels, a heart, and lungs, of kidneys, a bladder, and a womb. How common is it
                  that they lead a life of miserable consciousness of being machines out of order,
                  and often incapable of rectification and adjustment.
               From these general conditions we may descend to particular ones, pointing out and
                  applying the principles and practices of fashion, and tracing the necessary
                  results. Thus the load of hair which is often worn, and the tightness with which
                  it is arranged, becomes a frequent source of most distressing pains in the head,
                  which are usually set down to rheumatism. The most ridiculous freak with regard to
                  the hair, was that of shaving it off, to make an artificially high forehead. Some
                  of the weaker of the sex found, to their dismay, in place of a pale intellectual
                  forehead, a dark unfeminine beard—one of the last objects on a woman to attract
                  the admiration of man, which most undoubtedly was the intention.
               The exposure of the neck and chest, so common in the ranks of fashion, is as
                  injurious to the health of the body as to the purity of the soul Diseases of the
                  throat, the lungs, and the heart, are the necessary consequences, and thousands of
                  the fairest of the fair are annually the victims of consumption from this cause
                  alone. The joints and muscles of the spine are carefully preserved from every kind
                  of laborious exercise, and thus, the circulation in them is very weak and scanty.
                  This leads to diseases and distortions of the spine, crooked shoulders, and
                  unequal hips.
               The practice of tight-lacing, or dressing, obstructs the circulation in the
                  muscles, and thus hinders their growth and development. The consequence of this is, that the whole of the trunk is weak,
                  requiring support, and liable to give way upon being exposed to the ordinary
                  endurances of domestic life. The occasional exhausting activity of a ball night,
                  whatever it may do for the muscles of the legs, is of no service to those of the
                  body. If they had their liberty, an occasional dance might do them good, but to
                  exercise them in whalebone fetters is as absurd and cruel as to set prisoners to
                  dance in their manacles of iron.
               To diminish the space for the movement of the lungs, is to deprive them of a part
                  of their function. Their office is to convert the blood returned from the veins,
                  and the newly assimilated food from the stomach, into arterial blood. This is done
                  by exposing small portions of blood at a time in very minute and exceedingly
                  attenuated vessels, spread over large surfaces in the lungs, to the action of the
                  atmosphere, A portion of the combustible materials of the blood chemically
                  combines with the combusting portion of the atmosphere, and sets free a large
                  amount of caloric, which combines with the blood, and gives it the property which
                  is called vitality.
               If the lungs are prevented from spreading out their surfaces to the action of the
                  air, less of good blood is made than is required for the purposes of life, and the
                  whole of the organization becomes feeble, and the functions defective. Those
                  portions of the lungs which are obstructed in their functions, become debilitated
                  and absorbed. There is therefore less lung than is natural, and that is diseased.
                  Hence there is a sufficient foundation laid for the supervention of consumption,
                  dropsy, and diseases of the heart and lungs.
               If the lungs have not room enough to play, they will force other organs out of
                  their place in their efforts to obtain it. The heart, deprived of comfortable
                  space for its movements, will palpitate, and be irregular in its action, and
                  diseased in its substance. The stomach will be pressed down out of its place by
                  the force of the superincumbent diaphragm, and the substance of the organ
                  diseased, while its function of digestion will be disturbed. Indeed the whole of
                  the viscera of the abdomen will be pressed out of place, and disturbed more or
                  less.
               There are, however, two parts toward which the pressure is usually most
                  injuriously directed—the womb, and the last portion of the bowel. The cavity in
                  which these organs are placed, is covered in with muscles, which are capable of,
                  and intended for, contracting and dilating. They resist pressure to a certain
                  extent, but after that they give way and stretch, losing their elasticity. Is it
                  extraordinary that so many cases of prolapsus of the uterus and rectum should
                  occur? A fashionable pair of corsets will add to the weight of resistance in the
                  abdomen from ten to thirty pounds: what wonder if something give way? It would be
                  a wonder if something do not.
               We cannot now consider the point of beauty involved in this matter; but we merely
                  remark, in passing, that the laws of beauty are laws of nature—that is, of the God
                  of nature—and not of man; and that these laws are, and must be in harmony with all
                  other laws of nature. The very foundation of all science and philosophy most
                  rigorously insists upon this harmony. It is the principle which guides us in our
                  search for facts and truths. There is therefore no room for the argument, that the
                  beauty of woman requires this pressure; for this is to pass by unheeded the great
                  principle, that we are to learn from nature, not to teach her.
               We may now point out some of the many reasons why a fashionable woman suffers so
                  much more than a woman in the state of nature, in her conditions of wife and
                  mother. A fashionable woman cannot have her maternal organs in a state of health,
                  and therefore all the functions appertaining to those modes of her existence, will
                  necessarily be accompanied with inconvenience and pain. The functions of gestation, parturition, and lactation,
                  are performed with debilitated and diseased organs; and, from the necessity of the
                  case, must be disordered and disturbed.
               From our remarks in the previous part of this article, it will be perceived, that
                  in those ladies who lead a fashionable life, the sensibility and excitability of
                  every part is increased while the control over it is diminished. Thus, every
                  function which is not necessary to life, may depart from its normal condition to
                  an unknown extent, multiplying and complicating the derangements of the whole, by
                  the derangements of each, until reduction and restoration to order are improbable,
                  if not impossible. The remedies of medicine in such a case, like the ordinances of
                  a municipality in the case of a country in a state of revolution, are too local
                  and inefficient for the occasion. The whole condition and constitution need
                  revision and renewal
               The slightest acquaintance with the condition of persons in fashionable life,
                  brings to our knowledge one of the greatest sources of misery with which they are
                  afflicted, that of constipation of the bowels. As a cause and a consequence of
                  disease, it is dreaded as much as it is endured. It is the ruin of many
                  constitutions, families, and incomes, while it is the source of fortune to the
                  pill-venders and medicine-men. This stream of misery turns the wheels of Fortune's
                  golden manufactory for quacks and routinists, furnishing continual occasion for
                  meddling with the doings of nature by those who think themselves entitled to be
                  her directors and dictators.
               The function of the bowels, like that of every other organ, depends upon the
                  circulation; and as this is a function of the blood-vessels, entirely involuntary,
                  it might be supposed that we have no voluntary control over the function of the
                  bowels. But we find that our voluntary actions have almost as much effect upon our
                  involuntary functions, as though they were under our immediate control. Those
                  persons sons who work and walk much in the open air, are rarely, if ever,
                  constipated; while those who lead formal and sedentary lives are rarely, if ever,
                  free from constipation.
               The function of the bowels is two-fold—chemical and mechanical—yet both depend
                  upon the same agent for their performance-caloric; and both depend upon the same
                  "source of caloric—the blood; and the same mode of obtaining it from that
                  source—the circulation. Whatever therefore increases the circulation of the blood
                  in the bowels, assists their function; whatever diminishes the circulation,
                  obstructs it. Every time that a muscle is contracted, the circulation of the blood
                  is quickened, and the number and size of the blood-vessels increased.
               The performance of the ordinary work of a house, requiring the frequent, if not
                  almost the constant contraction of some of the muscles of the trunk, pressing upon
                  the bowels, "is one of the most certain means of procuring a good circulation in
                  the bowels, and therefore of securing a proper performance of their function.
                  Brisk walking and running, which require great action of the abdominal muscles,
                  are serviceable from this cause, as well as from the increased action of the
                  lungs, causing a greater general circulation.
               A fashionable lady is obliged to sit stiffly, and as still as possible, for
                  elegance and effect. She may not walk fast, much less run—that would be vulgar.
                  She may not work—that would be degrading. Her bowels must be externally
                  compressed, and kept as much as possible at rest for appearance. They are
                  generally kept warm enough to preserve their h(eat, and often much too warm for
                  their health for, to keep any part so warm that it cannot give off caloric, is to
                  prevent circulation and life. This is the cause of disease and death, in hot
                  climates and seasons.
               A fashionable lady must necessarily be constipated, and of course have a poor and
                  fickle appetite. She takes a great deal of nauseous medicine, and has a
                     disagreeable odor emitted from her
                  stomach, lungs, and skin; for if her intestines do not perform their function
                  properly, the stomach, lungs, skin, and bladder have to perform a part of it, in
                  order to maintain life, and preserve as much of health as possible. The
                  kitchen-maid and cook may have fine forms, agreeable skins and breath, and good
                  health, while their mistress and her daughters are deprived of them all.
               Fashion is a deviation from the laws of health; and those who will be votaries of
                  fashion, must endure the penalties of her offences. The highest refinement of
                  cultivation does not necessarily require the omission of one of the laws of
                  health, nor the commission of one of the sins of disease. The most cultivated
                  intellect, the most refined manners, and the most thoroughly elegant person, may
                  be compatible, and are, frequently, with excellent health.
               Sad indeed would be our condition if the progress of civilization, the improvement
                  of manners, and the elevation of character, were to be obtained only at the
                  enormous cost of our health. The laws of our bodies are a part of the great
                  system, which secures the good of the whole by the good of each part. If we cannot
                  act in harmony with universal nature, we shall inevitably be entangled in some, of
                  her omnipotent machinery, and be injured, if not destroyed.
               A penalty implies an offense. Suffering is the proof, the demonstration of the
                  commission of sin. If fashion inevitably entails suffering, then does it prove
                  itself to be an offense. Were it not for the diseases produced by the practices
                  and customs of fashion, the great proportion of medical men would have nothing to
                  live on, and perhaps nothing to do. A nervous and irritable lady, who can and does
                  pay for medical attendance, may be worth from one to five hundred dollars a year
                  to the profession. She is always ailing, incapable of being cured, susceptible of
                  relief in various ways, and most unfortunately desirous of it. A skillful quack,
                  regular or irregular, is the most suitable person to attend her, for science and
                  philosophy do not suit her, and suited she must be. Happily for her, there are
                  fashionable doctors as well as fashionable ladies.
            
            
               
               SCENES IN THE CABIN AND THE CHURCHYARD.
               THE OLD MAN AND HIS DARLINGS.
               SOLEMNLY, very solemnly did the tolling bell warn us of our approach to the old
                  churchyard of ——, long before we emerged in the poor little rustic wagon from the
                  forest road that led to it, from the humble cottage whence we had brought all that
                  remained of the innocent and lovely M——. The poor old childless and widowed
                  grandfather rested his aged head on my shoulder, and never since God gave me
                  breath have I felt the awful solemnity of my profession as I did that day. I had
                  been summoned from the city to visit the poor young girl by a medical friend whose
                  confidence I enjoyed from having performed several operations on his patients, and
                  as my practice was then limited, I willingly yielded to my feelings and remained
                  with her till the last sigh escaped her guileless bosom, and with the hand of her
                  only protector on her forehead, she breathed her last at midnight, in the lovely
                  month of June, 1839. Wretchedly poor, she had sustained her poor old grandfather
                  by her labor in a neighboring mill. The terrific force sometimes attained by the
                  over-wrought machinery, caused a great stone to fly asunder by its centrifugal
                  action, and a fragment striking her on the breast, injured the internal organs so
                  fatally, that she died in spite of the earnest efforts of her excellent physician
                  and his friends. I found him affected even to tears at her bedside as he related
                  to me the case, surrounded with three of his intimate friends, one of them from a
                  distance of twenty miles, and that, too, his third visit to the house of a pauper!
                  Such acts make us proud of our profession. I made up my mind to remain till all
                  danger was over, or death had rendered our efforts of no, further use.
               Our poor patient, but sixteen years of age, was a beautiful girl, the child of
                  sorrow and shame. Her mother, a simple country creature, the old man's only
                  daughter, fell a victim to the arts of a village monster, who had been in
                  consequence obliged to leave the town, and was at the time of her death an
                  attendant on a gambling hell in our city. We were now about to place the body of
                  her child by the side of his victim, who sank some years before under the finger
                  of unchristian scorn continually pointed at her by the village righteous, with the
                  precept of Christ before them, "Let him who is without sin cast the first stone."
                  It was supposed by the medical gentleman who called me, that the extraordinary
                  operation of elevating the breast-bone by means of the trephine, would relieve the
                  terrible oppression of respiration, and afford room for the laboring heart and
                  lungs to resume their natural movements. Her condition, however, was so low, that
                  she expired before we could sufficiently elevate the circulation by wine to
                  continue our efforts. Some spiculæ of bone were immediately removed on nay
                  arrival, but she bore it so ill, that further explorations were omitted till next
                  day: that night she died; but I have no reason whatever to suppose an operation
                  could have relieved her; the blow was too violent, and had doubtless produced
                  injuries internally too serious for nature and art united to overcome.
               We are often charged as a body with too light an estimate of religious devotion. I
                  know not, however, where the man can be found in our profession, who could have
                  listened to the prayer of that poor old white-headed man of nearly years, as he
                  knelt in the only room, of their little cabin, and implored of Heaven to save him his
                  darling, the only tie that bound him to earth: "O thou who didst raise the widow's
                  son—thou who didst anoint the eyes of the blind man and give him sight, look down
                  from thy throne upon the wretched creature who ventures to implore thee, and upon
                  thy servants, who would not, O Heavenly Father, oppose thy righteous purpose; yet,
                  0 God, most holy, must merciful, if it be consistent with thy blessed will, save
                  me that poor child of sorrow, even her at whom, like Mary Magdalen, the finger of
                  scorn was pointed, for the sins of one who is, I trust, in heaven;—for she was
                  kind to us all, and injured no one but herself." Here a burst of tears choked his
                  voice, which was unusually clear for his age. We were all of us unmanned, and that
                  night we prayed in spirit if not in words; but our efforts availed not, and it was
                  destined by Heaven that the poor old man should finish his journey alone.
               It was touching, after the simple prayer had been pronounced, to see the old man,
                  as his thin and snowy locks swayed gently in the evening breeze, quietly measure
                  with his staff the distance between the newly-made grave and the next one, whose
                  verdure alone—for it was marked by no stone—told that it long since received its
                  occupant. Alas! her only memorial was her shame and the love of an old father. He
                  looked expressively at the old sexton as he took him by the hand and thanked him;
                  't was all he had to give, even had not his old friend's tears assured him no
                  other gift would have been acceptable. "You will put me there, Joe, will you?"
                  said he. "God knows whether I will live to do it, but our friend will see to it,"
                  he replied, putting his hand on the shoulder of the good young clergyman, whose
                  face attested the excellence of his heart. The old sexton, however, performed the
                  same service for his schoolmate that he had for his children; and now, if he could
                  stretch out his arms, he might embrace both his darlings.

               NATURE OF CONSUMPTION.
               EXERCISE IS LIFE—INDOLENCE IS DEATH.
               FROM what point shall we start in this attempt to convey the idea of Consumption,
                  where all is darkness to the general reader? How shall we attempt to enlighten
                  him? Almost every one is quite satisfied, that pulmonary or lung consumption is
                  the result of a common catarrh or cold; and that to neglect that affection when of
                  an obstinate character, is to run the imminent hazard of consumption; and yet,
                  that is very rarely, though sometimes, its exciting cause,—we had almost said,
                  never its originating one.
               Reader, we will assure you, even at the hazard of incurring your displeasure for
                  seeming rudeness, that your own views of these matters, unless derived from
                  patient thought, and the most comprehensive and philosophical observation of the
                  other living animals that surround you, are worse than useless; they originate in
                  self-esteem and pride of opinion, and prevent your acquiring that knowledge that
                  can prolong your existence, by attending to the demands of nature.
               Your natural and unperverted instincts are constantly endeavoring to convince you
                  of the nature of your affliction, and the only means of combating it. Conceit and
                  physic, from the hands of some ignorant doctor, or designing empiric,
                     will destroy you—air, warmth, nutritious food, water, and
                  exercise, may save you.
               Suppose we succeed in showing you that there is particular constitution of body, where a tendency
                  to consumption is born with the child, and is almost absolutely certain to be
                  developed and destroy him, under a proper combination of circumstances? Suppose,
                  moreover, we show from extensive observation and evidence, that if we can change
                  these circumstances we may actually control the disease, and keep it at bay, till
                  not unfrequently the person dies at an advanced life—will not this be a point
                  worth striving for? Come with us then, reader—read slowly and thoughtfully, and we
                  hope to convince you of the utility of attending to the philosophy of your daily
                  life, more especially if you are threatened with this dreadful disease, so
                  hopelessly incurable with medicine.
               What is the first want we experience in our entrance into this world? Is it not
                  air? What the last? Is it not the same? What is the second want of our independent
                  existence? It is not food? For surely a vigorous infant would survive many hours
                  without it—but leave it exposed to the cold air without sufficient protection, and
                  it would soon die.
               It is air then first, warmth next, and food and sleep last; water it imbibes with
                  its mother's milk. It is a deficiency of air, warmth, and food, that causes the
                  development of scrofula, which is the other term for pulmonary or tubercular
                  consumption. This we shall proceed to prove from a few of the best authorities,
                  and what is much better, from the reader's own observation.
               Before we go further, we would remark, that your child, or yourself, may seem to
                  your own judgment, to possess in abundance all these requisites, and yet be
                  afflicted with scrofula in some part of the system, or perhaps with tubercular
                  consumption. Alas! that we should have occasion to remind you of that subduing and
                  sad thought, "the sins of the parents descend to the third and fourth generation."
                  Hereditary disease is acknowledged by all as the great curse of the human family.
                  Though surrounded with pure air and wholesome food, your lungs, from some organic
                  defect, or from some vice of early education or dress, may have been so long
                  crippled, that they cannot receive enough of air to build up the body with its
                  intended power. The stomach, likewise, may have suffered from, the incapacity of
                  the lungs to keep it in health, and from improper indulgence—and so it also
                  becomes a disabled organ. Thus the very material of which the body is made, cannot
                  be digested in quantity and variety sufficient for repairing its daily waste or
                  its diseases, or for transmitting health to your posterity.
               If breath and food, the actual fuel of the system, be thus deficient, the energy
                  of your nervous system will be impaired, the heart will refuse to contract with
                  sufficient power to drive on your impoverished blood, and deposits of tubercular
                  or scrofulous matter may form in the bones, lungs, or some other parts of the
                  body; in short, bring you into the first stage of consumption.
               We have said that our first and last want is air: which of us acts as though he
                  realized it? No sooner does an infant make its appearance in the world, than the
                  very first act of an ignorant nurse lays the foundation of an evil of the greatest
                  consequence. If not bandaged to its very throat, its viscera are at all events so
                  compressed as to cripple its lungs, by preventing the descent of its diaphragm.
                  Its very first act—to cry—shows its great first and last want; its persecutor does
                  her utmost to deprive it of the very pabulum of its existence! What is more common
                  than to cover the head of an infant? Of course it must breathe over and over again
                  the poisonous carbonic acid it has just thrown out of its lungs!
               Within a few days we have been assured by a stupid nurse, that crackers boiled in
                  milk were the proper nourishment for every child! She was strongly supported by a
                     near relative, and we believe nothing
                  is more common out of the very highest circle of intelligence. What must follow,
                  but a struggle for life against the most barbarous ignorance?
               When we pass in review all the lower tribes of animals, from the oyster and snail,
                  whose temperature is only 55 degrees, and are nourished with white blood or
                  albumen, upward to those which circulate red blood, it is shown conclusively that
                  the temperature, red globules of the blood, and muscular fibre, all increase in
                  proportion to the powers of respiration and motion.
               Birds that fly rapidly have great heat, and respire freely. Ducks and geese have a
                  temperature of 100 degrees to 107 degrees. The gull and swallow 111½ degrees. In
                  proportion, the lungs of these animals are much larger than those of man;
                  consequently his respiration and temperature are proportionally less. The heat of
                  man is 97 degrees, while that of nearly all other red-blooded animals is four or
                  five degrees higher.
               To show that exercise increases our temperature, it is observed that a man when
                  asleep respires less frequently than when awake. The thermometer proves
                  his-temperature to be 95 degrees, or two degrees lower; hence it is dangerous for
                  invalids to sleep too lightly clothed, and this is the reason why cholera and
                  pleurisies and inflammation of the lungs often attack people while asleep; at four
                  o'clock in the morning the temperature of the body falls from 3° to 4°.
               All animals that breathe strongly are more highly organized—that is to say, they
                  have more blood-vessels; their flesh also is more nutritious as food.
               ALBUMEN is the most simple of all animal material, and all our food is reduced, by
                  the wonderful power of the stomach, to that substance, whether we eat vegetable or
                  animal food. The young animal of every species, however highly organized after
                  birth, consists while within the womb, mostly of albumen. The egg of which the
                  chick is formed, contains little else, both the white and york being of that
                  substance. All the larva of insects, and all crawling animals, such as turtles,
                  lizards, frogs, that use little motion, consist almost entirely of albumen—showing
                  conclusively a simpler form of organization.
               Let us explain all this. The serum or watery-looking part of the blood that rises
                  in the bowl when a person is bled, is composed almost entirely of albumen: in
                  consequence of its greater thinness, it can circulate in smaller vessels, and
                  nourish parts where red blood, which consists of fibrin and red globules, cannot
                  go. For instance, the latter could not go over the front of the eye or cornea, or
                  in the white membranes or tendons: if it did it would obscure the sight, and
                  probably not suit the free motion of the tendons, or too readily admit of
                  inflammation, and thus make them immovable, by causing them to adhere to the
                  surrounding parts. Now the reader will please remember that albumen is the sole
                  product of digestion; that it goes into the blood as albumen, and can only be
                  changed from that state, by passing through the lungs—this it begins to do
                  immediately. A great vessel appropriated solely to it, gathers it up from the
                  intestine just below the stomach, and conveys it into a vein on the left side of
                  the neck: it is not yet red like blood, but creamy and white; it passes at once
                  into the vein, and mingles with the red blood which has been circulating through
                  the lungs and body. In a few minutes it has passed through the lungs, and been
                  subjected to the action of the air, and is then rapidly becoming FIBRIN, or the
                  material of which muscle or red flesh is composed. When the young animal is born,
                  its muscles are pale; as it gains strength and breathes more freely; its motions
                  increase, and they become red.
               Muscles are the red flesh of animals; they are formed of this more highly vitalized albumen, and it is now
                  called FIBRIN. The muscles are attached to the bones, and having powers of
                  contraction precisely in proportion to the breathing and exercise used, cause a
                  man to be considered strong or weak.
               The heart is a muscle as well as the calf of the leg; one moves without the will,
                  the other is obedient to it. We have said that muscles move the bones in all the
                  motions we perform; they do, and they likewise raise up the ribs, being subject to
                  act both with and without our will; thus they cause the air to rush in the lungs;
                  free motion demands free respiration, which demands nourishing food; the breath
                  and the food are the fuel, and cause animal heat; HEAT AND MOTION ARE LIFE; QUIET
                  AND COLD ARE DEATH; EXERCISE PRODUCES FIBRINE; INDOLENCE ALBUMEN.
               All animals that breathe largely, have a more complex set of ribs than the
                  inferior tribes. Most of these have no ribs. Man has twelve pairs, the ox
                  thirteen, the horse eighteen, the elephant twenty; their food being vegetable,
                  they require complex organs, both of digestion and respiration, to sustain them in
                  their labor, and increase their fibrine.
               Let us now return to oysters and snails, that are nourished with albumen. But what
                  has all this to do with the formation of tubercular consumption, or scrofula?
                  Simply this: tubercles are composed entirely of albumen, and so are scrofular
                  swellings and tumors of the neck, sometimes called king's evil; caries of the
                  vertebrae or back bone in children, called spine disease, and white swellings of
                  the knee, as well as tubercular consumption, all are caused by deposits of albumen
                  from the blood, in consequence of deficient exercise and breathing. They are all
                  one and the same disease.
               Remember, reader, it is the nature of an oyster or snail to circulate albumen; it
                  is its proper blood; but the more highly organized animals must have a large
                  portion of fibrin to form their muscle or red flesh, as well as their proper
                  amount of albumen to nourish the white tissues.
               It is health in one, disease in the other. Why it should so often select the
                  lungs, bowels, bones, and the surface of the inner lining of the abdomen, to be
                  deposited in the form of tubercles, we do not know; but we trust you will now see
                  the necessity of extended observation throughout the various tribes of nature's
                  kingdom, before venturing to form an opinion, and the immensely important
                  consequence of attending to your natural instincts. Indolence is a perversion of a
                  natural instinct. Man should not imitate an oyster or a snail.
               We have said that consumption often descends to the children from the parents.
                  Many parents marry when actually in the first stage of consumption. We have often
                  every reason to believe, that a single year after marriage will circumscribe the
                  existence of one of the parties; yet this is no hindrance to the production of
                  offspring; of course, that offspring must actually have tubercular formations in
                  some part of the body, or be so thoroughly predisposed to them, that it is sure to
                  die, either of consumptive disease of the spine, bowels, or brain. Infants rarely
                  die of actual lung consumption; the taint derived from the parents shows itself in
                  them mostly in spinal disease, or what is far more frequent, disease of the brain
                  or bowels. The two latter are fortunately a great outlet of life for these
                  diseased little creatures. We hope to be understood in thus expressing ourselves.
                  If the lamentable ignorance of physiology permits the parents to marry, surely
                  nature is merciful in cutting short the lives of as many of these diseased
                  children as possible.
               Tubercles are small masses of an irregular shape and size, varying from a millet
                  seed to a buck shot, and even larger;
                  they are very like cheese in appearance, and are mostly produced in consumption of
                  the lungs, in the upper parts of these bodies, directly under the collar—bone.
                  They are not organized—that is to say, no blood-vessels can be traced into them.
                  They are scattered about single and in groups, and are as foreign to all the uses
                  of the lungs as so many gravel-stones. When nature will endure
                  them no longer, the parts around and about them inflame, matter
                     is formed, and then the tubercles being loosened, they are
                  coughed up through the windpipe; a person thus situated is in the second or
                  suppurating stage of consumption. The common belief is that he is rarely cured;
                  but we believe if attentive to his natural instincts, he would often recover.
                  Medicine and the lancet will destroy the only means he possesses of healing the
                  cavities left when the tubercles are coughed up. Exercise, warmth, and food will
                  often cure them, as we know by observation.
               It is a remarkable fact, that many of the wild animals, when reduced to
                  confinement, die of consumption; thus illustrating and proving that great point we
                  wish to impress upon the reader.
               The keepers of menageries inform us that lions, monkeys, and parrots often die of
                  consumption, and when examined show tubercles in their lungs.
               Mr. Youatt, in his work on cattle, gives the following account of the cause of
                  this disease: There is one striking fact, showing the injurious effect of heated
                  and poisoned air on the pulmonary system. There are cow-houses in which the heat
                  is intense, and the inmates are often in a state of profuse perspiration. The
                  doors and windows must be sometimes opened, and the wind blows in cold enough upon
                  those that are close to them, and one would naturally think could not fail to be
                  injurious. No such thing. Those are the animals that escape; but the others at the
                  further end, and on whom no wind blows, and where no perspiration is checked, are
                  the first to have inflammation and consumption."
               Mr. Youatt might have added, that we often have these tubercles served up on our
                  tables. The flesh of these animals is frequently exposed in. our markets as prime
                  beef. Tubercles, when not suppurating, seem to have little effect in preventing
                  the fattening of cattle. We likewise eat them in solution in our puddings, and
                  feed them to our; children in the swill milk with which our city is so well
                  supplied.
               The ourang outang died a few years since in this city, of consumption. Horses have
                  it; it is called farcy—with fowls, the pip.
               We had occasion to observe some years since, the great frequency of scrofula, and
                  particularly its obstinate attacks on the eyelids, in the children of the House of
                  Refuge in this city; the sleeping apartments of that institution were not properly
                  ventilated, and nothing could be done with those afflicted until the patients were
                  removed into an airy hospital, and allowed a generous diet.
               Enlarged tonsils are often of scrofulous origin; we have often been obliged to
                  remove them in patients with diseased lungs, because of the great difficulty they
                  caused in breathing. A low, humid situation, bad and watery diet, with little beef
                  or mutton, weary and monotonous employment, such as sewing, which deprives the
                  poor girl of fresh air, and keeps the body in a bent position, thus also checking
                  the free circuation, all produce scrofula and consumption.
               Who that has a heart to feel and a head to judge, but must be convinced, when
                  considering the condition of these poor girls, as well as those employed in
                  factories, and quite satisfied of the shocking results of weary and monotonous
                  labor-in the stifling atmosphere of a Lowell factory, for instance? It may be
                  desirable, as the political economists
                  tell us, for reasons possibly very convincing to themselves, but God knows it is
                  very opposite to the natural desires; we can hardly think that a woman's qualities
                  as wife or mother could be improved by such exercise.
               Some years since, on a visit to Lowell, we were struck with the unmistakable
                  evidence of scrofular and uterine disease in the faces of the factory inmates.
                  There was scarcely a healthy face there. It is quite sickening to read the
                  falsehoods we often see in print, respecting their ruddy complexions.
               There is still a relic of barbarism in use by American women—although we are happy
                  to see some of the more highly educated repudiate it—we mean the corset, which has
                  done much, we believe, to increase consumption. In a lecture delivered some
                  eighteen years since on this subject, we find an expression of our feelings, which
                  we have had no occasion to alter, from the observation of later years. "The lungs
                  are the very citadel of life, and on their freedom of action and integrity depends
                  the full development of the functions of the future woman. How absurd, then, to
                  begin in the very dawn of existence to incapacitate them for the fulfillment of
                  their functions, to prevent their expansion, to shut out the very breath of life,
                  that gives development and symmetry to the whole figure! Monstrous, barbarous
                  ignorance!"
               Look at nature as spread out before your view over the whole universe; look at her
                  thousand tribes of ever-moving, changing life; behold them in their varied states
                  of action and repose; the birds of the air, the lambs that skip over the verdant
                  meadow. Has she ever been known to oppose an obstacle to the fulfillment of her
                  ends? Could the eagle soar to the clouds, or the lark sing his matin lay, if the
                  great process of life's renovation was checked within them?
               We know that their muscular energy, their power of rising in air, depends upon
                  their perfect freedom of respiration. The means of escaping pursuit, of obtaining
                  food, is never denied them. We alone, with our high powers of reason, reserve to
                  ourselves the skill of improving the forms of nature.
               More by far than personal consequences follow this mighty evil; posterity has
                  suffered; the mind of the rising generation, depending on its physical strength,
                  must continue to suffer; the children of weak and unhealthy parents, if they
                  survive childhood, have the seeds of tubercular disease within them. If their
                  early years should be spent under very questionable subjection to medical regimen,
                  should they chance to survive adolescence, where is their experience of life? That
                  predominance of the nervous system always visible in those whose early years have
                  been spent entirely within doors, fostered by an education derived mostly from
                  that mass of contemptible, filthy, and licentious trash, called the light
                  literature of the day, has totally cut off all experience of true life, all
                  knowledge of useful facts? The aching head, the prostrated body, are not capable
                  of acquiring judgment or expansion. Do we talk of beauty? I appeal to sculpture.
                  The forms of classic art are the reverse of modern deformity. Not a modern shape
                  is to be seen in all the sculpture of Italy. Graceful carriage? It is a union of
                  delicacy and strength; the limbs are planted firmly in the successive steps, the
                  chest expands freely, the head is erect, the eyes on a level with the horizon, and
                  often elevated to the heavens. Is this a picture of life in the Broadway? The
                  tottering step, the panting or suppressed respiration, the immovable chest, the
                  downcast lids—are they not visible wherever we turn our eyes? God forbid that the
                  future generation of our country should inherit the taste of the present age; we
                  should fear the event of another
                  revolution. We had intended to refer in this article to the proper method of
                  inhaling those remedies that are known to alleviate the symptoms of consumption.
                  Some very extraordinary results have certainly been attained by that process, and
                  we doubt not that those who are capable of receiving any benefit from medicine,
                  would find it with far greater certainty by that method, than by poisoning the
                  stomach and injuring the digestion, thus destroying the powers of that great
                  conservative organ which is, next to the lungs, the great source of life.
            
            
               SCENES IN SOUTHERN PRACTICE.
               KING DEATH IN HIS YELLOW ROBE—THE PROUD MERCHANT—THE LOVELY CREOLE
                  WIFE.
               THE days were very beautiful, though intensely hot, and the sun-dried air brought
                  but little refreshment as it came sweeping off broad gulf and bay. It had not
                  rained for forty days! God help the fever-sick! Green leaf of plant and tree was
                  scathed—the ground cracked open, and became an ashy dust, that rose whirlwind high
                  in the parched air—and the little birds no longer sang, for there was no early
                  morning dew to sparkle, and bid welcome to the great red sun. Vegetable and animal
                  life were oppressed; plant-sap and blood were dried up by that fevered
                  atmosphere.
               Is there any one who passed through this dreadful season of 39, that will cease to
                  remember it? Will he forget the weakening nights, the scorching days, and hub-high
                  dust to graveyard, where coffins of unburied dead lay in offensive heaps, awaiting
                  the time when officials and friends could find strength and heart to hide them in
                  the yet undug earth? To the piny woods ran some—to the gulf and bay shore, to the
                  north, to the highland plantations, fled others, in hopes of escaping the dread
                  fever-pestilence that mowed them down like cannon.
               When the frost came, some returned to tell how others, had died when
                  not far on their flight; and how others,
                  whose safety seemed secured, had hid within them the seeds of the plague, and died
                  most miserably, untented and unhoused.
               Some, when the fever first broke out, shut up their houses, and departed
                  immediately, whilst others remained, hoping it would not rage high, and that
                     they would escape. But in a few days such hopes were blighted, for
                  all were fast losing relatives and friends. Young and old, new comer and the
                  native, alike fell before the increasing pestilence. Some scarce lived six hours
                  from the invasion! In the night before, perhaps, they had made merry with their
                  friends—had carelessly passed the jest, that whoever died the others would bury;
                  and before the second night had come, their sportive speech was verified! In one
                  instance, five had so merrily jested; on the fifth day but one remained to tell
                  the tale. Where some two lived together, their friends, alarmed at seeing the
                  windows remaining closed, would enter, and find the work of death was doing, or
                  had been done.
               Life seemed a sport! The wine-cup or card-table was sought to drown harrowing
                  care; and many died in rooms in which the grossest dissipation was entered into,
                  to drive away the horrors of the scene.
               With many others I had fled to P——, near the gulf, where a beautiful bay, on the
                  shores of which the hotel was situated, offered both amusement and security. The
                  rainless days and dewless nights were rapidly drying up all signs of vegetation;
                  here and there the wide-spreading bay tree remained triumphant in dark green leaf,
                  whilst the tall pine and lowlier cedar, day by day were losing their color, and
                  parching by the heat of the unrelenting sun.
               When forest and wood, streamlet and spring, withered and wasted, is it a wonder
                  that man's blood should grow thick and fever-charged? Yet, free from the infected
                  cities, the traveller, when he arrived, would thank God for his escape, and bear
                  bravely with the heat, for the bay waters were sparkling in the right merry sun,
                  and the air did not bear the wing of the angel of death.
               But, alas! with some their rejoicings were too-early born; for the fatal seeds of
                  the fever were ripening within them. Some drooped and died shortly after arrival;
                  others remained apparently secure, when of a sudden, a pain, covering a spot not
                  larger than a marble, would seize them in the back, head, or neck, or a singular
                  death-like chill would crawl down their spines, taking away strength from marrow
                  and muscle, whilst brain and bowel burnt as though in. a kiln.
               Sometimes the unfortunate man would tell you he felt quite well, save for that
                  pain in the back of his head; indeed, his spirits were rather high, and he only
                  thought he might be sick because his pulse "ran so fast." Then the pain would
                  increase, the skin become fire-hot, unlike any other fever heat when touched.
                  Yellow, and deeper yellow, would grow the skin, the lip-uncovered teeth become
                  sordes dark, and the whole countenance in quickening changes tell how busily death
                  worked within.
               Some would become offensive before they died, and retain their senses to the last;
                  whilst others would walk wildly about, raving like maniacs, and die with curse,
                  incoherent prayer and speech, or ribald song, upon their blackened lips. When the
                  vomit attacks, it is not thrown off as in bilious fevers, with sickness and
                  convulsive effort—it boils up, as some hot spring, from the stomach, running like
                  coffee-grounds over the lips and chin, or is forcibly jetted out to the distance
                  of several feet, plashing against wall or floor on its hearse-like course.
               The self-devotion, the true-hearted charity, the Christ acting feeling of many
                  whom the fever had not attacked, cannot be appreciated unless witnessed; and
                  although some deserted their kindred and their friends when struck by the dread
                  fever, and left them, in their flight for self-preservation vation, to die with raving brain and parching
                  throat, uncared for and uncoffined—yet, thank God, there were others
                  who, fearless and firm, and but too often victims, came alike to friend, to
                  stranger, and to foe, administering to their fevered wants, and
                  registering their latest wishes. Bands of gentlemen left their homes and their
                  occupations, and joined in this brotherhood charity, while the Sisters of Mercy,
                  high in their catholic duty, came like angels to all classes who needed their
                  service, and at the expense of health, and by forfeit of life, performed those
                  duties which can never be forgotten by the living, and were blessed by the
                  dying.
               The day had been unusually hot, the sea breeze had failed, and the huge red disk
                  of the sun, as it went down, gave still the promise of a morrow alike suffocating.
                  We were sitting lazily enough at our doors—for who had energy?—wondering if the
                  next coining day would be alike stifling, and pitying the poor fever-sick of our
                  distant city. Coming slowly along the bridge, that extended half a mile into the
                  water of the fronting bay, we perceived Mr. D——, with fishing-rod and basket in
                  hand. He had been trailing in that hot sun since noon. His swarthy countenance
                  seemed a little flushed, and his eye was more restless than usual. He passed
                  quietly to his rooms, followed by his servant, bowing austerely to those he knew.
                  The world had prospered well with him—a large fortune had been amassed, but not
                  enjoyed, for the everlasting love of greater gain haunted him. He was an
                  atheist—gold his only god I Life to him was all—hereafter a starless blank.
               Yet, the man so grasping, so austere, and so hopeless, loved and was married to a
                  most beautiful Creole, whose very soul he seemed to hold. She was a zealous
                  Catholic, and by her ardent charity and womanly humanity had rendered softer the
                  rough angles of her husband. In figure she was full but graceful, with luxuriant
                  hair, which, when loosened, covered her completely in its dark waving tresses, and
                  eyes whose liquid light would cause one to cease in conversation, and wonder alike
                  at their beauty, and how her atheist husband could look into their soul-moving
                  depths and not see the evidence of God within. Yet, so it was—he loved her truly
                  in his way, without sentiment, but with passion and pride of possession. She and
                  his gold were his all.
               The next rooms to those of Mr. D—were occupied by the celebrated Professor—, of
                  P—, whose infirmity of health had caused him to seek a southern climate. We were
                  still conversing together, when the servant of Mr. D—interrupted us, by desiring
                  that the Doctor would immediately visit his master. Scarce an half hour had gone
                  by since he had passed with fishing-rod in hand. After an absence of twenty
                  minutes the Doctor returned. His countenance was grave and thoughtful. "Mr. D."
                  said he, "is ill; he has the pain in the head, his pulse is 108, and
                  yet he says he thinks it will pass away, as in other respects he feels well. But
                  it will not pass away, save when he dies! The first stage of the fever is upon
                  him—to-morrow the vomit will likely seize him, and in twenty-four hours after he
                  will have died. Here, within a few feet, with his doom sealed, lay the rich man
                  who just now with haughty mien had passed by. Thirty-nine days he had been absent
                  from the infected city!
               "My experience in this disorder," continued the doctor, slowly," leads me to have
                  no hope for the poor man, and yet I cannot say so to that loving wife; poor thing,
                  she will too soon know it."
               My room was upon the other side of D—'s chamber, separated by a mere lath
                  partition. Every deep breath he drew I could hear during the night—the very steps
                  of his Creole wife fell upon my ear. The next day broke-the sun rose in his
                  fire-chariot—the fever-sick gasped, and prayed for a change in vain; the air was oven-hot. Ice smoked
                  and melted over the sick man's head and bowels; still the fever-fire remained.
                  Cool drinks gave no refreshing respite to his parched throat—the brain hammered
                  on; Death was at his forge burning up flesh and blood.
               The night at length came on, and the breeze that had failed during the long day,
                  streamed gently into window and wide-open door. For a time the sick man roused up;
                  he seemed refreshed, and his breath, though rapid and oppressed, grew deep and
                  deeper. Hope again sat radiant upon his poor wife's brow! Alas! how many have thus
                  hoped, and hoped in vain! The night wore on, and ten o'clock came. I was passing
                  the door, when out rushed Mrs. D——, and seizing hold of my arm, she cried, "Oh;
                  God! he is worse; do something to save my husband!"
               Gently unloosing her grasp, and begging her to quiet her fears, I approached the
                  bed. My God! what a change a day had wrought. The features were sharp and
                  haggard—the skin tight-drawn and glazed over his forehead and cheek-bones—the
                  natural swarthy complexion had become an orange yellow—the eyes, with pupils
                  contracted to their utmost, were widely open—his fine teeth, covered with dark
                  sordes, were exposed by the withdrawn lips, whilst up and down with every breath
                  moved the dry black tongue. Two or three wax candles were casting long dismal
                  shadows on the walls, and just above the sick man's head, upon the ceiling, waving
                  to and fro, was the outline of funeral plume and streamer, foretelling the nigh
                  coming of death.
               I took the scorching hand within my own, as D—— fixed his wild-staring eyes upon
                  me. "I hope, Mr. D——, you are better."
               "Hope, sir, hope!" he cried, whilst every word hissed from his dry mouth. "You do
                  not hope—you know that I am worse. I burn-I am parching up."
               I felt his pulse—it was quite natural! perhaps a little more rapid,
                  but soft like a young child's, In a few minutes I left him, and went to the
                  doctor's chamber. I said to him I thought his patient was better. "How is his
                  pulse?" he simply replied, I answered him. "Then he dies. The forge will soon
                  stop, and by ten o'clock to-morrow all will be over."
               Putting his arm through mine, the doctor walked with me to my chamber. "You
                  think," continued he, taking a seat by the table, "that Death works fast in his
                  yellow raiments; well, in this case he has not worked so rapidly as in some others
                  that have fallen under my notice. In P—, the fever, in the year '93, raged
                  furiously; all night the dead carts would roll heavily along, with men crying out,
                  'pass out your dead;' and coffins would sometimes be lowered from upper stories of
                  lodging-houses, so fearful of infection were the occupants of the lower rooms. One
                  day, about noon, I was hastily sent for to visit one of my patients. I found him
                  walking up and down the parlor floor, a good deal agitated.
               "'Ah, doctor,' he cried, 'my wife would send for you—she is alarmed-I am not sick,
                  except an excruciating spot of pain in the back of my head.' I felt his pulse, it
                  was over 100, and his countenance seemed changing while we were talking. In vain I
                  persuaded him to go to bed. He had gone about two hours before into the centre of
                  the infected district to obtain some money—had not remained fifteen minutes, and
                  returned home to dine with his little family. His speech became less coherent, and
                  a most decided alteration of countenance had now taken place. Dinner was served,
                  and taking a seat at the table he said he would eat a little rice. He raised the
                  spoon to his mouth, when suddenly his teeth closed spasmodically on it, and with
                  an out-stretching convulsive movement of his arms and hands, he fell sideways upon
                  the floor. We quickly raised him, and laid him upon a sofa, but he was quite
                  dead!"
               
               At this moment the figure of the Creole wife glided in, her features pale as
                  ashes, and her deep dark eyes wide open with terror; upon the palm of her hand,
                  she held a napkin, in the midst of whose dark folds lay a dark brown spot.
               "What is this, doctor?" she cried, holding the cloth before his
                  eyes.
               "My daughter," he answered, "it looks like coagulated blood."
               With a convulsive sob, she left the room. Presently she rushed in again, but the
                  napkin was no longer white, it was completely covered and ran down with a dark
                  coffee-ground fluid.
               "What is that?" she almost shrieked.
               The old man took the stained towel from her hand, and in a low voice said, "It is
                  the black vomit, my poor child."
               Oh, what a sob of unutterable despair broke from that loving wife's pallid
                  lips!
               All night the work of death was going on; splash, splash against wainscoat and
                  wall, basin and floor, sounded the fatal vomit, as it was pumped from the sick
                  man's stomach.
               Towards morning sleep came over me, and I dreamed of the plague—of women weeping,
                  men and little children dying like sheep; when I awoke the sun was some hours
                  high, and the air again oven-hot. At breakfast, none in that great crowd seemed
                  merry, not even the very young, for all had heard of some dear one, dead or
                  dying.
               It was now nine in the morning; the sun was climbing into window and door, heating
                  the room like a kiln. I entered D.'s room—around the bed stood several of his
                  friends, with two or three ladies. With her long dark hair, like a mourning veil,
                  covering her figure as she lay with her head on the seat of a chair, knelt the
                  stricken wife. The sun was now bright on the head of the bed, where lay the dying
                  man, propped by his pillows, with the dark stained sheets in disordered rolls,
                  over him. There lay the man, who, scarcely six-and-thirty hours before, had passed
                  along, with head erect and proud step, a miserable wreck, unrecognizable, and
                  already offensive! How fast was death claiming his victim!
               The bright sunlight now touched his hair, and soon fell full upon his changing
                  face, which grew darker and more terrible to look upon; the lips, drawn back,
                  exposed every tooth, whilst the bright gleam glanced- upon their white crowns, as
                  with wide-open mouth he labored on, and on, for breath, straining muscle of face
                  and neck, in this great last battle for life. No longer the pulse beat at the
                  wrist; and as I laid my ear upon his chest, his tired heart slowly
                  throbbed—cluck—cluck.
               At this moment, wrapped in his morning gown, and with crossed arm, walked gently
                  in the doctor. In an instant the dying man's wife heard the step, and springing
                  up, with her long hair trailing over her feet, she clasped his knees, and
                  sobbed:
               "Oh! doctor, why can you not, with your skill, save me my husband?"
               The doctor quietly raising his finger on high, pushed back the hair from her broad
                  forehead, saying, "The Lord alone can save!"
               Quietly putting my arm around her waist, I raised her;
               "Come, dear madam," I whispered in her ear, "and be near him, for in after years
                  it will comfort you much to know that you held his hand, and received his latest
                  breath." With a shudder, and shrinking from me, she exclaimed, "Oh, God, I cannot
                  look upon him, he is too awful!"
               A low wailing sound, like some one in deepest grief, came from the dying man's
                  mouth.
               "Do not distress him more," I said to her; "he hears you, and it grieves him; his
                  brain is still alive. Ask for some sign."
               
               She seized his hand, and clasping it tight to her panting bosom, she cried in a
                  voice that pierced our very souls,—
               "Husband, dear husband, give me one little, little sign that you know am by you,
                  and that you heard me pray the live-long night by your side?; And his black tongue
                  uttered lol—lol—lol—lol—
               "Oh, he hears me," she again with agony cried; one more sign, dearest, that you
                  now think of your long-denied God, and that you have some little hope?"
               Again the black and stiffening tongue moved to and fro, and lol, lol, hoarsely
                  struck the ear. He had heard her! Then with one short struggle all was over.
               We carried the widowed wife to an unoccupied room at the end of the gallery. Not a
                  tear dropped from her eye; she had grieved too much, and the
                  heart-springs were dried. With a voice thrillingly calm, she said to me,—
               "Tell me, do your Northern women shed tears when their husbands die? for I cannot;
                  I cannot think enough; yet he was very kind to me, and loved me well.
                  'Tis very strange I am so calm, when he is dead!"
               Fearing lest her brain might suffer, I told her I would tell her how, at the
                  North, little children died in our summers; that one day full of health and
                  promise, the next day they ailed and drooped; and before long the dysentery would
                  set in, and they gradually wasted away, with their sweet faces so wan and pale,
                  and their little dry hands so hot in the palms, as they weakened on—how their
                  heart-stricken mothers watched their fading forms, and clung closer and closer to
                  them, till robbed of blood and of every vital fluid, naught remained to clasp but
                  the cold image of their loved one marbled in death.
               As I related these stories, a deep heavy sigh escaped from the desolate wife, and
                  tears that refused to flow for her own misfortunes, flowed like rain for those of
                  another. She was saved.
               When the sun went down, we took the corpse and placed it in a plain pine coffin,
                  covered with black muslin, and bore it through the wood, where a grave had been
                  hastily dug. His head clerk read the service for the dead, but the night closing
                  rapidly in, the print became obscure, and thus, with funeral service half read,
                  was buried the once proud merchant.
            
            
               
               FUNCTIONS OF THE SKIN.
               COLD FATAL TO INFANTS.
               ON taking up our pen, in order to do something in the way of instructing the
                  people, by the examination of the human body, we were a little in doubt where to
                  begin the dissection.
               It is the most natural, we think, to commence with the skin, for there in
                  dissection the scalpel first performs its office, and it is the part through
                  which, as an organ of sense, we hold the greatest amount of communication with
                  surrounding objects. It is also the watchful sentinel that warns us of the contact
                  of hurtful things, and like the military guard on duty, is the first to be
                  encountered on the way to the citadel within.
               The skin is regarded as the peculiar seat of feeling, and we would treat of it as
                  an organ of feeling only at the present time, reserving for future consideration
                  the study of its other functions.
               While reflecting on this subject, a very natural desire arose to group with it the
                  other organs of sense, and to present to our readers as plain an account as we
                  could, of the nature of the five external senses, of the organs in which they are
                  seated, the means whereby they may become deranged, and the natural methods of
                  preventing and remedying those derangements.
               
                  External Senses.—The external senses are five in number: feeling,
                  taste, smell, hearing, and sight. They are intended to apprise man of the objects
                  he should seek or shun. They receive and transmit to the brain, those impressions
                  which will enable him to judge of the qualities of bodies in the material world.
                  The acuteness of the senses should be carefully cultivated, for the purpose of
                  assisting the intellect in its power of active and precise discrimination of these
                  objects, and also to supply it with materials wherewith to act. The simple
                  employment of the senses does not increase directly the amount of intelligence,
                  any more than the employment of the muscles of the body; both are put in operation
                  by the action of the brain. They must be regarded, therefore, as mere instruments
                  of the brain, adding nothing directly to its perfection. The idiot and man of
                  genius, the savage and the civilized, have the senses equally developed, while the
                  intellectual development is far from being equal; indeed, in the savage, the
                  majority of the senses are far more acute, than they are among those who have the
                  benefits of the instruction of civilized life.
               
                  Feeling and Touch.—The organ of feeling is the skin; that of touch
                  is the hand. There are different degrees of delicacy in the touch; the ends of the
                  fingers possess it to the most perfect extent, while it is less in the palm. In
                  both, motion is needed to perfect the sense of touch; but from the imperfect
                  development of it in the palm of the hand, a movement, such as grasping, is
                  absolutely needed to convey the impression of the form of a body to the brain.
               It is by the transmission of a certain species of knowledge to the brain, that
                  feeling, in common with the other senses, guards the safety of the individual.
                  There are a number of curious facts recorded in different scientific works, which
                  prove the truth of this assertion.
               In the "Medico-Chirurgical Transactions," there is an account of a man whose hands
                  up to the wrists, and whose feet and legs half way to the knees, were perfectly
                  insensible to any species of injury; such as cutting, pinching, scratching, or burning. This man accidently put one
                  of his feet into boiling water, but was not otherwise aware of the high
                  temperature, than by finding the whole surface completely blistered on removing
                  it. A French surgeon, M. Rullier, gives also an instance of a patient who was
                  similarly affected in his lower limbs, who twice burned himself in his knees,
                  which were placed in contact with a hot stave, with such severity, that large
                  scars were formed, without his having been warned of his danger or his exposure,
                  such was the destitution of sensibility in the parts exposed. In another case, a
                  patient was insensible to the progress of a severe inflammation in the arm, which
                  took place from an injury; indeed, such was the insensibility of the limb, that he
                  actually broke his arm, and thought from the crash, that he had broken the spade
                  with which he was at work!
               In order to maintain the faculty of feeling and the delicacy of touch,
                  cleanliness, the usual appliances of the toilet, fine clothing of a supple
                  texture, and the avoidance of those occupations which tend to thicken-the
                  epidermis,—as the fine outer covering of the skin is called,—are all absolutely
                  necessary. This is evident from the effect which an exposure to those
                  circumstances which destroy the susceptibility of the skin produces. The hardy and
                  rough occupation of a laborer, blacksmith, and of such as are necessarily exposed
                  constantly to the violence of a severe atmosphere, with insufficient clothing, and
                  yet retain their ordinary health—all such persons are destitute of the delicacy of
                  physical feeling which characterizes others differently situated.
               In anticipation it is necessary to remark, that great care should be used not to
                  place the sense of feeling too far removed from the source of its natural
                  impressions, for by such a course, an excessive amount of sensibility would be
                  developed, often to a very serious extent.
               These remarks do not apply to the sense of touch, as this never can be made too
                  acutely sensitive, and it is only by the constant exercise of this sense that its
                  delicacy can be perfected. Blind persons, who are forced to exercise it
                  constantly, and who direct their attention almost exclusively to it, acquire the
                  greatest delicacy of touch, and are able to read with facility in a mode which
                  imparts no impression of a distinct character to others, who have not cultivated
                  the sense of touch.
               As to directions for the cultivation of the sense of touch, they are almost
                  unnecessary, for every one knows that the hand and fingers should be properly
                  preserved in their delicacy to maintain it in its perfection; bruises and injuries
                  of every kind impair this sense very essentially, but it is rarely altogether
                  destroyed.
               Feeling appears to be most useful in giving us a knowledge of temperature. It
                  indicates with accuracy the degree of heat which is proper for the maintenance of
                  health, with reference to the atmosphere with which we are surrounded, and to the
                  condition of our own bodies. The nerves distributed over the skin, are for this
                  purpose a much better thermometer than the ordinary philosophical instrument, and
                  whenever there is a want of correspondence between the latter and the sense of
                  feeling, it should always be from our own sensations that we should derive the
                  information we need. The temperature of stone, wood, linen, or wool, may be found
                  precisely the same when measured by a thermometer; yet these various substances,
                  when in contact with the skin, produce a very different impression in the
                  sensation they produce, each possessing different powers of carrying off heat. It
                  is on this account that a linen garment next the skin, is so much more cold to the
                  sensation than one of wool. Another illustration may be found in an ordinary
                  cellar, where the temperature differs but little throughout the year; yet we will
                  experience a feeling of cold or heat as we enter it, in the summer or winter, arising from the transition from the
                  external temperature to which the skin has become accustomed. The sensation of
                  cold thus produced is not less injurious than actual cold applied to the body,
                  which is applicable by the thermometer.
               The practical inference to be drawn from what we have said, is, that the
                  sensations of feeling relative to temperature at all ages, should be strictly
                  heeded as a rule of health, with reference to the employment of clothing. This
                  fact is of the greatest importance to persons of "a delicate constitution, and
                  liable to be easily chilled. Such persons should never wear linen next to the
                  surface of the body, nor sleep between linen sheets. Indeed, we regard the
                  introduction of fine cotton sheets as a very great improvement in domestic
                  economy, more especially as regards health.
               When an individual wishes to harden himself, as it is termed, against the natural
                  changes of temperature, he should always keep in mind that he is not to accomplish
                  this object by undergoing pain, or any disagreeable sensation, but only by
                  cautiously inuring himself to the causes which produce these disagreeable
                  sensations. The effort should be gradually made, and stopped whenever any
                  decidedly unpleasant effects are produced; in this manner, much greater progress
                  will be made than by enduring pain—for that can never be done, even for a moderate
                  period, with impunity.
               New-born children should always be kept warm; besides other ill effects, the
                  impressions of cold are extremely painful to the skin, scarcely covered with the
                  epidermis, and the sudden change experienced by the child, which has just passed
                  from a temperature of 97 degrees. Instinct, experience, and statistical records
                  all agree in the importance of warmth to the young child. One of the
                  manifestations of the love of all animals to their young, is to protect them from
                  the vicissitudes of the atmosphere, and to impart to their offspring warmth from
                  their own bodies. Nature also appears to shun the production in winter of such as
                  suffer the most from cold.
               There have been a number of experiments made within a few years, upon the heat of
                  the human body, and the following interesting facts have been established: 1st.
                  That power of producing heat is at its minimum in a new-born child—the temperature
                  at the arm-pits being 80 degrees, while in the adult it is 96 degrees. It is
                  obvious that the demand for heat must be the greatest at this early period of
                  life, when the supply from the body itself is so limited. 2d. That the youngest
                  children are those that chill the most easily, and that their mortality often
                  depends upon this natural condition of the system.
               Varied and extensive experiments have been made upon the lower animals, which it
                  is unnecessary here to detail; but they all go to show how injurious cold is to
                  the young of all animals. Every farmer knows the disastrous effects of a backward
                  spring in the poultry yard.
               These positions are fully maintained by statistical researches on the relation
                  existing between the mortality of infants, and the true state of the thermometer,
                  which prove that the mortality of new-born children is greatly increased by
                  cold.
               In order to protect infants from the effects of cold, nurses should not judge of
                  the effect produced by a slight degree of low temperature on their own sensations,
                  for this is not the proper criterion; a pale and shrunken aspect,- cold hands and
                  arms, will often appear in infants, arising from cold, when no sensation is
                  experienced by an adult.
               In this country, where parents are mostly over-careful in keeping their children
                  too warm, the summer is much more to be dreaded than winter; for the deaths among
                  children at that period of life are much more numerous at that season.
               
               The attempts to render the child accustomed to the air and to cold, must never be
                  neglected, for it will probably happen, as he grows older, that from the
                  impossibility of carefully watching him on all occasions, he will at times be
                  accidentally exposed to the influence of atmospheric vicissitudes.
            
            
               WATERING-PLACE SNOBS.
               HOTEL CONVENTIONALITY, WITH SPECIMENS OF EACH GENUS AND
                  SPECIES.
               IF there be one place this side of a beggar's opera and dinner-party, as described
                  in the graphic page of some European traveller, that presents to the observer a
                  complete microcosm of humanity, it is an American watering-place. A season at
                  Saratoga, Newport, or Cape May, opens as large a page of nature as the moderate
                  intellect of an ordinary observer can well digest during the next year's
                  existence; and if its owner do not lose his individuality, and find his skull and
                  its contents gradually turned into a porridge-pot, and give occasion to some of
                  our pathological brethren for a post-mortem and certificate of "Rarnollisement
                     Cerebri"*
                   he may thank Heaven for blunting his perceptive faculties, and saving his
                  carcass from so high a preferment before the kind offices of an undertaker, or the
                  keeper of a lunatic asylum, at the least. A periodical mania seizes most of our
                  citizens at the approach of the dog-days, and as soon as the corporation let loose
                  the dread ministers of the law on the unfortunate canine family, two legged
                  Puppydom takes the alarm, and rushes from the city, like one of their four-legged
                  brethren, alarmed at the novel appendage of a tin-kettle to his caudal extremity,
                  and a free course up Broadway.
               
                  
                  *Softening of the brain.
               
               We have made this extraordinary moral affection the subject ject of considerable observation, during the last
                  twenty years of our practice, and have studied the epidemic, as it has appeared in
                  various parts of our country; and as the disease has become exceedingly common and
                  of unvaried periodical return, the observations made on some of the victims may
                  not be without interest to our readers. It is true, our experience has not been
                  very extensive at those more notorious places, where the infection has been
                  attended with most alarming symptoms, because we have found it both necessary and
                  agreeable, during the latter portion of our professional life, to share our duties
                  and observations with two associates, for whose safety we have a little more
                  consideration than our more enthusiastic brethren usually have for themselves. The
                  disease is not generally fatal to them, not only because they are mostly free from
                  the complication of pecuniary congestion, but because their morals and manners, in
                  their latter days, generally lend peculiar force to that elegantly illustrative
                  apothegm—"I'ts hard to spoil" a—a—ah—the albuminous contents of a calciferous and
                  ovicular receptacle of gallinaceous vitality usually called by the vulgar—an egg,
                  Excuse us, sweet reader, for the coarse allusion, and give us credit in the very
                  introduction, of the proverb to such refined notice, for perfect liberality in
                  including ourselves in the category; for, with a Frenchman's fondness for fresh
                  eggs (not old doctors), truth and our glass compels the assurance, we are no
                  chicken; indeed, we think, dear child, when you have allowed the fringes of those
                  heavenly eyes to droop from their marble sills over the windows of the soul, till
                  you come to the end of this miserable article, you will be convinced you are
                  listening to the crowing of an old cock. Pray heaven, dearest, you do not in that
                  malicious little head, mentally invest us with one of the more envied attributes
                  of that strutting country representative of the true watering-place gentleman: we
                  are not omnivorous in our admiration of the gentler sex; although we confess a
                  strong penchant for Turkey, we usually take it cooked; for we swear to you, dear
                  children, however disagreeably the confession may revive former delightful and
                  youthful memories, we have not of late years had our vanity flattered by much
                  attention from your sex. Indeed, upon occasion of the last favor that gladdened
                  our eyes, when we fondly hoped to regale our nose with the delightful odor of an
                  enticing bouquet, delivered in the very presence of one who well knows our
                  amiability, we were greeted with the flavor of rue and wormwood, cunningly
                  disposed by some naughty little fingers, around—a dead hornet! True it is,
                  however, dearest, we always suspected it came in return for one we confess at
                  least to have seen, before it was sent to our young friend, containing—a mouse;
                  but the little creature was only designed to typify gentle innocence, and was sent
                  in a freak of invincible jocularity; two or three having reached the hands of the
                  same lovely creature, done up as wedding-cake, and if truth be all told, a couple
                  as oyster patties. Besides, Shakspere says in his Twelfth Night, "true, my mouse
                  of virtue," and in Hamlet it is bestowed by the king as a term of endearment on
                  the newly-widowed queen—though not too well deserved, it would seem, by that
                  devoted lady-as illustrative of her virtue.
               Well, then, our amiability and experience being taken for granted, we will enter
                  upon our investigation of the temporary diseases of the different classes,
                  occupants of ——, with now and then the more interesting points of an individual.
                  But first, en passant: as we are known to be so
                  thoroughly pachydermatous, and utterly unsusceptible of all the gentler emotions,
                  we never had the slightest reason to expect attention from any of the individual
                  specimens we describe. We merely view them as a class of humanity, worthy the
                  study of the reader of such a unique volume as is here presented—and with no
                  desire to cultivate an unamiable
                  dissatisfaction with any of the works of nature—particularly that puffing genus,
                  the batrachia, or its human synonym, the snob.
               The first point that strikes the observation of the practical surgeon, as he
                  dismounts from his vehicle, covered and begrimed with dust, is the extraordinary
                  prevalence of the spinal affections, and near-sightedness; the next, the
                  contemplative and resigned expression of a number of gentlemen, usually in black,
                  walking solitary and alone up and down the piazza, with their hands behind their
                  backs.
               The first of these affections is an awful and hopeless disease, very afflictive to
                  the genus snob, wherever found—and familiarly known to surgeons as the backward
                  curvature of the spine. It is usually the consequence of pecuniary repletion, and
                  is rarely observed before the patient's fortieth year, unless in times of
                  speculation, when it has been known to occur at the twenty-fifth. Occasionally it
                  is hereditary, when the abdominal projection that seems to have been intended by
                  nature as a counterpoise to the backward curvature of the spine, is accompanied
                  with the unfortunate condition of cerebral atrophy; do not suppose, however, that
                  the patient is destitute of brains; a little conversation with the unfortunate
                  individual will soon convince you of that extraordinary yet common phenomenon of
                  the transposition of the cerebral and abdominal contents, so well known to the
                  immortal physiologist of Avon, when he makes one of his heroes say: 
                     "You carry your brains in your belly, and your g—s in your head."
                  
               
               The seniors amongst these afflicted individuals, or as they are sometimes
                  affectionately called by their dutiful progeny, "the governors," are remarkably
                  tenacious of their position, as they fondly term their acknowledged height upon
                  the ladder of snobdom; this is graduated entirely by the amount of their fortune:
                  nothing under $100,000 and a carriage, will entitle them to the disease; and they
                  are sure to escape till that amount is obtained; the affliction is progressively
                  increased, and reaches its maximum at $1,000,000. A remarkable physiological
                  peculiarity in the afflicted offspring of this species of the snob, is the
                  extraordinary smallness and insecurity of their legs, together with the
                  approximation of the knee joints; near-sightedness also prevails amongst these
                  tender goslings to a remarkable extent; you may know them by their eye-glasses,
                  and the enormous bars of their checkered trowsers, not forgetting the angle at
                  which their hats are adjusted. It has been suggested by unlettered observers, that
                  the exceeding feebleness of their pins and eyes, is due to their own vices; but
                  this is a slander originating in the minds of the vulgar. A gentleman should never
                  do anything which another can possibly accomplish for him; and although he may be
                  obliged to sustain himself on his own legs, it is but proper that there should be
                  a marked difference in the manner, between himself and those ordinary individuals
                  who may require them for the more vulgar purposes of active locomotion. No doubt,
                  the distinctive smallness of the legs, is due to the refined quality of their
                  material, and is a merciful provision of nature to match the slender cerebral and
                  abdominal superstructure. Still it is somewhat remarkable, when we consider the
                  brawny development of their progenitors, particularly if they have been accustomed
                  to menial employment, or the more active duties of the loom, the spade, or the
                  pick. The latter is productive of an unsightly disease, the forward curvature of
                  the back-bone or spine. This is very afflictive to the snob, more especially if
                  his known employment has been calculated to produce such an anatomical
                  peculiarity; it revives unpleasant memories of the lap-stone and jack-plane, and
                  is prima-facie evidence of that horribly vulgar disease called industry: if known
                  to have thus originated, the unfortunate possessor of the deformity may quite as
                  well have the plague or the leprosy,
                  for he is at once ostracized—tabooed—and pronounced unclean. Should he venture, in
                  a thoughtless moment, to salute one of the victims afflicted with the opposite
                  condition of the spinal column, the latter is generally seized with a spasmodic
                  attack of coughing, or his immediate attention is suddenly arrested by a lady or
                  gentleman on the other end of the piazza, to whose presence he immediately rushes
                  as a refuge. If the offensive and plebeian salutation be made to a junior, he
                  avails himself of his eye-glass; this he levels with amazement against shoes or
                  jack-plane, with the effect of setting him off at an angle, and producing a
                  considerable increase in the curvature of his shoulders; bringing his hand behind
                  his back, and inducing a contemplative abasement of his eyes. We have occasionally
                  seen Shoes, worth $50,000, salute Sugar, $250,000, when the effect was peculiarly
                  rapid, inducing the belief that poor Wax-end had been electrified; on more than
                  one such occasion, we addressed our utmost benevolence to his relief, but with
                  very little success for some time; the JDOOI fellow, like Crusoe's man Friday,
                  evidently mistrusting that we also were a cannibal, and would eat him up; finally,
                  however, on finding a supporter of $100,000 in Rags, he regained his
                  self-possession, his curvature decreasing considerably.
               There is a complaint, observed amongst a large class of the frequenters of
                  watering-places, that is productive of an inconvenient result in promenading on a
                  narrow piazza. It is a disease peculiar to the dry goods snob, and consists in a
                  constant tendency of the thumbs to contend for the position usually occupied by
                  the palm; this brings the hand at an inconvenient angle with the body; and if the
                  gentleman be very impressive in his religious or political disquisition's—(the
                  afflicted individuals are always addicted to the vice of denunciation on one or
                  the other subject)—he constantly invades your ribs with his knuckles, and you will
                  do well to have a care of your eyes. When seated, and especially if in front of a
                  circle of ladies, the same remarkable tendency is apparent: the individual
                  grasping either thigh with that useful and economical measuring member the thumb,
                  on the outer side; this is peculiarly elegant and graceful.
               Several other less distinctly marked peculiarities, such as the rapid
                  approximation of the hands, in the auctioneer, knocking off, as it were; the
                  latitudinarian flourishes of the entire arm in the shoemaker, as though drawing
                  the wax-end; a frequent graceful pronation of the hand, throwing jauntily outward
                  the massive seal ring of the barkeeper (and sometimes of the bishop), indicate the
                  pursuits that have led to these different afflictions in the gentlemen.
               The ladies, God bless them, with their refined perception, and intuitive tact,
                  avoid all such illustrative demonstrations, by profound quiet; the code of
                  watering-place manners, recognizing nothing as so absolutely indicative of in-born
                  aristocracy, as that elegant indifference to all surrounding things, evinced by
                  the sleepy, voluptuous, half-closed eye, and the beautifully jewelled fingers of a
                  hand elegantly disposed across the person in a loving embrace, with the charming
                  little foot peeping from under the dress like a mouse. It has been suspected that
                  such a disposition of things might indicate a degree of lightness of the brain,
                  that would not admit of much mental effort. Be this as it may, there is no doubt
                  of its peculiar acceptability to most American gentlemen. A box of bon bons, an
                  assortment of ribbons, laces, and jewelry, have been known to produce signs of
                  vitality.
               An affection of the arms, of a very singular character, had a very short run in
                  Broadway, and was occasionally noticed amongst a certain class at the
                  watering-places, but it has now passed into-the Bowery and Chatham street. It
                  consisted of an angular contraction of the arm of the gentleman nearest the lady,
                  the hand being disposed behind the back, like the wing of a trussed green goose; the lady entered delightfully into the
                  arrangement, and consented to be pushed along in a very loving manner, in a sort
                  of let-me-go hold-me-fast way, quite enchanting.
               We must defer our observations on the watering-place literati, and wife and
                  husband hunters, to another article; they constitute extremely interesting
                  varieties to the medical psychologist.
            
            
               WOMAN.
               WHAT ARE THE CAUSES OF EARLY DECAY IN AMERICAN WOMEN?
               
                  
                     "Truth is the body of God; and Light is his shadow."
                  
               
               WHETHER the proposition assumed to be true in this query be admitted or denied, it
                  is probable the writer will receive credit for sincerity, in venturing to assert
                  the existence of very extensive physical inferiority in that sex, who are the
                  unquestioned arbiters of the success of every medical candidate for popular
                  favor.
               Her power to please, and the dread of her disapprobation, hold our sex in such
                  absolute subjection that the mentor is too often merged into the lover, and even
                  while fascinated by her presence, and trying to silence our hearts for our
                  dereliction, her fragile form is bending under those unchangeable and inexorable
                  laws to whose teachings we have failed to direct her, and the grave receives at
                  once the object of our love, and the evidence of our neglect of a duty, more
                  sacred than any other enjoined upon us by the Creator. Yes:—Man should be the
                  teacher of woman; he enjoys the privilege to guide her steps aright; his is the
                  strong arm and the judging head; hers it is to illumine the path with the sunlight
                  of her smile, to gladden his ear with the music of her voice, and to cheer him
                  with the blest and refining influence of her presence.
               We do not believe it was the design of the Creator to invest her with the sterner
                  attributes of a Newton or a La Place, a
                  Washington or a Shakspeare. It is glory enough for her to have nourished the
                  philosopher with her blood, to have planted the seeds of virtue in his heart, and
                  led his steps to an age when he becomes her protector and the fulfiller of his
                  destiny. In thus expressing ourselves, shall we be told by some miscalled
                  reformer, that we degrade the position of woman? Who was the mother of Christ? Who
                  of the philosophers, heroes and poets who have shed lustre upon past ages? They
                  neither discovered the laws of motion of a universe, upheld expiring liberty, nor
                  impressed the living page with the inmost emotions of the soul: they fulfilled
                  their destiny; let us not forget ours.
               Could we induce ourselves to believe the sole mission of the physican to be the
                  administration of pills and potions, and to yield a servile obedience to the
                  caprices of his employers (a bondage that dishonors and degrades him), our remarks
                  would be impertinent. But we believe our profession to be that of a teacher of the
                  laws of our being. Our College Edifice is magnificent; aye, as extensive as the
                  earth; our laboratory and cabinet, whatever it contains; our pupils, mankind; our
                  text book, the page of nature. It is true we sell no diplomas, and minister with
                  feebleness at her altar; we cannot always keep our spirit to the desired height
                  amidst the daily toil of professional life, but to the best of our perception we
                  shall always speak the truth.
               If it were not for the present wretched state of their moral and physical
                  education, and the too early development of the sexual passions, or that miserable
                  spirit that presides over the hearts and money bags of too many of our species,
                  our children might start on the race of life with far better prospects of reaching
                  its natural termination: marriages would not be contracted before the age of
                  reason, with that absolute selfishness that now governs them. Scrofula would not
                  mate with scrofula, insuring consumption to a line of diseased offspring. Insanity
                  would not seek the altar as a certain introduction to the mad-house. Gout would
                  not bequeath his aching toes and crutches to a line of cripples: nor Syphilis
                  poison the secret springs of life in the unborn babe, till the mother in the agony
                  of her spirit craves its death as the most merciful boon of Heaven.
               These thing have been called by worthy people "the mysterious dispensations of
                  Providence." But the nineteenth century, with her tables of statistics, and her
                  flood of physiological light, will no longer permit us to soothe our consciences
                  with such a delightful plaster for sins against light and knowledge. The sins of
                  the parents are indeed visited on the third generation of them that know the right
                  and still the wrong pursue. Is there no remedy for so great an evil? Can man look
                  upon the page of nature, and thence into the face of his Creator, and curse him
                  for abandoning the work of his hands to premature destruction? These bodies, so
                  curiously and wonderfully fashioned, were not designed for-the worm ere nature had
                  asserted the power of continuing the species: or what is far more dreadful, for
                  implanting the seeds of early death in our offspring. Let us examine the pages of
                  our great teacher, and see if we can discover the causes of such frequent failures
                  in attaining her end.
               So far as it concerns their original organic strength or life-force, males and
                  females are brought into the world with equal chances of life, whatever the
                  condition of health may be in the parents. Both sexes however, have, in our
                  opinion, better chances of surviving, if the mother be healthy, even if the father
                  be feeble; for the development of the body depending upon the blood of the mother
                  exclusively, health is more likely to exist at its birth, if the supply of the
                  material be pure and plenty. The chances continue to be equal, so far as our
                  observation goes, during the period of early infancy, or to be more accurate,
                  before they can run. After this, boys
                  enjoy by far the best chances of acquiring health until adult life, when
                  casualties and dissipation, and subsequently the cares and anxieties attendant on
                  the support of a family, increase the mortality amongst males. It is probably for
                  this reason that the number of male births exceed the female ones about four per
                  cent. But we must shun statistics: however enticing to the medical philosopher and
                  convincing to the reader, they will afford little aid in the views we take of the
                  causes of the physical inferiority of our countrywomen.
               If it be true, then, that the chances of health for the two sexes are equal at the
                  outset, and continue so till the period when they first attain the full use of
                  their legs, we must show some very decided and indisputable causes for the
                  difference observable at puberty, or what we have yet to say, will serve but to
                  show our own folly in making assertions we cannot substantiate. Let us look a
                  little after their early training. We will take for example a sister and brother;
                  the girl of eight years, the boy of six.
               We give the girl two years start of the boy, to make her condition equal to his at
                  the outset. Both have endured the torture of bandaging, pinning and tight dressing
                  at birth; both have been rocked, jounced upon the knee, pap'd, laudanum'd,
                  paregoric'd, castor oil'd, and suffocated with a blanket over the head, sweltered
                  with a cap and feather bed, roasted at a fire of anthracite, and poisoned with the
                  foul air of an unventilated chamber, according to the universal formula of some
                  superannuated doctor, or experienced nurse; probably both, for these people
                  usually hunt in couples and ape very gracious to each other. We give the girl
                  enough start, to make up for the benefit the boy has derived from chasing the cat,
                  and an occasional tumble in the hall or yard, and the torture she had endured from
                  her sampler, and being compelled to "sit up straight" and not be a "hoyden."
               Our little couple start for school, with such a minimum of lungs as the unnatural
                  life they have led will allow, and a stomach that is yet fresh enough to endure
                  bad bread, plum cake, candies and diseased milk. The reader will remember that
                  nature is benificent, and will endure much abuse before she succumbs. Well—they
                  are off for school. Observe how circumspectly my little miss walks; soon she
                  chides her brother for being "rude." He, nothing daunted, starts full tilt after a
                  stray dog or pig; and though he often tumble in the mud, and his clothes get
                  spoiled, the result is soon visible in increase of lungs and ruddy cheeks. He
                  cannot run without more breath; he cannot continue to run without increased
                  dimensions and power of lungs; he cannot have large lungs without good digestion;
                  he will feed well, and thrive apace.
               They are now at school, seated on a bench without a back, and often with their
                  legs hanging down, so that the poor back-bone has no earthly support. Thus sits
                  the wretched child with book in hand, from nine till twelve or one o'clock, and
                  sometimes three. The boy, with the aid of sticking a pin now and then in his
                  neighbor, and occasionally falling asleep and tumbling from his bench, from pure
                  nervous exhaustion, to the great relief of his half-stagnant bloodvessels and
                  torpid nerves, endures it till another merciful pig or dog chase makes him feel
                  that He is alive.
               But our unfortunate little miss is in a distressed condition. She is charged to
                  walk "straight home," where she is allowed to select her dinner from those
                  articles that afford the least nutrition; such as pastry, cake, rich puddings, and
                  apples. This, by the way, is her second meal of the same character, having taken
                  one either at breakfast or lunch. Indeed, she requires no better food; for she has
                  had no exercise to consume the azote of the meat she ought to eat. Remember, that
                  her muscles move her limbs, and are composed chiefly of azote; and it is the red
                  meat or muscle of beef and mutton that she would eat if she had any appetite tite for it, that is to say, if her
                  stomach and bloodvessels would endure it: the fact is, the child has fever, and
                  loathes meat.
               After dinner, she either sits down to her sampler, or the piano, and in all
                  probability finishes the day's feeding with tea and preserves. She is then posted
                  off to a feather-bed in an unventilated room, with the door shut for fear the
                  little darling will take cold. A Nott's stove or furnace keeps the upper chambers
                  from 85° to 100°, and the feather-bed and the blankets, retaining all the heat of
                  the body, swelter the wretched little creature till morning. What wonder that she
                  gets spinal curvature, if not actual deposits of tubercles in the body of her
                  vertebræ or lungs? All this we have explained at length in the article on
                  Consumption. We have there shown, that although strongly predisposed to that form
                  of scrofula, consumption, as well as spinal disease, can often be overcome by
                  exercise, air and a strong meat diet; and though a child be actually free of
                  scrofula, that it may be produced by such a barbarous and wretched mode of life as
                  we have painted above; one that we grieve to say, is extremely common in this city
                  Boys often escape these evils by parental neglect—and a precious boon for them it
                  is; but the poor girls are deprived of nature's only method of keeping the
                  pale-faced monster at bay.
               Now, if this picture be denied, take you two children of common parents, at a
                  common country school, two miles from home, and if they have sufficient clothing,
                  and good food, even though the benches have no backs, and the school-house be
                  overheated and little better than a pig-pen, tell me, if at twelve years of age
                  the girl cannot often wrestle with her brother, and ask no favors of him.
               As the period of puberty approaches, the constant deprivation of her natural
                  wants, of good air, plain nutritious food, and plenty of unrestrained exercise,
                  becomes more apparent in its results: she is exceedingly awkward; her face is pale
                  and her eyelids swollen; the tight dresses, those accursed women-killers, cripple
                  the play of the heart and lungs, and do not allow the blood to circulate freely in
                  the extremities: in short, she is literally a bread and butter girl, with a
                  distressing consciousness of being all hands and feet. But now commences another
                  and more serious difficulty: she is to enter upon a new and wonderful phase of her
                  existence: nature is about to show her power in establishing a function, which is
                  the evidence of the greatest change in her physical and moral nature. This change,
                  when healthfully established, is the assurance that the life-forces of her system
                  have been silently accumulating till they are redundant. If she have been
                  permitted to share the sports of her brothers, and to enjoy the comfort of a happy
                  home and intellectual parents, her cheek may be invested with the blush of
                  modesty, and her eyes assume the language of love unconsciously to herself;
                  nature's great end is attained with so little disturbance of the nervous and
                  circulating functions, that a few weeks produce an astonishing change in her
                  appearance. But yesterday, she was a child; pleased with a puppet or a doll; now,
                  she is a woman, prepared to sympathize and to love.
               Suppose, on the other hand, she be the unfortunate child of uneducated and vulgar
                  parents, whose absurd ideas of gentility and education have dragged or driven her
                  through early infancy in the manner we have endeavored to set forth. The period
                  for the great change arrives, and the mother, totally uninformed of the rationale
                  of the function, and knowing nothing but the fact that her child is still more
                  wretched than before, sends for her physician. He, perhaps, almost equally
                  ignorant with herself, or what is still worse, being a miserable time-server, sees
                  the admirable facilities for "making a bill," and straightway commences a scene of
                  deception and ignorance, that if it do not result in the death of his unfortunate
                  patient, leaves her a miserable creature with spinal curvature, or consumption, or still worse, by confinement and
                  physic, destroys her only chance of restoration, and causes her, should she
                  struggle through this eventful period of her life and become a mother, upon her
                  second if not her first confinement, to drag out a wretched life, lying upon her
                  couch from pure inability to stand up, a victim of prolapsus uteri.
               The truth is, nature has been utterly foiled in the proper attainment of her
                  greatest end, by crippling her only method of producing the life-force. Air, food,
                  and exercise of proper quality and quantity, and unrestrained song, laughter, and
                  sport; these are her means, and these she must have, or healthful puberty can
                  never be established. If she finally break through all this cordon of ignorance,
                  and attempt to invest her child with the crowning glory of womanhood, if the rose
                  at last blooms faintly on her cheek, it is but too often the precursor of
                  hysteria, and instead of being the delight of the social circle, she becomes a
                  constant source of anxiety and misery to those who surround her. In short, she
                  becomes "nervous," and that is an epitome of horrors often worse than death
                  itself.
               So far we have spoken of the more palpable evils of her every-day existence, whose
                  direct effect on her body is so apparent, that they are beginning to attract the
                  notice of the thinking world. How shall we approach the subject of her
                  intellectual being? What can we say of her mental education as conducted in this
                  city? In the article on the "Pathology of a Fashionable Lady," we have given a
                  picture of such startling truthfulness, that it is enough to rouse the attention
                  even, of a fashionable mother.
               It sickens the heart to contemplate the education of female children in this city.
                  Should nature even triumph over all the evils we have enumerated, no sooner has
                  the poor girl attained the age of puberty, than her mind and nervous system are
                  placed upon the rack of novel reading and sentimental love-stories. There is just
                  enough of truth in most of these mawkish productions, to excite the passions and
                  distract the attention of the young girl from the love of nature and her
                  teachings, and all rational ideas of real life and to cause her to despise the (to
                  her) commonplace parents, whose every hour may be occupied with consideration for
                  her welfare.
               There is one firm in this city (very pious of course) who have done more to injure
                  the morals of our young girls, by the publication of the overstrained arid impure
                  productions of the infamous school of modern French novelists, than they could
                  atone for were their worthless and selfish bodies chained to a street sweeper's
                  cart for a century; the filth of the streets they ought to be sweeping, is not
                  more noisome to the senses, than the immoral filth they have sown in the hearts of
                  our children. Am I told by some thin-skinned fashionable, that such expressions
                  are too severe? What language can be too strong for such disgusting hypocrisy? We
                  punish a poor wretch for the publication of an obscene book or print, and give
                  honors and preferments to those who instil poison into the minds of our children,
                  prepared with devilish ingenuity, and in every possible style of attraction, by a
                  jaded libertine of the French Capital.
               Dickens and Bremer, Sedgwick and Child, may counteract, in some degree, the effect
                  of the writings of such moral lepers, but when mothers praise such productions in
                  the presence of their children, there is but too much reason to suppose they will
                  be read by the curious girl, and their full effect produced.
               It is the premature excitement of the nervous and uterine system that we dread:
                  the licentious characters presented in all the glowing tints of a depraved
                  imagination, cannot fail injuriously to affect the youthful organism. Nothing can
                  be more certain than the production by these works of a precocious evidence of
                  puberty. The forces of the young heart
                  and vascular system, are thus prematurely goaded into ephemeral action; by the
                  stimulus of an imagination alternately moved to laughter and tears and sexual
                  passion. A morbid centre is thus created in the system, whose pernicious action is
                  manifest in the diversified forms of hysteria; and nothing less than the total
                  wreck of the youthful body, often follows this infernal hot-bed of the passions,
                  this altar of sacrifice for the young.
               To this pernicious training, we may add the example of that insane passion for
                  dress, that constantly leads the mother from attention to her offspring, and the
                  instruction of her own mind in those great truths essential to the proper conduct
                  of every family. It is impossible for a child to form elevated ideas of morality
                  or correct taste, if constantly under the influence of a mother whose whole soul
                  is absorbed in the set or color of a dress or a bonnet.
               On this subject it would be well for our countrywomen to notice the remarks of
                  some of their own sex, whose fortunes and inclinations have led them to the
                  observance of foreign customs amongst those to whom wealth is no novelty,—We have
                  often heard our intelligent countrywomen remark, that no lady abroad, would be
                  seen in such walking-dresses as we may constantly sec in Broadway. It is true
                  these dresses are never seen here upon those whose early training and associations
                  have taught them better taste, but we are desirous that our countrywomen generally
                  should be as celebrated for their good sense as they justly are for their
                  beauty.
               If we are asked what this has to do with health, we reply, that extravagant and
                  elaborate dress, not only incapacitates the body for natural and graceful
                  movements, but by preoccupying the mind, often exhausts the nervous system before
                  the wearer leaves her house for needful exercise. And what is worse than all, the
                  insanity of emulation in dress; too often deprives a household of those minor
                  comforts and ornaments, upon which so much of our health and happiness depends.
                  There is little doubt that a well-furnished and judiciously, selected library, and
                  those other indispensable aids to the formation of a correct taste in children,
                  good drawings, and casts of statues of artistic merit, might often be purchased by
                  the exercise of a refined economy in dress, by the time her children were old
                  enough to appreciate them, by many a mother who now sighs at her inability to
                  compete in extra vagant dress, with a wealthy and vulgar neighbor.
               The constant changes of fashion in female dress, often afford the Broadway
                  philosopher the most grotesque and ridiculous exhibitions of the skill of the
                  cunning modistes who devise them; their surprising ingenuity in contriving means
                  for filling their pockets and unsettling the feeble intellects of their
                  purchasers, is matter of astonishment, whilst the melancholy results of a close
                  application to that death-distributing agent the needle, is visible in the pale
                  cheeks of their wretched employés, who are sacrificed by thousands on the altar of
                  cupidity and fashion.
               Some time before the death of a dear friend, whose charming pictures still speak
                  his memory, and revive our delighted though sad recollection of his wit and
                  companionship, we suggested, upon the appearance of some new and monstrous
                  absurdities in the dress of both sexes, that he would allow his name, so
                  intimately connected with refinement and correct taste, to be associated with some
                  of the more eminent of the ladies, medical faculty, and others of our graver and
                  accomplished citizens, in the formation of a society to reform the monstrous
                  absurdities of dress. That we should depend upon the caprice of some mere Parisian
                  ape of a tailor or modiste, who often retail to our innocent countrywomen some
                  ingenious device to conceal a defective figure, or to display the contour of a
                  voluptuous person, when we have before us the classical representations of the
                  antique dress, and could so readily adapt them to the use and entire convenience of modern life, forms a
                  humiliating reflection to a country of twenty millions of people, and one that
                  boasts a model government.
               Every American woman should be above receiving the dictum of an ignorant and
                  tasteless dress-maker; she should be instructed in the anatomy and physiology of
                  her system, and be perfectly able, at puberty, to give a correct outline of a
                  classical figure, and its appropriate dress, on the blackboard. She should then be
                  instructed to cut her own dresses in a simple and elegant manner, and adapt them
                  to her figure, so that not the least pressure should exist on any part of her
                  person. Indeed, without a good knowledge of the pencil and the harmony of colors,
                  her person and her house will present what is so frequent in this city, a
                  grotesque arrangement of dress, suitable for a carnival or madhouse, and a
                  drawing-room that would pass for a furniture store or a pawnbroker's shop.
               So much, in our own opinion, is due to an incorrect and servile taste in dress,
                  that it is one of the principal causes of the early decay of our countrywomen. Our
                  climate demands during one third of the year, absolute warmth and dry feet; and
                  our fashionable countrywomen would consider themselves disgraced by appearing in
                  public, with a dress and shoes that every intelligent Englishwoman wears as a
                  matter of course.
               On the subject of music, dancing, and declamation, as connected with health, we
                  could extend our ideas far beyond the limit of a single article. They have much to
                  do with the physical inferiority of the present generation of women. The full use
                  of the lungs is so absolutely connected with the preservation of health, that we
                  consider vocal music inseparable from a true physiological education. The full
                  inflation necessary for the sustained expression of the author's idea in vocal
                  music, is, the best possible stimulus that can be used within doors, for their
                  healthy development, and the prevention vention of scrofula or tubercular
                  deposits; many a young girl has been saved from consumption by early instruction
                  in vocal music. Declamation, or the clear and distinct utterance in a loud and
                  full voice, whilst standing erect (and with the lungs fully inflated, and filled
                  as fast as exhausted), of the more elegant compositions in prose and verse, of
                  English and French authors, is productive of the same result, and should never be
                  neglected in the education of every young girl. There is not one American woman in
                  a thousand, who can read elegantly or even correctly.
               What shall we say of the music of the opera? We are far from being insensible to
                  its charms, and the refining influence it exerts upon the taste of the adult, but
                  can by no means assent to its good influence upon the young girl. It is the
                  highest expression of the language of passion, and as such, cannot but be adapted
                  to that premature development of that system, so completely under the influence of
                  passional emotion. That opera music is suggestive of higher thoughts and emotions,
                  we freely admit, and believe that intellectual adults may enjoy it with propriety;
                  but we ought not to forget that those high intellectual abstractions that may
                  refine the intellect of the adult, are produced by the action of two senses,
                  equally suggestive of earlier and stronger emotions of a sensual character, in
                  those whose years have not allowed the accumulation of material for thought and
                  comparison.
               The piano, with judiciously selected vocal music, is not liable to so great an
                  objection; that instrument is certainly well adapted for early instruction in the
                  rudiments of music and patience; it is only to be regretted that it is so often
                  made the means of injury to the health of the learner, by occupying too much of
                  her attention, too frequently under the instruction of a teacher who seems utterly
                  unsuspicious of the existence of fingers or wrist-joints, or that the backbone is
                  composed of vertebræ. The bent position in which a delicate or scrofulous child is compelled to sit
                  for hours, practising a distasteful task, when nature cries aloud for air,
                  exercise and mirth (merely to please the aspirations of a vulgar mother, or needy
                  and perhaps incompetent teacher, and when, frequently, there is not a reasonable
                  hope of the wretched child attaining the age of puberty), forces upon us the
                  conviction that it plays a prominent part in the early sacrifice of female life;
                  indeed we think it may fairly be classed with the needle in its pernicious
                  results; a single hour for a strong one, or a half hour for a delicate child, is
                  all that should be devoted at one time, to this agreeable but dangerous
                  instrument.
               Dancing, an accomplishment admirably adapted to the promotion of gracefulness and
                  health, is too often made the means of developing impurity of taste in the young.
                  That charming union of dignity and grace, so observable in the movements of that
                  elegant dance of our ancestors, the minuet, serves by contrast, to show the
                  sensual and impure character of some of the others; a few of the modern dances are
                  also well adapted for the young. It is deeply to be regretted, that we have so far
                  forgotten our national dignity, as to import the lascivious dances of the French
                  capital, for they are adapted neither to the health nor mental purity of our
                  children.
               The excessive indulgence in the dance in overheated ballrooms, is productive of
                  some of the worst results brought under medical notice, and is one of the
                  principal causes of ill health in our young women. If the other branches of
                  education were invested with that charm that might be imparted to them by
                  competent instructors, the dance would not hold the youthful mind in such absolute
                  subjection. The nervous exhaustion attendant upon committing to memory long and
                  absurd tasks, during those hours when the young girl should forget that there is a
                  school, and which should be devoted entirely to exercise and pleasing diversion,
                  and above all, to walking in the open air, causes her to seize, too often with a
                  morbid and insane avidity, upon dancing, as the only real recreation she is
                  permitted to enjoy; consequently, that which is designed for a graceful
                  accomplishment and pleasing relaxation from more serious pursuits, often occupies'
                  the mind exclusively, and proves equally degrading to her intellect, and injurious
                  to her health.
               The oral system of instruction, the only method congenial to nature, should be
                  adopted in every school desirous of improving the youthful mind and body, and
                  elevating the intellect of the learner; then the reasoning powers would be
                  developed, and facts and beautiful and true analogies would fill the mind, instead
                  of musty rules, and words often as unintelligible to the teacher as to the
                  learner.
               Successfully to impart knowledge, the eloquence of the voice, the eye, the
                  countenance of an intellectual teacher, who loves his subject and his pupil, and
                  above all, who remembers the workings of his youthful mind, and has not forgotten
                  that dark period of his own life, when he was condemned to the miserable
                  punishment of standing before an ignorant automaton, with a lash or ferule in his
                  hand; his young heart burning for sympathy and knowledge, and filled with rage
                  against his persecutor; that is necessary, that is electrical in its effect. But
                  alas! that would require educated and accomplished instructors, who fully
                  appreciate their glorious calling, and above all, parents, to reward and honor
                  them. That method, with hourly relaxation, during which the mind could be
                  delighted and elevated by experiments in natural philosophy, and more especially
                  chemistry and physiology, music, and drawing, that would cultivate memory, reason,
                  judgment, and taste, that would refine the intellect and improve the heart.
               When the young girl enters society, too frequently at her sixteenth year, even if
                  she have, to appearance, escaped the
                  bodily evils we have enumerated, she is often hurled into a scene of dissipation
                  that speedily makes them evident, or she seals her fate by premature marriage and
                  the cares of a family, before either her mind or her body is fitted for her own
                  preservation, much less the guidance of children. Then follows the attendance of
                  some illy-educated or designing but diploma'd quack, and she is taught to believe
                  that his senseless prescriptions will cure her, without amending her habits of
                  life; thus she settles down into a nervous invalid.
               All this we often hear imputed to our climate. Look at our revolutionary
                  grandmothers, nay, our mothers! for many of them are yet here. We honestly
                  believe, on the honor of our manhood, and what little knowledge we have, that
                  there is comparatively nothing in our climate to bring about the condition of our
                  young women, nor even any defect in the original constitution of one-half of the
                  victims of early disease, that might not be overcome, were it not for the errors
                  of their early education, their early introduction into society, and the fulsome
                  adulations of our own sex. Society, in our country, is composed of boys and
                  girls—not men and women. The senseless and degrading flattery with which her ears
                  are constantly filled, pre-occupies the mind of the poor girl in the whirl of
                  fashion and dissipation, and robs her of the benefit of that keen instinct and
                  delicate perception, she derives from her finer and more -delicate organization;
                  but of this we deprive her by the errors of her early training. The fault is ours,
                  not hers, but full sadly does she suffer for it.
               But we might protract this subject indefinitely, aye, even to the filling of a
                  volume, and all we could say would go to prove, that as a nation we live too fast,
                  we educate our children too superficially, and their nervous system at the expense
                  of their intellect. Our great master, John Hunter, has told us, that "increased
                  action is followed by diminished power," and this is as applicable to the arteries
                  of a human being, as to the hose of an engine. There is a regular series of
                  changes from the earliest infancy, to that period when we pay back the debt of
                  nature, that show by their unvaried sequence in such as die in advanced age, that
                  the intention of nature was, that we should not be resolved into our original
                  elements, until the gradual decay of our faculties rendered us of little use to
                  those who surround us.
               Not only other animals, but the vegetable kingdom, afford ample analogical proof,
                  that a healthy maturity and natural decay, await those only who have not been
                  forced to a premature development. The majestic oak that strikes its roots deep
                  into the earth, or "tosses its giant arms from the stormy promontory," and derives
                  increasing strength from the storms of heaven—the lordly and ponderous elephant
                  that tramps over the plains of India—the eagle that "sails athwart the skies and
                  o'er the rolling deep," and that mighty monster that sports amid the billows, and
                  whose vast bulk is nourished with hecatombs of living creatures, all derive length
                  of days, majesty and power, from following the simple and natural dictates of our
                  ever-watchful but inexorable mother. Man alone, with his lofty powers of reason,
                  from the influence of unrestrained passion and disobedience to her laws, is
                  subject by infinite odds, to a far greater number of casualties, that break the
                  brittle thread of his existence, and cause him to water the earth with his tears,
                  than any of the superior tribes of animals.
               We look with comparative calmness upon the face of the aged and virtuous parent,
                  as it lies shrouded in the dignity of death; our hearts may bleed, but we feel no
                  shock; reflection tells us, all the resources of joy and mirth are exhausted; the
                  life-spark has passed into the survivors; in the beautiful language of Scripture,
                  "being dead it yet speaketh." The body is about to "mingle with the atmosphere and
                  earth, whence it originated," and the spirit to return to its God. But oh! when
                  youth and vigor and hope are summoned,
                  when death, comes to them arrayed in the hideousness of disease, racking the
                  bones, wasting the flesh sending fever through the blood, and playing its dreadful
                  experiments upon the fragile form of loveliness, which the kindness of parent,
                  brother, friend, "has scarce suffered the winds of heaven to visit too roughly,"
                  tearing them from earth, its prospects of bliss, and the convulsive grasp of
                  affection, then indeed, we have cause to shudder at the consequences of our
                  departure from the beneficent laws of our Creator.
            
            
               SKETCHES OF A WESTERN STUDENT'S LIFE.
               THE CAMP-MEETING—A GRAPHIC SCENE—A REVIVAL—A SERMON—LUDICROUS
                  EVENT—ZACCHEUS—CAMP-MEETING WOLVES—A MIDNIGHT ATTACK—PECULIAR GENIUS OF THE TRUE
                  METHODIST PREACHER, BY A BACKSLIDER.
               ON a road that runs through a rough wood country, along a clear stream, towards
                  Batavia, in Western New York, at the junction of two small streams, may be found a
                  sloping dell, shaded with beech and maple. There our Methodist friends had pitched
                  their tents, and prepared for a camp meeting—and there, as I had a medical
                  vacation, I accompanied them It was a week before Conference, and all the big guns
                  were on their way to the gathering at Rochester. On Thursday night, the whole
                  forest was specked over with white tents; the brush was cleared out; the logs
                  rolled into lines, and seats made with slabs and boards and green poles. Around
                  the encampment, a rude brush fence was reared, to keep off the disciples of the
                  adversary. At the bottom of this dell, the altar was located—built of rude hemlock
                  boards; and directly in front of it, at the distance of forty feet, stood a
                  beautiful young maple, with a round top and a very smooth, straight trunk. In
                  clearing, the ground, the devil had taken advantage of this tree to destroy the
                  meeting, and instigated the brethren to spare it for its beauty. Who could be so
                  wicked as to destroy such a beautiful young maple?
               From all the hills and vales for twenty miles around, by Friday night, the
                  brethren had come in, and the hale honest faces of the old and the young sisters, lighted the throng with an air of
                  goodness. There is a frankness and sincerity among Methodist women, that greatly
                  endears them to me. I love frankness and a plain straightforwardness above all
                  other gifts of Heaven. The tent coverings were all of white cotton and linen. All
                  the food was cooked, and fires were only kept to cheer the evening, and make their
                  tea. The air of the evenings was gentle and balmy as an angel's breath; and the
                  camp-fires flickered among the green trees, and lighted up the surrounding forest
                  with a holy splendor. The singing in the wild wood, by these night fires, the
                  white tents ranged in a vast circle, and each group or family by the tent door,
                  and a clear light flashing upon the altar and the broad plain faces of the large
                  circle of preachers, lighted up the whole scene with a wild enchantment, that I
                  can never forget. The evenings were opened by prayer and singing, and then a
                  sermon from some younger brother. They were saving the best bits for a Sabbath
                  treat; for a strong onset upon the citadel of Satan; and a grand gathering of the
                  saved into the fold of the Lord for a finale. My maternal grandfather was a
                  Methodist preacher, and after serving his country in the war, caused by the
                  tea-tax imposed by our wicked old mother, he emigrated to the head of the
                  Susquehanna river, and engaged in fighting the battles of free grace. After
                  planting small churches over a vast region of new country, and watering them with
                  the best love of his strong heart, broken with age? and weighed down with want, he
                  settled some miles from where our meeting occurred. His venerable remains, with
                  those of his partner, sleep in a rude church-yard, marked by no stone, and
                  remembered by but few. I always remember him with the deepest emotion; my own
                  spirit, like his, has always been full of wild-wood scenes, and camp-meeting
                  fervor.
               This was the last camp-meeting that I ever attended, and what made it a
                  particularly happy one to me was, that a young woman attended it, that afterwards
                  became my wife, Her figure was tall and graceful; her eye a deep clear blue; her
                  hair a light brown, and combed smooth over the brow, which gave her sweet and
                  smiling features a most charming simplicity. An hour was appointed for retirement
                  in all the tents, but somehow after prayers were done, we sat up a long time to
                     watch. Where love was proclaimed as free, our young spirits could
                  see no harm in loving; even after midnight, even when the camp-fires were but, and
                  the lamps were dim amongst the trees, the lamp of love shone brightly in our
                  hearts. Her old mother was always on hand, and as crafty as a hungry hawk; she
                  viewed me with no special regard, and frequently reproved her daughter for such
                  late watching, warning her that her soul would miss of a blessing if she did not
                  wait on the Lord. But nightly the sin of watching was repeated. We were to part in
                  throe days for the entire winter, and the thought of it was painful; so we sat for
                  hours locked in each other's arms, looking out on the dimly illumined trees, as
                  the camp-fires flickered for a moment, and then smouldered and slept for ever.
                  That may have been sin, and offensive to God, but those hours were pervaded with a
                  fathomless blessing, the memory of which wakes a strange echo in my spirit, and
                  now sends a wild thrill along my nerves, and big soul dew-drops coursing in the
                  furrows along my cheeks. Those camp-fires have been extinguished for fifteen
                  years, and my heart is yet full of life emotions. Four sons gather around my
                  table, the fruit of our love, and the dear one sleeps far away in the gravel bed,
                  and the green grass springs over that mound, around which my heart lingers with
                  increasing emotion.
               Saturday night came, and every hour the excitement became intense-the sermons more
                  rousing, the prayers more fervent, the singing more stirring. Symptoms of strange
                  excitement began to appear in many parts of the congregation; the regular sermon
                  had passed, and brother B. was called
                  on to exhort. He was a tall, lean man, with a large head, with nerves of fire and
                  a tongue of flame. The wind was still—not a leaf stirred; the forest was
                  flickering in the reflected light; his voice was naturally sweet and clear, and
                  after a while penetrated into the remotest corner of the vast circle where a human
                  being could stand or sit. Much speaking in the open air had injured his lungs, and
                  like George Whitfield, he was suffering dreadfully with the asthma. His first
                  words were clear but feeble, and his breath labored with intense force to still
                  the sense of suffocation. This painful movement soon gave way, and his notes
                  became full and deep, and rang on the ear like the tones of powerful music. Floods
                  of tears burst from his deep-blue eyes, as he painted the agonies of a lost soul,
                  hurled from the presence of God; he was seen floating on the surface of a burning
                  lake, amid a darkness that was visible; he lifted his despairing eyes towards a
                  throne of light, and wailed out in a tone of loud despair, "How long, O Lord! how
                  long shall I endure this dreadful torment!" and the finger of inexorable justice
                  pointed him to the fiery flood, and uttered, "Eternity, eternity shall not see the
                  duration of thy sufferings!" The soul in despair sank into the boiling flood, and
                  groaned away the slow revolving years. Suddenly a dreadful light illumined the
                  vast cavern, and amid the red waves of the fire-flood, fragments of red-hot rock
                  shot upwards; some unseen force from beneath, hurled the damned spirits into the
                  hot and stifling air, from which they fell with yells and shrieks upon the points
                  of heated rock, breaking them into spiritual fragments, and as they sank beneath
                  the heated flood, they wrote in letters of lurid light, "Lost! lost! No hope! no
                  hope!" The frame of the preacher trembled under the reflection of his own picture,
                  and as his own excitement increased, that of his hearers seemed to follow him,
                  till the whole vast assembly swayed like a blast-smitten forest under his magic
                  eloquence. A loud scream issued from the very heart of the congregation, and a
                  noted rowdy, who had sought to disturb the meeting, fell stiffened to the earth.
                  The falling became general; on every hand, men and women, old and young, dropped
                  as if mown down by the scythe of death, and four of his brethren lay stretched on
                  the floor of the altar beside the exhausted speaker; One, a large man of a
                  powerful frame, with light skin and red hair, rose to his feet, with his eyes
                  closed, and moved up to the side of the speaker; a heavenly smile played on his
                  face; he tried to shout, but could not; he rocked to and fro on his feet for the
                  space of a minute, as if held up by some powerful attraction, and then fell
                  senseless at full length on the floor. His body was stiff, as most of them were.
                  The speaker soon began to feel the effects of his tremendous power; his silvery
                  voice became fainter, his gestures milder; a radiance of glory passed over his
                  face, and he sank back exhausted upon the floor. Faint shouts broke from some one
                  sitting in the congregation, then a chorus of shouts went up; hands were clapped,
                  and "Praise God," was breathed by a hundred voices over the assembly. The leaves,
                  fire-lit on the trees, seemed to flutter with emotion, and all the air seemed
                  stirred with a holy breath, and the sighs of angels seemed to kindle the ether
                  into a spirit flame. The tall, pale, blue-eyed figure, that sat beside me in the
                  tent, had leaned her head on my breast, and with my right hand clasped in hers,
                  was lost in reverie. Whether in the body or out, I know not, but my physical being
                  seemed lost, abstracted, and I was floating in a balmy sea of speechless joy. At
                  this juncture, a sister began to sing the words beginning: 
                     
                        "Come, Holy Ghost, all-quickening fire,
                        Come, and my hallowed heart inspire;
                        Sprinkled with the eternal blood,
                        Now to myself thyself reveal,
                        Thy mighty working let me feel
                        And know that I am born of God."
                     
                  
               
               
               Her voice rang through the air like a tenor trumpet, and in a moment a thousand
                  tongues seemed joined in the chorus of hallelujah, that pealed forth among the
                  trees, over the altar, and died off in a joyous echo in the distant forest. The
                  singing had not continued long, when a brother jumped to his feet, and shouted
                  with a voice that bordered on the fierce, and rushing wildly forward, he seized
                  the first man he met in his arms, and shouted till the woods rang again, Glory!
                  Glory! Glory! He rushed from person to person, repeating the salutation, till a
                  large part of the audience were seen rushing into each other's arms, wildly
                  embracing, weeping, and crying glory! The marble brow that rested on my breast,
                  was white as paper; those blue eyes were closed, and the gently parted lips softly
                  whispered in my ear, again and again, Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!—"Jesus can make a dying
                  bed feel soft as downy pillows are." Fifteen years have elapsed since the scene
                  described occurred, but at times I see those white tents, the camp-fires, the
                  grave old forest, illumined with a living light. That silent soul-whisper—I hear
                  it still-it rushes along my nerves like a stream of fire, and my body is pervaded
                  by a sensation I cannot describe. That marble brow is cold now; those deep-blue
                  eyes are closed, and those whispering lips are silent for ever. This sympathetic
                  excitement rushed through the congregation like a tempest, and continued for more
                  than an hour. When it subsided, the groups retired to their tents, but no sleep
                  came to the camp that night; the people were too happy; God had blessed them; they
                  sang, prayed, shouted, and clapped hands and groaned in the depths of their deep,
                  delirious agony of joy. If such religious scenes are a delusion, then a lie may
                  become ecstatic.
               One after another of these spiritual revellers fell asleep, till the voice of
                  praise and thanksgiving was hushed in every tent; and when the sun rose, with his
                  broad round face bathed in smiling light, he darted his glancing beams on the camp
                  where stillness reigned as in the house of death I passed around from tent to
                  tent, and that deep pervading joy still lingered on many a face, and many a
                  dreamer whispered the name of Jesus in his sleep, and clasped his hands m an
                  ecstasy of prayer.
               The scene I hare described is vulgarly called the "power" or a "spiritual
                  outpouring;" but much controversy exists m the world, as to what it should be
                  called, and to what cause it should be assigned. Similar phenomena have been seen
                  m all ages, and under the administration of the religious life of the
                  noble-hearted John Wesley and his co-laborers such scenes often occurred,
                  sometimes with individuals and sometimes with the entire multitude. To those sects
                  who deny the power of the Spirit, such occurrences appear either a delusion or a
                  mystery; but candor demands that some explanation should be found, that will solve
                  the problem in a more rational manner. True it is, that such an influence often
                  sweeps through the entire community, changing the life-long character of
                  individuals, and often of a still larger number, who steadily through life abide
                  by the teaching of the gospel.
               Persons of a highly-wrought nervous temperament of a scrofulous and consumptive
                  diathesis, are certainly more likely to be affected with such influences, as well
                  as evil ones; but that, by no means, answers the objection that these influences
                  are emotional only. If the speaker, at such an hour, should send out in his voice,
                  from his eyes, his face and his hands, the canine virus sufficient to penetrate
                  every person present, instead of the scene described, we should see a multitude
                  laboring under the horrible effects of hydrophobia; but if, instead of this, he
                  emanates in his voice, from his eyes, his face, and his hands, a psychical and
                  mental aura, deeply charged with the moral and spiritual element of a loving
                  nature, sufficient to affect the masses, he, by an inevitable law, induces in them
                  his own state of mind and heart.
                  Whether this aura is generated in the brain of a speaker, with powerful love
                  elements within him, or is derived by influx
                  from the invisible but exhaustless source of love from the Deity, is a question
                  that I leave others to settle. Whatever its source may be, it is certainly an
                  all-pervading love force, that acts with wonderful power.
               When rightly understood, the phenomena of religious revivals may be found to
                  accord with the highest elements of an enlightened mental and moral philosophy;
                  for it is true that John Wesley, by his individual labors, and the labors of those
                  whom he impressed, elevated the intellectual and moral and spiritual characters of
                  tens of thousands, nay, of millions of human beings. Love certainly works no ill
                  to its neighbor, and such love scenes as described at this meeting, prove
                  conclusively the assertion of the lady who affirmed that "nothing was half so
                  sweet as love, and she could never get half enough of it."
               Sabbath morning broke in with a cheerful face; the morning prayers were said, and
                  the congregation seated; the altar filled with queer faces: for an assembly of
                  Methodist preachers presents, to my eyes, one of the richest, most marked, and
                  queerest collection of human heads and faces, that I have ever met in any place.
                  The ten o'clock sermon was assigned to the Presiding Elder, a stout, square-built
                  man, his face rigged in fun and pervaded with a subtle roguery. He intended to
                  preach the sermon of the meeting, but it was too late; the master of
                  the storm had passed through the camp of Israel; the wild surge of excitement had
                  stunned and prostrated the people; they looked exhausted. Elder H. began to chop
                  logic, and reason about love and righteousness, but why reason about
                  that which the people had felt in such overpowering torrents? He could demonstrate
                  the law of God to be "perfect, converting the soul," but he could
                  not, with the blazing tongue of an archangel, suspend the sinner over the burning
                  gulf by a single hair, and cause him to hear the deep wild welter of the blazing
                  waves beneath his feet, and feel that God would be just to clip that
                  hair with the scissors of Divine vengeance, and let the trembling soul drop into
                  the gulf, red with a "darkness that was visible" as noonday, and groan away the
                  years that have no end. Br. B. had spoiled the Elder's sermon. Our Mend H. roused
                  himself, for he felt that a load was on him. He labored like a foundering vessel,
                  amid a heavy sea, battling, the waves; still he gestured like one beating against
                  a vacuum. All the time our exhorter, who had rode on the storm the previous night,
                  sat a little way off, looking up archly into his brother's face, smilingly, as if
                  to say, "Now you cannot lift that load, brother; the tempest-creating soul of
                  faith, and fire, and tongue of flame, passed by last night, and you are only
                  trying to find the footprints of the storm spirit." I feared all the time that he
                  was enjoying the embarrassment of Brother H., for he was brim-fall of mischief,
                  and those sober-looking jolly old fellows, even to the oldest and gravest, love a
                  joke, even at their own expense.
               A little incident soon turned the opening revival into a tempest of fun, that
                  swept all seriousness from the hearts of the people. A short, black-eyed,
                  curly-haired, laughing witch of a boy, had found himself crowded for room, before
                  the opening service of the morning, and clambered, like Zaccheus, into the
                  beautiful maple tree standing nearly in front of the altar. His glances soon began
                  to annoy the speaker, and he called out to him, "Zaccheus, come down from that
                  tree." He never moved, but the suppressed titter that swept through the crowd,
                  showed clearly that everybody felt good-natured. This was natural, for the people
                  had enjoyed a happy night, and the sun had ushered in a most smiling morning,
                  Laughter is only the spoken language of joy. A little consultation followed among
                  the clergy in the stand, and in a moment, a big, stout, burly, black-eyed man appeared in front of the altar with
                  an axe in his hand. It was Elder Gr.; his hair a little grey, but the very man
                  that a general would select for storming a redoubt, or leading an army of men to
                  the cannon's mouth. He gave no time for parley, but glided quickly to the foot of
                  the tree, and the next moment saw the glittering edge of the axe circling through
                  the air in quick and rapid strokes, and before the multitude had time to think,
                  the straight, round-topped maple waved for a moment, and fell with our hero to the
                  ground. This most deeply amused the old joker in the stand, for he always had a
                  smile on his face, and this time it grew deeper and broader, and almost became a
                  laugh. He broke the silence, finally, and shouted in a triumphant voice, "Every
                  tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, shall be hewn down and cast into the
                  fire. Brother Gr. has laid the axe at the root of the tree this time;" and the
                  good feeling of the crowd rose with the good feeling of the speaker, till all
                  seriousness fled from their faces, and laughter and general mirth soon pervaded
                  the assembly.
               The lad was not hurt, but was sadly taken aback. My first impulse was to kick the
                  chopper for spoiling- the beautiful tree, that had no hand in the fray, but as is
                  usual, had become the victim. To get up in sight of the crowd, and walk through
                  the encampment, was the largest load that the lad ever carried. His eye, black as
                  a raven's, flashed and gleamed with the red fire of wounded pride and thwarted
                  pleasure, that soon resolved itself into action. The crowd were all now gazing at
                  the lad; the ministers and ladies were smiling, and all seemed to go against him.
                  He passed quickly to the left of the masses, and in less than no time, a platoon
                  of a dozen of outsiders (visitors come to laugh) were around him. The meeting and
                  ministers, with some truth, perhaps, began to fear an onset on the tents and the
                  camp, for the b'hoys were all there, as it was Sunday, and their force numbered a
                  hundred or more resolute rascals, most of them young men grown. Always prompt in
                  danger, brother Gr., who had laid the axe at the root of the tree, ordered a
                  justice and a posse to the spot, and an attempt was made to arrest some of the
                  leaders. The justice, a slim, feeble man, seized the curly-headed lad by the
                  collar, and the rest of his assistants seized each their man. The whole encampment
                  had laughed at the lad, and my sympathies were with him, and a burning desire
                  seized me to aid in his escape. Mercy to a fallen foe, is the rule of all
                  honorable warfare, and the biggest of all sinners, in my eye, is the man who sets
                  the crowd to laughing at some unlucky culprit. Crucifixion is a mercy, compared to
                  a tittering multitude. In two minutes the rowdies and posse were surrounded by a
                  heated crowd, and as if by magic, the whole body bent its way towards a
                  precipitous hill. The chaps in the centre pulled, and twenty or more on the
                  outside pushed resolutely against the crowd who were behind, with zeal for the
                  Lord of hosts, and neither saw nor knew anything but victory. This impulse
                  followed the struggling throng to the verge of the bank, and the posse began now
                  to struggle fearfully to get away, but their enemy held them firmly and dragged
                  them headlong over the bank, a precipitous descent of some fifteen feet. The head
                  of the column disappeared like a body of men under the fire of a battery, and the
                  tail began to think of escaping; but the resolute few triumphed, and more than a
                  hundred men tumbled in a mass down the dusty, muddy, rocky sides of the bank, into
                  a broad wagon track on the side of a steep hill. The culprits now broke away and
                  ran over or knocked down whoever opposed them. The crowd in the camp was all
                  hubbub and excitement, and our good old brother who was speaking, and understood
                  well the temper of multitudes, stood paralyzed at the altar. He once broke out in
                  an exclamation, "What under heaven are men made of!" as the crowd disappeared over
                  the descent. The justice and posse returned, bearing no trophies, but all covered with dust, as of a
                  hotly-contested battle.
               The brother resumed his sermon, but it was in vain to essay to raise the multitude
                  from the pitfall of impressions so serious and ludicrous. The sermon went on, but
                  nobody heard. Another and another took the stand for the day, but the spirit of
                  the meeting did not return. The rowdies, however, did return at night to the
                  contiguous forest, and the yells and howls that beset the meeting, would have
                  disturbed hell itself. Scouts were sent into the woods, and captured here and
                  there a straggler, among whom was the curly-headed boy who had, by climbing the
                  tree, been the cause, though unintentionally, of all the trouble. He was lodged in
                  the inclosure below the altar, and remained quiet till about four o'clock at
                  night, when sleep oppressed all eyes, when suddenly a gang of camp-meeting wolves
                  issued from the forest, tore a board from the inclosure, and the lad leaped
                  through the opening and disappeared in the forest with the agility of a retreating
                  Indian, carrying with him, however, a new pair of calf-skin boots, owned by a
                  young clergyman who was to be married the next day. This nettled the Elder to the
                  very quick, and he laughed almost aloud when he remarked, "The devil is too
                  cunning for us this time." The Sabbath passed, the preaching ended, the prayers
                  were said, but no progress could be made; the new converts were wavering, and the
                  strong rowdy who fell the night before, was now among the wild spirits of the
                  woods, guiding them to victory. Monday morning came, and with it a warrant to
                  arrest the black-eyed preacher who had chopped down the tree, on a charge of
                  performing unnecessary labor on the Sabbath day. He went before the justice, and
                  seeing no chance of escape from so plain a case, he paid his five dollars and
                  returned to the camp to appeal to the brethren to refund the five, and the price
                  of the stolen boots. The meeting closed at a little past noon, and as the
                  multitude passed out of the gap in the brush fence, our presiding Elder appealed
                  to them in the name of the stolen boots. "Brethren," said he, "let
                  the devil see that God has as many friends here as he has;" and they did so, to
                  the tune of twenty dollars and five cents, which was duly paid over to the young
                  brother, who was sure of his bride, and more sure of his missing boots.
               I love a noisy camp-meeting, and would go twenty miles on foot to attend one; and
                  in spite of the sympathy I felt for the victim of the axe, I would stand all night
                  as sentinel, wielding a rusty musket, provided it was unloaded, to protect these
                  good people in their earnest, though boisterous mode of worship. I took a seat
                  beside the exhorter, in a large wagon, and wended my way up hill and through dale,
                  with a large number of preachers, to the house of Brother H., where the nuptials
                  were to be solemnized.
               I parted with these friends at Rochester, in the great stone church, and have
                  since beheld none of their faces. They are a brave, jolly, noble, generous set of
                  men, who love good for its own sake, and labor for the race with a strong arm and
                  moderate fare. The world may accuse them of mercenary views, but as a body, they
                  have as much available talent as can be found in the same number of men on the
                  globe, and might, in any of the professions, wield it for money or power; but it
                  is just as true that they are generally poor, and choose to be so for the sake of
                  the gospel. I have awfully backslid since those joyous clays-not so much in heart
                  as in doctrine—but I love, with a deep affection, those brave and noisy spirits,
                  and I hope some day to see them march in a body through the gates of the golden
                  city, waving the palms of victory, and shouting their triumph through the streets
                  of the New Jerusalem. They deserve a home in heaven.
            
            
               
               THE SENSE OF FEELING.
               INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE ON HEALTH, AND EFFECT OF ATMOSPHERIC
                  ELECTRICITY.
               NOTWITHSTANDING the great importance of protecting infants from cold, they ought
                  early to be accustomed to endure atmospheric changes. The experience of almost
                  every intelligent person, will furnish him with instances where the greatest evils
                  have arisen from a neglect to establish, at an early period of life, the habit of
                  resisting atmospheric changes. Entire families, who have suffered their children
                  to grow up surrounded constantly by artificial heat, have exhibited its serious
                  effects in the constant liability to various affections of the lungs and
                  air-passages, the slightest exposure being sufficient to cause inflammation of the
                  lungs, or that most dreaded of all diseases of childhood, the croup. Nor is the
                  evil confined to childhood. The adult suffers from the neglect at the early period
                  of life, which, like the neglect of the proper direction of the intellect in
                  youth, leaves the effects throughout the whole duration of life.
               We are decided advocates for leaving the head of an infant uncovered; at any rate,
                  after the first month, caps should be altogether dispensed with, as not only
                  unnecessary, but absolutely injurious, from accumulating too much warmth about the
                  head. The general clothing ought also to be lightened, and he ought to be kept
                  from the fire, and washed with water at first warm, but by degrees decidedly cold.
                  In this manner, the external covering of the skin will be hardened, and its nerves
                  become insensible to the cold. It must, however, be clearly understood, that this
                  must be gradually effected; and if the child experiences any pain from this course
                  which makes him cry, it is a proof that the attempt is too suddenly made. When
                  once these habits are established, they should be continued through life, for they
                  are the most certain guarantees of health, and may be regarded as a species of
                  resource kept in reserve, to be advantageously employed against causes of disease
                  which cannot be removed.
               When arrived at puberty, an age when the faculty of producing heat is at the
                  highest degree, when summer is more to be feared than winter, the youth, that he
                  may not lose this valuable power of resisting cold and heat, should never in cold
                  countries habituate himself to remain in close and heated apartments.
               If any one neglects to inure himself to the changes of the atmosphere, there
                  remains nothing for him but to shun all exposure. He should be on his guard at the
                  period of the changes of the seasons, and use particular care, while he at the
                  same time changes the nature of his clothing.
               As old age approaches, the power to produce heat diminishes, and between the age
                  of forty and fifty years, a chilliness is apt to be experienced on the approach of
                  winter, which the individual previously would have borne without experiencing any
                  inconvenience. At a later period, the effects are evident in the increased
                  mortality of old people, nothing being more common than the occurrence of many
                  deaths among the aged during the prevalence of intensely cold weather, while the
                  deaths among this class are comparatively few during warm weather. Thus it
                  appears, that the susceptibility to cold increases at the two extremes of life.
                  Great care should therefore be taken by aged persons, to guard themselves from the
                  effects of cold, without any efforts to "harden," as the danger is imminent in
                  such an attempt—for their condition is
                  far more irremediable than that of the infant.
               While treating of the skin, as an organ of feeling, and of the condition of the
                  atmosphere in making an impression on that organ, the electricity of this medium
                  must not be passed over; for this also, as well as temperature, reaches the system
                  through the nerves of the skin, and finds its passage by means of the atmosphere.
                  A brief consideration of the manner in which this fluid acts, and the appropriate
                  measures to prevent the evil consequences which sometimes result from it, may very
                  properly be treated of under the head of feeling.
               
               All bodies possess electric properties, but in different degrees—each one
                  possessing its own capacity for that fluid—that is, a power to retain it, or to
                  allow of its passage. The globe is an inexhaustible source of electricity, and it
                  is on this account denominated the common reservoir. The electric fluid, as was
                  just observed, exists in different quantities in various substances, and the
                  excess or deficiency is distinguished by the terms positive and negative. In the
                  ordinary state of bodies, and when it exists in equal proportions, electricity
                  does not manifest itself by any sensible phenomena; it is only when there is an
                  excess and deficiency in two bodies that approach each other, that the presence of
                  this fluid is made apparent to our senses. Heat and friction are usually employed
                  to develop electricity, and to impart it to a body. In a free state, electricity
                  of the same kind repels that of an opposite. The positive state always repels the
                  positive, and the negative repels the body negatively electrified, while those of
                  an opposite nature attract each other. An electrified body placed in contact with
                  a body that can conduct electricity, imparts to it a portion of its electricity.
                  The metals, many animal substances, except oils, conduct it; glass, resins, silk,
                  dry air, are bad conductors. Those bodies in which electricity is developed, are
                  said to be insulated when there is no communication with a conducting body.
               When the equilibrium is perfect between the electric fluid of the globe and that
                  of the atmosphere—that is, when these two grand reservoirs possess an equal
                  quantity, no electric phenomena are perceived, yet it possesses in organized
                  matter some action; this action is not here noticed, as it possesses no sensation,
                  to consider which, in all its bearings, being the object of the present essay.
               Where there exists a difference between the electricity of the globe and that of
                  clouds, an electric action is often manifested by signs more or less marked, and
                  which make an impression upon man to a greater or less extent. When the air. is
                  moist, and when the clouds are not at a great distance from the earth, the
                  electricity passes silently from the clouds, and no phenomena occur; this will
                  often be the case when there is a fog, or even a heavy dew. On the contrary, if
                  the air continues dry in the space between the clouds and the earth, the
                  equilibrium is established with a sudden concussion, accompanied with a bright
                  light, giving rise to the phenomena of thunder and lightning. Distant, rumbling
                  thunder, without a flash, is the electric explosion between two clouds, one above
                  the other, which renders the explosion invisible from the earth, the cloud
                  surcharged with electricity discharging it into that where there exists a
                  deficiency. When the electric fluid strikes the earth, it was formerly thought
                  that a thunderbolt had fallen, and all the phenomena of electricity were referred
                  to the noise; even at the present day, this idea prevails among the ignorant, and
                  pieces of stone of a peculiar form are regarded as the "bolt" itself.
               It will easily be understood that man, placed in the midst of these influences,
                  would manifest some of their effects; such is the case, as will be seen by a few
                  facts, which probably have fallen under the notice of most persons. If clouds, charged with electricity,
                  remain for some time without parting with it to the earth—either because they do
                  not contain a sufficient quantity of this fluid for the explosion to take place,
                  or because the equilibrium is in the process of being established between
                  them—some persons of nervous temperament experience an oppression of a very
                  remarkable kind, which enables them to foretell an approaching storm, with
                  thunder, without its being announced by any other sign. This oppression bears no
                  resemblance to that produced by heat—it is accompanied by an internal commotion of
                  a peculiarly disagreeable character, trembling of the limbs, a feeling of
                  distress, and an anxiety of a painful nature. Others experience distress in the
                  digestive organs, especially in the bowels; sometimes there is diarrhœa, and even
                  vomiting. Some have wandering pains in the joints, in the places of old healed
                  wounds, on the stumps of amputated limbs, pains in the corns of the toes, when the
                  thickening of the skin is rot old. These effects disappear when the equilibrium is
                  about to be established; and after the first explosions, a relief is
                  experienced.
               Some persons have a frequency of pulse just before the storm arises, which
                  continues until it ceases. It is very difficult to. account for these facts; but
                  we know from the electrometer—a delicate instrument for measuring the presence of
                  electricity—that atmospheric electricity will be made apparent even when no other
                  manifestation of its presence exists, and doubtless to the positive and negative
                  conditions existing between the atmosphere and the human body, even to a very
                  minute extent, that these phenomena are attributable.
               Several curious facts have been noticed from the earliest antiquity, connected
                  with electricity, which were formerly referred to the interference of spiritual
                  beings in the affairs of men. The most common was the appearance of a tuft or
                  flame of light upon the spears of soldiers, which was regarded as an omen of no
                  small importance. The electricity upon the tops of masts was formerly considered
                  as spirits. "Fiery spirits or devils are such as commonly work by blazing stars,
                  fire-drakes, etc." "Likewise they counterfeit suns and moons oftentimes, and sit
                  on ships' masts," remarks old Burton, in his curious work, The Anatomy of
                  Melancholy.
               Experience taught those who were more exposed to the effects of sudden electrical
                  explosions from clouds, that these pointed bodies were useful for their
                  protection; and it is stated that in the reign of Louis XIV., sailors were in the
                  habit of affixing a pointed sword to the mast. A learned priest, the Abbé Shiers,
                  who died in 1703, in enumerating the superstitious practices of his time, mentions
                  this as one which was always used during or before an expected storm. The immortal
                  discovery of Franklin, however, explained the practice on philosophical
                  principles.
               In tropical regions, in sultry weather, it is an occasional occurrence, when the
                  air is extremely heated, to see the presence of electricity manifested by small
                  tufts of light upon the various parts of the clothes—the same appearance takes
                  place at the extremities of the fingers, hair, etc. Such phenomena will Only occur
                  when the air is very dry, and the electric fluid is seeking a passage as it were,
                  to the common reservoir, the earth.
               The evil effects of atmospheric electricity may be obviated by the general means
                  which destroy the excessive susceptibility of the nervous system—such as exercise,
                  sleep taken in sufficient quantity, and at appropriate periods, absence of all
                  stimulants of the brain, cold bathing, a country residence, etc. Even at the time
                  of the storm, the intensity of its effects may be obviated by avoiding too great a
                  variety of food, and particularly of such as is of an opposite quality, the
                  promotion of digestion by agreeable conversation, a walk in a cool apartment,
                  etc.
               
               Besides these effects, a man may experience such as arise from the concussion
                  whenever his body becomes the medium of communication, or the conductor of
                  electricity. The shock is oftentimes so severe as to kill him instantaneously,
                  especially if his body is wet; sometimes the fluid will glance along the body,
                  leaving marks, and often burning it with great severity; at other times, death has
                  occurred without any shock whatever, apparently by the sudden vacuum occurring,
                  whereby the individual has been suddenly deprived of breath; the sensations
                  described by those who have recovered, appear to warrant this conclusion.
               To prevent these effects, we must avail ourselves of the facts which science has
                  demonstrated to us in the use both of conducting and non-conducting bodies. The
                  ordinary lightning-rod, so much in use in this country, is the best instrument for
                  silently conducting the electricity to the earth. The modern mode of covering the
                  roofs of houses with metal, If this is connected with a tin leader reaching to the
                  ground, is the next best method of protection by means of a conductor—there being
                  innumerable small edges and points on the roof, which serve to attract the
                  electricity silently from the clouds.
               Stone is a bad conductor; a seat upon the stone steps of a cellar for fearful
                  persons, will afford sufficient assurance of safety. A feather bed is another safe
                  place of refuge. Two equally opposite means could scarcely be found, and the most
                  diverse peculiarity of taste could be satisfied in selecting a secure retreat from
                  the terrors of a thunderstorm. The bedstead should be removed from the wall; a
                  seat should never be taken by a window, under a tree, or by a fire-place. The
                  latter, especially, should be avoided—for not only is the chimney liable to be
                  struck from its being the highest part of the house, but when wood or bituminous
                  coal is burned, it is coated with soot, a substance possessing great conducting
                  properties.
               Before the introduction of lightning-rods, lightning was often a cause of death,
                  especially previous to the early part of the last century (when, in some parts of
                  Europe, it was the custom to ring the bells during a thunder-storm, on account of
                  a superstitious notion prevalent at that time), by the exposure of persons to the
                  attraction of points, and the conducting power of moist ropes. During the night of
                  the fifteenth of April, 1718, the lightning struck in Lower Brittany, in the space
                  which separates Landerman from Saint-Paul-de-Leon, upon twenty-four steeples, and
                  those particularly in which bells were rung for the purpose of averting such an
                  occurrence. On the eleventh of July, 1819, while the bell in the village of
                  Chateaux Vieux was tolling on the occasion of a funeral celebration, the lightning
                  struck the steeple, killed nine persons on the spot, and wounded twenty-two.
                  Statistics of such occurrences have been made in Prance, from which it appears
                  that during the space of thirty-three years, the lightning struck three hundred
                  and eighty-six steeples, and killed one hundred and three bell-ringers! These
                  results could only happen, while prejudices are maintained against the use of
                  lightning conductors. In our own country, where conductors are in general use,
                  these accidents are never heard of.
               It is dangerous, also, to fly kites during a thunder-storm, especially as the
                  drops of water render the string wet, and which thereby becomes a conductor.
               It has been estimated, by a calculation founded upon the difference in the
                  rapidity of the movement of the light and sound, that when the cloud is at the
                  distance of nine hundred and seventy-eight feet, a second, or one pulsation of the
                  artery, may be counted between the flash and the noise; two thousand and
                  seventy-six feet, when two are counted, and so on. If this estimate of the
                  distance of electric bodies is of little utility in guarding against accidents, it
                  will at least serve to re-assure timid persons, by proving to them that when they have seen the light they need not
                  fear the explosion.
               Some animals possess the power of imparting an electric shock, and employ it for
                  the purpose of disabling their prey, or defending themselves from the attacks of
                  an enemy. The torpedo, cramp-fish, and electrical eel, are among these. The last
                  mentioned, gymnotus electricus, abounds in the
                  rivers and stagnant pools in Columbia, S. A. It is of considerable size, being
                  about six feet long. The electric shock is conveyed through the hand, or any
                  metallic conductor which, touches the fish; and a stroke of one of the largest
                  kind would prove instant death to a man. The angler sometimes receives a shock
                  from them through the wetted rod and fishing line. An old frequented road near
                  Urutica, has been actually abandoned, on account of the danger experienced from
                  crossing a ford, where the mules were, from the effects of concealed shocks, often
                  paralyzed and drowned.
               This faculty has not been confined entirely to the lower animals. A very curious
                  fact was related in the journals a few years since, where a young infant was found
                  to possess the power of giving a severe shock to those who first handled it. A
                  series of philosophical experiments were tried with this animated electrical
                  machine. The child was placed in a cradle, which was put upon glass legs, and from
                  the body a Leyden jar was charged, sparks were drawn, and many other of the usual
                  phenomena of an electrical machine were exhibited.
            
            
               SKETCHES OF WESTERN PRACTICE.
               HAVE you ever had a ride on the great western Mediterranean—silver-surfaced and
                  placid old Erie? She is one of that vast sisterhood of lakes, that stretches from
                  the Far West, through a region of two thousand miles in extent, and loses its
                  self-hood in the majestic Niagara. Her musical shores wash the whole northern
                  boundary of Ohio; and at short intervals, this glorious body of water is fed with
                  rivers,—some of which are worthy of the name, and others come creeping through a
                  bed of rank weeds, for a distance of fifty miles, and mingle their turbid waters
                  with this crystal fountain. Like all rivers skirted with marshes, a crop of
                  bilious fevers are occasionally worked into being, from the fermenting mass of
                  rotting vegetation found along their beds. It was on a main road—running through a
                  well-populated country—two miles from the bed of one of these rivers, that I set
                  myself down with my household gods, in a land of strangers. How I was to procure
                  bread, or what I was to do, were shrouded in the mysterious future. Memory came in
                  to console me: for in spite of myself, the "Diary of a London Physician," that I
                  had read in my younger days, came with its racy pictures, flitting before my
                  mind's eye; and I knew not but I, too, might wish myself, my Mary, and my child,
                  sleeping in the cold grave, to hide me from the persecution that seemed to follow
                  me with such sleepless vigilance.
               There is an hour, even in the history of a physician, when cliques—the "old doctor" looking all the wiser for
                  his specs—and even fate, make their figures against us in yam. When pestilence
                  walks unseen in the midst of the people, slaying its victims in every house,
                  invading the altar and the office; the proud mansion of the aristocrat, and the
                  mud hovel of the peasant; then, in spite of all foes, will the cool head and clear
                  eye of a well-balanced judgment, triumph; the. common-sense act takes on the charm
                  of genius, and amid the general consternation, the fearless man becomes the oracle
                  of the hours. To resist the mad impulse of heroic medication, and protect the sick
                  from the hand of officious meddling, often, constitute the highest duty of the
                  medical adviser to the sick and dying.
               About one mile from where I had located, on a high rolling ridge, in a
                  highly-tilled region of country, and miles distant from river or marsh, a fever
                  was prevailing of the most fatal character. It was among a farming population,
                  accustomed to wholesome diet and laborious habits. It had been raging for two
                  months, and sad enough to tell, not a patient had been saved. All grades of
                  doctors had been consulted, till some twenty of the best medical men of the region
                  had been called in; and numerous quacks had displayed their skill with like
                  success. The location was marked by a single hotel and half a dozen dwellings; and
                  from this point, circling out the space of a mile, fifty persons had died with
                  this fatal epidemic.
               The landlord lost his wife and four children, the last two of whom died two days
                  after my arrival. These two, boys of ten and fourteen years, had passed through
                  various hands; the regulars had begun with them; they were both salivated, their
                  cheeks horribly ulcerated, and their lips nearly eaten through by its violent
                  action. So many had died under regular treatment, that a botanic had been called
                  to finish up the job for these poor lads. From the sad effects of cathartics and
                  emetics, they had passed rapidly under the influence of calomel, and at about the
                  eighteenth day had gone into the hands of this ignoramus. When I entered the room,
                  I found the two patients and the doctor alone. On a large table were spread his
                  implements of warfare. Whiteroot and crawley (monatropia
                     uniflora) tea; number six; a decoction of lobelia and sanguinaria;
                  and a wash of pepper and vinegar for the ulcers. They had fever, and took lobelia
                  and sanguinaria to relieve it; they were in a typhus state, and number six,
                  pepper, myrrh, and brandy, were given to hold up their strength; and then herb
                  tea, hot and parching, to urge on sweating. These devilish imps in the shape of
                  drugs, were poured into these poor lads once in ten or fifteen minutes. Death was
                  not long in taking advantage of such efficient assistance from the doctor! and the
                  scene closed in shrouds and coffins. In three days they were taking their long
                  rest. I passed round with a neighboring physician to see his last patient. A lad
                  of sixteen years lay stretched on a straw couch; he had taken freely of the Samson of the drug shops, and it had taken full effect; the palate
                  and fauces were ulcerated—the mouth swollen and painful—the teeth loose—and the
                  right cheek and lower lip nearly eaten away, by that dreadful disease, so
                  frequently seen after the injudicious use of Calomel. The physician, a young man
                  of fine acquirements, a graduate from Philadelphia, felt deeply chagrined at the
                  condition of his patient. He had merely intended to produce a mild action on the
                  mouth; and as he folded his hands upon his back, and drew a long breath, he
                  quietly observed, "that is a dreadful case of gangrene; Cancrum oris is a sad thing connected with such a fever." The
                  patient had bled profusely from the mouth and tonsils, and large masses of black,
                  fœtid slime poured out from the mouth, and the fast-decaying face. Death, the
                  doctor's only friend, in such a case, soon removed the sad sight from my friend's
                  eyes, and he indeed felt that the "ways of providence are mysterious."
               
               The resident physician was discouraged, and had fallen sick, and supposed himself
                  a subject of fever; he was, like all doctors, afraid of dying, and handled himself
                  with extreme care. He had called counsel, and a mild laxative had been prescribed,
                  and his head and face were profusely bathed in beet-juice, as the most cooling
                  thing of the season! It imparted a fine hue to his countenance, a glow that
                  bordered on a beautiful crimson.
               This was a genuine specimen of the rooting tribe, and had passed all
                  grades of employments, rising, like every true genius, till he had combined the
                  trio of accomplishments, of priest, lawyer, and doctor. His build was fat and
                  stout, his bowels of compassion were well rounded, his face round and jolly, with
                  one eye archly given to strabismus, imparting to the face a certain laughing,
                  mysterious shrewdness; the whole temperament fiery, a glib tongue, and an eye that
                  easily moistened at real or fictitious woe.
               He commenced his career as a Methodist exhorter, and taking religion with a
                  natural ease, he was often enabled to enjoy the power; but the bent
                  of his benevolence running too much in one direction, the brethren
                  shrewdly suspected him of an imprudence that need not be mentioned. He entered the
                  office of a country practitioner, and his "boss" falling sick with fever, he
                  mounted the horse, and was installed physician through the neighborhood; and in
                  three months his confidence in his knowledge of disease had so increased, that he
                  started for the West, and settled as a botanic doctor in the vicinity of
                  Cleveland.
               His religious traits still haunted him, and his benevolence inclining him to the
                  merciful, he commenced preaching and doctoring in the locality, proclaiming to all
                  the good news of restored health and universal redemption.
               Finding himself in command of a few hundred dollars, he removed to a new region
                  and a new location; adding to his already numerous vocations that of stump orator.
                  He informed me, that in the height of his glory, he had in a single day attended
                  the birth of two children—married a young couple—made a stump speech at an
                  election—and preached a funeral sermon of one of his own patients; and he laughed
                  through his crooked eye in a manner that showed him equally pleased in each act of
                  the drama. His pilgrimage had taught him wordly wisdom; his various fees had
                  secured him a good home, a small farm, a commodious house, surrounded by
                  out-houses, and a fine office, upon four corners in a country place; and the whole
                  set off by a large maple grove, in which, in the spring, I have often seen the
                  jolly puke, gathering sap, and boiling it into sugar.
               We well understand that physicians have no political rights; we may follow in the
                  wake of the warrior, building his throne on a pyramid of skulls, and floating
                  himself to glory and a throne on a sea of blood, and humbly bind up the cannon
                  shots and sabre cuts which he makes; we may staunch the blood of his bomb-mangled
                  victims, but we are still the tools, merely, of all politicians, and all
                  governments. Who ever heard of a physician's name in connection with any honorable
                  or profitable office? Our hero did not acquiesce in this general tenor of our
                  history; and when that political whirlwind passed over the land, which carried
                  Harrison to his long home through Washington, he embarked, soul and body, in the
                  struggle; built him a log-cabin, mounted it on a wagon, hoisted his flag on the
                  cabin, adorned it with hog-yokes, plow-points, sap-troughs, bundles of catnep and
                  tanzy, a barrel of cider, and some large Johnny-cakes, and started with an endless
                  train with flying banners, for the point where the people were to gather
                  together—Gog and Magog. He was next heard of at Fort Mei'gs, addressing a vast
                  army that no man could number, from whence he sailed to Buffalo, and with a
                  broadsword belted to his waist, scattered his fire and fanaticism among the hosts
                  of loaferdom that swarmed the wharves; but strange to tell, on his return home, he was defeated as a
                  candidate for the legislature, and has since expressed a most decided opinion that
                  republics are ungrateful.
               The next patient that fell sick of the fever, came into my hands; I had no
                  competitor, death had cleared the field; for as their patients went to the grave,
                  the confidence of the people went with the body. It was a lady about forty years
                  of age, of light and fragile form, the mother of a large family, and her excellent
                  character endeared her to all, and made her value to the family doubly felt.
               The terror that had shaken- the nerves of both patient and physician had become
                  extreme. This tremor I calmed by condemning all that my predecessors had done, and
                  that fiat found a ready response in the hearts of the people. The symptoms were of
                  the mildest character, the tongue but slightly furred, the pulse almost regular,
                  rising but five or ten above the natural standard, and sinking a little below in
                  the remissions. This was a universal characteristic; and in all the cases where
                  the treatment was mild, the fatal poi-son crept through the veins with such
                  insidious stillness, that from day to day hope would whisper that the next day
                  would find the patient convalescing; but, alas! you would awake from these hopes
                  by the sudden sinking of the patient, and before the vital forces could be
                  rallied, the spirit would have fled.
               I at once adopted a negative course of treatment; the mildest drinks, laxatives,
                  and constant attention to the patient's wants. For ten days she was cheerful, and
                  the slight glow on her cheeks, for a few hours, would daily return to tell us that
                  danger was within. She reached the twentieth day, when the awful gastric sinking
                  came on, and on the twenty-first the patient sunk, and seemed hopelessly doomed.
                  Counsel was called, and they prescribed prayer, and while the family
                  were assembling for this last appeal, I gave the patient a grain of morphia and a
                  good horn of brandy, to ensure the success of our spiritual endeavors; and to the
                  joy of all, the remedies seemed to work together for good. In the absence of all
                  local congestions the patient was thoroughly roused by the stimulants, and in
                  eight days and nights, she had taken a gallon of the best brandy we could procure,
                  and from that point she rapidly rallied, and was saved.
               This recovery acted like magic on the community, and the dozen or more cases that
                  fell into my hands were more controllable, and ended in recovery. The, tonic of
                  restored confidence was all-powerful, and the community clustered around me as the
                  oracle of their destiny; my fortune was made, and a business from that hour
                  secured, which never forsook me.
               About two months elapsed; the fright had disappeared from the public mind, and
                  autumn was far advanced, when a family noted for neatness were stricken down. Pour
                  young persons in a single house fell sick in a few days, and our hero of the
                  cabin, whose name was Bell, was again on his feet. The love of the people for the
                  "old doctor" had revived; he was called, and began the treatment of the fever by a
                  cathartic of calomel; in ten days I was called to his assistance; the specific
                  effects of this substance were seen in two of the patients, and the two remaining
                  ones had taken it, but were placed in my hands by his request. The first case, a
                  young lady of great beauty, and much beloved, died on the twenty-second day with
                  congestion of the bowels, preceded by frightful delirium and demoniac yells. The
                  second sister died in two days after; a sweet and confiding girl, with a form as
                  perfect as a Venus, and a skin as pure and white as Parian marble, and the rich
                  red glow on her lovely cheek, surrounded by raven-black locks, and eyes as soft
                  and spiritual as the angels' whisper, made her an object of surpassing beauty as
                  she lay on her dying pillow. Congestion of the lungs supervened, and the
                     fever-consumed victim went to her
                  long rest. The first brother was convalescing, when this sister was carried by the
                  door of his room; his brain reeled, and in an hour his mind wandered; in three
                  days, congestion of the brain laid his manly form in the quiet grave, near the
                  dwelling of his medical attendant.
               The second young man was yet able to rise from his bed, and his mother, a strict
                  botanic, and a great friend to pepper, rose in the night and gave him a strong
                  dose of pepper-tea, to keep up his strength. His case, next morning, showed signs
                  of congestion of the mucous coats, and all at once his tongue became very red,
                  resembling beef covered with varnish and dried. On the sixteenth day of his
                  sickness, he was seized with sudden pain in the right side; he groaned for a few
                  moments, wished to get up, and a quart of venous blood
                  was voided at a single passage, and when I arrived, his symptoms were all better;
                  his skin moist, his pulse natural, and strange as it may seem, he floated quietly
                  on in this condition for four days, and on the fatal twenty-first, he insisted on
                  knowing if his sisters and brother were dead; he- fixed his mild blue eye on mine,
                  and said with great earnestness, "I know they are dead; tell me, do not deceive
                  me; tell me, it will not scare me." I told him: the next setting sun found him
                  stretched on a board, and clad in his grave-clothes. It wounds me to write of this
                  poor boy, he prayed so hard to live; and was gentle and confiding, and so mild
                  were his symptoms, that, but for the fatal pepper, he might probably have lived.
                  This tragedy, rapid and frightful, totally confounded me, and for the benefit of
                  the reader, I record the results of my observations.
               The cases exactly resembled all the others, and all of them ended in local
                     congestions, and any attempt to give a stimuus in such cases was fatal.
                  These congestions did not occur in any case where I began the treatment. I gave no
                  calomel, no active cathartics, the mildest febrifuges, and regulated the bowels
                  mainly by enemas. This treatment did not disturb turb the vital forces, nor change
                  essentially the character of the fever, which was a chemical action of a miasm
                  that had entered the system through the lungs. All the cases, without exception,
                  treated by active medication, were attended with congestions; the calomel
                  cathartics in two cases, and the pepper in a third, and a mental impression in a
                  fourth on seeing his sister's dead body, seemed to my mind to give a fatal
                  determination to these four cases.
               The cause of this fatal fever, I regard as local and miasmatic; and this view is
                  confirmed by the fact, that on the same locality, the succeeding year, all the
                  inhabitants were subject to a black jaundice; no one was confined by its effects,
                  but dozens were as yellow as the pure Indian; the symptoms were attended with
                  great sleepiness, which lasted, together with the yellow hue of the skin, for the
                  space of four weeks. I am satisfied that regions where no rank growth of
                  vegetation occurs, often give out miasmatic influences. Dr. Watson, of London,
                  sustains this view of fevers, by some very satisfactory examples. Prom soils where
                  no vegetation has existed for years, from sandy plains percolated by water, from
                  water saturated with vegetable matter thrown into stagnant pools, fevers as fatal
                  may arise, as those which seem to have their origin in a-fenny region. But this
                  fact is no more indisputably established, than the fact that certain localities,
                  in certain seasons especially, have great power, by physical emanations from the
                  earth, in producing most singular and varied phenomena, of a strictly nervous
                  character.
               Leaving these suggestions for your consideration, I pass on to other and different
                  scenes. My store of old watches came into play; a gentleman wishing to sell out
                  his land, divided it up into ten-acre lots. In one of these I invested all the
                  wealth I possessed, which did not exceed a hundred dollars; shouldered my axe, and
                  by the aid of a brother, I soon prepared logs for the mill, sufficient to erect me
                  a small dwelling; into which, in the
                  lapse of eight months, I moved. I was never happier than when preparing the
                  lumber, and splitting the blocks of sand-stone for the foundation of my dwelling.
                  One customer, whose wife I had carried through a lingering fever, furnished me a
                  frame for my dwelling, and I fell in his debt for a pair of boots. Another
                  furnished me nails and glass; and for two years I fed my cow and raised my own
                  corn to feed my gallant nag, which shared my toil and its profits. The profits of
                  my first two years' labor barely sufficed to pay for my home and feed my family;
                  when the terrible drought of '46 appeared, I was forced to relinquish the horse
                  which I then hired, for my nag was dead. For five months I performed all my
                  business on foot, often travelling six and ten miles to see my patients. The earth
                  was parched and dry; the streams were all dried up; all classes of crops were
                  shrivelled to a mere shadow; and the country was deprived of half its animals
                  during the year; one half had been sold to find food for the other. These were
                  trying times; but what if the elements were unpropitious? I had food and shelter
                  for myself—blessings about which I had often been in doubt—and I was fully
                  prepared to "let the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing." The first
                  winter was one of great severity; and so changeable was the climate, that the most
                  hideous snowstorms were often succeeded by heavy rains, and the roads were often
                  frozen up in a single night, leaving it neither possible to travel on horseback
                  nor in a carriage. I had a patient some five miles distant, sick with "lung fever"
                  (pneumonia), and in an attendance of forty days, I made thirty journeys on foot.
                  His recovery added much to my reputation, and I received for my labor a new clock,
                  a new overcoat (which I greatly needed), and a hive of bees, This toiling family
                  of honey-makers, I prized highly, and for four years they furnished me with honey,
                  when disease and fickleness left their dwellings vacant.
               An old horse which I hired of a friend, had a glorious way of limping, and was a
                  source of much merriment among my patrons. His faults of limping I attributed to a
                  sense of politeness; and this nag, with my plain and rustic appearance and toiling
                  habits, endeared me to the laboring population, among which I lived, and my
                  calamities became my greatest friends. My fortune was soon to change, and the
                  experience and name I had acquired, now came in to act as capital in trade; and
                  the flood of luck which followed, I will relate anon.
            
            
               
               WILL MEDICINE CURE CONSUMPTION?
               TUBERCULAR or scrofulous consumption, is but a fragment of a great constitutional
                  malady, said Dr. Latham, and that malady plays its part most conspicuously in the
                  lungs, This is high authority, and it is the sentiment of the entire profession
                  throughout the world.
               Tubercles are white substances, like cheese, scattered throughout the lungs and
                  elsewhere; they are entirely destitute of blood-vessels—or, as physicians say,
                  unorganized, and- must, therefore, sooner or later irritate the surrounding parts,
                  and produce matter, just like a splinter of wood or other irritating
                  substance.
               We have heretofore observed that spinal disease, white swellings of the knee,
                  king's evil, or scrofulous tumours in the neck, were also tubercular; the wasting
                  away of children and adults, sometimes with tumors in % abdomen, is also very
                  often tubercular. They are all forms of the great constitutional malady, SCROFULA.
                  It descends "from the fathers to the children, even of the third and fourth
                  generation" How it may sometimes be checked in its development, we have already
                  set forth; but there was one remark which the reader did not believe: it shall be
                  the object of this paper to convince him it was true; for on that depends the
                  solution of the question-will medicine cure consumption?
               We said that a common cold was rarely the exciting cause consumption, and perhaps
                  never its originating one. We should have said, it never originates tubercular or
                  scrofulous consumption. It is true, indeed, that a cold, or a slight inflammation
                  of the lungs, may excite disorganization of the substance of the lungs round about
                  tubercles already existing, and thus cause consumption; and it is on this account
                  that delicate and consumptive persons should exercise extreme caution in keeping
                  the surface of the body as well as the feet, utter strangers to cold and dampness.
                  But this does not produce scrofula, or tubercles. There are also other varieties
                  of consumption sometimes originating from colds, such as chronic or slow
                  inflammation of the bronchia, or greater divisions of the windpipe, called
                  bronchitis, very rare cases of abscess in the body of the lungs, and a few other
                  obscure affections that may be confounded with tubercular consumption; but an
                  acutely observing physician can generally detect them.
               Many physicians carry about with them the stethoscope, a small cedar stick with a
                  hole in it, ornamented with ivory, to give it "professional effect" in the eyes of
                  the people; but is for the most part a mere trap to get business by. The ear
                  applied to the chest is much better, because it will lie flat, and not permit
                  other sounds from outside the body to reach it, and disturb the sounds of the
                  breathing from within. This method of ascertaining whether the lungs are pervious
                  to air, is indispensable to a careful physician. He will, before using his ear,
                  usually strike the chest in various places with the end of his fore finger, having
                  first interposed a finger of his other hand flatwise, so as to avoid hurting the
                  patient. He judges from the flatness or deadness of the sound, whether there be
                  foreign substance deposited in the lungs, or whether they are solidified, so that
                  air cannot enter them. It is done precisely upon the principle we sound a melon to
                  judge whether it be ripe. Indeed the structure of the lungs is very similar to the
                  core of a ripe water-melon. Percussion should always be done with extreme gentleness and tact; a single tap, heard by
                  an acute ear, will convey the truth precisely as accurately, as a touch on the
                  piano will convey a note in music. The painful thumping with the three fingers, so
                  common among physicians, is enough to frighten the well, much less an invalid.
                  Exposure of the chest is not necessary; a thin garment should always cover it.
               It is very mortifying to observe the uses made of the stethoscope by many
                  physicians; to see them frighten and fatigue a poor invalid, by their tricks and
                  solemn countenances, when nature or over-feeding has made many of them so obtuse
                  in their hearing and intellects, that it can convey no particle of information. We
                  can only advise the sick always to employ a gentleman;" a man with a proper union
                  of gentleness, simplicity of deportment, and benevolence; they always go together,
                  and can never mislead a good observer of men. We know, by personal experience, the
                  supporting influence of such an adviser. During years of anxiety, such as those
                  only can appreciate who have felt it, we were a constant witness of the effect on
                  the delicate invalid, of the unwearied patience, gentleness, and science, of one
                  of our city physicians. We rejoice that he is still in the height of usefulness,
                  and only regret that a misapprehension of our object, might, to his sensitive
                  mind, render a more distinct allusion disagreeable to him.
               It is a remarkable truth, that tubercles affecting the lungs, almost invariably
                  attack their upper parts, directly under the collar-bones—that is the bones that
                  cross the chest at the base of the neck—diminishing rapidly toward the lower part
                  of the lungs; they are also generally more numerous nearer the back than the front
                  of the chest. The physician who understands this, will always direct his attention
                  to these parts in searching for them. He also knows the fact that pneumonia, or
                  ordinary inflammation of the lungs, originating generally in checked perspiration,
                  and coming on for the most part very suddenly, almost always attacks the lower
                  parts of the lungs, proceeding, when not checked, to the upper parts. This, with
                  the suddenness of the attack, greatly assists in doubtful cases, in forming an
                  opinion.
               Indeed, the manner of its occurrence, the history of the family in regard to other
                  cases of consumption, the general appearance of the patient, with the sounds
                  discovered by applying the ear, are sufficient, in almost every case, to enable
                  the physician to form an accurate opinion. The labors "of truly great men on this
                  subject, both in Europe and America, have been vast. They have been amply rewarded
                  in reducing our knowledge of the habits of this disease almost to a certainty, and
                  although medicine has little or no effect upon it, we have shown that its
                  prevention is often within our power, and that we can materially assist nature in
                  curing it. There is, indeed not one case in a hundred that an accomplished
                  physician cannot truly determine.
               This is of immense consequence in adopting preventive measures in time. Change of
                  climate, food, and general habits, have saved, and will continue to save,
                  thousands. Only be sure to get merciful and scientific advice; beware of needy
                  men, who talk of their cures with wonderful medicines; there is no medicine for
                  consumption. The reader himself is already convinced, if he has understood us; we
                  give the sentiments of great and good men, and assert that consumption is better
                  understood than almost any disease that attacks the human body.
               God pity the wretches, whether in or out of the profession, who trifle with human
                  life and human feelings in this dreadful disease. There is in this city a
                  miserable miscreant, who deludes thousands with a book containing precepts of a
                  truly admirable character (gleaned from the writings of earnest and conscientious
                  men), so artfully mingled with his
                  allusions to cures performed by his innumerable compounds, shoulder-braces,
                  abdominal supporters, breathing tubes, and other scoundrel-money traps, that it
                  makes one blush to think he is called a doctor. The fellow talks of having
                  discovered the uses of the lungs! Notwithstanding such arrant absurdity, people
                  believe and trust him.
               It would be idle, of course, in a popular article, to give any of the signs
                  revealed by the ear as indicative of consumption. We shall, therefore, give the
                  general symptoms, and as we cannot do better for our readers, we extract them from
                  that beautifully clear and philosophical work, Dr. Thomas Watson's Practice of
                  Physic, London edition, 1843. They are fully corroborated by our own
                  observation:
               "Cough is one of the earliest symptoms of consumption; and it is that which first
                  attracts the attention and awakens the fears of the patient or friends. Generally
                  at first it is slight, occasional, and dry; it occurs upon the patient's getting
                  out of bed in the morning, or if he makes any unusual exertion during the day. It
                  feels to him as if it was caused by irritation about the throat. Sometimes it will
                  cease for a while, in the warm weather of the summer, and recur in winter, when
                  the external temperature is lower. By degrees it begins to be troublesome at
                  night, and to be attended with more or less mucous expectoration."
               The reader will observe the gradual process by which these symptoms occur; it is
                  in this respect they differ from a common cold. Yet these very dry coughs may, and
                  often do, depend upon disordered stomachs or a chronic catarrh; or they are even
                  hysterical, and the result of habit, in women particularly. Notwithstanding the
                  general presence of these symptoms, consumption will sometimes appear absolutely
                  without cough, and destroy the patient in a few months, or even weeks.
               The symptoms already given, are those that for the most part, first arrest the
                  attention; those we are now to state, belong mostly to the second stage. First,
                  spitting of blood. This is to most persons a very alarming symptom; and in cases
                  where the conformation of body and history of the family in regard to the
                  occurrence of former cases justifies the apprehension, it is certainly a symptom
                  much to be dreaded. And yet, when we consider the many reasons why it may occur
                  from causes quite unconnected with the development of tubercles in the lungs, and
                  its long continuance even when they are present, we feel that a more extended
                  explanation is due our readers, because of the extreme anxiety and alarm attendant
                  upon this symptom.
               Physicians call it HÆMOPTISIS, which means spitting of blood: we shall, therefore,
                  use that term, for shortness.
               Dr. Watson remarks, "that if a person spits blood who has received no injury of
                  the chest, in whom the functions of the womb [the monthly periods] are right, and
                  who has no disease of the heart, the odds that there are tubercles in the lungs of
                  that person are fearfully high." Excluding cases of the suppression of the monthly
                  periods in females, and mechanical injuries of the chest in both sexes, the
                  distinguished French physician Louis did not meet with a single example of
                  hæmoptisis in twelve hundred cases, except in such as were consumptive.
               Now, without designing to attempt invalidating the high authority of these justly
                  distinguished men, we will point out the reasons why hæmoptisis, without
                  tubercular disease, is quite common in this climate.
               Bronchitis, or inflammation of the lining membrane of the bronchia, or larger
                  branches of the wind-pipe, is certainly a common disease; but Dr. Watson and many
                  others remark, that hæmoptisis is quite uncommon in bronchitis. This we certainly
                  think is an error; at least in this climate. We are satisfied, that whether there
                  were tubercles or not, hæmoptisis has been a frequent result of bronchitis in many
                  cases under our own observation, as well as that of our friends— and they were cases in which all the symptoms were
                  those of bronchitis—many of them having been under our own observation for twenty
                  years, and still living.
               When we reflect upon the insane adherence to fashion in our country, and the total
                  want of that knowledge that would compel precautionary measures, why should it not
                  be so? It is part of an American female's education to wear tight dresses and thin
                  shoes; she esteems herself, at least temporarily, degraded if she does not do it.
                  What becomes of the blood—that is, of four or five pounds out of the twenty-five
                  she has in her body—when it is driven from her extremities by cold, upon the heart
                  and lungs? These organs struggle to overcome their bonds, and to pass it through
                  the lungs fast enough to preserve the balance of the circulation, but they must
                  fail; a dozen powerful hooks and eyes, if not a corset to boot—and one is just as
                  bad as the other—resist the efforts of the muscles to raise the ribs, and the
                  delicate blood-vessels lining the bronchia, tender from congestion, give way here
                  and there, and she spits blood: 'tis merciful she does; it had better come out
                  than remain in the substance of the lungs.
               Men exhaust themselves with tobacco, drink, and other vices, and if they do not
                  wear tight clothes, over-exercise and exert themselves, and the same thing occurs;
                  for the blood must pass through the lungs at a certain rate of speed, and they
                  cannot transmit it fast enough, and so ruptures occur, and they spit blood. This
                  is the whole matter in its naked simplicty; scientific words by the score would
                  make it neither plainer nor more true.
               The good effect of nitrate of silver, applied to the throat and wind-pipe or its
                  divisions, shows that many of the cases hitherto deemed consumptive are chiefly
                  bronchitis, whether there be tubercles in the lungs or not. That the two diseases
                  are very often combined, we know.
               Difficulty of breathing upon slight exertion, is a common symptom of consumption,
                  but not an invariable one. It originates, if it exist, from the fact that the
                  lungs are more or less filled with tubercles, which encroach upon and press
                  together the air-cells, and diminish the capacity of the lungs for air; when
                  increased exercise quickens the circulation, the blood endeavors to get through
                  the heart and lungs faster, and thus still further aggravates the difficulty. But
                  this symptom is sometimes scarcely observable. The digestion in many consumptives,
                  is greatly impaired, and the blood diminished in quantity—as is sufficiently
                  evident by the thinness and paleness of the invalid—is accommodated to the
                  diminished capacity of the lungs. Moreover, many persons thus situated, use little
                  exertion, and so do not hurry the circulation. Neither is pain always present. We
                  have known cases in which no pain was felt to the last: we know no reason for
                  this.
               Dr. Watson remarks: "When during the progress of consumption, violent pain in the
                  side, and extreme difficulty of breathing and anxiety, set in
                     suddenly, they denote with much certainty, perforation of the
                  investing membrane of the lungs, or pleura—(hence the word pleurisy)—and serious,
                  and generally fatal consequences. This, with hectic fever and diarrhœa, constitute
                  the last symptoms of consumption." Hectic is accompanied with exhaustion, and
                  extreme sweating, and frequency of the pulse. We know little or nothing of the
                  immediate cause of this distressing symptom. It seems to be connected with sleep,
                  the patient not experiencing it while awake—some escape it entirely. Many control
                  it somewhat by reclining partially when sleeping. Diarrhœa does not always occur
                  as a last, symptom; it sometimes comes on early in the disease, and often serves
                  to denote its approach with certainty, when the other symptoms are not all
                  present, or sufficiently distinct to remove doubt. It is generally connected with
                  ulcers in the intestines; and these often originate from the attempt instituted by nature to get rid of the tubercles
                  often formed there, as in the lungs. The system becomes irritable from want of
                  exercise, or improper and indigestible diet, not producing sufficient nourishment
                  to maintain its functions in quietness, from mental anxiety, or else from venereal
                  excesses (a most powerful and frequent cause), and so inflammation, of a slow and
                  scrofulous character, occurs all round the tubercles, and nature attempts to get
                  clear of these foreign substances precisely as she rids herself of a splinter in
                  the finger.
               There is this grand difference, however, in the result: a splinter is thus ejected
                  from a part not essential to life, a finger or toe for instance—a part of the body
                  comparatively at rest—whereas the lungs and intestines must move constantly, and
                  the ulcer is irritated by motion, air, or the contents of the bowels, if the
                  tubercles be situated there, which they sometimes are. Moreover, the disposition
                  in the individual is to form tubercles constantly; in short, he is scrofulous.
               When the constitution can be rapidly improved by diet, exercise or climate, these
                  ulcers may heal, and if no more tubercles form, and digestion and the skin be kept
                  in full play of their powers, so as to produce plenty of material, and to throw
                  off carbon or the useless matters of the system, the person recovers. But if
                  prostrated by physic, or sexual excesses, bad diet, and cold air, he dies.
            
            
               TOILETTE OF NEW YORK LADIES.
               WHAT ARE THE ACTUAL CONSEQUENCES OF COLD FEET?
               
                  
                     "Life is Warm; Death is Cold."
                  
               
               IF there be one subject that beyond all others demands the earnest attention of
                  the American mother, that subject is the, protection of the feet of her daughter
                  from the cold and dampness of the pavement. We give it more than, usual
                  prominence, because the evil is neither understood nor regarded in any other light
                  than a remote contingency, not worth a moment's thought, when compared to the
                  gratification of making an impression on her admirers, by what she imagines a
                  beautiful foot. It is by no means necessary that this object of her soups idolatry
                  should bear any proportion to the other parts of her person, or in any degree be
                  adapted to the requirements of her system in taking exercise. If God has given her
                  a good constitution and a well-proportioned and muscular body, adapted to the
                  emergencies and trials of life, and the display of those graceful movements
                  impossible without organic strength, she is greatly afflicted. A companion, either
                  influenced by envy, or an absurd estimate of gracefulness, originating in that
                  absence of true taste always the result of an education in which drawing, the
                  anatomy of the human figure, and the study of antique sculpture, are not prominent
                  objects, tells her she is fat; and if she herself be unusually angular and
                  awkward, she may add that her foot is "immense;" or some invidious and artful ful comparison is made, that causes the
                  young creature the greatest unhappiness. The first thing consequent on this
                  assurance observed by her ignorant and distressed parent, is the paleness of her
                  cheek, and her refusal of that wholesome food her appetite has hitherto craved;
                  this is probably due to excessively tight clothing, and perhaps drinking vinegar,
                  or some other monstrous and suicidal practice. To appease the Juggernaut of
                  fashion, her feet, or rather her toes, are encased in a slipper with wafer sole,
                  her arms in open sleeves, and her chest with a delicate covering, at best of a
                  single thickness of wool, and a scanty cloak, and thus she trips it over the
                  pavement of a December morning, to a school where, too often, everything but
                  sense, and true gracefulness and dignity of character are taught.
               Physiologists have proved by actual experiment with the thermometer, that the
                  central heat of the body, or that of the blood as it issues from its starting
                  point, the left ventricle of the heart, is 100 degrees; and that at the sole of
                  the foot it is no more than 90 degrees!
               The great and unchangeable law of the Creator that develops life, is warmth. The
                  egg of the fowl only possesses latent life, till the warmth of the
                  mother expands the germ, and gives the heart its first contractile or active
                  force; without warmth, it would never assume its organized form nor continue its
                  action.
               Before we speak of the influence of cold on the nerves of the feet, and its still
                  more rapid effect on the circulation of the blood through their action on the
                  heart, let us consider the value of the great facts we have presented to the
                  reader, viz. the natural decrease of the warmth of the blood in the blood-vessels
                  of the feet, as a probable means of permitting the ill effect of cold on these
                  great central organs of life, the lungs, if not prevented by art.
               It is conceded by all intelligent observers, that a violent chill communicated to
                  the body, is very soon and sensibly felt in the lungs, and that pleurisies and
                  inflammations of the lungs themselves, are the frequent consequences of such
                  exposure. Now, it is known that heat or caloric has a tendency to equalize itself
                  in all the various bodies in the universe; ice itself, only melting, by the
                  inevitable necessity of imbibing heat, when exposed to it; according to this
                  unchangeable law, it can only exist as ice, during the summer months, by
                  interposing between the atmosphere and it, substances! possessing a known power of
                  repelling heat. Thus it is preserved in ice-houses. When the earth is colder than
                  the body, this law instantly begins to operate upon the feet standing upon it; and
                  as the body is a producer of heat, its safety is secured precisely in proportion
                  to the, vigor of health it possesses, or in other words, the rapidity with which
                  its blood circulates through the lungs. It therefore follows, that the feebler the
                  circulation, the more unable the body is to afford to part with its heat. If you
                  clothe the body warmly, and thus prevent its warmth from transmission to the
                  atmosphere, and interpose a cork sole between the skin of the sole of the foot and
                  the earth, this transmission of heat is stopped, because cork, wool, silk and
                  cotton, are non-conductors of heat. Thus, it will be seen, that the great
                  essential of life is preserved, by availing yourself of a well-known property of
                  substances, when of common quality accessible by the slenderest pecuniary
                  means.
               There is a persistence in the use of thin shoes by our countrywomen, that is
                  really unaccountable by an ordinary process of reasoning. We observe it in no
                  other nation. Shoes that are adapted to the ball-room may often be seen in
                  Broadway in December, and it would seem that a woman considers herself
                  irretrievably disgraced by the use of a shoe thick enough to protect her from the
                  cold, whilst she is still less prepared to meet the moisture of the damp
                  pavement.
               In a woman of ordinary size, there can be no reasonable doubt from the computations of physiologists, that
                  half of her blood passes under the feet in two minutes at the least; so that it
                  will be perceived the conducting power of the damp earth, must continually deprive
                  the blood of its warmth. The effect of cold upon the nerves is yet more rapid than
                  this. It is known to most persons, that instantaneous sneezing is often produced
                  by standing on the cold hearthstone or oil-cloth; and the speedy action of damp or
                  cold feet on the bowels, is often painfully evident to many invalids. Assuming the
                  body to be a producer of electricity (and it seems impossible to conclude
                  otherwise), that fluid is known to be subject to the same law as heat, i. e. to
                  seek a constant equilibrium with surrounding objects. There can be no better
                  conductor than the damp earth; all positively or negatively electrified bodies,
                  not isolated or cut off by a non-conductor, seek an instant equilibrium. This law
                  is well known to philosophers, and ought to be equally so to every intelligent and
                  rational being; therefore, it must be, that even if heat and electricity be not
                  the same thing, still the same danger must be incurred by too light clothing and
                  shoes. Dr. James Murray has asserted, and he thinks proved, that cholera is
                  rendered impossible, by isolating the feet by cork soles, and feeding and clothing
                  the body so as to keep up a high degree of electricity. All experience has proved,
                  that those persons most afflicted during both the epidemics which occurred in this
                  city, were those who endured the greatest exposure to dampness, and ate the most
                  watery and ill-cooked food; and what is more conclusive, they were mostly attacked
                  towards morning, when the atmospheric temperature is always lowest.
               Cork soles, of proper thickness, are an absolute non-conductor; and when the
                  leather of the shoe is of good quality they will prove sufficient for all the
                  purposes of health till the month of December; by that time the pedestrian should
                  have accustomed herself to a well-made boot with buckskin leggings, made in all
                  respects like those worn by males. Without such protection she is never safe from
                  the vicissitudes of an American climate, nor the liability of disease that will
                  soon destroy her gracefulness and beauty.
               But these explanations and remarks only affect what the young American woman
                  esteems the most Inconsiderable part of her toilet. If her shoes be thin and tight
                  enough, the object is answered, and she bestows her principal efforts on the
                  drapery of her person. Before we venture to suggest a reconsideration of the rules
                  adopted by our countrywomen on this important subject, let us recur to the
                  observation we have already made, on the necessity of some attention to artistic
                  studies, if she designs to declare her independence of those arbiters of her
                  destiny, the dress-makers. Should she repudiate both science and art, there is
                  nothing left to guide her but the modiste.
               Whether the refined and exquisite figures in the windows of the peruquiers of
                  Broadway, are to be taken as evidences of the requirements of the national taste,
                  it is very certain that they are offered as the highest evidence of artistic
                  skill, and that the delectable models receive the worship of fair eyes, and seem
                  to be sufficient to meet their aspirations. Let us not be misunderstood: we do not
                  say that all our fair countrywomen would consent to adopt all the absurdities of
                  such models, yet it is very certain that the unnatural exhibition receives very
                  general approval and imitation: the appearance of our ladies is sufficient
                  evidence that it is so. Are there then any better and more elegant models for
                  their guidance? Let us consider the matter.
               There must be in everything artificial, dress included, some beau ideal of beauty;
                  from the chair we sit upon, to the gem that shines upon the snowy bosom or among
                  the raven locks of youth, everything is copied from some type of nature. The
                  individual members of the chair, from the beautiful curves of the limbs of a tree;
                  the facets of the gem, from the natural
                  crystal; nay, both are sometimes used for their respective purposes, directly as
                  formed by nature. What is more beautiful than the graceful waving line of the
                  ostrich feather? We take the type of many artificial productions directly from
                  nature. Where shall we find a combination of the line of beauty, equal to that of
                  the figure of a lovely American woman? The statue that enchants the world cannot
                  equal some of the natural and dress-untutored forms of our village maidens. When
                  we see her in her first young, beauty, fresh from the hand of nature, with the 
                     
                        "Sweet calm brow, to which God's finger lent
                        The beauty of his angels,"
                     
                   we do involuntary homage to the creature, even before we lift our thoughts to
                  the perfection of the plan of a Creator, that meditates no less perfection
                     for all his creatures. What then has marred the perfect plan? What
                  "ineradicable taint of sin" has issued the penalty for disobedience, of flat
                  chests, angular shoulders, and curved spines? It is our object to show that the
                  cause exists in the errors of her moral and physical education. We have devoted
                  many pages to that purpose; we now propose to set forth what we conceive to be the
                  results of those of the toilette.
               The sculptor who designs to adjust his drapery, in a manner that shall excite the
                  admiration of the beholder for its gracefulness and truthful adherence to the law
                  that regulates its natural disposition, well knows that he must understand the
                  anatomy of the figure, even to the articulations of the bony system or skeleton.
                  He often models the entire proportions, including every muscle and dimple, before
                  he applies a single fold of the drapery. Should he be ignorant of these, and
                  attempt to do it before he has knowledge enough to give the statue its just
                  proportion and pose, he will find that his efforts result in nothing but an
                  ungraceful arrangement, that excites the ridicule of the intelligent, and even the
                  disapproval of the ignorant.
               There is a natural appreciation of beautiful and graceful simplicity and dignity
                  in the getting up of a statue, that elicits a just appreciation of its merits by
                  most beholders. Is the disposition of the dress on the living wearer less
                  calculated to arrest criticism or excite pleasure? The meretricious effect of
                  color, often obscures the errors of female costume and of natural disproportion
                  from the mass, but it never can hide the defect from an observer, whose judgment
                  and taste have been refined by critical analysis of the figure in its natural and
                  anatomical proportions. These are regulated by a plan, that we are not at liberty
                  to suppose imperfect. When we examine the structure of the female neck, and its
                  union with the shoulder and chest, we find the line of beauty at every point; the
                  head cannot be turned, or the arm elevated, without its being still apparent:
                  indeed, true gracefulness, is nothing more than ability to perform every movement,
                  with as little disturbance of this line as possible. It is represented by the body
                  of the letter S; it was first analyzed, and set forth as deserving of its
                  appellation, by Hogarth.
               Without being ambitious of the office of a man milliner, we feel at liberty as a
                  teacher of the laws of health, and an admirer of the sex in her more natural
                  character, to give our opinion of those errors of dress, that often deprive her of
                  that admiration her real charms entitle her to. Besides, we have given "those
                  hostages to fortune," which if they be "impediments to great deeds and noble
                  enterprises," fairly entitle us to commit small ones; i. e. small by comparison
                  with those statesmen and municipal officers, common council-men, &c., engaged
                  in deceiving their fellows and furthering the interests of "their constituents,"
                  by filling their pockets from the public treasury.
               Allow us then, fair reader, to question the propriety of the waist and sleeves of your dresses, when
                  constructed according to the modern fashion of those ladies, who wish to display
                  the line of beauty of their neck and shoulders in its most fascinating aspect. The
                  true diamond fall of the shoulders, those lovely outposts of the citadel of
                  maternal love, is directly the reverse of that hard and corset-compelled
                  cadet-like set of the bust upon the trunk, that some ladies feel compelled to
                  adopt, because God has given their muscles and breasts, those noble proportions
                  adapted to the full nourishment of their offspring. Not that we advise them to
                  wear their dresses like an Indian squaw or Otaheitean; but we would fain preserve
                  their children from the evil consequences of crippling the fountain of its life
                  blood, as it starts from the benificent hand of nature on its pure and holy
                  errand. If you who do not yet fulfill this endearing office, would permit its free
                  and unshackled attainment, avoid we beseech you in your early youth, that rigid
                  "clothes line" which sometimes borders the top of your dress, and falling often
                  full four inches below your shoulders, shackles and pins your arms to your sides
                  like a fowl's wings trussed for the spit. This is often productive of unsightly
                  tumors in the tissue directly under the skin; we have repeatedly been obliged to
                  employ the knife for their removal; all surgeons are aware of this cause of their
                  very frequent occurrence. Let the top line occupy what anatomists call the outer
                  third of the collar bone, that crosses the chest on either side at the base of the
                  neck; in winter let it pass quite to the base of the neck. In summer it may begin
                  to curve at the shoulder tip. Let not the line extend across the chest in an
                  unbroken curve, but let it fall downwards in the middle, and reveal the beauties
                  of that swan-like line of the neck, that loses itself between the breasts; this is
                  consistent with great beauty of form in the dress, and perfect modesty in the
                  wearer.
               There is no objection in young persons of good health, going with bare arms even
                  in winter, if they have the good sense to use temporary sleeves that admit of
                  removal on entering the opera or ball-room: in winter, they certainly are not to
                  be neglected without danger.
               At the opera, they should have the means of instant protection at hand, as some
                  men, who are permitted to call themselves gentlemen, never think of closing a
                  door, and the universal and national failing of neglect of duty by all public
                  servants of inferior station, throws every opera-goer upon her own watchfulness,
                  if she is to escape pleurisy.
               The long and extremely pointed waists (now to be seen in their highest perfection
                  in the Bowery), have been entirely overdone; if the ladies will pardon us, we may
                  again with propriety compare them when thus dressed, to a fowl whose pelvic
                  dimensions are excessive, or a badly calculated automaton, that is all breast,
                  hips, and legs, and no body. The fowl when showing his beauties on the lawn, has
                  the advantage of a tail to counterpoise the disproportion so visible in his fellow
                  on the table; the size of our modern drawing-rooms, will not allow the ladies to
                  avail themselves of that graceful resemblance, the train. This pointed arrangement
                  of the waist, is moreover the fruitful cause of those frequent displacements of an
                  important internal organ, that entails more lasting misery upon her, and hands
                  down to her posterity a catalogue of diseases, that our space will not allow us
                  even to enumerate; in some of our past efforts, we have endeavored to give a faint
                  outline of their consequences. Neither is it our present intention to say much on
                  the subject of the corset or tightness of the dress; we reserve them for future
                  articles on the heart and lungs. It is only necessary here to remark, that any
                  degree of tightness that will in the slightest manner interfere with respiration
                  and the heart's action, must immediately diminish the vitality of the blood,
                  impair digestion, and produce red hands, headache, want of expression in the eye,
                  dullness of perception, and
                  displacements of the uterus. It is quite useless for the mother to endeavor to
                  make any estimate for us of the tightness of her daughter's dress. We have too
                  often been appealed to by both mother and daughter to decide upon that matter, to
                  place any reliance upon the judgment of either party, if desirous of being in the
                  fashion or "looking decent." This latter expression, is the ultimate appeal to
                  your opinion as a gentleman, and is generally answered by capitulation. The
                  advantage of print, allows us to avoid striking our colors, and to throw our
                  ultimatum boldly at the feet of conventionality, and nail our flag to the mast
                  with the inscription: "Free breath, or red hands, headache and
                  consumption..
               On the subject of the skirts, both topographical and profound, we feel the
                  necessity of great caution. The traveller who ventures to explore an unknown
                  country, feels his dangers as he approaches the interior, and the necessity of
                  calling up all his expressive amiability of feature, to protect himself from the
                  danger consequent upon misapprehension of the object of his visit. If it is
                  finally concluded that the ladies are not to wear pantaloons, we take it for
                  granted they are to have the control of the usual quantity of skirts; we design to
                  point out how they may sustain the load, with that fortitude and resignation
                  characteristic of the sex; we only wish to give the spine and the shoulders their
                  share of the infliction. We shall therefore take time to consider what is to be
                  said on this subject, and give the result hereafter.
            
            
               SCENES IN COUNTRY PRACTICE.
               THE BAPTISM OF LOVE AND TRUST—LOST FROM EARTH, FOUND IN HEAVEN—THE
                  IDIOT BOY—AN IMPRESSIVE LESSON.
               PHYSICIANS will understand what I mean when I talk of night and darkness. Not
                  night, when every star like a regal jewel sparkles in her diadem; but night;
                  unrobed of gem or queenly beauty, when darkness becomes seemingly palpable to
                  outward sense. Such phases in the out-door world are strongly marked in every
                  doctor's almanac, and to a selfish lover of ease would anathematize our
                  profession. 'Tis true, home and home comforts are best appreciated when thus
                  contrasted with angry elements.
               Sleet had fallen through the day, and strong north-east wind had converted every
                  icy particle into a barbed arrow. My ride had been a heavier tax upon my energy
                  than every day's footing up could claim. A toilsome, harassing duty, performed
                  from common love to suffering humanity—a cheerful, self-denying one, for
                  particular love to self and family. I blush to have uttered this last sentiment,
                  for 'tis all unworthy the character of men who sacrifice so much upon the altar of
                  their profession. Fee or no fee, should not be the question; but rather, can I
                  save that man to the world, that mother for her family, that babe for the arms of
                  her who bore it? Such is the language of every one who carries a doctor's heart in
                  his bosom, a doctor's soul in Ms countenance, or a doctor's practice in his life.
                  You will remember, dear Doctor, that I had returned from such a day's labor, weary, hungry, and half-frozen, some
                  hours after a night of such gloom had cast its shadow abroad, when I found your
                  cheerful face at my humble board. A warm fire, a cup of tea, and better than all,
                  the smile which said, We shall le so happy now, soon put things to
                  right, with both outer and inner man. There is no alchemy like woman's love, and
                  the social companionship of an old friend, to change life's ills to bliss and
                  blessedness. I marvel, with you, that her heart's crucible should sometimes only
                  hold its dross. In a few hours we had adopted Shakspeare's insurance for
                  digestion, and were sweetly sleeping, safe from ghostly intrusion. At least so I
                  thought, until startled by a rap at my door—prophetic to me that death stayed not
                  Ms mission for the tempest, though its wail was like a madman's shriek. Never did
                  I feel less humanity in my nature, nor more inclined to compromise with duty,
                  forgetful of my Christian mission to heal the sick; forgetful of my spirit's
                  baptism, when set apart and consecrated by my Alma Mater, for my Master's use.
               I remember it with pain—for I asked impatiently, perhaps unkindly from the
                  messenger, what was the necessity for this untimely errand. The door opened so
                  reluctantly upon its hinges, that self-reproach had begun its work before the
                  youth, choked in his utterance, and half-blinded by his tears, could reply. But I
                  waited not; the heart's telegraph had done its work: "Richard was himself again."
                  No delay was now desired, nor was the storm remembered. I recognized the boy, and
                  in doing so, I knew that some fearful change had swept over the life-strings of
                  one of God's sweetest instruments. Two days previous, I had visited my patient,
                  and as usual found her cheerful, and to appearance even happy; and though I knew
                  that every affection was packed up, and journeying towards heaven, still I saw
                  nothing to warn me that she would follow so soon. Our ride passed in silence;
                  neither wishing to intrude upon the silent reflections of the other, nor would the
                  violence of the storm have given back a sound, had it been uttered. A light from
                  the hall window gave us our latitude, and in a moment I had entered the door,
                  disrobed myself of wet garments, and was stealthily entering the sanctifying
                  chamber of one who, knowing grief, had hid it in her heart; one who had lived
                  for—another.
               Noiseless as my step had been, it awoke the sleeper from what seemed to be a dream
                  of happiness. A few brief words were uttered; a look of regret, almost of agony,
                  rested upon her countenance, as she murmured: "Jordan is still between us—I
                  thought I had passed over—and thou, my friend, my brother, my long loved and lost
                  one, wast there. Once that dream had been a sin—wiped out by many a tear-now 'tis
                  heaven." Fearing exhaustion, I stepped from my half-concealed position, and gently
                  approaching placed my finger upon the pulse. A slight vibration was perceptible,
                  so slight, indeed, that it seemed life had nothing for which to struggle.
                  Receiving a few drops of wine which I had ordered, she revived to a consciousness
                  of my presence. Hitherto, I had known nothing of the history of my patient, but I
                  had felt a tenderness mingling with my interest, that none but a physician can
                  understand. "Doctor," said the dying one, "I know that the night of the grave is
                  coming; I know, too, that eternal morning will follow the night; that death,
                  though it chain this clay tabernacle, will pinion the affections for their flight.
                  God is my Father, God is my Friend; I know that He careth for me; when sinking, He
                  hath sustained me; when a stranger, given me friends. I know that God is love; I
                  feel it in your kindness; I feel it in your sympathies, and I know it in every
                  emotion that swells my burdened heart. I said I was dying! But what is death? The
                  gate of life for which I have long panted; the ante-room where the soul puts off
                  its outer garments. And shall I not then be a bride, worthy of him who waits my coming?" Perceiving, or rather
                  thinking, that her mind wandered, I endeavored to soothe her into repose. "Tis too
                  late," said she, understanding my effort. "Life ebbs; the returning tide is not
                  for me. Listen, that I may speak, for you have something to forgive.
                  Though grateful for your every care, yet I have not been wholly truthful. A mist
                  should never come between physician and patient; but I have covered myself with it
                  as with a garment, that I might wrestle with the destroyer less pitied, well
                  knowing that God would receive back the principle He gave, when purified by
                  suffering, and in the fullness of His own almighty love, would join it by affinity
                  to the loved and lost of earth—to the loved and found in heaven. Bury me, doctor,
                  in the church-yard, under the old weeping elm; the sun-light falls softly there,
                  and there you—yes! I know it was you—laid him so gently away," The chambers of
                  memory unlocked. * * * *
               'Twas under that elm, in years gone by, with sorrowing heart, that I placed the
                  turf, lightly as kindness and friendship could place it, over the breast of one,
                  that in light laughing boyhood, had been my play-fellow. Years separated us. We
                  met again as men; I, toiling in my profession; he, wasting day by day, loving to
                  talk of death and the worms' banquet. He died: none knew why! but in the
                  church-yard, under the weeping elm, we laid him. Every year, fresh flowers had
                  blossomed on that mound; none knew who planted, nor yet who watered them with
                  tears. One moment I gazed, and when I knew the form before me, the
                     mist had passed away; nor need any wonder, that two such hearts had
                  broken, so rudely were they severed.
               I looked again—the light of her eye had retired within; the pulse had fluttered
                  into death; the heart stood still, that the spirit might pass in silence to God
                  who gave it—its first pure baptism of love and trust. It was this midnight scene,
                  my dear Doctor, that produced my gloom when we met next morning at the breakfast
                  table, and I write it as apologetic therefor.
               In the earlier years of professional life, we are, it must be confessed, far more
                  influenced by emotions of a sympathetic nature, than in those sterner times, when
                  professional struggles for position and bread absorb our time and attention. I
                  find the most lasting impressions for good were made upon my heart, when I looked
                  to the honor of a call from almost any source, as sufficient remuneration for my
                  services. The scene I have described, had its influence upon me for many a year,
                  and I learned to be careful of the feelings of others. Many other affecting
                  incidents intervened in after years, and I could now and then view my conduct
                  without self-reproach, when reviewing my intercourse with a patient who could no
                  longer complain to me of the neglect of relatives, or thank me for my sympathy. A
                  history was added to my experience, which has often led me to reflect upon some of
                  your own and Dr. Richmond's theories, with regard to the influences of unkindness
                  to the unfortunate, upon the mental character of the unborn child. It received
                  such a touching corroboration by a thoughtless act of my own, that I shall never
                  forget it. It may be acceptable to you as a warning to parents, how they steel
                  their hearts against a child who has been the victim of a disappointed attachment,
                  and to physicians, how they jest with the unfortunate.
               A poor child, the daughter of a comfortable farmer, had fallen a victim, like Dr.
                  Richmond's patient, to the arts of the seducer; but she, though a harmless and
                  loving young thing, had no mother to sympathize with her through the gloomy period
                  of gestation. She was, indeed, herself the head of the family, her mother having
                  died broken-hearted, from the treatment of a brutal husband; a man who had sold
                  himself to gold. Day after day she toiled at the dairy and overlooked the
                  household, doing most of the labor with her own hands, uncheered by a word of
                  kindness, but often visited by a curse
                  from a brutal father. At night she retired to read the last letter of her lover,
                  who had enlisted during the Mexican war. Earnestly she prayed for death; but had
                  not courage, as she told me on the night her child was born, to swallow the fatal
                  draught she had prepared with her own hands, from foxglove growing in her garden.
                  It was planted by her mother; and she had been the child of prayer; each night
                  that poor mother would fold her little hands, and with tears invoke Heaven to
                  spare her for her child, and to soften the heart of her cruel husband; but grief
                  wore out her feeble frame, and she sank into the grave. A small mound, but a few
                  rods from the house, covered all that remained of her; and by her side, at the end
                  of five years, we deposited her only child, my poor patient; leaving her infant
                  and fatherless son, an idiot boy, under the sole direction of a severe housekeeper
                  and his brutal grandfather. The idea of the Indians of our country, that the Great
                  Spirit watches with peculiar care over those afflicted with insanity, and now and
                  then speaks his will through them, always struck me as peculiarly grand and
                  poetical in its tendency to truth; who shall say what lovely and powerful visions
                  of God flit through the darkened chambers of the soul He but fitfully lights, up
                  with His presence? And how do we know but God will one day strike light out of
                  darkness, and give us possession of the thread to recall reason to many of these
                  unfortunates, by playing on the magic harp-strings of latent sympathy, obscured by
                  the rude jar of cruelty? I always thought the hint I received, was an indication
                  of my own thoughtlessness and want of sympathy. One day I was summoned to a
                  farm-servant, in the family of my brutal employer, where I only consented to visit
                  for the attachment I bore to the poor child of my patient. The mental character of
                  this boy was of a very low order, and he often showed the influence of his
                  grandfather's conduct upon his nervous system, by his terror of a blow, which his
                  poor mother had often received before his birth. He would now and then utter short
                  sentences taught him by his mother, and it was observed when they showed any power
                  of mental connection, they always related to her. No wonder was it to me, for I
                  knew how devotedly and tenderly she loved him. Never had I seen more devotion,
                  even where Heaven had given the light of intellect to a child. As usual, my poor
                  little charge was lying listlessly on the grass, pulling to pieces a poor
                  grasshopper he had caught: opening the gate, I thoughtlessly put my hand somewhat
                  rudely under his chin, and exclaimed, "Sim, hold up your head; you must not do so;
                  don't you see how you hurt the poor grasshopper?" at the same time pinching his
                  ear: "how do you like that?" The poor boy, giving loose to his passion, made a
                  violent effort to kick me, and then suddenly checking himself, turned his eyes
                  reproachfully upon me, who had never before treated him harshly, and exclaimed,
                  "I'll tell my mother, and she won't let me pray the good God for you no more." He
                  had never been known to utter so long a sentence. I never heard one so suggestive
                  from mortal lips; was it not a fleeting visit from the Great Spirit? I soon
                  discharged my duties to my patient, and riding two miles to the next town,
                  returned and purchased my peace with a few candies. I felt the soft eyes of the
                  mother beaming reproachfully from her grassy bed upon me, and the sacredness of my
                  trust revived. Never since, have I viewed a person with any mental malady, without
                  thinking how solemn a duty we have to perform to them. Do you remember the manner
                  in which the late Dr. McDonald received the story, and the parallel case he gave
                  us, at our interesting visit to the Bloomingdale Asylum? I was glad, when four
                  years later, we placed the poor child by the dust of his mother; for his
                  grandfather married the housekeeper, no less brutal than himself, and his future
                  was hopelsss.
            
            
               
               THE CAUSES AND EVILS OF CELIBACY.
               WIFE AND HUSBAND-HUNTERS, DIFFERENT CLASSES OF—FORCED
                  MARRIAGES.
               IT is not at all surprising when we look around society, and estimate at their
                  true value the motives which actuate so large a portion of the human family, that
                  no popular writer has ventured upon a truthful exposition of the evils of
                  celibacy. The fear of incurring the wrath of rich or influential friends, or the
                  disapprobation of a class of society who would be the better for more enlarged
                  ideas of duty, has withheld those medical writers from whom we had a right to
                  expect it, from an exposition of a very unthankful character. There are indeed
                  (thanks to our wretched system of education) inherent difficulties in popularizing
                  the subject, only surmountable by a degree of tact that we are quite conscious we
                  do not possess. No difficulty exists in presenting a true and minute exposition of
                  the catalogue of miseries and vices, in a purely medical work; but such has been
                  the industry of medical men in stopping up every crevice of popular instruction on
                  this and kindred subjects, "lest the light should shine too brightly on the
                  unprepared mind," that they have yielded to the influence of a sickly and prudish
                  sentimentalism that suffers the insidious approach of the most unmanageable
                  diseases without warning, when a timely submission to one of the simplest and most
                  palpable laws of nature, would unquestionably have averted them. And if by reason
                  of a powerful and merely animal constitution tion, a class of the human family
                  escape an early death, and continue to drag out an existence, the arid selfishness
                  of which chills the atmosphere where some could, but for their presence, enjoy in
                  their purity all the intellectual graces and social affections, too often, alas!
                  do others, wretched victims of the most hideous and loathsome vices, fall into
                  premature graves without a suspicion of the true cause; or else the funeral pall
                  of intellectual darkness has too late been removed from the parent or the tutor,
                  to see it in a material form, inclosing the miserable remains of the child or the
                  pupil, who but for their dereliction, might have been preserved to fulfill the end
                  and object of his creation, and shed light and happiness on the domestic
                  circle.
               It will be seen, then, that on the very threshold of this important subject our
                  hands are tied; if we would not have even this feeble effort (only made because it
                  is the result of an irresistible conviction of duty) thrown with disgust from a
                  reader who is blinded by conventionality, we must speak in parables, and endeavor
                  to cheat him into a correct understanding of a subject, in which he has been
                  assiduously courting deceit, from the very period when his most powerful
                  instinctive impulses were directing him towards the truth. "Increase and
                  multiply," was the command of God; "male and female created he them:" thus it is
                  written. Whatever arguments the casuistry of a designing priesthood or other
                  selfish men, may advance to shelter themselves from the operation of this command,
                  we care not; there can be no law, beyond that imprinted by the finger of God upon
                  every blade of grass, and every animal however insignificant, moulded by his
                  Almighty Hand. The microscope itself reveals to us the universality of an adaptive
                  organism designed to carry out the divine mandate; our instinctive impulses and
                  dearest affections have confirmed it; and we unhesitatingly pronounce by virtue of
                  that mandate, that the perfect man or woman who does not marry, when no palpable
                  and insuperable able obstacles prevent
                  it, is committing a sin against nature and society.
               Let us consider for a moment the habits of those persons who fail to marry,
                  without some highly conscientious motive; such, for instance, as the necessity of
                  supporting helpless and dependent relatives, insurmountable poverty, or great and
                  arduous public duty. We will not take disappointed love into the list of excuses,
                  for that, after all, in but few years, becomes, however chastened with affection,
                  the most morbid selfishness.
               We have, in another place, subjected the universality of the injunction to the
                  physiological test. We will now trace the approaches of that miserable calculating
                  spirit, that operates upon so many of our young men, and prevents them occupying
                  the position intended by nature and by nature's God.
               We cannot agree with that clear-headed physician, the late James Johnson of
                  London: the close of her third Septenniad, or twenty-one years, for woman, and the
                  fourth, or twenty-eighth, for man, was the period assigned for matrimony by him.
                  Now, it is too melancholy a truth, that although the length of human life is
                  increasing in both countries, that period would too often leave a young and
                  unprotected family, to the mercy of a heartless world, or of a stepfather or
                  stepmother. Although we would prefer that the male should have attained the age of
                  twenty-five, and the female twenty, there may be the strongest reasons for the
                  abatement of two years in the former. The reasons are by no means generally so
                  good for the same abatement in woman, because the education and diet of that sex
                  rarely ensure her so good a constitution. American young men in city life, who
                  have escaped the curse of sexual disease, liquor and tobacco, have generally far
                  better constitutions at twenty-three, than women at eighteen. This would not be
                  so, if the negation of all physiological rules in her physical cal education did
                  not insure the result; woman being as perfect in her organism, when properly
                  reared, at eighteen, as man is at twenty-five; but society and its vices have made
                  it otherwise. Every motive brought to bear upon the impulses of a fashionable girl
                  in city life, makes the largest exactions upon her sensuous or nervous system, and
                  leaves the organism of her vegetative life, uncontrolled by a healthful equipoise:
                  hence neither her sleep nor exercise, her breathing nor digestion, are allowed
                  fair play in expanding and strengthening her feeble and exhausted system. That
                  accursed term, "marriage of convenience," fit only to be found in the mouth of an
                  unfortunate or a libertine, is now by no means too shocking to escape the lips of
                  a fashionable mother, alarmed at her husband's prospective failure, and the
                  consequent loss of her box at the opera. She must make profitable sale of her
                  daughters, because she cannot influence her sons, or their wives when they get
                  them. Whether the article be merchantable or not, a sale must be effected. The
                  father is too often so immersed in business, that he is scarcely consulted; the
                  family physician never; or if he be, he is perhaps a time-server, and looks
                  forward to a profitable return for withholding the truth.
               A knowledge of the frequent necessity of early and forced marriages, is only
                  operative in producing celibacy upon those of our sex acquainted with the
                  structure of city life, and the great value of a rich husband. It is unfortunately
                  no restraint upon those, who, reared in the comparative seclusion of a small town,
                  and possessing affluence, are subjected to the fascinations of even decaying city
                  splendor. These are often caught, and their domestic wretchedness and consequent
                  dissipation, furnish beacons for those who are still at large. As society
                  advances, these light-houses erected on the shoals of domestic misery, are
                  becoming constantly more common; there are few whose circle of acquaintance is at
                  all extensive, but can point to one or more of them and the wretched domestic desolation by which they are
                  surrounded. But we must describe the male fortune-hunter, before we attempt to
                  sketch his more impudent and wealthy rival.
               The difference in the deportment of the three principal species of wife-hunters is
                  very great. If the suitor possess only a profession, or a bare competence, and be
                  past thirty, and the lady young and wealthy, he is characterized by remarkable
                  precision of attire, and the attention he pays to all the little conventional
                  nothings of society: no man is more impressive in his assent to mamma's opinions,
                  and none more warmly interested in the particular church or charity she may
                  "patronize." Whilst he studiously agrees with Papa—that is, if madam allows his
                  presence in the parlor; if not, he need pay him no attention; indeed, absolute
                  rudeness will be more acceptable to the female partner than the contrary; he must
                  hold himself in readiness to accompany her to the opera and to church, and to
                  perform the general service of a foot-boy. He is not to object to being turned
                  into ridicule, or occasionally to receive the cut direct; particularly if some
                  fashionable and wealthy young gentleman should look twice at her and her dear
                  daughter; or some vulgar tobacco-chewing and greasy Congressman should court their
                  society. She is revelling in the anticipation of calling her daughter the wife of
                  the Honorable member from Cow Pen district beyond the Alleghanies; the bachelor
                  must take his chance, after she is sure that the Honorable won't bite. The
                  gentleman may occasionally erect his feathers at such outrageous conduct, but a
                  patronizing smile from mamma soon brings all right; and if the daughter be tender,
                  and the gentleman a fool, she may do almost anything but kick him. In due time
                  they are married; for this species are usually successful. He rarely applies for a
                  divorce; but deems it expedient not to be over particular in his inquiries of the
                  character of his wife's visitors; it might lead to imprudent discoveries.
               The next variety is quite a different character. Generally a foreigner, gay and
                  poor, with some credit at the tailor's, and an acquaintance that bleed well, he is
                  rather too familiar with cards to admit the idea of his having been educated at a
                  theological seminary. He used to be a count, but that commodity became so plenty
                  that it is now somewhat cheapened. He can play whist by the evening, and dance the
                  polka and schottische exquisitely; belongs to the most fashionable club, is a
                  frequent attendant at the opera, and nods familiarly when no ladies are near, to
                  some very fierce-looking gentlemen with large seal rings, jaunty cloaks, and
                  enormous colored beards and moustaches. The acute observer finds no difficulty in
                  classifying those gentry, as superiors of some fashionable hells, and not
                  unfrequently other establishments of a kindred character. Our specimen is a pupil,
                  and if successful in matrimony, may in due time become a principal. Nothing is
                  more common outside the circle of the highest intelligence of the native New
                  Yorker, than to see our young men. of probity and true dignity and agreeableness
                  of manner, thrust aside for such nuisances; and often does the hapless victim of a
                  weak mother and a designing knave, lament in agony over the cradle of a dying and
                  blood-poisoned babe, the blighted morning of a young life sacrificed by her who
                  should have been the guide and counsellor; whose unperverted instincts should have
                  detected the miscreant as the devoted bird does the hawk, ere his polluted breath
                  poisoned the atmosphere of a mother's love.
               Riches, when combined with a tolerably decent family genealogy, are an object of
                  boundless ambition, and in this city take precedence of all other recommendations.
                  From the clergyman to the market woman, all are equally blinded by it; neither
                  dissipation, nor an empty head, is often a drawback, whether in man or woman; and
                  alliances are every day contracted, where nothing but disgrace and
                     mortification tification can
                  reasonably be anticipated. Therefore, in this class of matrimonial candidates,
                  there are no rules of conduct whatever. The privileged possessor generally finding
                  a ready apologist for any conduct not openly outrageous; the most flimsy veil will
                  answer; a pew at church and a seat at the opera cover a multitude of offences, and
                  generally suffice for all derelictions short of robbery and murder.
               If such expressions be thought extravagant, we need only require of the objector a
                  retrospective glance at the alliances of the last ten years in fashionable life in
                  this city, and we will abide the result, confident that our opinion will be fully
                  sustained.
               The difference between a thoroughly selfish old bachelor and a man that is married
                  and fit to be married to a woman he loves, is about the same as that of an
                  American yacht and a Chinese junk; one will sail in the very eye of the wind—the
                  other only when it is dead astern.
               Your true bachelor, like the junk, is very stupid and awkward, and requires an
                  immense berth; he is given to seat himself in the lady's chair and to toast his
                  shins before the middle of the fire; very solicitous is he about his creature
                  comforts, and a perfect stoic to woman's charms. He takes no hints; never mind how
                  coolly he is treated, nor what symptoms of the opera or an evening party to which
                  he has not been invited he may perceive, so much the more lie will not go. Nay,
                  the very appearance of the lady's gallant will not move him; he can inflict
                  himself and his twaddle on some unfortunate member of the family; she may make the
                  best of him, for her martyrdom is certain. If there be a stupid and good-natured
                  brother who smokes fine cigars, and he will tolerate the insult to the sister, the
                  dining room will be rendered peculiarly acceptable at breakfast to those who have
                  delicate olfactories. The mental peculiarities of this creature are all
                  characterized by dogmatism and selfishness, and no one at all familiar with the
                  animal can fail at once to detect him.
               The marriage of a young girl to such an individual can be productive of nothing
                  but unhappiness; it is equally opposed to experience and natural instinct. The
                  soul as well as the body shrinks into arid selfishness when it does not early bow
                  to woman's charms. The lightning of the eye and the music of the voice are
                  quenched by the vice of celibacy, and the miserable creature dreams not that the
                  forfeit of his devotion to his personal comforts, is nothing less than the
                  capacity of the enjoyment of the most godlike attribute of his nature.

               ILL-CLAD poverty, numbed with cold, alone was abroad that winter's night, as the
                  white snow fleeced the frost-hardened ground. But never mind earth's cold bosom,
                  the rich man's heart doth warm him, and makes him merry, however blows the wind,
                  or rages the storm. Shiver, shiver on, beggar-poor! Ye have no hearts. Hungry
                  stomach and chilly skin belong to such as you. Kindly impulse nor feeling are
                  thine! Starvation and sense-dulling cold alone belong to you!
               Winter night! hast thou no tongue to tell how spiritless poverty cowers beneath
                  thy frozen breath, and vainly wraps its icy blood in tattered rags? Canst thou not
                  enter the summered air of earth's favored children, and teach a lesson to
                  them?
               Through the crunching snow trudged a weary boy, with alms-basket upon his
                  shivering arm. From his figure he seemed not over ten years old; but his face was
                  so wan and sad, that it was difficult to tell how many year-blights the beggar
                  child had seen. Summer clothes were still upon him; a tattered woolen comforter
                  was the only winter article he wore.
               Light yet enough remained with the snow's reflection to discern every outline of
                  chimney and housetop, against the milky sky. A gay carriage rolled noiselessly on,
                  with a beautiful girl well wrapped in fur and cape, whilst the snow was dashed
                  from the rapid wheels like a white dust. She saw the weary, thin-clad boy, as he
                  stopped, with head bent aside to the flake-burdened blast, to gaze on the smoking
                  horses as they plunged through the fast-deepening crust. The window was let down.
                  She threw a coin to the boy—it sank from her warm hand deep into the snow! It
                  might have brought bread and a cheering faggot; but the smitten child never got
                  it: the snow closed over it, whilst the blast grew keener. Trudge, trudge on,
                  weary boy, life is a God-lesson!
               Fire and lamplight gleamed through window pane and wide-open door, as the gay girl
                  leaped from the carriage step—health glowed as warmly from her bright cheek. The
                  snow melted as it fell on her up-turned face: on the beggar-boy it would have lain
                  as upon a corpse—life blood had ceased to warm it. Alas, for the beggar-poor.
               From lowly cot to palace-house, the snow lay unbroken, not a sound broke on the
                  night; the very watch-dogs were hid in some place secure from cold. The wind alone
                  was abroad, howling its wintry dirge through leaf-stripped tree and hedge. Still
                  the snow fell and drifted in ridge-like heaps—landmark and road-cut were all gone.
                  None could tell where poor man's lot or rich man's grounds began or ended; like in
                  the grave, their claims were one.
               The beggar-boy toiled on through drift and dark ere he returned, more weary as the
                  night gathered on. Thus is it ever with the humble poor; their load lightens not
                  though life lessens! No light, nor warming hearth, things that make house a home,
                  were there to welcome the wandering boy. He placed his basket upon a bench. A wick
                     still struggled to light the
                  wretched apartment as it flickered in the deep socket. An old woman lay asleep in
                  the corner, covered with rug and rags. The boy approached and touched her face
                  with his cold fingers—they were colder than the blood of starved age! Their chill
                  aroused her. Another light was placed in the socket, and a few dried leaves, with
                  shavings, were put beneath some rotten and water-soaked bark, to warm the frozen
                  fragments that unwilling charity had given; and thus wrinkled age and wasted
                  youth-life broke fast.
               The clock had just struck two, as I was summoned to the house of Mrs. T—. The same
                  carriage that in the evening had borne the beautiful girl, awaited at my door,
                  with its impatient horses snorting against the frosted air. In a few minutes I
                  entered the house. Mrs. T—met me in the hall; her face was deadly pale and her
                  manner much excited. Her at times singular nervousness, had struck me at my former
                  visits whenever her daughter ailed. She now informed me that her darling Emily was
                  very ill with high fever.
               The young girl lay with her head turned aside upon the pillow, her golden brown
                  hair scattered in wild profusion upon its white cover, whilst the nurse was gently
                  moistening the palm of her outstretched hand. The pulse was beating wildly at the
                  wrist and temples, which were scorching hot; fever heat glowed from her lustrous
                  eyes. As I kept my finger on the pulse, and watched the expression of my young
                  patient's countenance, something seemed to whisper—it was not from any regular
                  reasoning from the symptoms—that mind had much to do in this over-action of
                  matter. Whilst the nurse held the candle to her face, the traces of dried tears
                  shone on her suffused cheek. "Heartache surely is here," I said to myself.
               The mother watched my countenance with a painful solicitude. A faint harshness of
                  expression gave a certain rigidity to her features, which were still very
                  beautiful. There was something in the whole appearance of my patient that excited
                  my curiosity in the case. Some eight or ten hours had only passed since she had
                  thrown the snow-claimed alms to the beggar-boy, and now fever was running riot
                  through every artery in her body.
               Silently seating myself at the bedside, after administering a cooling draught, I
                  watched for the changes that might ensue. There is a sort of knowledge which
                  cannot be defined, that is garnered up by experience only—a peculiar manifestation
                  that has no language, and is only recognized by its impress on the senses. Every
                  practitioner experiences it daily; he cannot impart it, nor even make it
                  intelligible to another; yet, it makes the truest part of the basis of action, in
                  connection with the accurate inquiry into the cause and result of the disease
                  against which he is to contend.
               The snow continued to fall, and was driven crinkling against the double window
                  casements. A comfortable fire burned on the hearth, casting long shadows on the
                  floor and walls. The young girl dozed, but now and then started from her short
                  fevered sleep with eyes wildly open. Once or twice a deep sob escaped her lips,
                  and a few words unintelligible to the ear were uttered. After a time she slumbered
                  almost calmly. I placed my finger gently on her wrist; the pulse had lost much of
                  its increased strength and frequency. Here was the point—the one waited for by me
                  to declare myself. I was now satisfied that this sudden incursion of fever
                  originated from some violent mental cause.
               Her mother sat near the fire, its blaze lighting up every feature of her once
                  beautiful face, which still remained, very pale. In all my intercourse with Mrs.
                  T., I had never had so prolonged an opportunity of examining in detail the
                  expression of her countenance. The longer I gazed on her the more satisfied I became that she had not passed
                  through, life without a history.
               As we go through the world, and reflect on the different people we meet, the utter
                  sameness of their every-day actions and appearance strikes us, and we exclaim,
                  "they are all alike"—a mere fleshly multitude! It is only occasionally that we are
                  diverted from this human monotony, and are startled by the face of some one—it may
                  be in the thronged street or in the crowded room—and become instinctively
                  conscious that this one has not flowed down time's stream, without wreck of heart
                  and happiness, It was this sensation that struck me when first I became acquainted
                  with Mrs. T. A few vague rumors had floated around relative to her history: that a
                  strange desertion of her husband had taken place, and that he was afterwards found
                  drowned in the river near his house, and that by his death Mrs. T. had become
                  possessed of an immense estate. These tales, however, had soon subsided, and as
                  her means were large, and her charities ample, the gossips of the town quietly
                  dropped the past and speculated on the future, as all respectable gossips should
                  do.
               The longer I scanned her features, which at times became almost fierce, and varied
                  with the thoughts that seemed crowding her memory, the more I was satisfied that
                  this woman, generally so stately and self-possessed, had passed a stormy life at
                  some period when her passions were under less restraint than now. The voice of the
                  fevered girl diverted my thoughts: a few words were murmured, and then the lips
                  pressed tremblingly together, and a tear flowed and ran off her cheek. Suddenly
                  starting up in the bed, and threading her long curling hair with her slender
                  fingers, she exclaimed, in a wild, delirious tone:
               "It cannot be true. Oh, mother—tell me, mother I"—Mrs. T. fairly leaped to the
                  bedside, and placing her hand over her daughter's mouth, exclaimed, with
                  affrighted gesture:
               "What is it—what do you mean? My God, doctor, she raves."
               The young girl fell back on her pillows. The mother stood trembling and pale by
                  the bed, a nameless terror depicted on every feature. Turning to me, in a quick
                  restless voice, she bade me give her a quieting draught—"anything that would keep
                  her from raving." The room was not more than comfortably warm, yet the
                  perspiration stood upon the excited mother's forehead like a thick dew.
                  "Conscience," I thought to myself, "must lie here."
               In the course of an hour the sufferer slumbered heavily; her breathing was hurried
                  and oppressed; the fever heat had increased, and her moanings were more
                  constant.
               Day was just breaking as I left my young patient to return home. The snow was
                  still falling. The traces of wheels made during the night were nearly effaced.
                  Winter's white robe covered every tree, branch and shrub, post and fence. As the
                  carriage rolled noiselessly on, I was struck with the quiet and lifelessness that
                  reigned everywhere. The wind had gone down, and the air was intensely cold.
               As I looked out of the carriage window I saw a small boy struggling knee-deep in
                  the unbroken snow. It was the poor beggar-child, thin clad as of yesterday, with
                  his pale cheek as white as the snow he toiled through. I called to the coachman to
                  stop as we were passing the child. "Where are you going," I exclaimed, "in this
                  cold winter morning, my poor boy?"
               He raised his large dark eyes to my face; my heart grieved at their look of utter
                  hopelessness, as he simply answered, "To beg for myself and old grandma."
               "Are you not very cold in those thin clothes?" I asked. His little teeth chattered
                  as he answered, "I am very cold, sir."
               
               The horses, impatient at resting, were plunging violently against the traces, and
                  the coachman asked if he had not better drive on. I gave the boy a few silver
                  coins that were in my pocket, and the carriage passed by, I never saw that boy but
                  once again. His look haunts me to this day. As I drove on, memory was busy tracing
                  where I had ever seen features like his. The dark hair that laid in uncombed curls
                  upon his forehead, and clustered warmingly about his neck, as though in protection
                  against the bitter cold; his large black eyes with their long lashes; the
                  chiselled outline of his nose and mouth; these all struck me that somewhere I had
                  seen a face which strikingly resembled his. Poor boy! beauty was his only
                  possession!
               At breakfast, a letter was handed me which summoned me immediately to see one of
                  my children who lay ill at a distant town. Before leaving, I wrote a hurried note
                  to Mrs. T., stating the cause of my sudden departure, desiring that she would call
                  in, during my absence, another physician. The young girl's fate, and the
                  beggar-boy's sad face, were almost forgotten, during the journey, in my own
                  cares.
               On the sixth day after, I again found myself at home. My first thought was for
                  poor Emily. I dreaded to ask; there was something whispering at my heart that all
                  was not well. Whence comes this over-spreading gloom, that shrouds every ray of
                  hope within the racked brain? It hath no reasoning, nor any apparent rational
                  deduction; yet who has not experienced it, and felt that spirit was
                  prophesying?
               My suspense was not long; a messenger had just left, stating that the dear girl
                  was fast failing, and that her physicians had pronounced her laboring under typhus
                  fever. My God! how my heart sank as the words fell on my ear. I had dreaded this
                  mistake as I left. Alas! how many have fallen by the name of a disease and not by
                  the disease itself! When will medical men learn to cast aside the shackles,
                  fastened in ignorance, and which have so long clogged their progress? Thank God,
                  the time is not far distant when the wretched nosological works of the
                  superannuated schools will have ceased to be read, and the dust of neglect consign
                  them to a merited grave. Read these tomes, ponderous in error, and one would be
                  led to believe that disease consisted of an excess of vitality!
               After a hurried meal, I drove rapidly to Mrs. T.'s. The weather had again turned
                  intensely cold; the icy road cracked beneath my horse's feet. The only green thing
                  showing was where here and there the wind had blown the snow-caps from the stunted
                  cedar-tops. Earth looked arrayed for the grave.
               The house-door was quietly opened by a servant; in another minute I stood in
                  Emily's chamber. The mantel was crowded with numerous vials; the close atmosphere
                  of the room sickened me. Daylight just sufficient to discern objects was admitted
                  through a partly opened blind. My step was so light that no one perceived my
                  entrance. By the bed-side, with her head bowed down over one of her daughter's
                  pale hands, which she held in both her own, sat the wretched mother. It seemed to
                  me as though ten years had passed over her faded and care-worn countenance; her
                     hair had become gray! I could not move—my heart stood still. On
                  the young girl's temples, dark, round, blue marks with crossed gashes, showed that
                  the fatal cups had been at their work; the left arm, exposed by the withdrawn
                  sleeve of her night dress, was bandaged at the elbow—blood also had been taken
                  from the arm! Oh, God! how my heart ached. The doom of the sweet sufferer had been
                  thus surely sealed. Fatal error! The excitement of the brain had been
                  mistaken for its inflammation.
               
               I approached the bed; for the first time the desolate mother heard my step, and
                  turning quickly, she sprang from the chair, and placing her hands on my shoulders,
                  she bowed her head on my chest. She
                  sobbed wildly as though her heart would break.
               "Look, look, doctor, would you have known her? Oh God! she is leaving me—save her,
                  save her!"
               She sank fainting on the floor. We gently raised her, and bore her to her own
                  chamber. In a few minutes, I returned to my patient's room. She turned her head
                  languidly towards me, while her right hand moved as if to take mine. How dry the
                  palm was! Her color had faded away; the round moulded cheeks were sunken; her eyes
                  seemed double their natural size, and of a deeper color; the mouth was seemingly
                  swollen, whilst the lips parted sluggishly from the dark, crust-covered teeth.
                  With great effort she said: "Oh! I am glad you have come back to me—do try to save
                  me!"
               Poor child! her dark tongue was so thick and dry that her words were scarcely
                  intelligible. I felt her pulse: it was very rapid, and the blood felt thin like
                  water in the easily-compressed vein. Death was at its work in the young and
                  innocent!
               Sending the nurse from the room, I quickly took the young girl's hand within my
                  own. "Emily," I said to her, "do you really wish to live?" "Yes, yes," she
                  distinctly murmured," I am very young—too young to die!" "Then, dear child, tell
                  me, what has shocked your nervous system so terribly—tell me."
               With a strength, that startled me, she searched under the mattress side, and
                  placed a small note in my hand. It was slightly discolored, as though by time. I
                  opened it; the date was over twelve years back. It ran—
               "When you receive this, Mira, my career will have ended. By my death you will
                  inherit all. Let my unborn child have its just legal claim. Your child, 'Emily,'
                  take to your home, as though it were an adopted orphan. Let not her youth be
                  blighted by the knowledge of her unblest birth. I forgive you. Adieu for ever.—H.
                  T."
               My God! the doomed child was illegitimate! I stooped down and kissed the
                  sufferer's forehead, and promised I would be a father to her. "Come," I whispered,
                  "cheer up; your mother, if she has sinned, has suffered much for your sake-forgive
                  her."
               "I do forgive her," she answered; "but could I forget myself,
                  unblessed as I am? But I must live to know the truth. Oh where is the right owner
                  of all this wealth? My memory returns now indistinctly from my early days; all
                  seems in a cloud; but I remember a small cottage in a deep wood, where my mother
                  often came to see me, and a tall woman who took care of me; then a gay carriage
                  took me to a large house; but I never went back to the wood again. There mother
                  left me a long time, and when she came back—Oh, doctor, I can speak no more; do
                  give me something to strengthen me, and I will yet try to live!"
               Her pulse was almost countless from excitement and exhaustion. * * *
               The physician who was called in after my departure had found her with high fever
                  and delirious. Without sufficiently analyzing the case, he viewed it as an attack
                  of inflammation of the brain. A consultation was called; the second comer was
                  notedly a man who viewed every excitement as caused by "an over action of the
                  vessels," and the withdrawal of blood as its only relief. The nervous system he
                  ignored! from his theory, man was a mere combination of blood, blood-vessels, and
                  biliary secretion (more or less deranged). Calomel, salts, and the lancet were his
                  Hercules. From his often reiterated words, the grand causa
                     mortis amongst this human family was "Serosity." And some very
                  evil-minded wags amongst his brethren styled him "Dr. Serosity," The poor child
                  was purged, cupped, and blooded, to subdue this so termed "over action of the vessels." Verily it may cure the
                  vessels, but it certainly kills the patient.
               A cordial was administered by my own hands, and in a short time sleep came over
                  her. The pulse fell to a little above its natural standard, but the
                     life-current was nigh exhausted; there was no blood left for the renewal
                  of brain or nerve, or of any other vital tissue! My heart was bitter against this
                  murderous adherence to false principle. A human life—the life of a young and
                  spotless girl was the forfeit. And this by the great judging world—the wise
                  world—by fathers and mothers-is termed "experience"—a word too long concealing
                  perpetuation of ignorance and often repeated errors. Will ye ever learn?
               Night again closed in; the wind had gone down as the sun set. Another night of
                  cold was ushered in. Woe to the poor! Woe to the hungry and fireless! But, God in
                  his mercy adds no thorn to muscle or brain of the cold-perished as life steals
                  away. Pain is lulled to rest; the once active brain is no longer tortured with
                  quick changing thoughts; but sweet, calm, and peaceful repose steals with dreamy
                  softness over every stronghold of the mind's citadel, and death begins where sleep
                  endeth!
               The wretched mother still retained her room. By night-watch, and fast, and
                  heart-corroding memories, her energies had been suddenly snapped. Pride and
                  passion, so long her friends, had now deserted her, leaving every heart-agony
                  deeply line-graven on her faded countenance. In all my life I had never seen such
                  a wreck! The proud look of self-possession was gone, suppliant dejection filling
                  every feature; the haughty carriage bowed beneath a weight, as though long years
                  had robbed the muscles of their strength and pliant mould. Her voice, but of late
                  so charged with repressed impulse, was now low, and every word spoken with a
                  melancholy slowness, that but too often becomes the forerunner of some great
                  life-change.
               As I entered late in the evening, I found her sitting in an easy-chair near the
                  fire. A small private secretaire had been brought from the library to her chamber;
                  its lid was down, and as I seated myself, she took from a package of tied letters
                  a sealed parcel and placed it in my hand.
               "Read this, doctor, at your leisure. My pilgrimage of time is nigh ended. You will
                  judge how great my sin, and how severe my punishment has been. I ask no
                  forgiveness, for there will be none left to forgive me. But charity
                  of feeling I beg from you; for I would not like to die knowing that you would
                  retain a severity of thought against one who, however erring, had paid the forfeit
                  by great {suffering."
               She spoke for some minutes longer, in the same low, distinct voice. Well I knew
                  her heart was nigh crushed! I soon left her and sought her daughter's chamber. How
                  still everything seemed! The very candle with its long flame parted by the
                  thickened wick-char, seemed not to flicker as it burnt on! I looked at the bed;
                  the sweet girl lay with both hands crossed upon her bosom, as though in prayer. An
                  orange-blossom had dropped from her grasp and lay neglected by her side. Her
                  life-hand never touched it more. I placed its stem gently back in her palm; for
                  Death had claimed her as his bride!
               A wild piercing shriek sounded through the house; the erring mother now knew that
                  she was alone in the world!
               Whilst the shrouding of the dead took place I retired to my room in the house, and
                  opened the sealed package. It briefly told its tale of sin and sorrow. How from
                  first love Emily was the fruit; and how, unknown to all, the child had been
                  secreted. That about three years after the birth, she was married to Harold T.,
                  whom she never loved; and how, by a singular accident, the knowledge of her
                  trespass was made known to him. That after violently cursing her, he left her, and
                  was shortly after found drowned. That the letter so fatal to Emily had accidentally dropped from her secretaire, and was
                  picked up by her, unknown to the mother till the day before my return, when she
                  missed it. It then spoke of the birth of a male child after T.'s death, and that
                  seized with an insane fury, she had resolved he should never inherit the father's
                  name and wealth; and how, through the connivance of a nurse, it was placed, with a
                  sum of money, at a beggar's door, and a dead child laid beside her in its stead.
                  That before sending the infant away, she had his father's initials tatooed on its
                  left arm. All trace of the child had been lost; the beggar woman had died, and
                  another had taken it. At length her heart had reproached her, but search had been
                  made in vain.
               As I read this tale of crime and repentance, memory traced out the features of the
                  beggar-boy, as he stood shivering in the deep snow before me. Like a sudden light,
                  it burst upon me; the features that had so tormented my memory to recall were
                  those of the unhappy mother. Quickly I walked to Mrs. T.'s room: she was not
                  there. I entered. Emily's; the mother was clasping her daughter's shrouded body,
                  weeping as though her heart would break. Gently bearing her back to her own
                  chamber, I informed her that perhaps another child long lost might be restored to
                  her. She listened as one bewildered. I then informed her of my adventure with the
                  beggar-boy.
               It was hardly day-dawn as I entered the carriage. My breath froze against the
                  window-panes. After a few minutes the horses stopped before the wretched
                  snow-covered hovel. Not a word answered the footman's repeated knocks. I opened
                  the carriage door and placed my hand on the latch; the door opened; it was neither
                  locked nor barred; for no thief would enter there. In the corner lay a bundle of
                  rugs with some straw apparently used for a bed, but it was unoccupied. Near the
                  fire-place, where naught but a little ashes and well-charred bark remained,
                  half-reclining reclining in a large Wooden chair, lay the beggar-boy. His cap had
                  fallen on the ground, and his dark curling hair fell clustering over his extended
                  arm as his head rested on it. He had seemingly fallen asleep the night before, for
                  his thin summer clothes were on, and his basket yet filled with the fragments of
                  broken feasts, remained untouched at his feet. I put my hand upon his beautiful
                  head; it was icy cold! Quickly pushing back the hair from his cheek, the
                  unmistable evidence of death met my eye. He had apparently fallen asleep weeping,
                  for a tear lay frozen between the long lashes!
               We raised the stiffened corpse of the ill-fated youth, and tearing away the thin
                  sleeve from his left arm, the letters H, T. were discovered in light blue points.
                  Deserted, famished, and frozen, Death had claimed the lone boy before he knew a
                  mother's love.
            
            
               
               HOTEL AND CLUB-HOUSE LIFE IN NEW YORK.
               PERNICIOUS INFLUENCE ON THE MANNERS AND MORALS OF THE YOUNG—THE ART
                  OF FURNISHING A HOUSE WITH ECONOMY AND SIMPLE ELEGANCE.
               
                  
                     
                        A woman's crown of glory should be her family,
                        Her throne—home; her sceptre—affection.
                     
                  
               
               No subject of social interest can fill the mind of the physician with more
                  depressing reflections, than the pernicious influence of the hotels and
                  club-houses of this city, on the minds and manners of the young. But one other
                  phase of life amongst us can vie with it in developing the passions destructive of
                  domestic joys, and crushing out the graces and benign influence of the character
                  of woman on our sex: and that is, where wealth has been suddenly acquired, and the
                  minds of the parents have not been refined by education. The evil influence of
                  hereditary wealth on the domestic virtues, where the parents are not of an
                  intellectual character, is unfortunately too common a subject of observation in
                  this city; still nothing is more evident than the fact that the long-continued
                  possession of it, generally prevents that insane passion for show so certain to
                  follow its sudden acquirement, in all who have been accustomed to view its
                  prospective possession, principally as the means of gratifying the senses by the
                  display of vulgar finery.
               The influence of the early development of the passions upon our bodily vigor, and
                  the impossibility of acquiring a healthful condition of the mind and the
                  affections, without an equipoise of action in both, cannot escape the philosophic
                  observer, whatever the bigoted moralist may aver to the contrary. We pity that
                  parent, who expects by crushing the earlier demonstrations of passional attraction
                  for physical beauty in the opposite sexes, to elevate the moral character of the
                  child. That very attraction was designed by nature as the guide to a union
                  calculated to carry out the perfection of her plan. Shakspeare, in his "Tempest,"
                  has made Miranda speak her attractions to the young Duke of Milan, in all the
                  native simplicity of a heart unwarped by prudery. An unwise attempt by a parent to
                  suppress the free utterance of this instinctive feeling of admiration, will be
                  followed by the cultivation of falsehood, and the concealment of attachments, that
                  may jeopardize and lose for a lifetime a daughter's happiness, and entail misery
                  on her children. No situation can be more unfavorable to elicit a child's true
                  character, by a parent, or the real sentiments of a lover, than these
                  congregations of incongruous temperaments and emotions, these caravanseras of
                  wife, husband, and mistress hunters. Who that has a natural emotion left, unwarped
                  by artificial vulgarity, can enter the parlor or dining-room of one of them, we
                  care not how highly heralded by the press; who that has ever gazed with admiration
                  upon the garniture of meadow, vale and wood, or contemplated the appropriate
                  disposition of the colors of a wild flower or a bird, can avoid a sensation of
                  disgust at the scene that meets his view? The truthfulness of our remarks will be
                  more apparent by recalling the preceding emotions and the time in which we are
                  usually ushered into "the splendid parlor," or the
                     "magnificent dining-room." Fresh from the diversified face of the
                  country, undulating with hill and dale, mellow with the soft gray of the rock and
                  tender green of the meadow, spotted with the simple and chaste colored wild
                  flowers, enlivened by the running brook, and garnished by the leafy forest with
                  its flying birds, with cataract, precipice and mountain—the whole soul filled with
                  the beauty of nature, the eye is
                  suddenly oppressed and offended by flaunting carpets and curtains, and tawdry
                  walls, whilst the everlasting and ungraceful and enervating rocking-chair is put
                  in motion by a woman—perhaps a nobly-formed specimen of her sex, covered with
                  colors and figures of objects having no synonyms in anything on the earth, except,
                  perhaps a peony, a parrot, or a sunflower. Should you desire to escape this
                  infliction, and seek the hall as a present relief from the oppressiveness of the
                  exhibition, you are offended with the presence of the nauseous spittoon, and its
                  flood of tobacco juice, whilst some victim to the disgusting habit is in the
                  immediate neighborhood, ensalivating and preparing to expectorate the filthy
                  fluid. These exhibitions, it is true, are not always visible; the "private
                  entrance" may protect your wife or daughter from the drench, but the man who
                  debases himself by such habits, may claim an introduction to either of them, and
                  your business relations may be such as to make it desirable to avoid offending
                  him. Who can deny the justness of this cause of offence? The poorest and plainest
                  man may be in all respects a gentleman. So long as his cleanly person and
                  unobtrusive manners offend no one, he is entitled to more respect than the
                  wealthiest and most flaunting and loud-mouthed vulgarian. But let us not forget
                  our object; we would present analytically to our readers, our views on the subject
                  of the influence of home on the hearts and manners of the young. Custom has
                  conceded to the young wife and mother, the high privilege of adorning the domestic
                  altar with the virtues and graces of her sex; to her is committed the privilege of
                  soothing the asperities of our rougher nature, and refining our sensibilities,
                  blunted by collision with a world unmindful in its ceaseless whirl, of the better
                  influences of life. It is vain to expect a graceful discharge of the domestic
                  duties of a home, when the earlier years of adolescence and married life are spent
                  in adorning the person and satiating the appetite with the vapid amusements and
                  frivolous conversation of hotel life, with no occupation but ministering to dress
                  and appetite.
               We unhesitatingly declare that the young girl, wife or mother, fills a higher,
                  aye, and often a more graceful station in the estimation of the majority of our
                  own sex, when discharging the filial or maternal duties of the humblest home, than
                  when, bedizened with jewels, she is enacting all the absurd trickery of a
                  ball-room. I address not this remark to him or her who has already reached the age
                  when society and nature has a right to demand their elevation to the dignified
                  position of a housekeeper and a parent, and who still look with scorn upon the
                  patient toil and assiduous care of the humblest individual discharging that sacred
                  obligation. But one answer can be expected from a source so selfishly unmindful of
                  their duties. It is notorious, that amidst unexampled prosperity in our commercial
                  and professional circles, marriage is delayed to a far later period of life, than
                  was common at the commencement of the present generation. This has, of course, a
                  reason: my belief is, that it may be found in the preference given by so many of
                  our young people to boarding-houses and hotels. The higher classes of the former,
                  and the latter almost universally, are furnished in a far more costly manner than
                  a majority of young men can afford, whilst a style of living of corresponding
                  expensiveness, could not be maintained by less than double the cost of that
                  undignified and constrained mode of life.
               Setting aside the evils of that more or less ill-selected and extensive circle of
                  acquaintance unavoidable when a young couple board at a hotel, let us endeavor to
                  prove that the magnificent furniture of our hotels and boarding-houses is
                  inelegant and absurdly extravagant; we do not mean to say that it is not
                  "splendid" "magnificent," "gorgeous," "superb," or dazzling to the eye; we mean
                  simply that it is inelegant and oppressive to the eye of true taste. As we design
                  this book to have a practical bearing,
                  and hope it will influence some of our readers to select a more rational and
                  simply elegant mode of life, we begin with those articles combining the ornamental
                  and useful.
               Firstly, of CARPETS.—It is now well known to those who investigate, by dissection
                  after death, the diseases of the body, that the microscope will frequently detect
                  small particles of wool and minute concretions of particles of dust, inhaled from
                  the atmosphere, where they are constantly flying about. The lungs in a state of
                  health will ordinarily l throw off all such matter, by sneezing or coughing; still
                  as it has repeatedly been found in the lungs of persons who have died from
                  pulmonary disease, confining them to the house for weeks anterior to the period of
                  death, the inference is irresistible that they have been inhaled from the
                  apartment in which the sick person has lain. It may be said that this would
                  exclude altogether the use of carpets from sick rooms, or indeed from the whole
                  house. Strictly and logically speaking it would; but owing to custom, and the
                  natural power of wood and stone, by means of their superior density, to conduct
                  off the animal heat, and that with distressing results in debilitated persons, and
                  as our women cannot be educated in this generation up to cork soles in the house,
                  carpets will doubtless continue to prevail till a more elegant and artistic taste
                  shall banish and replace them with hard or polished wood. Stone, from its power of
                  attracting moisture, will not answer for family or sleeping rooms. Very well,
                  then, as what can't be cured must be endured, let us investigate the properties of
                  those gorgeous carpets, with the fleecy and velvety texture, which are so
                  indispensable to the happiness and gentility of an American housekeeper. Firstly,
                  as it regards their health-destroying properties. Every housekeeper knows that
                  they cannot be thoroughly swept, because the dust is forced downwards at each
                  successive effort, and protected from the action of the fibres of the broom-this
                  is evident enough; moreover, as they are tacked down, and are exceedingly heavy,
                  they are rarely shaken, whilst the windows are kept shut as much as possible to
                  avoid the dust from the streets. Every one who enters a parlor thus carpeted will
                  perceive, by the peculiar character of the close and oppressive smell, that it
                  proceeds from the carpet. Now, in one word, the more there is of it the more this
                  smell will prevail; if it be unhealthful, the longer the parlor is occupied the
                  greater will be its evil influence on the lungs. But let us examine this carpet
                  artistically. What was designed in its peculiar structure and gorgeous flowering?
                  The nearest model we can select would be grass and flowers, and yet it would be
                  rather difficult to find gray or dove-colored grass; and the figures, however
                  gorgeous, but poorly resemble the lovely ornaments of the wood or the prairie. It
                  seems, then, they are not a successful imitation of nature, not only in form and
                  color, but in the sameness and wearisome effect of the continued recurrence of the
                  rude unmeaning figures. Bacon, in his expressive and quaint old way, makes a
                  remark which we have often thought would admirably apply to the stereotyped stucco
                  and gilt cornices and paper wherewith our parlors, and the berths and panels of
                  our gorgeous steamboats are overburdened: "The way to amplify
                  anything is to break it, and to make anatomy of it in several
                     parts, and to examine it according, to several
                     circumstances, and this maketh a greater show if it be done
                     without order, for confusion maketh things muster more; and
                  besides, what is set down by order and division, doth
                  demonstrate that nothing is left out or omitted, but all
                  is there; whereas, if it be without order, both the mind
                     comprehendeth less that which is set down, and besides, it leaveth
                  a suspicion that more is to come." It would have been difficult to have expressed
                  more plainly, true artistic tact in imitating nature. If we look upon the pansied
                  carpet of the meadow and field, we find
                  a lovely illustration of this sentiment: there is no order in the distribution of
                  the flowers. The wood, the gray rock, the mossy trunks, and the velvety grass,
                  furnish subdued and delightful quiet for the eye, whilst the vivid tints of
                  scattered flowers, put in the lights, as it were, in their most natural and
                  agreeable way. The scarlet cardinal flower in the shady recesses of a wood vividly
                  illustrates our meaning; the same beautiful object transplanted in a monotonous
                  row, by the side of a whitewashed city fence, produces a far less agreeable
                  effect.
               But flowers, however judiciously and sparsely disposed, are usually but poorly
                  imitated on a carpet; the colors are never shaded with sufficient delicacy, to
                  make even a tolerable resemblance to the many beautiful pictures of them that may
                  be had for a few shillings. Not only appropriate and tasteful pictures, but the
                  many beautiful statuettes of chaste and classic device, many of them reduced in a
                  manner quite admirable in their anatomical proportions and artistic skill, and so
                  cheap as to be within the reach of great numbers of persons who live on salaries,
                  are miserably marred in their effect by the gaudy colors of a carpet, whose
                  counterpart may be seen in almost every hotel and steamboat. The flaunting figures
                  preoccupy and oppress the eye, and reflect varied and ill-contrasted colors upon
                  the statue or the picture, utterly deranging its harmony of light and shade: when
                  this is increased by the usual concomitants of showy curtains, and chintz-covered
                  and red and green sofas, with a yellow wall and a number of looking-glasses, and
                  China monster flower-pots, the eye is sadly oppressed and finds no relief but in
                  looking on the sky or the grass.
               It is much to be regretted that our ingenious countrymen will not turn their
                  attention to the preparation of cheap closely-woven or felt carpets, of uniform
                  shades of gray and green: these might be delicately crossed in a tesselated or
                  lozenge form, with threads of gold for the green, and some darker color for the
                  gray ones. They would be both beautiful and appropriate for neat parlors or
                  dining-rooms; and if the latter be nearly on a level with the grass plot, and a
                  large combined door and window all of glass down to the floor and in the middle,
                  instead of the two windows now in use, the continuous effect of the green of the
                  carpet and grass plot would be extremely beautiful: few realize the delightful
                  effect of distance in the penned-up city; we are free to confess our dinner is
                  often spoiled (when no more agreeable object is before us), by the prison-like
                  effect of the immense brick pier between the two windows, occupying the precise
                  place where the space and light is most wanting, and destroying one of the corner
                  spaces in the apartment so desirable for a sofa or table. At a future time we
                  shall enter on the subject of other articles of domestic comfort, and go at length
                  into a plan for the collective yet separate arrangement of elegant private
                  apartments in a large phalanstery, after the manner of a hollow square. That these
                  can be made within the reach of the salaries of our best clerks, does not admit of
                  a doubt and that similar smaller yet perfectly neat and comfortable apartments are
                  attainable by the common laborer, we intend to demonstrate to the satisfaction of
                  all.
               We deprecate with great sincerity and earnestness, the growing passion of the
                  young of both sexes for boarding and club-houses: They keep up an absurd idea that
                  tinsel show and vulgar finery are essential to a respectable and elegant
                  appearance. Marble, silks, and worsted hangings, silver plate, and mahogany—may
                  all be artistically and beautifully replaced by other and cheaper materials. The
                  modern hotel parlor, is as oppressively loaded with finery as the shoulders of its
                  often beautiful mistress; and if well formed and proportioned, is no less marred
                  in its use and design, than those lovely outposts of that citadel of love, that so
                  often capitulates to the attacks and stratagems of unworthy conquerors. The young woman who forms her estimate
                  of manner and moral worth in a lover, by what she usually sees in most of those
                  who may seek to win her regard in such hunting-grounds, will often find the prize
                  of little value: and if our own observations do not greatly mislead us, the young
                  man who desires to improve his manners and elevate his social condition, will find
                  his object greatly facilitated by seeking it in the quiet domestic circle rather
                  than in the hotel or the club-house.
            
            
               SKETCHES OF A WESTERN STUDENTS'S LIFE.
               MY FIRST CASE—THE POISONER—A DEMON.
               THE sunshine of September is the softest, the brightest, the purest in the year.
                  Spring has passed, her blossoms and flowers have faded; fruit has come on the
                  trees, grass is gathered to the barn, the wheat is garnered, and all nature's
                  bounties hasten to a shelter, except the slow, majestic corn crop, before the
                  mellowing suns of September come to us. Away off on the hill-side, as the eye
                  wanders in the distance, the rich yellow and deep red maple leaf paints the forest
                  with the bright hues of autumn. Nature is not yet dying, but ripening; the leaf is
                  not yet dead, but is full of life; it has gathered up all its beauties, to give
                  one full vigorous bloom before it dies. When the leaves begin to fall, melancholy
                  begins to brood over the spirit; our songs are all sad ones; the voice has mellow
                  tones, soft, sorrowful, but joyous. In the spring-time we shout with excitement;
                  in summer we are silent, brooding in thought over the gestation of nature; then
                  the full maturity of autumn comes, and our soul swells with emotions we cannot
                  describe: it is a deep and intense joy; but we still feel lonely, and
                  dread the approach of winter as a cold-hearted destroyer; flower, leaf, fruit,
                  stem—all fade, wither, die, in his cold, cheerless death-embrace. Spring is the
                  season of the affections; it is hard to be selfish in spring-time: nature is so
                  full of sympathy, of gushing life, of generous colors, and many-tinted flowers,
                  that the heart grows warm, and swells and beats, and pants with a new life, which seeks
                  instinctively to diffuse itself into all things that have life.
               I would like to die in the autumn of life, say turned of fifty, and in the month
                  of September, when the grand old forests are in the "sere and yellow leaf," when
                  the light is soft, the winds are still, when the twilight is coming, and the soft,
                  still breeze sighs over the placid lake, where I hope and pray that my eyes may be
                  closed, gazing on the water. One friend I would like to be with me and only
                     one, and that a friend who has never deceived me. The music of a violin
                  I should crave at such a moment; it is the first music that I ever loved; it will
                  be the last. My mother's voice would be sweeter, but its tones were hushed in
                  death before I could remember them, and now they do not return to me—I cannot
                  recall them.
               I had lived all summer with an elderly lady, near a small brook, skirted with
                  willows, beside which I used to lie and pore over Bell, Richerand, Gregory and
                  Thomas, shaded from the sun by a large black birch and two friendly maples. Here
                  summer had passed, her fruits had ripened, and autumn had come, with her fading
                  leaves, tinkling sounds, and wild murmurs. Nobody felt any interest in the poor
                  student; his pale face and scanty wardrobe were forbidding—at least they attracted
                  no one.
               Towards the close of August, '38, the school-children had wandered into the thick
                  shade beside the low stream that ran through the meadow. Among them was a slim,
                  raw-boned, cross-eyed, dark-haired vixen, about twelve years old; she always went
                  bare-foot and bare-headed; her long, coarse hair streamed in the wind, and her
                  sinister look was always a presage of evil. She was regarded by the country people
                  as a pup of the devil, and hated by every one who knew her. One day she collected
                  around her six young girls, from six to ten years old, and having dug from the
                  ground some conium maculatum (poison muskrat
                  root), and washed it in the brook, she persuaded the children to eat it, by first
                  tasting it herself, and adroitly spitting it out. The neighborhood was soon in an
                  uproar, for the children began to show signs of poison. My preceptor was gone to a
                  wedding, and death seemed impending over the whole group. Sulphate of zinc (white
                  vitriol) is one of the quickest emetics, but in the fright I could find none, and
                  no time was to be lost, and I resolved on trying the power of milk and oil, in
                  such quantities as to produce vomiting. With these and the aid of some good
                  ladies, I succeeded in vomiting five; from the stomachs of three of them, large
                  pieces of the deadly root were ejected. Milk and warm lard, melted, were then
                  again used most freely, and served to protect the coats of the stomach against the
                  effects of the poison. The five were saved. But not so with the sixth, a little
                  sister of the witch who had, apparently by a kind of Satanic intuition, given the
                  poisonous weed to the children. Her sister had received a large close into her
                  stomach, and started for home with her destroyer, who ran from her in terrible
                  fright when she found that she was having convulsions, When the others were
                  relieved, I started in pursuit of the little girls, and found the poisoned one
                  lying in the road, a mile from home, in violent spasms. With the little sufferer
                  in my arms, I walked rapidly to a log dwelling, some eighty rods from the road.
                  She passed from one convulsion into another with great rapidity, and all efforts
                  to vomit her were unavailing: the fatal poison had entered the nervous system, and
                  was hastening to extinguish the life of the little sufferer. The first symptoms of
                  approaching death were seen on the skin, in the form of dark, maculated spots,
                  which changed quickly to a lighter hue; then the remainder of the skin passed from
                  a pale white to a leaden hue, and then a sudden quivering of the whole body,
                  especially the extremities; the muscles of the mouth were drawn from side to side,
                  and the eyes opened widely and rolled in a rapid circular motion, till the whole
                  aspect of the child was hideous beyond description. Death closed the scene, but
                  not my remembrance of the horrid sufferings of the little victim. When the
                  helpless child dropped down in the road, the elder sister fled for home and
                  disappeared from sight, and after a long search, we found her in the granary,
                  astride of an old flax-brake, her grey wild eyes flashing terror, and her raven
                  locks hanging wildly around her face. We asked her why she gave the poison to the
                  children. She replied that she did not know; that she gave it to her sister first,
                  and then the other children consented to eat it. Her face was a picture of
                  demonism; she alternately laughed, and cried, and howled.
               Ten years afterwards, when visiting the place, I met the funeral procession of a
                  young mother and her first child. I wandered into the crowd at the grave; and, as
                  is usual in new places, the corpse was shown for a last time, just before
                  consigning it to the narrow house. On looking upon the face, I recognized the
                  features of the juvenile hag upon the flax-brake; her hair yet black and glossy,
                  and parted across her contracted skinny brow. Her infant lay on one arm, sleeping
                  its eternal sleep. The adventure with the poisoned children came over f me with a
                  chilling shudder, and I thanked God that the dead one before me had not left her
                  likeness on the earth. That she deliberately gave the fatal dose to the children I
                  never had a doubt; but I have wept over her case in pity, for her evil was born in
                  her. She died of consumption, caused by a scrofulous taint in her blood; and I
                  give my explanation of some of the consequences of scrofula, for the benefit of
                  those who read this tale, and as a contribution of my small mite to throw back the
                  accursed idiotic lie, that diseases are caused by the mysterious providence of
                  God! No! it is our contempt for God's laws.
               The effect of scrofula on all who inherit it seems to be, to quicken and vivify
                  the temperament. The intuitions of such persons are as quick and agile as a ray of
                  light; and among many females who are thus disposed to consumption, we find the
                  most loving and angelic spirits; while others seem born with a demon in them, and
                     involuntarily, it appears to me, they act out the tendency of that
                  idiosyncrasy. The general tenor of our lives generates in us a life fluid, and
                  that fluid floats in our nervous system, partaking of all and every element of our
                  life and being. That was inspiration, almost, that induced the remark
                  that "the motive power of the human heart had its earliest inception in maternal
                  love." And if that maternal love is charged with goodness, the being
                  that imbibes, its first life-throb from its divine impulse, is
                  essentially a being of good; but, if that maternal life is penetrated with a
                  throng of evils, wrongs and outrages, then the being whose heart
                     impulse receives its vital rays from such maternal elements, will be
                  probably a hideous human basilisk, whose destiny is to sting, and bite, and infuse
                  its virus into surrounding hearts. The evil passions, brooding like so many demons
                  in our souls, and from thence re-acting on our vital nutritive economy, actually
                  eliminate in our psychical systems a miasm that pervades and shelters itself in
                  our blood, and, sooner or later, finds its way into our physical nature, and, like
                  the canine virus, at some inauspicious moment, suddenly rouses itself into a
                  terrible activity, and consumes and wastes our mortal life.
               Startling as such a doctrine may appear, it is, nevertheless, sustained by facts
                  that seem clear as holy writ; and this idea finds a striking confirmation in that
                  tale in the good old book, that represents our first parents as created immortal,
                  but doomed to mortal death by partaking of the forbidden tree; for imbibing a
                     lie into their existence, the whole race are doomed to mortal
                  death.
               M. Thiers, the eloquent historian of the Revolution in France, in speaking of the prominent actors in
                  those terrible scenes, without knowing the law of its origin, describes many of
                  its heroes as having a singular color of skin and aspect of
                  countenance. Robespierre is said to have had a sallow countenance, and a green and
                  hideous tinge of blood, that painted the veins through the skin of a deep and
                     yellowish green. The "green-eyed monster" was the central
                  soul-element of his life, and consumed and poisoned him, and sent the best and
                  dearest of his friends to the edge of the glittering knife.
               An organization charged with a soul-poison, may elicit its psychical
                  correspondence from such soul systems, and infect other beings with their own
                  rabies, as surely as the dog will communicate his poison by his bite. The conduct
                  of my little hag finds its explanation in this law of the life-forces. Her mother
                  had suffered much with a nervous affection, and left the fatal impress on the mind
                  and body of this daughter. Her demoniacal nature urged her, by an irresistible
                  necessity, to do mischief to some one. The wrong imbibed into her own being, she
                  sought to act out upon those around her. When questioned as to her motive, she
                  replied, "She did not know; she was a great sinner." The clamor of
                  the deed died away in a few weeks, and my student was packing up his duds for a
                  tramp, Rumor spoke for a whole week of bestowing some memorial upon him, for his
                  prompt and manly action, in the form of a new shirt or a good dinner (and God
                  knows he needed both badly enough), but the one nor the other ever came. He that
                  beheads a king is immortal, but he that brings back to the bosom of affection our
                  household gods, the darlings of our lives, is forgotten. Thus early,
                  I learned the great truth to which every physician can soon testify.
               A few weeks found your dreamer in new scenes and new sensations; for whatever
                  change might come, his heart could always feel, and his eye and ear enjoy. He
                  could find a song in the falling of a leaf; in the murmur of a brook, there dwelt
                  a pervading life; the moving of a muscle on the human face, often sent a thrill
                  along his nerves and fire into his heart.

               I AM satisfied from observation and a close analysis of my own thoughts during the
                  various phases from infancy to manhood, that the plan of imparting instruction to
                  children and adults, is radically absurd. It is not my present purpose to examine
                  or prove the peculiar errors of any system, and I can only rely upon the results
                  that shall follow the plan, I have thus far adopted in the education of my
                  children, to prove the injustice of including it in the general category of its
                  predecessors.
               Before I attempt its detail, let me for a moment retrace the painful but
                  instructive path through which I reached the sixteenth year of my life; the period
                  in which I made the alarming discovery that I was profoundly ignorant of all
                  useful knowledge. I shall be perfectly free in my statement of thoughts, feelings,
                  and actions, for it is only by that course that I can attain the object in view-to
                  show that there are some minds so constituted, that the principle of faith in
                  others, without collateral and active proof of its being justly due, is literally
                  absent, and that I suspect it is the very absence of faith in children (that very
                  quality by the way that has been assigned them so preeminently) is the cause of so
                  many of them growing up dunces.
               I never had any faith. The very first incident I remember ber in life, was a union
                  of doubt in others, and selfishness, coupled with the exercise of childish tyranny
                  to attain my object—the possession of a worthless green apple. Well do I remember
                  the discovery of the treasure in the straw of a barrel, from which the fruit had
                  been taken for family use. A favorite black boy, of my own age (five years), was
                  the finder, and no tiger ever leapt upon its prey with more agility, than I flew
                  at him to obtain it; but he was too strong for me, and gave me my first lesson,
                  Reader, smile not when I tell you, that this event has been food for occasional
                  reflection during my whole life to the present period.
               The first great and acknowledged principle of, justice I, attempted to bend to my
                  purpose, was the right of discovery. My playmate was the discoverer, it therefore
                  undoubtedly belonged to him; but I had been taught that he himself belonged to me;
                  and here my parents were to blame. Fortunately for me he was my superior in
                  strength, and thus I was convinced that the adventitious aid of position towards
                  him, was, as it should be—nothing; the right and the ability to defend it were
                  clearly his; and most useful did that lesson prove; it made me a democrat; that is
                  to say, it taught me that the natural privileges of man were alike; color and
                  situation, and the false assertions of others, to the contrary, notwithstanding;
                  here began my doubts. I was told that the boy was mine, and he plainly proved
                     that he was not by the exercise of superior strength—true, it
                  might have been otherwise—had I proved the stronger, I ought by the same reasoning
                  to have supposed that I was really his owner; but the great acknowledged principle
                  of discovery, made it clear to me that he was in the right. Enough
                  said—I pondered, and doubted my instructors.
               The second incident, was an experiment to discover the reproductive power of a
                  duck's head! Attracted by the beauty of
                  its plumage, I inquired its origin, and was told to plant it and another would
                  grow. I waited patiently the required time, and finding out the deception, added a
                  second to my stock of doubts; nay, not only a second, but as many more as occasion
                  might demand. I believed nothing but the tea-bell and bed-time—a capital
                  illustration of the advantage of the truth in imparting knowledge. The tea-bell
                  and bed-time were invariably attended with a certain result, and I always believed
                  them.
               My next event was one that betrayed a weakness that had not left me at the more
                  mature age of twenty-three. I fell in love with a pretty woman; she used to play
                  with me, and give me sugar-plums, and being much in her company, I grew fond of
                  the gentle expression of her face, and became quite unhappy when she was absent;
                  it was not the absence of the sugar-plums, nor the expectation of "favors to
                  come," for it was all the same in a little while, whether she brought them or not;
                  if I could only gaze in her pretty face I was happy; but this is no marvel,
                  indeed, for all children love to look at a beautiful and happy face, and by a
                  natural consequence their own features assume a gentle expression, if surrounded
                  by such; the face is but the index to the soul, and if the thoughts are not at war
                  with nature, will always be pleasant to look upon. And here let me anticipate, by
                  a little anecdote of this same lady. At five, I was in love with her; at
                  thirty-one, I called to pay her a new-year's visit; finding her surrounded with
                  some eight or ten fine children, I naturally recurred to the past, and
                  communicated the fact—new, and I really thought it must needs be gratifying to
                  her—that she was the first person of whom I had any distinct recollection. It was
                  my intention to have communicated my childish flame, but I could not take it into
                  my heart to gratify her by relating it, when I observed the frown that visited her
                  still agreeable face, on my recurring to an event that made her older than myself;
                  there were the eight or ten palpable contradictions to her youthfulness, all
                  talking away to their "mother," yet, alas! poor woman, she was angry at my
                  presumption in supposing she could get older. In my folly, I really thought I was
                  paying her a delicate compliment, and designed to make it much more so; but alas!
                  I never was a lady's man. And this was not my first error by many a one.
               Time passed, and my recollections of my earlier years are principally identified
                  with an intense love of nature, and a constant habit of musing, and wondering what
                  I was and what I was made for; whether my mother—for I always placed her first in
                  my estimate of happiness—or my father could die; and why the Almighty was so cruel
                  as to kill people—for so I find all children think; nay, most of them speak their
                  thoughts in language equally plain.
               Alas! I had not then discovered that the philosopher knew as little of the great
                  why as the child. Amongst other subjects of wonder, I well remember my constant
                  amazement that people tried so hard to explain their destiny hereafter; when my
                  infant mind, absorbed with the present, could not conceive the purpose of my being
                  in the world at all. Of the philosophy of admiring beautiful faces and flowers,
                  and of eating sugar, I felt perfectly assured; but the endless sermon, every
                  Sunday, to prove that we should not be roasted hereafter (for my parents attended
                  the church of a very eloquent Universalist), I could by no means understand;
                  though I see now but too plainly my deficiency of wonder as the phrenologists say;
                  there is so much Indian in my nature, and that villanous doctrine of
                  utilitarianism has gripped me so fast, that I am, perhaps, a poor judge of such
                  matters. One of my everlasting annoyances about this period, was the constant
                  pouring into my ears of bugaboo stories and Santaclaus nonsense by the family
                  servants. In my very heart of hearts I believed them all lies, for my early habit
                  of doubting stood me in good stead here; yet the withering contempt! used to throw in my ascetic
                  little face, as I pronounced my anathemas upon liars, I well remember to this day;
                  and it is even now a source of unhappiness to me to know how I hated all who tried
                  to deceive me, however kind at other times. Their efforts were constant, and made
                  me indeed a good hater. And here I cannot withhold my earnest appeal to all who
                  have the care of children, never, on any account, to deceive them. A fudge for all
                  the so-called poetry of the namby-pamby toy books, the Santaclaus nonsense, the
                  Little Red Riding-hood story, and all the rest of it: why, what absurdity! is it
                  true? or is it false? Is the child to whom it is repeated a learner or not? How is
                  the infant mind to discriminate between the beauty of truth and falsehood, if its
                  earliest efforts are to be foiled by those it should revere as the soul of truth?
                  whose earnest meditative expression of countenance should be for ever associated
                  with beautiful truth, truth in all things; and who should ever set forth to the
                  youthful learner the meanness of a lie, a cowardly lie, that implies
                  that the teller is afraid of some one. Children all believe their
                  parents heroes, and associate them in every possible way with the idea of
                  protection; if they detect them in a deception, there are a thousand ways in which
                  it is associated in their minds with cowardice. Never tell your children that if
                  they will be good and stay at home, they shall have such and such things, enjoy
                  some favorite amusement, and so on. It implies ability to extort the reward for
                  obedience which belongs to parents as a right. If the reward be not paid to the
                  letter—and such is not always possible—they set it down as a falsehood, and
                  whenever a new promise is made to induce obedience, they conclude it to originate
                  in the cowardice of parents who are afraid to command the obedience the child
                  should know belongs to them.
               During my sixth year, the great object that occupied my thoughts was an almost
                  insane love of nature, but more especially flowers and foliage, and well do I
                  remember connecting this love of my earlier years, with my destiny hereafter, arid
                  deducing from it the absurdity of punishment; I reasoned thus: God is good, and
                  lives in a beautiful country called heaven; the devil is bad, and lives in a very
                  ugly country called hell. There can be no heaven without beautiful ladies and
                  flowers, and no hell without plenty of fire, which burns people; but the ladies
                  and flowers everybody likes, arid the devil nobody can like; so nobody will go to
                  the devil, and God would be very wicked to send them there; therefore, as
                  everybody will go to heaven, and no one can love flowers and foliage as well as I
                  do, I shall be head gardener there, for God will want me to take care of the
                  flowers. Often have I made a miniature garden with a little hill by way of a
                  throne for God to sit upon, and overlook the garden, whilst I and my beautiful
                  wife should work in it. This powerful youthful passion for the visible
                  representation of psychological truth, has influenced me strongly in the plan I
                  have adopted, and the advice I have always given for the education of
                  children.

               A TRUE definition of Memory cannot be given, and yet retain in that defining any
                  of the popular notions of that faculty of the mind. An idea is everywhere
                  prevalent, that most of the acts of our lives may be forgotton and covered up from
                  our mental recognition; that an act, when once forgiven or repented of, is
                  repudiated by our moral sense, and done with for ever; but a greater error does
                  not exist in mental philosophy, and it leads to the most immoral and paralyzing
                  results, so far as keeping our consciences void of offence is
                  concerned. The wretch who believes that he may forget an act of infamy, an outrage
                  on the weak and defenceless, is not careful about committing another. The crime of
                  to-day, if submitted to eternal forgetfulness, is as though it had never been; but
                  the stain is impressed upon the soul, it cannot be effaced, but will return at
                  some future period when the equilibrium of selfishness is disturbed by the memory
                  of injustice or crime.
               In that mysterious world of mental lights and shadows, some strange events occur,
                  which startle the thinker when he looks into the future. Many instances have
                  occurred to most physicians who have seen much practice, in which the affected
                  individual was lost to himself, and, up to a certain point, life and all its acts
                  were cut off and forgotten; but as we trace out the thread of the future, we find
                  in the end, that when remarkable physical changes occur in such systems, the lost
                  impressions of memory revive and pass with palpable distinctness before the mind's
                  eye, not as shadows, but as occurrences real and lasting. Persons whose brains are
                  deeply disturbed by fevers, often lose their life's doings, up to a certain point,
                  till the change goes further, when they regain suddenly all that was lost. The
                  near approach of death often discloses the same fact; as described in the
                  sensations of drowning, persons, who declare that the entire occurrences of their
                  lives are flashed, out before them as in a mirror or on a burning canvas, where
                  each figure teemed with a living fullness.
               Long study of Memory has led to the conclusion in my own mind, that nothing
                  pertaining to our mortal life is ever forgotten; no thought, sensation, joy,
                  grief, or act of evil, can ever be effaced from memory; but all the acts and
                  sensations of life become part of our being, and have much to do with our future
                  state of progress in a spiritual existence. Memory is to me the
                  Daguerreotype-plate of the soul, whose images are set in eternal colors; each
                  thought, each shading, as in life; the time we sat for the impression, its
                  lineaments in joyous or horrid fullness, will stand out in true I relief, as the
                  subtle chemicals of a future life will light up the sleeping shadows, and what to
                  us was lost, will again gleam out as a living and real thing. Assert this to one
                  of those Pharisees that disturb society with their flaunting equipages in livery,
                  driven to the doors of the very house of God, and watch the working of the muscles
                  of his face; the averted eye, the wild expression of a troubled soul, which was
                  flattered by a time-serving conscience, or the false shepherd himself, into the
                  belief that what he wished, could be forgotten. De Quincey's Confessions of an
                     Opium Eater are full of testimony on
                  this point. He describes memory, or brain impressions, as resembling a parchment
                  from which the writing had been discharged by chemical action; when by the touch
                  of some unseen element, the minutest lines, that had been effaced for years, are
                  brought again into full light, and read with as much ease as the last impression
                  made upon the parchment. It is known to every observing physician, that patients
                  under the impression of certain medicines, whose action is direct and powerful on
                  the nervous system, seem to be reenacting the scenes of former life; all past
                  occurrences seem to be revived and reflected before the mind of the sufferer, as
                  though real and present.
               De Quincey affirms that in his deepest state of stupefaction by opium, the
                  minutest acts of his life were reproduced, not as memories, but as real things;
                  and, like him, I have come to the conclusion that there is no such thing
                     forgetting. In the future, every man must face his earth-life; the
                  lawyer carries with him his legal tricks, and will hear again the sad wail of the
                  widow and the orphan he has robbed; the doctor, whose quackeries have filled his
                  purse and the graveyard, will meet his victims again; the priest, whose bloody
                  hands had tied his victim to the stake and the faggot, as the dim shadow on the
                  dial-plate of his soul is revived by the mysterious power, will see reflected the
                  purple and flame-colored hue of his murderous deed, and the victims of his hate
                  will rise before him to act the grand inquisitor to his hell-tortured soul.
               In making these remarks, I am passing over the field of forgotten memories, and a
                  thousand scenes are renewed that appeared lost in the void of the past. And as I
                  shall have occasion to illustrate this law of Memory in the trials of life which
                  follow, you will not, I presume, deem them misplaced. After parting with my
                  friends at the meeting, a few days' travel found me on foot wending my way into a
                  back-country place, to a medical college; the professors had chosen that spot
                  because board was cheap—and it removed the student from the temptations of city
                  life, which often prove too much for the moral natures of the young men who seek
                  their life's zenith through our noble but degraded art. The college had for years
                  convened its hundreds of students, and several large hotels rose in the wilderness
                  place for their accommodation. Several professors, with their families, resided
                  here; and much ado existed among the various churches of the village, as to who
                  should be honored by the presence of the largest class of medical students. A
                  large stone building had been erected by the side of the college, for the
                  accommodation of those students who wish to practice close economy in their
                  expenses.
               My room-mate was a young man who came from the valley of the Wyoming, and seemed
                  the very ideal of puritanic integrity. His library was large and well-assorted;
                  and he lived among his books. His face was pale, and his health feeble; his head
                  large and square in front, and his expressionless features were relieved of their
                  melancholy cast by a large and brilliant black eye. His threadbare garb bespoke
                  his poverty. After the custom of those days, he gave his note for his
                  lecture-fees, and in six months after his return home the Dean received notice of
                  his intention to avail himself of the bankrupt-law, and his note for medical
                  lectures was needed for adjudication with the rest. The disciple of Gall had been
                  in mercantile business and failed in his hopes of wealth and ease, and turned his
                  attention to medicine. The career of the young man was instructive. I will give
                  you a page or two in his history. He acted evidently under a well-digested
                  principle. Two years after he left our college, he obtained a license to practise
                  in a distant State, and his career is now brought graphically before me by the
                  magic glass of memory, as my eye wanders over the actual scene where he enacted
                  the occurrences I relate. One of his first steps was to marry in a religious family, in the
                  vicinity of the college; for, with a degree of effrontery common with such people,
                  he had returned to carry out his plans, in the very neighborhood where he gave the
                  first proof of his character. His wife and relatives were all saints, and he took
                  rank among the leaders in Israel.
               A lovely and estimable young mother fell sick, and our hero was called to attend
                  her, which he did by combining the double balm of medicine and prayer; but the
                  hairs of her head were numbered and her hours assigned her; all his skill and
                  sympathy failed of their effect, and she sank with, her child into an early grave.
                  His attentions were unremitting, he visited and prayed with the family often; not
                  a breath of censure visited him.
               During one of these nocturnal visits for prayer and praise, a man employed for the
                  purpose exhumed the body, boxed it up, and the devout and scientific Æsculapian
                  loaned his wagon for the purpose, and it was deposited in a warehouse on the lake
                  shore, directed to a neighboring city in the care of a friend, who had helped to
                  advance both his skill in the art and his zeal for the Lord. The wind and the
                  waves were against him; the body was detected and re-interred, and our disciple
                  arrested and thrown into prison within a few rods of the place where I write. The
                  wrath of the enraged people burst on him like a whirlwind, and the pulpit now
                  thundered at his gins only because it was impossible to shield him; they could now
                  gain more éclat by condemning him, than by
                  affording him their protection. The terrors of the insulted law fell on his head,
                  and he atoned for his theft and his prayers by a long and tedious imprisonment. I
                  am far from advocating the cause of so cold-blooded a villain, but I feel
                  impelled, on a subject of momentous import, to give my testimony against
                  legislative folly. Civilization seems not to have removed the prejudice of the
                  popular mind against the dissection of the Human body; the authority of the King
                  of Egypt over his barbarous subjects could not eradicate their aversion to the
                  dissection of the body, and the power of his throne was shaken by his resistance,
                  till he was obliged to abolish the custom granted to the college of physicians in
                  Alexandria. The aversion, undoubtedly, originated from religious belief, and
                  partly from a superstitious fancy among the Egyptians, that the soul returned to
                  take possession of its body after a lapse of time; an idea that differs only in
                  form, from the notion of the resurrection of the body entertained at the present
                  day. We also attach to the dead body, the love that we felt during life to the
                  living spirit that animated that body. The law controlling dissections is wholly
                  inconsistent, for, while it strips the surgeon of his life-long earnings for the
                  most trivial blunder—or defect which skill could not remedy—it rigidly restrains
                  his body and empties his purse for the act of exhumation, and makes no adequate
                  provision to prevent it. But let us return to our pious student.
               Stung to the quick with chagrin at her delusion, long ere the period of his
                  imprisonment expired, his proud wife fell into the grave, a victim to the insane
                  folly of parents, who were deluded by his canting hypocrisy, and sacrificed the
                  true love their child bore to an industrious and excellent young man, a farmer,
                  for the wretched privilege of calling their child the wife of a "pious" physician.
                  The hypocrite served out the term of his imprisonment, and left the place to
                  practise his villany where he was unknown.
               In the same town, lived a young lady whose fate may prove a warning to those who
                  feel themselves cursed with an impulsive disposition; I say cursed, for the most
                  noble and beautiful impulses may become a curse, if not balanced by judgment.
                  Miss—was no ordinary character; and into the brief passage of her life, had been
                  mingled lights and shadows of uncommon and fascinating interest to the student of
                  woman's character. She was left an orphan in her childhood, and the heart of charity had taken
                  her to a friendly shelter, and watered the tender plant with all the kindness and
                  assiduity that the love of one who had never been a mother could bestow. She soon
                  grew interested in her young treasure, as her quick and sparkling intellect threw
                  off its brilliant light to cheer her desolate dwelling. The lady who had taken her
                  as her own, had no living thing to love or cherish, and though surrounded by
                  wealth and a pleasant home, its shades were the shades of the cypress, and its
                  lights were the dim shadows of twilight, reflected from fashionable friends, and
                  more or less distant relatives. The voice of young M—— sounded like heavenly music
                  in the ears of her protector, and she lavished on her all the blessings that
                  wealth, refinement, and good society could bestow. Her rare talent for music was
                  early discovered, and she played and sang with the most brilliant execution and
                  pathos, that often drew tears from the most thoughtless.
               I had often met her in the streets, and admired her commanding person and queenly
                  bearing. I observed that she always dressed in black, and when I inquired the
                  reason of this, I was told that about a year since, the malignant scarlatina
                  appeared in the village, and some twelve or fifteen children had died with it;
                  among the rest, Miss —— had lost a darling little member of her Sunday class, a
                  boy three or four years old, who also was an orphan. The students often spoke of
                  this lad as one of uncommon promise and beauty; and having no father to love him
                  and caress him, he became a great favorite with them: he had learned to visit the
                  college, where his full and glowing charms, radiant even now in his early
                  childhood, had won him the love of the entire class. This little fellow seemed to
                  wonder why he had no father, and was seeking among those faces something he could
                  not find—that holy thing, parental love.
               Our young lady had become the soul of the entire social circle of the place; her
                  grace, her beauty, her wit, her music, her power of fascination, had all combined
                  to render her an object of admiration, and the belle of the place; and called into
                  the large circle of her worshippers a number of young men. Among these was a young
                  man of fine address and agreeable manners; he was an object of general favor among
                  the ladies. Young! M—— received her full share of his attentions, and in a short
                  time all supposed he was her chosen lover. After a few months' devoted attention
                  to her, he was taken suddenly ill, and left for home; his residence being in a
                  neighboring State. Soon it was observed, that the health of the young lady began
                  to fail, and the opinion became prevalent that she was going into a slow decline.
                  Gossips were busy as usual, and the conclusion was very general that there had
                  been a lovers' quarrel, and she was suffering the consequences of unreturned
                  attachment.
               After a few weeks, she was entirely confined to her room; and, as she refused to
                  see her most intimate young friends, it was supposed that she was allowing her
                  grief and mortification to drive her into a decline. Several months elapsed,! and
                  as she did not make her appearance, her friends gradually ceased inquiring for
                  her; and I, amongst the rest, had allowed the cares of business almost to efface
                  her from my memory, when I was one evening confidentially requested by the family
                  physician to visit her in consultation.
               On our arrival at the house, he informed me that knowing my friendship for the
                  family, he had taken the liberty of a slight and pardonable deception, with the
                  view of, shielding the unfortunate young girl's character, and that it was her
                  child for which I was expected to consult.
               She had become a mother nearly a month before. I was inexpressibly shocked, and
                  grieved for the dear girl, but commanded my feelings as well as I could, and soon
                  beheld the pledge of her unfortunate attachment, a lovely boy; but the moment my
                  eye alighted on him, I was that the feeble thread of life was nearly severed.
               
               He lay at the point of death with croup; we did all that we could—perhaps too
                  much. God knows I did my best; but soon we followed her little darling to the
                  grave. Death's chill wind blasted her flower; the fruit of her suffering was early
                  gathered. She went with us and the sexton of the village church, alone to the
                  grave; parent, sister, brother, lover, none were there. We placed it where she
                  desired us, under a rose-tree, near her chamber window, where she could always see
                  the grave, and put a grassy mound over it, and left it to its last sleep. I
                  continued my visits from sympathy for her sorrow, and a strong desire to obtain
                  further knowledge of her extraordinary character.
               Since her affliction, no other face except her kind foster-mother's and her two
                  physicians, had beamed upon her with a smile; her heart had almost withered for
                  want of the dews of affection. The public had applied to her the cup of
                  consolation usual in such cases—first, its curses and forsakings, and then their
                  sympathy! But she heeded neither; she told me, that the voice of her babe still
                  came to her in sleep, and shed around her couch a holy comfort; his little grave
                  was covered with roses, which she literally watered with tears; she had learned to
                  speak with a calmness, that the sting of a world's scorn could not deprive her of.
                  My visits she often told me seemed at first a puzzle; indeed, she asked me again
                  and again, how I dared to be the friend of one whom the world had branded. As time
                  went on, her confidence in me increased, and once upon an occasion I had long
                  sought for, and tried to bring about, she tore the veil aside, and showed me the
                  deep fountain in a woman's soul: she is long since gone from earth, and my heart
                  tells me I may communicate her story.
               The first effort of the young gentleman, when he found himself likely to be called
                  on to fulfill his promise, was to induce her to swallow some deadly drug, that
                  would make sure work of the child, or of both; failing in this, his health
                  declined, and he disappeared from the place.
               The white mantle of chill winter had fallen before the warm spring sun, and joy
                  seemed to return to the heart of all things but the heart of the trusting betrayed
                  one. Cut off from all sympathy, she resolved on one long season of communion with
                  her own heart; she retired to her, chamber, and there feasted over her silent joy;
                  in spite of the scorn of the world, and loss of caste and friends, she felt a deep
                  pervading silent sea of joy welling up in her heart; a new music was sounding in
                  her spirit, new voices spoke to her ears, and a thrill of celestial happiness
                  pervaded her soul, when she felt by signs that could not by herself be mistaken,
                  that she was to be a mother; that her own spirit was mingled with another spirit
                  in eternal union, and bound to an everlasting life. She said: "I knew all I was to
                  suffer, the loss of all things earthly was to be counted on; but none of it awed
                  me—that living ecstasy still governed my spirit, and it was sweeter than the voice
                  of friends, or of her I had learned to love as a mother, or the celestial
                  symphonies of angels, could have been. It seemed so to me then, arid it seems so
                  still. When the rains descended, and the flowers came forth to laugh and smile in
                  the sunshine, and die with happiness in the dewy evening, my heart overflowed with
                  a new sympathy with nature, and I loved everything that looked beautiful—that had
                  life or seemed happy.
               "A pair of gentle and confiding robins came and built their nest in a large rose
                  bush near my window, and now, for the first time in my life, I felt an interest in
                  the bird; all day she and her mate gathered wool, and sticks, and moss to decorate
                  their nest, to adorn and make comfortable the little home, where "their young
                  birds were to see light, and lisp out on the living air their first accents of
                  joy. All the day long I watched the faithful pair at their work; they never seemed weary nor sorrowful, but
                  labored till the mellow twilight came, and then he would watch and sing to her,
                  and she would answer him with a little joyous note of fond affection. One day, I
                  heard a new song under my window; its notes seemed celestial, and I don't know
                  why, but it seemed to have in it a tone that went to my inner spirits and spoke a
                  language there that I could not wholly unravel. Now I know what the
                  notes were; I hear them still—they are sweeter now, but oh, how saddened! I repeat
                  them often; I learned their meaning from the voice of my child; the holy memory
                  comes to my heart from that grassy mound where they laid him. It was the song of
                  coming maternity—that new sensation of the spirit that a mother only feels, that a
                  mother only can understand. Oh, I know now what it was that made her sing; she
                  could not help it—she was happy; the poor bird knew that her young ones, would fly
                  in the field with her, and carol in the green forest in chorus to the song that
                  they would learn from the outburst of a mother's love."
               She was silent; the memory of her joy and the full cup of her happiness—now for
                  ever dashed from her lips—made her silent, and we walked on in darkness for some
                  minutes, by the lake side. Science cannot read the mystery of a woman's heart;
                  nothing but the light that flashes from the furnace of her perfect love can tell
                  its secrets. When she had regained her calmness, she continued: "Through the long
                  spring days I watched these happy birds; their joy seemed full; watching seemed
                  not to weary them, but their instinctive faith had guided them to their highest
                  hopes, their new-born desires. By day and by night, through sunshine and storm,
                  these frail birds had watched over their treasure till their young appeared, and
                  then wandered over the fields and through the forests to find them food; and when
                  I volunteered to aid them in the task of feeding their young birds, I felt for the
                  first time the joy of feeding the helpless and the young. This was a new light in
                  my spirit, a new love that I had never known.
               "I had no sympathy with the world; I needed none; from the moment I discovered
                  myself deserted by him I would gladly have died for, I lived in the joy of my own
                  hopes; I was instructed by the toils of these winged spirits, these teaching
                  messengers of parental love; they never seemed to forsake each other, nor
                  repudiate the fruits of their love; it is, it seems, the privilege of a man and a
                  Christian, a gentleman and a scholar, to do that; a man must be bred in polite
                  society, and be the heir of wealth, to impress such a blot on the fair face of a
                  generous and confiding love, without making a stain on a manly escutcheon.
               "One night, a rude storm came over my rose tree, and scattered the young birds in
                  the grass, and a remorseless cat destroyed them. All the next day the poor things
                  mourned and chirped out their sad notes of grief over the little vacant nest. They
                  stopped not to eat or to rest, but mourned all the day, and made even the night
                  sad with their laments. This was the first real sorrow I had ever known the world
                  had brought many clouds over my sun; but none seemed so dark as this; none so full
                  of grief. Day after day the poor birds came to mourn for their little ones, till
                  weary of lamenting, they forsook the spot.
               "When the cruel disease slew my darling boy, you remember we laid him close under
                  the window by the tree where they had reared their young. I know not why, unless
                  the birds of the air have sympathy with human sorrow, that man cannot feel, yet
                  the robbins came again at the coming October, and seemed again, to my doomed
                  spirit, to sing the dirge for my darling boy. His sweet little hands were laid
                  upon his breast, and I spread the white muslin over his face; I kissed his cold
                  lips the last time, and I was alone. The sorrow of the poor birds was now plain to
                  me; my heart could read their song;
                  their notes were now home music; the strings of my own heart were jarred by the
                  same anguish. Angels cannot know the joy of being a mother, and much less can they
                  comprehend the sad notes that are mingled in a mother's grief."
               She ceased, and I took my leave. She is gone now from earth, and some future day I
                  will tell you her further history. If "the motive force of the human heart
                  originates in maternal love," then man and all life, originates in the love of the
                  maternal heart; and man being the creation of woman's love, he is ever the object
                  of her divinest care and solicitude; she cheerfully braves death to give him his
                  being; she foregoes society to rear and nurture his tender life, and all the
                  return her generous nature asks, is, that man should love her, and honor that love
                  with an enduring faith, a deep sincerity.
               The mother's heart is a mine of sparkling diamonds, a casket of gems glittering
                  with the topaz, the jasper and the onyx; and I repeat, I would guard the rights of
                  her holiest affections, her maternity, from the hands of the robber, as God
                  guarded the tree of life in Paradise with a flaming sword. Fill her life with all
                  holiest blessings, enlarge her heart by a generous teaching, and expand her
                  affections into a larger life by a generous sympathy, and the maternal heart gives
                  back to her child by the laws of maternity, all the blessings it has received,
                  with as generous a return as she receives the blessings of her own being from the
                  hand of the invisible Creator. It is true, that woman always displays in her
                  nature a deeper and truer devotion than man; that feature in the religious system
                  of some nations which requires or permits the female to burn herself on the
                  funeral pile of her dead husband, shows it forth in an indisputable manner. To
                  suppose this the work of a blind idolatry is sheer nonsense; it has a deeper and a
                  purer foundation. Man never burns himself on the funeral pile of a wife-such an
                  act would amaze the world; but woman alone has the abiding faith, the deep
                  devotion to lay such a gift on the altar of her affections. It is plainly the
                  result of that overpowering love-element that pervades her being, and actuates her
                  most deeply in the material life. She represents most fully that love-element that
                  pervades and animates the universe; were it not so, we should not see so many
                  instances of devotion to the object of her affections, that braves death and
                  defies all peril.
               When the deep sea of her love is roused, there is no offering within her reach
                  that she will not lay on the altar with an air of triumph. The Christian
                  philosophy has this idea embodied in its system in a very impressive manner. The
                  Being that redeemed the race from sin and death, was wholly female; the male
                  element was excluded from the origin of his being; he was the seed of the
                     woman, quickened by the Holy Spirit; and most devoutly do I believe,
                  that if a man is to have such a redemption, the being to be offered for such a
                  sacrifice must have such an origin; and yet that idea is but the counterpart of
                  the sacrifice on the funeral pile; woman will go to any point to secure the
                  happiness of the man, and she fearlessly mounts the fiery car, and her spirit
                  rides on fire and flames into the presence of the invisible Jehovah. God is love.
                  The strength and power of this element in her nature must be brought into full and
                  perfect play in perpetuating and educating of the race.
               The stern and selfish nature of man cannot understand at present the strength of
                  the law of maternity, and its freedom and beauty is restrained and crippled, and
                  the race is dwarfed and shrivelled by the breath of selfishness. Fifteen years'
                  experience among mothers has left one truth most deeply engraven on my heart: that
                  among them an element of love and devotion is seen at work, that nowhere else
                  presents itself in human character or conduct.

                  THE physician who can retrace an experience of twenty-five years during an
                     ordinary practice in a large city and its suburbs, must enjoy a singularly
                     placid temperament if he avoid- an occasional emotion of joy or sadness, that
                     he desires to share with some one who can smile or sigh with him over the many
                     ludicrous and sad scenes he has been called to witness during his ministrations
                     to the whimsical and the afflicted. It is certain, however, that some of our
                     number will draw near to the close of a long life, and show but little emotion
                     as they leaf over the checkered volume of their experience. We have often
                     endeavored to arouse the sympathies of men, who, it would seem from their
                     social position, could scarce have failed to experience 
                        
                           "The gentle power whose bosom heaves the sigh
                           When memory paints the scene of deep distress."
                        
                     
                  
                  But the tear spontaneous would not crystallize the eye, nor could we always
                     believe, that mere self-control suppressed an emotion that seemed due to the
                     subject, had it presented itself to a sympathetic heart. The surgical and
                     operating corps of our profession, have so long been accustomed to hear the
                     quiet self-congratulations of the public, that "it is providentially provided,"
                     in especial reference to the sufferer's safety, that we shall lose our finer
                     feelings, together with that useless commodity, a surgeon's humanity, that I
                     trust I shall be pardoned for endeavoring to repudiate the compliment, at the
                     expense of some professional credit for nerve, and perhaps a little comfort to
                     the reader, who may not thank me for disturbing his nerves when sipping his
                     brandy and water, with unpleasant images of cloven skulls and broken limbs. It
                     is somewhat singular, but 'tis true, that while the same delightful beverage
                     can warm the heart and expand the affections with such refined sentiments, the
                     temperate surgeon is often destined to hear himself complimented for his want
                     of sympathy by the very person who may require his services for a broken head
                     incurred by a "little imprudence" in the use of the inspiring nectar; a wife or
                     mother's broken heart is unworthy of the generous creature's notice; but it
                     illustrates a frequent phenomenon that we often witness, and tends to the
                     cultivation of a proper self-abasement for our want of refinement and
                     benevolence.
                  How far we shall be tolerated by our fairer readers for the introduction of
                     some scenes that may shock their sensitive nerves, will depend very much upon
                     their vanity and selfishness. Every day's observation teaches us that the
                     distinctions are very slight in the degree of intellect and self-respect
                     between those who are accustomed to give way to their appetites, whether for
                     extravagant display in dress and furniture, or gambling, drunkenness, and other
                     vices. Neither the fine lady, who would scorn to be seen under the influence of
                     wine, yet loads her body and her house with extravagant clothes and furniture,
                     at the expense of her husband's happiness and her children's food and
                     education; nor she who comes forth from the midnight ball-room with cheeks
                     glowing and breath redolent with champagne, are withheld from the same vice
                     that impels the wretched victim of
                     intemperance to disgrace her sex in the public streets—by any other motive than
                     a fear of losing caste. The nerves are sensitive and willing creatures to be
                     educated, and a vacant brain when stimulated with wine and intoxicating its
                     delighted owner with the unwonted visitation of an exciting idea, however
                     extravagant or sensual, is but a dangerous and seductive guide to domestic
                     happiness. We doubt very much if either sex recollect the actual commencement
                     of those practices that have robbed their cheeks of health, their bodies of
                     dignity, and their souls of self-respect. We are not writing the æsthetics of
                     drunkenness, and shall therefore not trouble ourselves to select the most
                     pleasing examples of the fascinating vice, but allow memory to recall them just
                     as they presented themselves, however hideous and revolting. No one takes
                     medicine willingly, and the most nauseous is often most beneficial.
                  It could not have been long after the first scene described in a former
                     chapter, when we were indebted to our decoy-duck for a surgical call we shall
                     certainly never forget, should we reach the age of Methusalah. I was as usual
                     taking my own dram of green tea at the time the messenger arrived, and could
                     not avoid the honest reflection when my eyes met the sad spectacle that greeted
                     me on arriving at the garret (that or the cellar kitchen being the usual scene
                     of the young surgeon's first attempts)—I say I could not honestly avoid the
                     reflection, how prone we all are to some kind of intemperance. I was sent for
                     to see a young man who had been wounded in a drunken frolic, but I had hastily
                     secured two strong cups of most exciting and exhilarating green tea—a beverage
                     of whose evil effects I am now thoroughly convinced.
                  A very handsome young man, of some twenty-five years lay extended upon a
                     rickety bedstead, partially covered with a few miserable rags; his magnificent
                     masses of black hair *
                      were clotted with blood, which was yet welling up from a great wound in
                     the temple, and flowing over the throat until it dripped upon the floor. A very
                     slight examination with the finger detected the sharp and jagged edges of an
                     immense fracture. The laceration of the great artery, answering on the inner
                     side to the temporal artery without, and very extensive depression of the
                     bones, made quite clear the source of the bleeding and the perfect stupor in
                     which the patient lay; his magnificent chest rose and fell with measured and
                     regular breathing, scarcely if at all interrupted by the fracture and
                     compression of the brain. We have already explained to the reader, that the
                     nerves which control the act of breathing, originate from the very lowest part
                     of the brain, and have no immediate dependence on the anterior lobes where this
                     fracture existed.
                  
                     
                     *An anatomical preparation displayed in my office.
                  
                  We now Committed a very grievous and capital error in the politic management of
                     this case, which stuck to our skirts for years; indeed to this day we are
                     charged with the death of this poor young man, and that from downright
                     brutality and ignorance, though heaven knows we committed no error. We desire,
                     however, to caution the young surgeon to avoid the like offence if he would
                     preserve his bread and butter; not that he will ever get any from such
                     patients, but none are so debased that their influence may not be felt on some
                     occasions where fees are to be had. Provided with no instruments for a
                     formidable operation, and entirely unacquainted with the nature of the accident
                     (for the messenger assured us the patient was "hurt"—how he could not tell), we
                     immediately saw the serious consequences of the depression, and as the bone was
                     thoroughly comminuted, as surgeons say, or broken in many fragments, it was
                     apparent that the trephine (an instrument with which we saw out a circular
                     piece of the skull in order to let out blood and elevate the edges of a
                     depressed bone) was quite
                     unnecessary, whilst the bleeding and depression warned us of the danger of
                     delay. The ordinary instrument used for raising the edges of a fracture is in
                     reality little more than a blunt skewer, which in proper hands will really
                     answer every purpose; so without more ado (I was always in love with Crusoe's
                     ingenuity), armed with that domestic and primitive weapon and a common lancet,
                     after cutting as closely as I could the beautiful hair locks, I made the
                     necessary incisions, and took away a great number of fragments, and elevated
                     all those that were depressed, discovering and cauterizing the bleeding artery
                     with the end of a piece of red-hot wire which some one had brought at my
                     request, and the perfect fitness of which every good surgeon will recognize, as
                     the artery is partially concealed in the groove of a bone. I was congratulating
                     myself on the very perfect manner in which I had effected my duties, and
                     awaiting as anxiously as the surgeon only can, unless some "nearer one" be
                     present, when a suppressed curse met my ear, and on looking up to see who my
                     enemy was, the assurance was audibly given, "'Twas quite time there was another
                     doctor called- one who had proper tools, and knew how to use 'em."
                     Notwithstanding my pity for the poor man's ignorance, I anticipated
                     inconvenience from his impudence, and always finding amiability lost upon such
                     people, I very quietly led him by the collar into a wretched back room,
                     designing to request him to remain there, and to lock him out whilst I awaited
                     the result of my operation, or, if needful, the bleeding, which I hoped would
                     restore my patient to consciousness. Imagine the chill which almost curdled my
                     blood, when I saw the body of a beautiful woman clasping a dead infant in her
                     arms, and a wretched creature of the other sex, seemingly about twice her age,
                     propped up with rags, and watched by two beings as miserable from disease and
                     the effects of drunkenness as himself. Something in the beautiful tiful arch of
                     the eyebrow riveted my gaze, and with my hand still upon my friend's collar, we
                     both stood transfixed with surprise.
                  Standing at the side of the bed and viewing, the yet beautiful face from below,
                     the heart-sickening truth flashed upon me;—I stood by the corpse of a once
                     lovely being, a former patient, the sister of the youth I had just operated on,
                     and the wife of the wretched creature whose eager gaze had already detected in
                     me a playfellow and schoolmate. He and his brother were orphans, and had come
                     to this city from a near State to try their fortunes. We had not met for years,
                     he always avoiding me when visiting his unfortunate wife (she too was an
                     orphan) because he was invariably intoxicated and knew my aversion to his
                     habits. He was a bookkeeper. One short year had brought him from a pretty
                     house, beautifully kept by his angel-wife, a pattern of neatness, and sustained
                     unitedly by himself and her brother, to this miserable garret. Like many
                     others, they were too happy. The demon seized upon them, having stealthily
                     begun to entrap them at the dinner-table and the palaces in Broadway. Both now
                     opened upon me at once; my schoolmate calling me by the only abbreviation my
                     name admits of, and one not particularly calculated to convey the necessary
                     impression—God help us—of a surgeon's dignity (rather a necessary article when
                     operating in a garret and in the presence of drunken people)—
                  "And is that you, ye cursed murdering devil?"
                  "Ah, ye unfeeling wretch!"
                  "Why he stuck a skewer and a bit of hot wire into his head!"
                  "I always meant to have your life for your pride and insolence, you infernal
                     executioner. You've killed poor Jake, and if ever I'm able, I'll have yer life,
                     ye murderin' beast. Yer like all the rest of yer cursed crew."
                  Thus they went on long after I had closed the door and returned to my patient. An unusually long attack
                     of intemperance had completely prostrated the poor creature, and sent his
                     brother-in-law entirely to his only resource—the amusement of his drunken
                     companions—for he was yet rather young-to witness the tearless anguish of his
                     starving and beautiful sister, without discomfort; he was therefore rapidly
                     becoming as great a drunkard as his miserable brother-in-law. Both had been
                     discharged from their situations several months before. It was during a general
                     frolic in the open fields that an unlucky stone, thrown by one of his
                     companions, had inflicted the horrid wound for which I had been called. After
                     drawing some blood, with the view of diminishing the pressure on the brain,
                     that might be still continued by the distension of the blood-vessels, the pulse
                     having risen considerably after the operation, I directed some kind neighbors
                     to keep up cold applications to the head and warm cloths and bottles of warm
                     water to the limbs, with a view of equalizing the circulation and diverting the
                     current of blood from the brain, which might also be suffering either from
                     extensive laceration or depression from blood-vessels in other parts, I felt
                     that I had done all that could be done for my patient, and leaving the house, I
                     called upon a medical friend who had attended the poor dead wife, and whose
                     kindness had ever availed me—alas! he has now gone to his reward—to share the
                     responsibility and take charge of our two patients alternately with me during
                     the night. Leaving my home at twelve o'clock, I came prepared to spend the
                     balance of the night, but it proved to be needless. My wretched schoolmate had
                     received a large dose of laudanum from my poor, delicate friend; himself dying
                     by inches with consumption, he had retired to a neighbor's on the next floor,
                     and was asleep in his chair when I entered. Without disturbing him, I quietly
                     ascended the stairs and beheld the denouement of the scene. I shall never
                     forget it while life lasts. The only watcher was in a state of beastly
                     intoxication tion on the floor, and my young patient quite dead; my wretched
                     schoolmate, in a high state of frenzy from delirium tremens, the influence of
                     the laudanum having passed off, was dancing alternately from one room to
                     another, calling upon, his dead wife to get up" and give him drink, and
                     threatening his brother-in-law for concealing the jug in which they were
                     accustomed to keep their home supply of the maddening beverage. As I stood in
                     the room where the body of my patient lay, watching him, his attention was
                     suddenly arrested by the dead infant. Gazing fixedly at it for a moment, he
                     seemed much amazed, and muttered, "And what's this? I never saw this before (it
                     was indeed their first-born, and she had died in giving birth to it during his
                     drunkenness of an entire week), where did she get this? Poor thing? she was a
                     good girl, but so peevish, so fretful—so very fretful; I'm sure I couldn't get
                     her everything she wanted." Then, evidently forgetting her death, which he had
                     for a moment seemed to realize, he danced into the other room, where the corpse
                     of my patient lay, and called out "'Liza, Eliza, get up and get our breakfast;
                     'tis time to go to the store. (They had both been clerks.) Why don't ye get up,
                     ye lazy thing, and get breakfast?" and then dancing back, and placing! his hand
                     over the face of his dead wife, he soon withdrew it, and looking at it, as it
                     were amazed, he pressed his lips for a moment to hers, and instantly
                     withdrawing them with a face expressive of the utmost terror, gazed fixedly
                     upward, and with an awful and unearthly cry that pierced my very soul, he cried
                     out? placing his hand on his breast, "Oh! oh! oh!
                     hell-fire—fire—water—water—water—she's dead, and I've killed her and him both!
                     Hell—hell-fire—all is ready for me! I see the devils with their red-hot forks,
                     legions of 'em. There—there they are," pointing upward with dilated pupils and
                     distended nostrils and lips ashy pale, "devils—devils—come to take us all to
                     hell!" and again placing his hand on his chest, he cried for water, and swore the fire
                     was burning out his soul. My heart was sick at the awful scene, and availing
                     myself of the neighbors' aid, who now came in numbers, we tied his hands and
                     feet with handkerchiefs, and administered a formidable dose of brandy and
                     laudanum as the readiest means of quieting him. In a couple of hours he slept,
                     and leaving him under the care of a trusty man, I retired to my couch in my
                     office, my usual resting-place when anticipating disturbance and desiring to
                     spare my family a share of my troubles. My dreams were none of the pleasantest
                     the reader may be sure, and I made an early visit to my poor patient, having
                     sent home my poor dying friend the doctor, hoping—and God knows with what
                     heartfelt conviction of its humanity—that our wretched patient might share a
                     grave with his poor wife and her child and brother, for I knew him too well to
                     hope for amendment. My wish was gratified; he expired but a few minutes before
                     my entrance, at the moment of awaking, and calling his poor dead wife to get
                     breakfast. His death was represented to have been so instantaneous, and his
                     complaint of that pain that caused him to make the horrid exclamation that his
                     soul was burning, dwelt so forcibly on my mind, that I felt unwilling to give a
                     certificate without an examination of the body. A postmortem revealed an
                     immense ruptured sac of the arch of the great mother of all the blood-vessels,
                     the aorta. He had died instantly of aneurism, the frequent unsuspected result
                     of intemperance, goading the heart to violent over-action and too great
                     distension of the blood-vessels. The poor wife had died of convulsions,
                     consequent on a premature confinement, the result of over-exertion, brought on
                     by attending her wretched husband. Potter's field opened its benevolent bosom
                     for the entire family of the drunkard- the great trench received them all!
                  Oh I look not on the wine-cup; its crystal lip will lure you to its uncertain
                     depth. If it sparkle in the ruddy light, there is death in its illusive ray.
                     Bright eyes and ruby lips may be reflected from it; the song and the dance, the
                     whispered vow and the kiss of love may follow; but the curse of desperation,
                     and the bloated or the haggard face will come; and the bloodless lips and the
                     mild eyes of the one you swore to cherish and protect will look at you in the
                     silent night, and even if they cast on you a forgiving ray, and you escape the
                     comparatively merciful fate of my wretched schoolmate, you can only put out the
                     fire of conscience, that will burn in your very soul, by the same draught that
                     brought all this misery upon you.

                           O human voice! thou magic mirror of the Memory!
                           Thou witch of Avon and of Calvary!
                        
                     
                  
                  "WILL you come and see my mother, Doctor?" said a young girl, dressed in an
                     humble garb, as I opened my door to the timid summons of the bell, very late on
                     a cold January night; the tones were plaintive and tremulous, and led me to
                     infer that the mother was very ill.
                  "Where does your mother live, my child?" I asked, for I had already learned the
                     sad lesson in humanity that the names of the poor are of no consequence. "Where
                     does she live, and how long has she been ill?" I had spent a hard day, and it
                     was near twelve o'clock at night. I would willingly have taken a nap on my
                     office couch.
                  The young girl looked up into my face as the hall lamp illumined faintly a pale and haggard
                     countenance; and as she timidly raised her eyes to mine from beneath a common
                     straw bonnet, her voice became still more tremulous, and I saw tears fall upon
                     her faded shawl. "She lives close by, sir, in Mulberry street, near where you
                     have been attending the poor woman who was burned; she saw you go in there, and
                     Dr. —— told her he could not cure her; so she thought she would like to see
                     you, sir. She has been very ill for nearly a year, and I am afraid she will
                     never get well."
                  The poor child addressed me with a degree of accuracy and tenderness I was
                     entirely unused to in my wretched practice; it spoke of gentle nurture, and the
                     heart prompted my reply. "I will go with you, my dear child, immediately: pray
                     sit near the fire and warm yourself whilst I go into the kitchen for my boots."
                     It was a night of sleet, and my servant had gone to his warm bed, whilst I was
                     exhausted with care and toil, and this poor child was abroad and oppressed with
                     grief and poverty. And yet we were only fulfilling the mandate of Christ to
                     bear one another's burdens. Her poor little heart was swelling with sorrow, and
                     seeing dimly her day of desolation approaching; whilst I, in bodily comfort at
                     least, was but fulfilling the vow I had made to my Alma Mater, and gathering
                     the heart's harvest of humanity, in place of the prosperity that would have
                     blunted its perceptions of mercy and of truth. Almost ashamed as I wrapped the
                     ample folds of my thick cloak about me, and the shivering girl pattered after
                     me with her well-worn shoes, I walked on in silence; the poor child's plaintive
                     and sweet voice was yet falling on my ear—"I am afraid she will never get
                     well." Sweet and plaintive as it was, memory recalled one far sweeter, though
                     its actual notes had long ceased to make music for me; yet it still comes to me
                     from the spirit's hoard in my weary rounds amongst the children of misery, and
                     helps me to bear the toils of our thankless profession.
                  The faint rays of a candle issuing from a window in the second story of one of
                     those wretched wooden buildings that run the entire length of an ordinary city
                     lot, lighted us up a rickety stairway on the outside of the house, leading to
                     each miserable upper tenement; a stately tenant-house with its unventilated
                     rooms and foul and pestiferous smells, has now taken its place. Poor as it was,
                     its cleanliness was under the control of its own occupants, from the fact of
                     its isolation from the loathsome Irish neighbors, whose superior means and
                     brutal habits allowed them to occupy the lower and more accessible apartments,
                     almost in common with the pigs which were fed from their very door-steps. As I
                     reached the small platform in front of the door, I was obliged to stoop in
                     order to enter the apartment, and its small size brought me almost to the
                     bedside by a single step. The face of its occupant was turned from me as I
                     entered, and it was not until a violent paroxysm of coughing had ceased to
                     agitate her, that I could see the features of my patient. Quick as thought the
                     little messenger had thrown off her hat and shawl, and passing her thin little
                     arm behind her mother, she raised her up so tenderly, and when the fit had
                     ceased, she begged her to take a few drops of her anodyne with such melting
                     earnestness—"Mother, dear mother, do take them; they will do you good; take
                     them, dear mother, and you will be able to talk to the Doctor." As I turned for
                     a moment towards the window, a sweet rose bush in full flower met my eye; it
                     stood upon a board of faultless whiteness, shaded by a little muslin curtain of
                     equal purity. These little evidences of refinement produced a melancholy effect
                     upon me, which was not lessened when good breeding required me to address my
                     patient.
                  I have always been accustomed to look upon the human face, as the last great
                     struggle approaches, with almost a reverential feeling: as one approaching a
                     knowledge of that great secret—no less than the object of our creation— every being about to pass the dark
                     gulf is entitled to our interest, if only from selfish motives; but when the
                     cord is about to be severed, and one little, helpless creature is to be left
                     friendless and alone, to struggle with the world's icy selfishness, and the
                     poor, fainting form is alone dependent upon that child, prematurely old from
                     care and misery, the soul is alive to the slightest impression such a scene can
                     make. In the instance before me, how inexpressibly was all this heightened!
                  I had slowly approached the sick woman, and as I offered ray hand to her my eye
                     took in every object before me.
                  The countenance of my patient had evidently been beautiful; an immense mass of
                     auburn hair, such as Titian loved to paint, yet shaded her brow, and the eyes
                     were large and lustrous; the nose was slightly Roman, the lips thin and
                     fearfully pale; the chin was of an appropriate curve, and fell in grandly with
                     the rest of the countenance. Every feature bespoke the woman of a highly
                     refined and intellectual nature. She placed her wasted hand in mine, and as her
                     gaze for a moment met my own, I felt almost as though pity was misplaced in the
                     emotions that swelled my heart: for the moment, had she been an empress her
                     gaze could not have been more lofty and almost stern. We neither of us spoke;
                     she suffered her eyes to dwell a moment on mine, and as they were slowly
                     withdrawn, and rested upon her child who stood by my side, she said, "Go,
                     dearest, to your little bed, and close the door, my love; mother can reach her
                     drink, and when the doctor leaves her he will open it; I will ring, dear child,
                     if I want you." The child lingered an instant, and looking earnestly at her
                     mother, I instinctively stepped aside whilst their lips met in that holy kiss
                     that a dying mother only can give; aye, and a prayer that she alone can
                     breathe. As the little creature withdrew, I noticed a door indistinguishable
                     from the rest of the whitewashed boards that divided the floor into a larger
                     and a smaller room, although both together would scarcely constitute a
                     comfortable chamber. When the earnest look of the poor mother was withdrawn,
                     her eyes again rested calmly on mine, as she said, "I have troubled you,
                     Doctor, not with the view of taxing your kindness to any extent, but simply to
                     ask you how long"—she mused a moment, and placing her thin hand on her wasted
                     bosom, continued—"I may yet linger, depending for every service upon that
                     little fragile creature, for whom alone I have, I fear selfishly, desired to
                     live.
                  I could not answer immediately, and she resumed; "I have a duty connected with
                     her that depends upon your answer, and one that I have selfishly, alas! too
                     long deferred. When I leave her she must have a protector." So far my poor
                     patient had sustained a countenance as calm and an eye as tearless as though
                     she were conversing in perfect health; for a few moments she ceased, and
                     placing her hand before her eyes, was silent. Then resuming, she said: "I left
                     my father's house twelve years since, to share the fate of one who deserved all
                     the love that a woman could bestow; he struggled manfully against misfortune
                     till two years since, when he left me for a happier sphere; here is all I have
                     to recall him to her remembrance when I shall join him." She took from under
                     her pillow, and placed the miniature of a noble-looking man, of apparently
                     twenty-five years of age, in my hand, and again ceased, while I examined it
                     with great interest. I was strongly impressed with the idea that I had seen the
                     original. I said nothing, but examined it attentively; every element of manhood
                     was stamped upon the features. She saw my admiration, and with eyes upraised as
                     though her spirit was winged for its flight, she exclaimed, "My husband, my
                     good, my noble George I why could we not have gone with thee?"
                  Calmly she then detailed their history. She was the motherless daughter of a
                     wealthy merchant in one of the
                     interior towns, and had received an education far above that usually bestowed
                     upon her associates; city facilities had been added, and her residence here was
                     prolonged beyond the usual period of girlish studies. Whilst at school, she met
                     and loved a poor man. I had been at a loss to discover a reason why so delicate
                     and refined a woman should, on a first visit, have given me so large a share of
                     her confidence; but it appeared she knew me through her husband; he was a
                     physician! and the likeness of the miniature to a distant remembrance of some
                     face I had formerly seen, was now made clear to me. My poor patient informed me
                     that shortly after their marriage, when her husband's means were quite
                     exhausted, and his practice a mere nothing, a chance call had summoned him to
                     an accident occurring in their poor neighborhood in the outskirts of the city.
                     A gentleman's carriage had run over a child. I was at that time attending one
                     of our charitable institutions in that vicinity, and was requested by this
                     gentleman, a member of the committee, to visit the child. A fractured limb was
                     the result of the accident, and on my arrival I found the young medical man had
                     already done all that the occasion required; I apologized, and immediately
                     retired; but the parents of the child were called upon by my friend, and
                     assured that he would pay all the charges for its medical, attendance on
                     condition of their employing me. The young physician on learning this the next
                     day at his visit, immediately retired in my favor; but as I had experienced on
                     more than one occasion the same mortifying treatment, I called upon him in the
                     evening at his office, and insisted upon his acceptance of a portion of the fee
                     I knew I would get. I remembered that I had found some difficulty in inducing
                     him to accept it, and that my impression at the time was that he was
                     excessively proud; and yet such is medical life in this great city, his poor
                     wife informed me that when he came home that evening, with a large basket of
                     necessaries, and some delicacies, to which they had long been unaccustomed,
                     upon her expressing her astonishment, he sat down and wept like a child, as he
                     exclaimed, "Great God! why did I take you from your father? What a reward for
                     devoting the flower of life to such a profession; to hear a wife and the mother
                     of my child expressing astonishment and joy at the unwonted sight of the
                     necessary comforts of life in the wretched household of a gentleman and a
                     physician, her own husband, the father of her child!" For the first time my
                     poor patient was overcome; she wept at the memory of his grief; she, on the
                     verge of the grave, wept for the sorrows of him who was at rest, whilst she was
                     surrounded with desolation. My heart was full.
                  I insisted upon her ceasing her narrative, and excusing any examination and
                     opinion till next day. I named the afternoon as the period, because I expected
                     to find her fever at its height. I had recognized the dreadful malady at the
                     first glance; there could be no doubt she was far gone with consumption. Nor
                     would my feelings allow a hasty visit. I felt unwilling to leave her, but she
                     assured me she had no apprehension of any immediate change. She requested me to
                     open the door of the little chamber; I did so, and there lay the poor child
                     with her clothes still on! Merciful God! an infant watching its dying mother—a
                     refined, delicate, and intellectual woman, the wife of a physician, in a
                     wretched tenement surrounded by palaces! I left them and sought my couch; but
                     it was near morning before I slept, and then but fitfully. I dreamed. Why was
                     it not my fate? who was I to be so favored of heaven? God is just; why was I
                     not punished? But He is also a mystery. What—whence—why are we? Why had I not
                     known tin's unfortunate man? alas! could I have aided him? He was morbidly
                     proud; so was I. But nature had given me strength, perseverance, and scorn" and
                     contempt for medical meanness and trickery. I had raised, even thus early,
                        my standard, drawn my sword, and
                     thrown away the scabbard. Had he died now, his poor wife and her fatherless
                     child might, if his poverty would have allowed the necessary contribution to
                     its coffers, have received the aid of a charitable society(!), originated by a
                     man whose private practices arid pretensions, and insolent assumptions of
                     superiority over the most intellectual young men, backed by the wretched clique
                     to which he belongs, have done more to break the spirit of the young physician
                     and render that society necessary, than all the ridiculous professional pride
                     ever produced by the absurdities of a modern senile code of medical ethics.
                  I did not then know the actual merits of this unfortunate young man; it was
                     only when his note-books and manuscripts fell into my hands, that I discovered
                     what a loss his family and our profession had sustained. As soon as I awoke, I
                     sent for the most soothing cough-mixture, and a few delicacies, and sent them
                     with a note of direction to my poor patient, and hurried about to get through
                     my miserable practice—for it was my custom for years to attend every call; the
                     most wretched and dingy denizens of the cellar and the attic, were then as
                     carefully visited as the thriving mechanic or the most purse-proud aristocrat.
                     It is true they gave me little money, but a rich harvest of medical experience,
                     and a keener edge to my knowledge of the human heart, which I soon learned was
                     governed by the same emotions, whether it beat in a hovel or a palace.
                  At four o'clock I knocked at the door, arid found the poor little sentinel at
                     her post, at her mother's bedside. Then it was that I saw what at first had
                     excited my curiosity, viz. the manner in which my patient contrived to support
                     herself; for I was quite sure that she would never have condescended to beg, or
                     to allow her child to solicit any other aid than, perhaps, the personal service
                     of some poor friend in their humble home. I had observed during my visit the
                     previous evening, a very large parcel, tied up in commercial style, and by its
                     side a large square board, similar to those used by pupils in drawing. The
                     widow and her child were at work, putting up soda and seidlitz powders; several
                     dozen boxes had been taken from the great package and filled during the
                     morning, and they were now placing the envelopes and labels upon them. She
                     sitting up in her bed, her cheeks burning with hectic, was propped up with some
                     coarse pillows of straw, and the square board rested on a couple of
                     cross-pieces to keep it from her wasted libs!
                  The little girl was working at the same employment on a small pine table, close
                     by her mother's bed. Some of the fruit and the mixture I had sent were placed
                     on an earthern plate, on a little board nailed to the wooden partition by the
                     bedside.
                  As I entered, my poor patient actually smiled gracefully, as she begged me to
                     be seated. She thanked me for my attentions, and observed that she would not
                     have made an exhibition of their industry, were it not for the contracted
                     nature of their accommodations! Seeing that I could not answer her smile, she
                     added, "'Tis the lot of humanity to labor, and why should any be exempt?" I
                     replied that her remark was just as it related to the healthy; but labor could
                     never have been intended, in a humane community, for those who required all
                     their powers to repel disease. I removed the board from before her, and placed
                     the table at a little distance, allowing the child to resume her avocation.
                     Seating myself at the bedside, I soon saw that I must again cut short our
                     interview, because of the violence of the fever. I learned that her poor
                     husband had died of typhus fever, caught from a miserable pauper he was
                     attending; he was doubtless predisposed from anxiety and poor nourishment; he
                     died, mercifully bereft of reason, and thus escaped the bitter pangs he would
                     have suffered at the sight of the misery of his wife. He had continued till a
                     late period to decline all medical
                     treatment, rather than expose his poverty to his brethern: in this he was
                     undoubtedly wrong, for benevolence was near him in the person of one of the
                     profession, whose genial warmth of character and humble origin made him an
                     acceptable visitor amongst the poor; they had long cheerfully employed and paid
                     him, and rendered him able to assist a suffering brother. When her husband
                     became known to Dr. ——, he had devoted his time and his purse freely for their
                     relief; he closed the eyes of his patient, and placed his remains decently in
                     the grave. After a moment she continued, "I summoned fortitude enough to
                     protect and feed myself and child in comparative comfort." It was after the
                     death of Dr. ——, who within the same year fell a victim to that accursed
                     failing that has destroyed so much genuine benevolence and worth in our
                     profession, that feeling the fell disease had seized upon her, she was obliged
                     to leave her comfortable apartments and remove to the cheap abode in which I
                     found her. The needle and the coloring of prints had sustained them both for
                     nearly a year, when she found it impossible to earn enough at that employment,
                     and she resumed the one by which her husband had been accustomed to eke out his
                     miserable income in order to sustain them. Often she told me had she sat by his
                     side late in the night, reading to him whilst he plied his fingers
                     industriously at this employment, so utterly repulsive to an intellectual man;
                     and when she would beg him to retire, he would often cheerfully obey the
                     summons to an all-night visit of some wretched and dishonest Irishman, who
                     could not get the services of a more knowing physician without an advanced fee,
                     in the remote hope of obtaining a few dollars, which his refinement and
                     personal appearance taught these wretchedly dishonest people, they had only to
                     refuse (as they almost invariably do) in order to escape entirely the
                     obligation.
                  Those who speak of the gratitude of the low Catholic Irish, as they present
                     their true characters to the young practitioner in this city, will find but one
                     opinion; a more improvident, heartless, and dishonest class of people never
                     defiled the fair face of the earth: they are indeed a bitter curse to the young
                     and humane physician. It was whilst attending one of these wretched people,
                     that he imbibed, in the miserable hole in which they dwelt, the fatal disease
                     that swept him from earth, and left his poor wife and child to struggle on in
                     their cheerless journey.
                  After an hour spent in these details, my patient desired her child to convey a
                     message to the poor friend who once a day performed the domestic services of
                     their little household. As soon as the child closed the door, she turned to me,
                     and with the greatest quietness begged me to tell her with entire candor how
                     long she could yet live; assuring me that she felt it could be but a very short
                     time, and she wished to prepare a letter for her father, so that her dear child
                     should not long prove a burden to the poor friend with whom she wished to leave
                     her at her death; she feared that only that event would soften his feelings
                     towards her child. Her voice filtered slightly as she said, she had not
                     received an answer to a single letter she had written him for the twelve long
                     years since the one forbidding her marriage; her feelings toward him, she said,
                     were now too tender to risk a change by receiving no answer. She preferred
                     writing the letter, and letting him see the reality of those feelings, which
                     she feared he might doubt under any circumstances less impressive than those of
                     which her death might assure him. As this cruel necessity seemed to be the
                     result of her actual knowledge of his unforgiving nature, and his twelve years
                     of silence towards her would seem to leave no doubt of its correctness, however
                     incredible it might otherwise have seemed, I consented at her request not to
                     write to him till she had ceased to breathe. I told her a few weeks would be
                     the period to which she could hope to attain. "I hope!" she replied; "could I hope, Doctor? would you
                     have me hope to live, thus situated? I could weep at leaving my dear child,
                     were it not for the gloom that would for ever shroud her spirit should this
                     scene be too deeply imprinted on her young heart. My father has wealth, and
                     other children more happily situated; her lovely, thoughtful disposition, will
                     win them to her, and soften their feelings towards one who can no longer incur
                     the resentment of their wounded pride. They will not dislike my child when they
                     learn that I died blessing their dear memories, and recalling those happy hours
                     when we shared the love of both of our dear parents. My poor father, Doctor,
                     felt wounded and hurt when my mother died. He had been devoted to wealth all
                     his later life, arid he expected too much from me. I could not fill the void. I
                     loved him tenderly; but oh! the love of even a mother's memory and a father's
                     living presence, cannot satisfy a woman's soul! It requires more fervor and
                     devotion than the strongest love of a parent. Never, oh! never has my woman's,
                     my mother's love twined itself round the fibres of my dear child, as it does,
                     even now, around the memory of my noble husband. I shall soon join him; "you
                     must not be surprised at my certain conviction of the truth of my hope. I have
                     not reached it, it is true, by the aid of those outward demonstrations of
                     religious faith, so graceful and becoming to my sex when publicly made. My
                     woman's pride has always prevented my mingling with those who I feared would
                     despise me because of my plain attire, even in the house of God. I loved the
                     human race, and would cheerfully have aided any one in distress; but I had been
                     accustomed to worship God amongst those who were my equals in this world:
                     rudeness and noise I never could endure, without distress and entire
                     distraction of a thankful frame of mind; but such deportment is always to be
                     observed in free places of worship; yet I am aware they ought to be open to
                     all. I believe in the mercy of God, and that He will not separate hereafter
                     those who loved tenderly on earth. God himself is love—a love holier by far
                     than ours; but still ours is a spark from that undiminished source that forever
                     and for ever radiates from Him, brighter and brighter for every soul it warms
                     into life in this world of sin and sorrow. But, Doctor, I will not trouble you
                     further. To-night, while I have strength enough left, I will prepare the letter
                     for my father; it will express all I desire for my dear child. Let me now
                     allude to the disposition of this poor body. Place it, with as little expense
                     as possible, by the side of my dear husband's remains: do not remove it till my
                     father arrives; for if I may judge from my own feelings as a mother, I should
                     not wish to be deprived of the last look upon one I had loved. But there are
                     two things remaining that I wish my daughter to possess; this," taking from
                     under her pillow the miniature of her husband; "give it to her the moment my
                     eyes are closed: thank God, that inspired a dear and absent friend to offer it
                     to me in the days of our deepest poverty. I could have wished, for my father's
                     and sisters' sake, there had been one of myself; not as I am now," raising her
                     eyes to mine with a smile. "It was offered by the same dear friend; but I would
                     not then tax his kindness; his circumstances were too like our own. He insisted
                     upon doing it, but he sailed unexpectedly for Europe with a friend, before his
                     kind intentions could have been executed; for you see, Doctor, how much pains
                     he has bestowed on these noble features."
                  It was indeed a gem of art; she gazed a moment upon it, and continued. "The
                     other bequest is a little book, in which I have occasionally written such
                     thoughts as I hoped would keep alive my child's early lessons in virtue, and
                     her father's instructions. I believe the world would think them cold and severe
                     for a mother to write to her child; but my views of education have been greatly
                     changed by my husband; he differed much from the world. He used to say, I There is too much sentiment and
                     too little justice: they call it benevolence; but it is a sickly term, and
                     often an insult to God. We owe man much more than Christ owed us." These were
                     his words, Doctor; do me the favor to read them. You will find them amongst my
                     dear husband's papers, in the little trunk under my pillow; take them before
                     you leave the house at my death; I give them to you, my dear sir, as most
                     likely to appreciate them. And now, good evening, Doctor, for I have too long
                     detained you from your duties to those whose condition may render your talents
                     more available. One thing only I regret, Doctor; it is that my husband did not
                     cultivate your intimacy; your calmness and energy might have strengthened his
                     spirit. But God is good: He is wise: all is right, though we may not understand
                     it."
                  She extended her hand to me, and warmly thanked me for my-kindness; I pressed
                     it a moment, and left her. I saw nothing peculiar in her countenance, and I
                     thought she would live for weeks; but it was ordained otherwise. On my return
                     to my office, I found a call in the neighborhood required my attendance. Two
                     hours had elapsed when I returned, and found the poor woman who had been sent
                     for by my patient, had called and requested my instant attendance, as she was
                     much worse. I hastily sought the abode; all was over: calm and majestic lay the
                     dead mother, with the living child by her side; the little creature was gazing
                     with awe upon the face of her mother; she looked at me with tearless amazement,
                     wondering if it were indeed death. I took her in my arms, and asked her if she
                     remembered the last words her mother had spoken. She said softly in my ear, "Be
                     kind to all; never tell a lie; remember your father." I took the letter she had
                     written, and examined its address. It was to one of the interior counties of
                     our State. It was so late in the season that the river communication was
                     closed, and I feared to intrust it to the post office, as I knew it contained
                     her last wishes for her child. I had of course to communicate her death to her
                     father, and I therefore chose to preserve it till his arrival. I announced the
                     event with as much sympathy as I could feel for one whose parental character
                     was to me inexplicable. I dated the letter at my own residence, and begged the
                     postmaster to transmit it immediately to her father, on its receipt.
                  All the necessary arrangements were made for preserving the body till his
                     arrival; but I would not allow its removal from the humble abode. I was
                     determined that he should know the whole truth; I thought it would soften his
                     feelings towards the poor child. The kind woman who had aided them in their
                     little housekeeping, had promised the dying mother that she would take personal
                     charge of the child, till her grandfather should arrive. She took her to her
                     own humble apartments, with such provision as my knowledge of her late
                     deprivations suggested me to procure for her comfort. All else was given in
                     charge to the undertaker.
                  On the fifth day, late in the evening, on entering my office, I found a man of
                     about fifty years of age, plainly dressed in black, with one of those
                     countenances that admit of no particular definition; the features were
                     immovable and hard, and the whole countenance wore rather an anxious
                     expression; the hair was profuse and grizzled. He arose from the chair in which
                     he was seated, and inquiringly said, "This is Dr. ——?" I answered
                     affirmatively. "I received a letter from you in relation to my daughter." This
                     was said in the most perfectly business manner, and without the removal of his
                     small black eye for even an instant, or the slightest emotion. I must have
                     looked my astonishment, for he immediately added, "A sad business, a sad
                     business, my dear sir."
                  I did not reply for a moment, and he added, "Well, well, sir, I will not detain
                     you; the corpse is here, I suppose?"
                     I answered him simply negatively, and resuming my cloak, I told him I would
                     accompany him to the late abode of his daughter. I felt glad that the corpse
                     had not been removed. I thought that if not now, it would some clay do his
                     moral nature a service to see to what condition his unfeeling nature had
                     brought her. Her late abode was but two squares from my own, and I confess that
                     I looked in wonder at his face as I motioned him to ascend the wretched steps;
                     not a muscle changed. I followed him. Our knock was answered by the watcher of
                     the corpse. Motioning him to enter, I took from my pocket the letter she had
                     written, and as I handed it to him, remarked, "These are your daughter's last
                     words: I will not intrude upon you, sir, but will await you at my office till
                     ten o'clock, when I have a patient to see." It was then eight. I bowed and
                     retired.
                  In less than a quarter of an hour he returned, and without any other allusion
                     to the event, thanked me for my attentions, as he refused the chair I offered
                     him, requested me to direct him to the present abode of his grandchild, and to
                     the shop of the undertaker, "as he wished to settle the account and have all
                     ready for an early start in the morning, as he designed to take the corpse with
                     him," adding, "You will please to make out your bill, sir."
                  I was speechless: he was an anomaly. I stood still, and measured him with my
                     eyes; he cast his own for a moment on the floor, and replied, "My business
                     habits, I fear, shock you, sir. I have been all my life in a hurry; I have
                     never had time to think. I owe you an apology, sir, and I hope you will pardon
                     me."
                  I thought of the poor child and her future fate, and I must say, hypocritically
                     for once in my adult life, I took the hand of a man I despised, as I asked him
                     mildly if his daughter had not requested to be buried by the side of her
                     husband.
                  ""No, sir," replied he, sharply;" his name was not mentioned in the letter:
                     very properly, sir, very properly. I had no respect for him, sir, none
                     whatever; nor should I have acceded to such a request had she made it. I intend
                     to take the body with me, sir, and will not trouble you farther. Good evening,
                     sir; I am much obliged to you, and will send in the morning for your bill." I
                     gave him the directions to find his grandchild, and the undertaker. I thought
                     over the matter, and determined not to oppose him, because I wanted him to love
                     his poor little delicate grandchild, if possible. He sent in the morning for my
                     bill; but I had prepared an answer that I hoped would benefit him without
                     aggravating his feelings towards her. I told him, in a note, that I deemed such
                     a privilege a sacred one, not to be soiled by a pecuniary return. I said other
                     things to him, which I will not repeat.
                  Near spring, I received a kind and almost an affectionate letter, announcing
                     the death of his grandchild. She had greatly subdued his nature, by her lovely
                     character; but her feeble frame had received a shock which she could not
                     sustain. I was glad to hear of her death; it was not desirable for her to live,
                     with such memories clouding her early youth.
                  One evening, in the month of June following these events, I set out about eight
                     o'clock from the bank of the Great Western Canal, on a rude country wagon, by
                     the side of a good-natured farmer, I had hired for the purpose, to fulfil a
                     sacred promise. I had kept the memory of her to whom it was made near my heart,
                     and as I approached the little church of ——, I felt as though her spirit beamed
                     kindly on me. I had provided the necessary certificate, and with the aid of the
                     sexton, who, I had learned, resided near by, we deposited our sacred treasure
                     within the porch. I avoided all allusion to the peculiar circumstances of the
                     case to my companions, merely saying I was carrying out the wishes of the dead; and leaving my name with
                     the sexton and a note for the father of my late patient, I begged him to see it
                     placed in his hands. The note alluded to the virtues of his child, her trials,
                     and her devotion to her husband in life, and reminded him of the certainty of
                     our equality in death. I added, that what man could not divide in life, he
                     should not wish to separate in death. I learned that the remains of her husband
                     were interred next day by the side of the daughter and her child; and I
                     received but lately the assurance that the poor father admitted, before his
                     death, that money was not the chief good.

               THE month of May had set in—tender grass and sweet-scented flowers sprang from
                  earth's warming bosom. Life seemed young everywhere. How could a grave be dug in
                  gay-mantled May? Ask Church-yard, whose tear-nourished ground hath robed itself
                  with spring-time flowers—ask of it, if the old and young are not welcomed to it,
                  as though in some sequestered bower! Ask if, midst Nature's plenitude, man's
                  desolation be not most ripe? Ask old Church-bell, as "toll," "toll," its iron
                  tongue doth vibrate through ear to heart, searing the loved marks of former days,
                  ask, if it doth not teach bud and blossom below, that they do early fade! Doth not
                  the spring wind, with its fragrant breath, tell of its escape from winter's tomb,
                  and bear upon it evidence of another life begun! Then weep not, ye who bury loved
                  ones midst early shrub and flower, when every breath-wind bears a new
                  life-welcome.
               Night had closed in; the day's labor was over. Slipper and arm-chair were fast
                  solacing the body with gentle, half-dozing forgetfulness, stealing away all
                  thought of self and others. With a sudden start I leaped up at the sound of my
                  bell. A stranger needed my instant attention at L——, some miles distant. The
                  messenger was the hotel-keeper himself.
                  He was a small man—small in every way. Small head, small body, small legs—his very
                  clothes were too small for him. His mode of conversing was alike small—hints more
                  than speech came from him.
               "Ah, doctor," he cried, as he hopped into my office, "wanted
                  instanter—extraordinary man—awful sick—will die—have none other—must come—carriage
                  at the door—soon be there." I knew the man, and without a word, encasing my feet
                  and back in their appropriate vestments, I followed him to his wagon. The stars
                  were shining brightly, but the air seemed sharp after my luxurious arm-chair. The
                  little man was in the body of his horse. He was a pantomime of the animal and
                  vehicle together—such grimaces—such sharp twitchings—such easy-let-down actions,
                  were never seen before. The road was hilly, and here and there lay through marshy
                  woodland, or dark high forest patches; the little man drove as well in the dark as
                  the light—sometimes half out the wagon, at others, standing nimbly up, but never
                  speaking nor stopping pace.
               I wished I was back in my old arm-chair; my mind was almost made up to topple him
                  over, as he leaned half-body out. Never so much before did I feel that my
                  profession was a mere business—it was nothing else, to be so hauled over rut and
                  stone, down and up hill by such a fragment of humanity! We were now clear of all
                  signs of habitation. The wind had become gusty, and the stars shone less brightly,
                  as the clouds lay scattered here and there over the heavens I felt nervous and
                  chilly—I knew not why; and I even wished the curious homunculus beside me would
                  talk or even whistle. At length he began:
               "Forgot to tell about him—dreadful stern man—like a pirate—gentleman pirate—speaks
                  like a savage—perfect skeleton, and won't die! No, sir, says he won't,"
               "What is his disease?" I inquired.
               "Has all," answered the little blackbird; "is mad—grits his teeth—strikes his
                  chest—very strong-pitched me like a ball—just asked if his lungs were gone! Be
                  careful, sir, desperate fierce man—ordered our doctor out the room—steady there."
                  The horse claimed his attention, and again he seemed in his very bowels.
               At length the light of the top of the hotel appeared, and in a" few minutes we
                  arrived at the steps. Death surely could not be at work here! there was the sound
                  of music and laughter—a maddening waltz was playing, and the young were very happy
                  and merry.
               With his quick step the little keeper led on to the sick man's room, I knocked
                  gently at the door. A deep voice bade me enter. Upon a sofa, wrapped in a rich
                  brocade dressing-gown, lay the figure of a man of almost colossal stature. By his
                  side a table stood, holding a carcel-lamp, with its shade casting its powerful
                  light upon a book, which apparently he had been reading. Every feature of his
                  wasted face was distinctly shown. It was the utter wreck of great manly beauty.
                  The dark curling hair fell lightly over his white massive forehead, as though it
                  belonged to vigorous manhood. The eyes, now deep sunken in. their hollow orbits,
                  were of a hazel-black, and still full of pride and power. The teeth were
                  exquisitely beautiful and white-how often seen in those doomed to die from lung
                  disease!—whilst the firm, but now thin lips, were slightly parted, and were red,
                  as though mocking with health; the wide-opened nostrils moved with every breath.
                  At a glance I read the fatal disorder that was fast preying on this noble-looking
                  creature. With an impatient wave of the hand he motioned the host to the door, who
                  seemed eager to quit his presence; and then, with a faint smile, he pointed me to
                  a chair.
               "Doctor, I have sent for you thus untimely, that you may give me something to ease
                  me—my strength has failed me strangely.
                  "That is," he continued hastily, "I do not feel so well as I ought."
               The few words he uttered seemed an effort; he was evidently dently averse to be
                  thought ill. I asked him how long he had been sick. For an instant a faint flush
                  passed over his wan cheek, and with an abruptness rendered startling by his
                  singularly deep voice, he said; "I have merely sent for you, sir, to give me some
                  strengthening remedy—I do not care to enter into any detail."
               Gently but firmly I informed him, that unless I knew something relative to the
                  history of his disorder, and was allowed to make such physical examination as I
                  deemed necessary, I could not prescribe. He appeared excited by my answer, and was
                  about to reply, when he put his hand suddenly over his heart, compressing his lips
                  tightly upon his closed teeth. His whole frame shook with the violence of the
                  heart's palpitation; and his face, that had become suddenly suffused, grew ashy
                  pale. A bottle of ammonia standing on the table, I poured a few drops into some
                  water, and handed it to him. He gave me a look, and then mechanically took the
                  glass and drank the contents. Recovering in a few minutes, he said in a low
                  tone:
               "Doctor, forgive me—I am at times very hasty, and I fear very self-willed," he
                  added, faintly smiling. "You have demanded nothing more than what is right. You
                  may examine my chest," he continued with reluctance;" you are the first man that
                  has ever done so—perhaps you will, be the last. You will find all right there;
                  only my nervous system has given way."
               With what self-taught delusion did he still endeavor to hide the truth from
                  himself and me! Nothing of sound lung structure remained; and, as from time to
                  time he spoke, the voice entered into my very ear, as I laid my head on his broad
                  chest. What a frame—yet not an ounce of fat was left—all had gone; the mere
                  skin-covered skeleton remained, of what must have been a specimen of the finest
                  manly beauty. His poor heart labored in his tired breast, like some frightened
                  bird trying for escape! His fate was inevitable—he merely lived by the will.
               As I resumed my seat, he placed his dark eyes on my face. The sweat stood in large
                  beads upon his forehead and upper lip—a strong commotion was going on within. At
                  length, in a voice whose tones resembled those of a fine bass, he said, with an
                  ill attempt to appear indifferent,
               "Well, sir, what have you found; or rather what is left to be found? Come—speak
                  plainly; I know not why, but I now wish to have an opinion. Feel my pulse—you see
                  it is very calm."
               It was beating violently irregular, and was very rapid! I gently informed him that
                  disease had long, or else very rapidly invaded his chest, destroying his lungs in
                  the most remarkable manner. He hastily interrupted me.
               "Stop," he exclaimed, "never mind about the amount of damage—there must be enough
                  left to keep life upon—try your skill—it and my will must win—by heavens! I
                     will not die! Why man, soldiers have been shot in the chest, and
                  their lungs drowned in blood—yet accounts tell that some have lived. Pshaw! go to
                  your work, and I promise you my part shall not be lacking. You see," said he,
                  vehemently, whilst the sweat rolled from his forehead and plashed on his arm, as
                  he suddenly raised himself, and stood to his full height upon the floor—" you see
                  what strength I have. Does this look like dying for want of lung-air? Why, man"—he
                  could say no more; a violent fit of coughing caused him to sink panting on the
                  sofa. He knew, but dreaded to hear that he was a victim to that dread disease,
                  consumption. How many have thus dreaded and fallen I Alas! how many have revelled
                  in that singular condition of hope, so falsely attendant in his funeral train!
               Taking from my case a powerful stimulant, I gave it to him. He drank it greedily, and lapsing back upon Ms
                  cushions, he lay with half-closed lids, whose long lashes fringed his pale cheeks.
                  In the course of a few minutes he appeared refreshed, and drawing as deep a breath
                  as he could, he said:
               "Doctor, the remedy does me good—I feel it coursing through my veins, like slender
                  streams of heat—why man, I tell you I feel better than I have done for weeks. Give
                  me some more, and I will yet live to laugh at your grave face. I could almost eat,
                  and that I have not done much for weeks; my tongue and throat have been so
                  sore."
               After some time I gained his consent to try to sleep—he was afraid of suffocating,
                  and he said, his thoughts were so wild as he would lose himself, that he would
                  start up, and fear he might go mad. At length he slept; but what a struggle, now
                  that the influence of the brain was calmed. I had promised to remain by his side
                  that night. Whenever he awoke from his troubled slumber, I gave him some
                  refreshing drink, and to my astonishment he uttered his gratitude in the mildest
                  manner. I could scarcely believe that it was the same proud and almost fierce man
                  I had seen at first. Towards day his garments became drenched, and his cheek grew
                  more wan, whilst his dark hair dripped with the heavy sweat that was fast flooding
                  life away.
               When morning dawned, I retired for a few hours' rest. On my return to his chamber,
                  I found him on the sofa as first I had seen him. He extended his emaciated hand,
                  and, with a smile whose power was extraordinary, he thanked me for my care.
               "Between your skill, doctor," said he, "and my determination, the enemy might be
                  held down a long time."
               The day wore on. To my surprise he really seemed better than the day previous. His
                  conversation, at first somewhat reserved, became more free and earnest; and as
                  night closed in, he appeared to regard me almost affectionately. Occasional faint
                  turns occurred during the day, but upon the whole, he thought he felt better than
                  he had done for weeks. Yet there was scarce lung enough to have supported an
                  infant. Still, this once powerful man lived on—moved at times with a surprising
                  strength, and spoke almost with oat a pant.
               When the sun was nigh down, he placed himself at the window. A few clouds
                  portended a coming storm, as their irregular outlines were lighted up by the last
                  rays. As I looked upon him from the book I had been reading, a tear trembled upon
                  his long lashes, and gently fell upon his chest. Soft feelings were busy in the
                  heart of this usually stern man, making him a child again, A shudder shook his
                  frame as he gazed upon the disappearing disk of the sun. Was he thinking he might
                  never see it more!
               "It has gone," said he, speaking to himself. "The friend of my childhood—the
                  gladdening sun of my morning-life—has left me for a long night. Oh, God! may its
                  rays gladden my poor mother when I am gone." Turning to me, he called me to his
                  side; "Doctor," said he, a when the sun goes down, there seems something taken
                  away from me—the funeral pile lights on my cheek, till every fibre of my frame
                  glows beneath its consuming fire; and, alas! the heavy morning sweats are not as
                  dew to me—they waste and chill me to my very marrow. From my early child days have
                  I watched that great bright sun, and bathed myself in its light. I saw how tree
                  and flower alike grew strong beneath its generous rays, and I learned to look upon
                  him as a great life-giver. It has left me, and I feel my heart-strength has set
                  with it—damps already rise, and earth soon will be hid in the grave of night. Give
                  me some drink, and for the first time in my life I will tell to another the
                  history of the wreck that remains of me.;; He continued—
               "There are moments in all men's lives that a change new-born in their characters,
                  be it for weal or ill. Some accept the
                  impulse, and try their bark upon the new sea. A port full of promise is the reward
                  to some, whilst others are wrecked most miserably! To me there is no future in
                     this world left; whilst in the world to come, those clouds that so
                  fast darken the just now reddened heavens, are not darker than the doubts that
                  surround the horizon of my future being. Yet, most singular, as my body, fibre by
                  fibre drops away, leaving bare that called 'spirit,' I find growing apace within
                  me that which createth a need to believe in a future—a very
                  soul-necessity that it must be!
               "I say, doctor," he continued, striking his breast, "that this very inward
                  waste—this utter unfitness of my dissolving body to be the scene of my spirit's
                  action, has done more to teach me of the imperishableness of that true self—the
                  true I—than all the sermons and readings could have done. There was a time when
                  such teaching could not have weight; then, this body seemed a fitting residence
                  for what I then termed will, but am now convinced is
                     soul. Not a nerve, not a muscle, that was disobedient. The
                  muscular sense was so perfect, that I felt satisfied that that termed soul was its
                  mere embodied requisitions. In other words, soul seemed to me the perfect unition
                  of the senses!
               "As a child, I was large and well formed. As years advanced, and these doctrines
                  took hold, I did everything to perfect the body, that this unit—this soul—should
                  become as perfect as possible. My father died whilst I was in my fifteenth year.
                  He had been a vigorous man, and only at times complained that his energies were
                  weakening. A slight cough set in, which he attributed to accidental cold; when of
                  a sudden a vessel burst, and before his physician could arrive he was a corpse.
                  His death made a powerful impression on me. The physician said he had hemorrhage
                  from the lungs, which lie had long considered the seat of tuberculous
                  disorder.
               "From that moment I imbibed the most powerful dread lest my fate should be sealed
                  like my father's. I obtained books—read them attentively—studied the disease in
                  its every phase—its prevention, and its appropriate remedies. Climates were
                  studied, as to their natural disorders and their antagonistic disposition, and as
                  to the effect on persons resorting to them when afflicted with this dread scourge.
                  Mankind were classified relative to their habits and social positions. In a word,
                  I became learned about others, but morbidly avoided thinking of self—fear alone
                  pervaded me. Yet I grew into uncommon manly development, and health seemed
                  impregnable. But now, how changed. See these withered hands, once proud in almost
                  giant strength! Great God! hath not the wretched disease anatomized flesh from
                  bone I Give me some drink—the recollection of my former days maddens me.
               "Do not interrupt me," he went on, as I begged him not to excite himself by
                  unprofitable memories; "I have begun to empty my surcharged brain—let me proceed.
                  What is a day more or less?" he bitterly exclaimed. Then, apparently reverting to
                  his former feelings, he said—" It is everything in a battle for life—a change
                  might take place in this melting lung, and with my nerve force I might live for
                  months, perhaps for years. Could it not be, doctor? I feel less pain, and am
                  strengthened by your remedies. Try it, sir, and by heaven I'll aid you by every
                  effort of obedience. I am young yet. I must not die-I will not
                  die!"
               The last few words were uttered so vehemently, and were so expressive of the
                  mingled despair and hope that rioted through his brain, that I felt deeply pained
                  as I answered him. For a while he seemed more exhausted than I had yet seen him. I
                  wished him to lie down; but, motioning me to be quiet, he pointed to his draught.
                  In a few minutes after taking it, he went on in a more quiet voice—
               "By my father's will, I inherited a fortune. The income was far beyond my wants. The usual course of study
                  was pursued by me—pleasure was ready to greet me at every step; but, alas! the
                  dread of that fate—the fate of the consumptive—haunted me everywhere. Nothing was
                  enjoyed to its full—I dreaded excess in all things. As I before said, I became
                  acquainted with the disease in its every shape. I searched in hospital and
                  prison—midst rich and poor, and in every climate, to gain a personal knowledge of
                  it. It became, I fear, a monomania. At last the
                  reality settled itself within me—not with cough or pain, but with a certain
                  sensation after expiration, as though a portion of breath still oozed from the
                  lung. Then the pulsation of my heart became sensible to me, and as I laid my head
                  on my pillow, I could scarcely sleep for the rustling beat that entered my ear. In
                  vain I tried not to hear it—to laugh at my conceit—the sound was ever there; and I
                  then observed there was a preference to lie on one side to the other. Sometimes I
                  would be aroused from my sleep by a choking catching of the breath, with my heart
                  beating violently, but soon subsiding, and leaving for a minute or two a stifling
                  sensation in my chest, as though the lungs would burst if I breathed hard. These
                  attacks were not frequent, generally ended with a slight moisture starting over
                  me, and perhaps I would sleep on calmly, but unrefreshed on waking. I did not dare
                  to mention it—not even to my mother; it might pass over, and why make her
                  miserable? Yet at times I would find her eye resting anxiously on me, and as
                  quickly withdrawn if I met her gaze.
               "During one of my excursions I met with one so pure, so gentle, and beautiful,
                  that life assumed a new interest. Self for a time was forgotten—I existed in her
                  being. Again my step was buoyant, my spirits almost seemed joyous, whilst my
                  mother's eye grew bright again, My every sense was filled—I was a man again.
               "One day, Juliette and myself were enjoying a sail in a small pleasure-boat, when
                  of a sudden the wind changed, and ere we could return a cold drizzling rain set
                  in. I took off my coat, and insisted on placing it over her shoulders, whilst I by
                  rowing could keep myself warm. I was drenched through, but felt happy and gay as
                  she was by my side. That night I awoke with a sharp pain in my chest, and was
                  burning with fever. For awhile the perspiration streamed off me in the agony of my
                  re-awakened forebodings; but it soon dried up, and my skin again became parched,
                  whilst every breath was painful. Inflammation of the lungs had attacked me. In a
                  fortnight I was greatly relieved. My flesh had wasted, and my countenance told the
                  commotion of my mind. The heart again sounded in my ear as I lay on my pillow.
               "Then came upon me the bitterest self-reproaches. I would not, I could not marry
                  the being I so tenderly loved. My manner became preoccupied when near her, and at
                  length I was morbidly sensitive even to her name; not that I loved her less—for
                  God knows that my heart was wrapped in her. No, no; I could not make her the
                  mother of children doomed to die by an inheritance! I spoke of friendship to her;
                  yes, friendship, when I was a self-immolated sacrifice to my love! We parted. Her
                  young heart seemed crushed. I could not explain my fearful apprehensions. She
                  thought me insincere—my God, when I suffered equally! See, here is a copy of a
                  note I addressed to her containing a ring:—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "'DEAR JULIETTE,
                           
                           "'In the olden time, when the romance of life was in its evergreen,
                              and reality clothed with chivalric vestment, a ring was
                              held sacred. It told by its circlet, how the beginning and end should
                              be alike one—a symbol of unity, foreshadowing golden
                              days. It became a rich legacy of maternal affection and paternal
                              pride—the talisman of kingly power —a token of knightly pledge—and the
                              gift of one fond heart to another. Within its magic circle flowed the
                              warm blood of maidenly faith, whilst upon it sat the brightness of
                              man's unsullied troth. In later days, man's occupation changed from
                              the poetry of life to its necessities, and commoner feelings grew rank
                              in the garden of the heart—the ring no longer was sacred to memory,
                              but became an ornament of vanity—a merchandise alike for king and
                              peasant, and a worthless exchange of an idle fancy. But between us,
                              dear Juliette, let it be redeemed from its sunken state. Wear it ever
                              without change, till change take place—let it be the
                              silent token of my constant thought and unswerving love. As in the
                              olden time, let it be emblematic of one-ness. When colder
                              feeling usurps the seat of affection, wear it not, but return it, that
                              it too may teach how the happiness of other days has passed away-the
                              something real of a bright vision faded for ever.
                           
                              "'GEORGE ——.'
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "Time passed on. Regret was now added to dread. My frame soon told the tale of my
                  agony. The night air now distressed me, and a cough, at first dry and irritative,
                  never left me. The pulse, at first irregular, at last became regularly
                  quickened—flashing heat and chilly tremor vied with, each other. I only
                     appeared when my cheek was flushed! One day my mother took my hand—the
                  palm was hot like fire—she pressed it to her eyes, and bathed it silently with,
                  her tears. Then commenced the dewy sweats, and exhausted mornings, with capricious
                  appetite. My clothes were now too large over my chest. Day by day I gradually
                  wasted, and my breath grew short on slight exertion. One evening something salt
                  welled up into my throat, and, with a slight cough, bright blood fell upon the
                  cloth before me. I rose, locked my door, and bled alone! Not even my
                  mother discovered it. I was paler, but I said I had not slept well.
               "For a time the loss of blood gave me relief; but soon the languor increased; my
                  flesh wasted, and the pulse hurried on, but with less strength. Then the chills
                  became more severe, though the fever lasted not so long; but the horrid sweats
                  increased. I do not think the oppression was now so great, although my breath was
                  shorter—life and lung were accommodating each other! but the pain in my shoulder
                  became greater—I called it rheumatism! To my surprise, I became more
                  cheerful-hope seemed to hold out a saving hand. I began to think there was a limit
                  to my disease. But this lasted not long. My cheek burned with a deeper red,
                  although my blood grew daily paler. Too well I knew that life's load was
                  lightening; yet my will struggled against conviction.
               "Now, doctor, you have my history. I am arrested here on my way to Juliette's
                  home. I have written to her, to say that I will soon be with her, and that all
                  shall be explained. Will she doubt me, when she sees the wreck that regret and
                  disease have left? Will she refuse her forgiveness when the dreadful secret is
                  disclosed?"
               He ceased speaking, and appeared much fatigued. Still was he calculating on time
                  and strength, when it was impossible that two more days would be his I Besides,
                  the morrow promised to be a day of storm; heavy clouds obscured the heavens, the
                  wind was very high, and rain would soon fall in torrents. A little fire was made
                  in the hearth, as the night grew more inclement. The sofa was drawn up; and in a
                  few minutes he fell asleep. He slept almost like a child, so easy were his
                  breathings, although short.
               The fire-light alone brightened the chamber, whilst the storm without appeared
                  fast increasing. But the inmates of the hotel eared not for the night; sounds of
                  music occasionally struck my ear, as I half-dozed by the side of the sick man.
                  Surely, a great hotel is a heartless place; it hath none of the sanctity of home
                  life!
               
               The rain pelted the jarring window frames—the storm whistled, and died moaning
                  away. The sick man seemed happy—the changing sounds lulled him to sleep. A smile
                  played over his mouth. Were the angels whispering to him as in childhood they do?
                  His thin white hand gently raised, and his arm motioned as though embracing some
                  one, and "Juliette, loved one," breathed from his lips. A peal of thunder, like
                  the roar of artillery, shook the house. With a faint cry he awoke. Fright was
                  depicted in every feature.
               "Ah, heaven! is that you, doctor? Then it is not real."
               I took the poor sufferer's hand, as he laid his head upon my shoulder. The once
                  proud strong man sobbed—his heart seemed broken.
               "Dreams are only mine," he at length said. "I stood with her at the altar—my arm
                  was around her waist, and the first pure kiss seemed lingering on my lips—when of
                  a sudden the earth rent open, and I was left alone, struggling in a sea of blood!
                  I feel it here," he continued, placing his hand over his heaving breast; it is of
                  no use, I must die—die, unblessed and unheard."
               For a while I thought the end was nigh come. How the cold sweat poured from his
                  broad forehead! Scarce a breath he drew, unless convulsive gaspings could be so
                  called. The fire-light was nearly out—the stump-ends of the logs welled and sang
                  like a death bell. I felt very weak—the storm alone seemed' strong, as with
                  plashing rain and fierce blast it howled on. I could not leave him. He lay half
                  off the sofa, drooping and panting on my chest. The firelight grew less and less.
                  I called aloud to some one passing the door; but he heard it not, and went,
                  humming a merry tune, by! Then came over me that bitterness of heart, so often the
                  companion of our professional life. I mentally cursed the gay man, and thought how
                  close, hand
                  
                     Call me George. Have you not been a brother to me?—to me, a perfect
                        stranger, whose wayward and rebellious feelings have caused nothing but
                        trouble and pain to you. Call me George. No mother is here to call me thus.
                        You have been all to me."—PAGE 283.
                   to hand, sported life near death. God help the traveller who sickens in
                  these great gatherings of men I At length he rallied, and placing him upon his
                  cushions, I gave him a restorative—lamp-light never seemed more like a friend.
               Pointing to me to be seated, he said in a half whisper—"Doctor, how long can this
                  last? Tell me—I must know." I was glad at the question, for there might be many
                  things yet to be done by him; and friends drink eagerly the happenings of the
                  closing scene—a message—a mere "God's blessing," are deeply prized, when breathed
                  by the loved dying. Have we not all felt it? But a sad task it is to allot the
                  hour of death to the yet young.
               "My dear friend," I answered, "if you have anything to prepare—any writings, or
                  message, or peace to make—it should be soon done; for I fear by this time
                  to-morrow the burthen will have been laid down."
               "So soon," he cried, starting up; "it cannot be—it must not be. I
                  will live—I cannot give it up yet."
               I begged him to quiet himself, and to attend to what he could before he slept.
               "Sleep—sleep! my God! what, sleep, when my very soul is awake? What, with every
                  hour numbered, to waste a single one on sleep, when the body's want has ceased?
                  No, no; no more sleep for me. Hush, waste not words; my will is as strong as ever,
                  though the muscles have weakened. It is the hour I have so long dreaded—so fought
                  against; and yet I must most miserably perish, robbed of heart blood, with scarce
                  a fragment left uncontaminated within my chest."
               He shuddered; his old feelings were again rioting within. By degrees he became
                  calm, and as I commenced, he seized my hand, pressed it fervently, and interrupted
                  me.
               "Call me George. Have you not been a brother to me?—to me, a perfect stranger,
                  whose wayward and rebellious feelings have caused nothing but trouble and pain to
                     you. Call me George. No mother is
                  here to call me thus. You have been all to me."
               I told him that all physicians did daily do as I had done.
               "Yes," he exclaimed, "their mission is a high one—yet so little prized, how little
                  even thought of! Even I did not appreciate their mighty value, till now, when too
                  late to do aught but thank and God bless them—to ask forgiveness—when often I have
                  passed them by, as though belonging to the common herd of men, ignorant of their
                  sacrifices, their unseen humanity, and their Christianizing heart-influences! But,
                  doctor, my poor mother will cherish you—her prayers will mingle your name with
                  mine. She will never cease to remember the death-friend of her only child. When I
                  am gone, doctor, tell her how dear she was to me—tell her how the cradle has never
                  left, my heart, with her soft lullaby and mother-prayer—that now, even now, when
                  the damps of death chill my wasted blood, my heart still feels warmed by the
                  strong memory of her affection for her darling boy. Will you promise?"
               I did so through my tears. For a while he seemed communing with himself—the
                  expression of his countenance was sacred.
               "Summon my servant," he suddenly exclaimed, "and bid him take horse, and ride like
                  the wind to B—. Let him tell her, Juliette, to come quick to me, that all may yet
                  be explained—for my sake.
               He was overcome, and panted like a sheep.
               "Now, doctor, fan the flame; let it not go out till I have seen her by my side;
                  and then, world's care will be over."
               He slumbered heavily during the night—the storm had abated, and his servant had
                  left regardless of the weather.
               The morning broke bright as Hope itself—the early bud and blossoms were weeping
                  dewy tears of light. Here and there some torn-off branch, with scattered
                  flower-leaves, lay on the earth, soon to be crushed and withered, whilst others
                  grew happily on. Such is life!
               George was evidently weaker than the night before, but he was composed. He
                  constantly looked at his watch. His whole aim seemed in trying to be prepared for
                  the expected arrival. Twelve o'clock passed, and he was very languid. I began to
                  fear he could not last till the meeting. He avoided taking the stimulants as
                  frequently as before; he was nursing for his last trial. The sun was nigh set,
                  when suddenly he cried, "She comes—she comes!" I listened, but could discover no
                  sound. His ear was more acute, for in a minute the roll of a carriage rapidly
                  driven broke on my ear. "Quick," he cried, leaning on his elbow, "give me the
                  drink—more;" and he drank double the usual allowance. I went into the passage—the
                  servant was rapidly escorting a young lady. Putting out my hand silently I led her
                  into the chamber, followed by her father.
               With out-stretched arms the dying mart half raised from the sofa, as his loved one
                  sank amidst an agony of his sobs into his embrace. No one moved for some time. Our
                  tears
               flowed like rain. At length, gently raising her from his breast, we placed her by
                  his side. Her silken hair fell over his pillow, as she bent her ear to catch his
                  voice. I had never before seen such beauty. Alas! for heart-canker!
               "Can you now forgive me, dear Juliette?" he faintly asked. "Do you not read the
                  fatal secret that dashed the cup of joy from our lips? Was this wretched body a
                  fit mate for thine?"
               "Oh, speak not thus to me, George. It was not the body I loved—thy spirit mated
                  mine. See, upon this hand I have ever worn the ring; am I not thy
                  spirit-bride?"
               "Oh, Juliette," said the now happy man, "you are more than bride to me!—thou art knowledge!—since thee I
                  began to learn a future life!"
               "Did you, dear George?' she said—"could you believe that within us, which rides
                  from earth heavenward upon thought, could partake of the perishable nature of
                  matter, which, ever changing, teaches destructibleness? Matter belongeth to
                  earth—spirit hath but one affinity, and that is for its Maker, to whom, it may
                  render the account of its working whilst in the prison-house of the flesh!"
               A bright glow centered on the wan cheek of her listener—the fervor of received
                  truth beamed from his eyes!
               "Speak to me, Juliette—speak thus again," he gasped out. "The ills of my manhood
                  are passing away. I feel chasing through every fibre of my brain the bright
                  intelligence so lately learned. It must be true. God's will be done! Oh, let me
                  feel your hands, so full of human warmth—fresh from the hearth of your pure heart.
                  Oh, how different from other heat! Tell me, doctor, how far cold am I?"
               He stretched out his arm towards me. He was like ice to the elbow.
               "I know—I know—Death's frosts are stealing over me; yet I feel your warm hands,
                  Juliette, and your breath seems genial to my cold cheek. More drink. My sight
                  loses you, dearest. It is of no use—I fail—I die. Bless—mother—Juliette." All was
                  over.
               Again it is May—the churchyard is green again. Two tombs lie together. One seems
                  but freshly made, for the grass is trodden down by its side, and a few withered
                  blossoms, like those full blooming over the other, lie scattered around. On this
                  new tomb is inscribed, "Juliette."
            
            
               REVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF FORT LEE.
               IT has been said of the American, and we fear with too much truth, that he has
                  little attachment to his native place. The allurements of wealth and the love of
                  change seem to engulf so much his attention, that he appears to reverence scarcely
                  even that spot of earth that may be hallowed by the most tender associations.
                  Without attempting to defend our countrymen, or to eulogize their enterprise or
                  their bravery, we propose simply to contribute a few facts in relation to this
                  beautiful and romantic suburb, with which we have been made familiar since our
                  infancy, by those who Were personally engaged in them during the exciting period
                  of the Revolution. The spot is associated with the memory of a being we most
                  revered on earth—one to whose lips falsehood was unknown. We shall, however,
                  commence twenty-five years anterior to that period, in order to trace its earlier
                  history.
               The site of Fort Lee is not generally known to those who visit the place on
                  excursions. Many suppose it to have been situated directly on the river, on the
                  table-land upheld by the Palisades, as that glorious and stupendous bulwark of
                  vertical rock is called that stretches some thirty miles up the noble Hudson. This
                  is an error. There were two large cannon stationed there, upon a raised platform
                  of earth, which is now distinctly visible in its outline, some three hundred feet
                  from the Bluff, as the first great rock is called, that caps the ascent
                  immediately behind the hotel. There was
                  also a small fort there called Port Constitution, mounting three or four guns.
                  These cannon were placed there to annoy the shipping, and to prevent them from
                  ascending the river—the prospective importance of which, as a channel of
                  communication with West Point and the Canadas, General Washington could not fail
                  to perceive. A chevaux de frise, of considerable
                  strength, had been constructed of chains, and sunken posts, and timber, for the
                  purpose of obstructing the navigation; and this extended across the river from the
                  shore directly beneath the batteries, to that in front of Fort Washington, on the
                  other, or city side of the river. There were likewise two cannon a couple of miles
                  further up the river. These defences were erected some time before Fort Lee.
               The prophetic eye of "Washington, after the victory of the English on Long Island,
                  seeing that the war could only be continued, with such miserable military stores
                  and appointments as we possessed, by alternately retreating and fighting the
                  enemy, selected the first great natural position for a fort that offered on the
                  Jersey side. Brigadier-General Mercer was accordingly directed to occupy the
                  position of Fort Lee, with the militia and such troops as could be gathered. It
                  was named after General Lee, then in command of a detachment of the army. Fort Lee
                  was commenced on the 12th of September, 1776, and was situated on the western side
                  of the road that leads up the hill from the steamboat landing, about three hundred
                  feet behind the Palisade rocks which skirt the river. Its southern bastion is
                  situated directly behind the Episcopal Church. It was about a quarter of an acre
                  in extent, and was surrounded by an embankment, still traceable, though nearly
                  obliterated by the plough.
               Some four hundred acres—comprising the sites of these two forts and the whole of
                  the village proper, now above and below them, together with the landing and the
                  hill on which the hotel stands—were purchased, about twenty years before the
                  Revolution, by Stephen Bourdette, who, in connection with William Bayard, had
                  received from the King a grant of a large tract of land, comprising Weehawken and
                  Hoboken. The house is still standing at Weehawken Hill, in which he lived. He was
                  the great-uncle of the writer. He purchased the land at Fort Lee from an old slave
                  who had been made a free man by his master, and lived in solitude by fishing and
                  trapping the animals that abounded in the vast forest about that place.
               The father of Stephen, Etienne Bourdette, was the son of a French gentleman who
                  had left his native country many years before the Edict of Nantes caused the
                  exodus of the Huguenots, and settled in one of the West India islands as a
                  planter; thus early, showing the indomitable family hatred of religious tyranny,
                  that cannot permit other men to be their conscience-keepers. Etienne had been sent
                  to New York by his father, to obtain an education, about eighty years before the
                  war, or one hundred and sixty years ago.
               Stephen Bourdette, finding that the habits of his father, whose wife was then
                  dead, and himself of a contemplative and religious character, led him to make
                  constant excursions from the city (where he lived in Pine street, and cultivated
                  land) to the beautiful region of which we write—purchased the entire place, and
                  erected a spacious stone house for him, directly in front of the old farm-house,
                  now standing on the left of the brook which skirts the road, on the west end of
                  the house now occupied by Robert Annette, proprietor of the hotel and landing.
                  This exceedingly valuable and commanding situation, we may here remark as an
                  illustration of the primitive habits of those days, was given to an old man for
                  constructing a few hundred yards of wall, to hold up the old road leading from Mr.
                  Bourdette's house to the cow-pasture on the top of the hill. It is now richly
                     worth $100,000, and comprises the
                  entire water front of the village.
               The stone house occupied by Etienne Bourdette, was the only one then standing on
                  the place, and for nearly a mile north and south of it. It was the head-quarters
                  of Washington; and after the death of Etienne, was left to his son Peter, and his
                  wife, who had been living at Hackensack, and came to take charge of their father
                  in his extreme old age; he died there, aged eighty years. Peter Bourdette, with
                  his excellent wife, a woman gifted with" a noble soul and a most energetic and
                  commanding character, came to the place about fifteen years before the war, and
                  soon made it the abode of great comfort and hospitality. There the miserable and
                  the afflicted always found a comforter, and were never turned empty away. There
                  was no end to the requirements of hospitality, as such a thing as a hotel was
                  unknown until within the memory of the writer. The social and gentlemanly farmer
                  rarely visited the city, and delighted in learning the current news from the
                  wayfarer. It was the custom of those days, for the farmer to have around him a
                  number of slaves, and the master was always at leisure for a friendly chat.
                  Although wild and mountainous, the land was very productive, and there was always
                  abundance of food for the hungry man and his horse. If a gentleman, he was invited
                  to the table; if not, the kitchen was ample, and the servants as fond of news as
                  their master.
               Some idea may be formed of the wildness of the place, a hundred years ago, from
                  the necessity of inclosing the sheep at night, in order to keep them from being
                  devoured by the wolves. The mother of the writer, long after the Revolution, was
                  standing with a sister in the garden, when a great bear came down from the forest
                  on the hill, and scrambling on a cake of ice, was shot some few miles from the
                  north of the city. The carcass was sold in Washington Market, which was often
                  called by the country people, from that circumstance, the "Bear Market." The same
                  sister now living reported the discovery of a large wildcat, as she returned from
                  picking berries. It was shot by a brother the same day, and found to be a very
                  fierce creature. The rattle-snake abounded. The writer met with one a few years
                  since, that was killed and preserved shortly after the Revolution. Foxes were a
                  great pest, and were hunted and trapped to some profit by the negroes.
               It may be supposed, that very few social and educational opportunities were
                  offered Ito the family of the farmer of such a wild region as existed ten miles
                  from the city of New York a hundred years ago. Indeed there was not visible; but
                  boats and horses were plenty, and there we lithe limbs and strong arms to govern
                  them. Both boys and girls owned their horses, and a ride over the hills of ten
                  miles was a trifle to a revolutionary mother; or an early breakfast in New York,
                  after-a row in a little eggshell, starting before day-break over the waters of
                  that noble river, waiting like a beautiful bride or a young mother, bear her
                  children on her ample bosom to some dead old familiar face in the city. We have
                  before us, at this moment, the richly clasped and griffin-footed little walnut
                  chest, that a great-aunt, who reached her eightieth year, served the tea from. It
                  contained a compartment for tea, and by its side the old and quaint little silver
                  spoons. They were the gift of a lover.
               The sister of this lady, the great-grandmother of the writer, was a devout
                  Episcopalian, and illuminated with her pencil with which she was skillful, a
                  panel, with some scriptural device, over the clergyman's pew in the old Church du
                  St. Esprit, which still stood, as well as the old family mansion within the memory
                  of the writer, in Pine street. The great-grandfather on the maternal grandmother's
                  side—a Hollander—left his farm, where Hanover square now is, to reside at
                  Hackensack, in New Jersey; and it was to visit the relatives who remained in the city that the
                  excursions from Fort Lee were made.
               A few curious books in natural history and botany, which were gathered up after
                  the plundering of the old house at Fort Lee, still remain, and attest the
                  intellectual habits and taste that governed Etienne in the choice of his abode. He
                  was eminently religious. When the lightning would paint its notes upon the thunder
                  cloud, and the storm-anthem would throw the grand diapason upon the ear, as it
                  reverberated from the rocky organ of the Palisades—when the last notes would
                  rumble away in the distance of the noble river—the old man would bare his aged
                  head, and walk forth in the midst of the storm. The mother of the writer, who
                  would attempt to detain him, always received the reply: "Be still, my child, and
                  listen to the voice of God!" The rock has often been pointed out to me on which he
                  would sit; and when the hollow murmur of the thunder could be faintly heard in the
                  distance, a fine old sonorous voice might be heard, sometimes in French, but
                  oftener in English, chanting the Episcopal service: "We praise Thee, O God!" The
                  man of fourscore years, the son and the grandson of ninety-four and ninety-five,
                  and she from whose lips—but lately closed, and to whom we owe life—we write, of
                  eighty-five, owed that early life-force that led them so far beyond the allotted
                  years of man, to the pure atmosphere of this romantic spot; and two of the last
                  generation, of sixty and seventy, still look upon the rising sun near the spot
                  where they first saw its light. A hundred years has been attained by a neighbor,
                  and eighty and ninety are frequent amongst the inhabitants. The toils of city
                  life, and the cunning devices of man to cut short its brittle thread, will not
                  permit many of their descendants to reach so distant a goal.
               But the son had his trials. Etienne, the father, died several years before the
                  war, and the place was given by the senior brother, who resided at Weehawken, and
                  was always called by the English of the paternal name, i. e., Stephen, to his
                  brother Peter, the grandfather of the, writer. He, with his eldest son (also
                  Peter), his excellent wife, Rachel Bush, arid the mother of the writer, then seven
                  years of age, and three other children, passed through the stormy period of the
                  Revolution at their lovely mountain home.
               One day, early in November of 1776, with some of the younger children, my mother
                  was summoned unexpectedly from school, in the English Neighborhood, as that large
                  and beautiful "portion of farming country which lies between Fort Lee and
                  Hackensack is called; and as she came in sight of the winding road that leads down
                  the mountain to the river and the old farmhouse, hundreds of tents appeared on the
                  high ground that commands the river. General Washington had issued his orders to
                  General Mercer to summon all the available troops and erect a fort there, as early
                  as the 6th of September, so as to command the river, in case Colonel Magaw should
                  be obliged to retreat, and cross with the army from Fort Washington, then
                  threatened by the British General Howe, Sir Henry Clinton, and Gen. Kniphausen,
                  whose designs on that place were now palpable.
               Fort Lee was also intended as a depot for troops, in case a reinforcement should
                  be necessary for the defence of that fort; but how they were to be transported the
                  writer could never understand, as there were no flat-boats, and the river is
                  nearly two miles across, forbidding the use of floats. This post must have been
                  first occupied between the 1st and 10th of November; for the troops were there,
                  and it was the 13th, when the illustrious Father of our Country first appeared at
                  the old farm-house. It was a period of great gloom to our country; for our means
                  of payment prevented anything like permanent enlistment, and Washington was sadly disappointed at the impossibility
                  of obstructing the river by chevaux de frise. As
                  early as October 6th, three British vessels had passed the fort, receiving but
                  little damage from the batteries on the heights; and it was evident that
                  reinforcements of men for the British army could not be prevented passing up the
                  river; and thus the army at Fort Washington, under the brave Magaw, with all their
                  munitions, could be more easily cut off by greatly superior numbers.
               Washington was the object of childish adoration by my mother, and her brother, a
                  youth of sixteen, was a great favorite. On more than one occasion, he rowed to the
                  city at midnight, and brought papers and intelligence of the anticipated movements
                  of the army who threatened Fort Washington. The illustrious chief would retire to
                  his room, and after perusing the papers, he would walk up to the fort, and
                  inspect, through his glass, the movements at Fort Washington, on the city side of
                  the river. The site of that fort our readers will recognize by the flag-staff
                  directly behind the great telegraph masts, where the wires cross the river. It is
                  about eleven miles from the City Hall, and on the highest ground visible.
               One night, when my brave uncle was approaching the shore, after one of his night
                  visits to the city to get the news for the General, and to convey some provisions
                  to her poor friends from his excellent mother, who never forgot the needy, the
                  wind prevented his signal from being heard by the sentinels who guarded the shore,
                  and supposing an enemy to be approaching, a rifle ball cut his oar in two pieces,
                  As he had but one left, he managed his boat with it as well as he could, and
                  landed, at great risk of being shot, about a mile down the river, and made his way
                  home on foot. On this occasion, the chief stood by while his mother ripped up the
                  lining of his great coat, and receiving the papers, complimented him warmly for
                  his bravery. So attached was he to Washington, that he was continually importuning
                  his mother to permit him to receive an appointment near the beloved chief; but she
                  pointed to my mother and her still younger children, and asked him who would
                  protect them if his father was shot, for his republicanism rendered him a marked
                  man, and her sagacity assured her that in the event of the evacuation of Fort Lee,
                  their situation between the two armies would be almost desperate.
               As it proved entirely impossible to prevent the English from ascending the river
                  by chevaux de frise, and as they had landed in
                  full force on the Sound, it was very evident that they had the means of speedily
                  cutting off all communication with the city and the country north of the creek,
                  which, with Harlem river, bound, the island of New York on its northern side. This
                  creek on the Hudson is situated about three miles north of Fort Washington, then
                  commanded by the brave Col. Magaw. This post it was resolved to hold at all
                  hazards. Congress passed a resolution on the 11th of October, to incur any
                  possible expense to obstruct the river; and as Fort Washington and the batteries
                  of the Palisades were to aid this plan in. its most essential and destructive
                  features, there was a prospect of stirring times about the old house.
               The "Fort Field," as the grandchildren always called it since the war, was divided
                  into streets, called after the most noted streets of the city. Broadway, Pearl
                  street, &c., were chalked on pieces of bark, and tacked to posts. The streets
                  were made by lines of tents, and many of the soldiers had constructed huts of
                  stone, with fire-places, and doors opening to the south. Within the circuit of one
                  of these, but four years since, we assembled a large family party—my mother giving
                  us, with great spirit, and a perfect recollection, many incidents of the war. We
                  drank from a well, now inclosed and quite perfect, which had been constructed by
                  the soldiers, and looked out from our rocky seats under a beautiful pine tree, over the
                  glorious river, as it stretches away in its glistening course to the ocean. One of
                  the huts, of unusual dimensions, fronting south, was devoted to the use of General
                  Greene, and near it the great Chief met in council with the officers, when it was
                  concluded to evacuate the fort.
               Here had been the slaughter-house, there, the powder-house, and here, the
                  commissary's tent.
               On October 28th, the battle of White Plains took place, which was so nearly equal
                  in its results as to give our countrymen some encouragement; but our miserable
                  appliances, and the determination of Gen. Howe to possess the command of the whole
                  of New York Island, induced him to approach Fort Washington. He directed Gen.
                  Kniphausen to cross the creek, and occupy the north-western end of the island,
                  between Port Washington and King's Bridge. Gen. Howe soon joined him, and
                  Washington saw that Fort Washington would be the immediate object of attack.
               As Gen. Howe approached King's Bridge to cross the creek, three ships of war again
                  passed up the river, notwithstanding the chevaux de
                     fries and firing batteries. This was answered from the ships, and a
                  ball cut off the tops of several trees just beyond the house, and ploughed up a
                  considerable space in the road. It moved the hearty mirth of a favorite black
                  servant, who was ascending the hill, and she shouted out at each fire, in great
                  glee, "At 'em again, blue jacket!" (alluding to the dress of our soldiers) and it
                  was long a by-word amongst the black servants of the family. Gen. Washington now
                  took measures to aid Magaw, in the event of attack,, by transporting troops across
                  the river; though I could never learn that there were any boats of consequence
                  there, or any means of constructing them.
               Such was the force with which the British were assembled under Kniphausen, on the
                  north, who had five thousand men, besides an unknown number south, under Lords
                  Cornwallis and Percy, and Lieut. Stirling, that Washington sent discretionary
                  orders to General Greene to direct Magaw to evacuate the fort and cross the river,
                  should he judge it expedient; but the brave Magaw was high in spirits with his two
                  thousand, all told, against at least ten! On the 13th, General Howe summoned him
                  to surrender. General Washington was then at Hackensack, and he immediately
                  returned, and late at night was crossing the river, my brave uncle delighted with
                  an oar, to give Magaw the necessary instructions, when they met Generals Putnam
                  and Greene, who were returning from a visit to that post, in order to make
                  arrangements for reinforcement, if necessary.
               The British General resolved upon carrying the place by storm. The event is matter
                  of history, though few know how awful a carnage occurred within ten miles of the
                  spot where we write. The brave Col. Rawlings left six hundred of the enemy dead on
                  the north side of the fort alone, and there were two hundred slain on the southern
                  and eastern approaches to the fort. The accounts give little satisfaction, as it
                  regards the loss of the Americans, though it could not have been at the utmost
                  over three hundred, as there were but two thousand regular troops in the fort, and
                  the prisoners were stated by Gen. Howe at two thousand six hundred—a discrepancy
                  which must have originated in estimating those only who were regular enlisted,
                  without volunteers or recruits Irregularly obtained.
               My uncle, who was on the ground after the battle, informed me that dozens of men
                  lay dead, their bodies in heaps, so close was the attack on the northern side,
                  under Rawlings. But this was the precipitous part. On the other sides, the ascent
                  is but slight, and the overwhelming numbers and perfect military equipments of the
                  enemy, will account for the victory.
               
               When the attack was at the highest, General Washington sent a boat over to request Magaw, if possible, to
                  hold out till night, when he would send a reinforcement. He remained with my uncle
                  on the Palisade rocks skirting the river, inspecting the movements of the
                  belligerents; and when the flag was struck, handing his glass to his young
                  companion, with looks of greatest dejection, he exclaimed: "Look, my boy, look!
                  All is over. Alas! my poor country!" Descending the heights, Gen. Washington made
                  immediate arrangements to evacuate Fort Lee, which was by no means as strong as
                  Fort Washington, and the General saw the British would immediately invest it.
               Accordingly, Cornwallis, with six thousand men, crossed at Dobb's Ferry for that
                  purpose, and advanced by a forced march. It would have been madness to attempt to
                  fight such a force; therefore the garrison moved off on the 18th of November,
                  compelled to abandon their cannon, tents, and military stores. The impossibility
                  of obtaining wagons was the cause of this sacrifice.
               My grandmother and the children were obliged to flee to the English Neighborhood,
                  two miles off, so as to escape the immediate consequences of the free plunder that
                  they knew was to come—my grandfather and his son remaining, to collect, if
                  possible, any property that might be spared.
               What valuables and money they possessed were buried, and they soon had occasion to
                  summon all their fortitude. Some thousands of Hessians and mercenary soldiers
                  devastated the place. A perfect saturnalia now commenced. A barrel of whiskey and
                  another of sugar were rolled out of the cellar, and thrown into a rain-water cask
                  standing at one corner of the house, in the court-yard. My good grand mother's
                  dairy-room yielded its aid, and a puncheon of milk punch was made, and stirred
                  with a rail. My grandfather begged a British officer to try and preserve at least
                  a single pail of milk for his children's evening meal. Overcome with sympathy at
                  the nature of the request, he was too much excited to carry out his benevolent
                  intentions judiciously. Approaching a Hessian soldier, who was coming up the
                  cellar steps with a flat vessel of milk (called a "keeler" in dairy phrase) on his
                  head, he struck him slightly on the back with the flat side of his sword. The
                  cowardly creature jumped aside at his officer's frown, the bottom of the old
                  vessel broke, and he became in a moment a personification of plenty-literally
                  flowing with milk. There was a shout of laughter, in which my grandfather was too
                  much of a Frenchman not to join.
               When the punch was prepared, my grandfather was impudently requested to drink the
                  King's health, by those wretched creatures, the Hessian soldiers. They were using
                  their shoes by way of drinking-cups! Several British officers were present, and it
                  is but doing them justice to say that they seemed to sympathize with the
                  inhabitants. One of them immediately stepped, up to my grandfather, and advised
                  him to go through with the formality only, as the soldiers continued loudly to
                  call for him. There were hundreds of soldiers present. He said he feared it would
                  be the cause of personal danger to him, if he refused; but he had stern Huguenot
                  blood in him, and replied that if he drank at all, he would say what he pleased.
                  They immediately made way for him to approach the puncheon; and the officers, who
                  well knew his boldness, surrounded him completely. Uncovering his head, and
                  dipping his hand into the liquor, which he only pretended to drink, he bowed to
                  the name he was about to utter, rather than to the officers, and exclaimed in his
                  clearest tones, throwing a Frenchman's kiss over the mountain where he had that
                  morning taken leave of his beloved and great friend, "The health of General
                  Washington! Confusion to King George, and destruction to his hireling Hessians!"
                  It was well for him that the officers were attached to him, or he would have been cut to pieces by the infuriated
                  soldiers. Why he was not killed by some of them when their officers were absent,
                  is to me a wonder; for his fearless utterance was always exasperating.
               At the end of ten days, the British troops had evacuated the place, and were
                  proceeding towards Newark, under Cornwallis. Washington had crossed the Passaic,
                  on his way to New Brunswick; and my grandfather and his son went in pursuit of the
                  family, to bring them back to their ruined household. My mother and the other
                  children were brought over, and they were about being sent supperless to such beds
                  as could be prepared for them out of the torn fragments, which the infuriated
                  soldiery had not entirely destroyed, when my good grandmother appeared, coming
                  down the hill on an old wood sled, drawn by a beautiful horse, the only living
                  animal they now possessed, driven by a black man. All the cattle and other horses
                  were of course carried off by the British troops; and she had herself driven over
                  this horse to the English Neighborhood, when the family fled from the old house,
                  with a bag of flour and a few pounds of butter, and secreted him in the cellar of
                  an old deserted house I have often seen. Here he remained for three days, without
                  food or drink, and would have died but for the kindness of a British officer, who
                  was attached to my grandfather, and to whom she communicated the hiding-place of
                  her beautiful pet. He kindly went over, and fed him and gave him drink, during
                  those three days, when the British had extended themselves from Port Lee, and were
                  foraging the southern portion" of the English Neighborhood, where she, of course,
                  could not venture to go.
               Hearing their mother below stairs, the children were clamorous for food; for they
                  had not eaten since morning. The poor little creatures were fain to content
                  themselves with a raw turnip till some cakes could be hastily made for them. The
                  wholesome milk and the pet cows—each one having its name and its owner—were all
                  gone; and had it not been for the providence of a mother who combined all the
                  affection of the woman with the firmness of a most determined man, they might have
                  well-nigh starved to death; for, as we have already said, there was no other house
                  near, and the people for miles were robbed of all their food and cattle.
               "Bless God for all his mercies! Here you are, and here are we all together; and
                  here is food, too," said this excellent woman to her husband. "I feared your
                  tongue would cost you your life." She little knew how nearly true her
                  anticipations had proved.
               My mother, who was but seven years of age, and her sister, mounted the old sled,
                  and begged a turnip to appease their hunger. She had found her doll and her pet
                  cat near the wood-pile, and seated herself on a log, perfectly happy, eating her
                  turnip.
               "This is hard to bear," said my grandmother; "but God will yet prosper our cause,
                  if we follow the counsels of Washington."
               "Yes," said her husband; and they now know my sentiments," adding an expletive in
                  French, which his feelings will pardon.
               "What's that?" said she. "Some more imprudence, I dare say."
               A few days after, my uncle told her the story of the punch and the toast, to which
                  she jocosely replied, looking nevertheless proudly at her husband: "Pity it is
                  your father had not a little Dutch blood in him. These Frenchmen are always half
                  crazy. Thank God, my son, your father was not killed before your eyes!"
               The family were now in still greater danger than before, for they were entirely
                  unprotected, as the entire American army were west of the Hackensack, and what was
                     worse, the country was continually
                  ravaged by tories and robbers. What money and valuables they possessed were
                  buried, and my grandfather abstracted from time to time only enough to procure
                  bread for his family during the winter. It was useless to purchase many cattle,
                  for he could not be sure of preserving them over a single night. The family
                  managed to subsist during this hard winter; but it was necessary for my uncle to
                  visit the city, often at great risk of life, to procure food; and when I last saw
                  him, at ninety years of age, firm and erect, with the voice and will of a lion,
                  his immense features and grey hair adding great dignity to his appearance, I could
                  not but think that the sage was right when he said, "Difficulty is good for
                  man."
               An event occurred shortly after the evacuation of Fort Lee, which I have often
                  felt would have graced the page of history, although it never probably occurred to
                  its chief actor that it was worth recording; for he never seemed to think it of
                  much moment. Gen. Kniphausen continued in command of the fort and the division of
                  the army on the northern part of the island of New York. But a few days elapsed
                  after the family had returned, when they were alarmed by the rude midnight summons
                  of a British officer, followed by several soldiers, and a demand that my
                  grandfather should immediately cross the river to the fort. They were all
                  dreadfully alarmed; but the officer assured them he would be permitted to return
                  before day, as Gen. Kniphausen merely required some information, which would
                  insure his safe return. This was equal to an assurance that he would be sent to
                  one of the city prisons, as the family knew he would communicate nothing to the
                  enemy, and that he had greatly exasperated the Hessians by the toast, It had now
                  obtained general currency, and every one supposed him a doomed man. My uncle most
                  earnestly begged to be permitted to accompany his father, but was not allowed. He
                  was hurried off to the fort, none supposing they would again see him in weeks or
                  months, if ever. On his arrival at the fort, he was immediately introduced to Gen.
                  Kniphausen, who treated him very courteously, offering wine and refreshment. The,
                  General soon commenced the conversation by alluding to the trouble my grandfather
                  had already undergone, and made some remarks on the unequal nature of the contest.
                  My grandfather replied that when a whole nation were of one mind, and a country as
                  extensive as America, he could scarcely believe it possible to subjugate them
                  without years of sacrifice and expenditure. Gen. Kniphausen smiled, and asked if
                  the recent results showed much determination on the part of the Americans. My
                  grandfather had it on his tongue to refer him to Col. Rawlings and the northern
                  bastion of the fort, within the enclosure of which they were then sitting; but
                  prudence prevailed, and he was silent. Gen. Kniphausen was not a rude man, and
                  made no further effort to prolong the conversation; but drawing from his pocket a
                  heavy purse of gold, he threw it upon the table, and assured my grandfather that
                  he would be pleased to extend to his family, in his present dangerous position on
                  the lines, the aid and protection of a guard, and that he would be happy in return
                  to receive some necessary information about the future movements of the army; that
                  as Gen. (Washington had been his guest, he must possess more knowledge of the plan
                  of action than any other person; ending with the assurance that he would be
                  pleased to possess his personal friendship, and in return he would supply his more
                  immediate pecuniary necessities, pointing to the purse. My grandfather felt as
                  though every drop of blood in his body had mounted to his face. He immediately
                  arose, and walking towards the further entrance of the tent, replied: "Permit me,
                  Gen. Kniphausen, to draw this conversation to a close; and excuse me for the
                  remark, that if you insist upon its further continuance, I cannot but feel it will
                  be discreditable to both of us. I have
                  already been too long here; but what could a man, seized at midnight, surrounded
                  by a helpless family do, but yield to superior force? I am ready to accompany your
                  soldiers to your prison, for I suppose that is to be my fete?"
               "That is not the way, Mr. Bourdette," replied General Kniphausen. "I have no such
                  intention. But you are a bold man thus to trifle with your family. I will return
                  you to them for the present, but cannot always promise to be so lenient.
               "General Kniphausen," replied my grandfather, "it may save you and my helpless
                  family further trouble should the chance of war again bring Gen. Washington under
                  my roof, if I inform you that I am not advised of his intended movements. They
                  will doubtless be dictated by the emergencies brought about by your superior
                  numbers and appointments; but I trust in God for my poor country, they will result
                  in good. Good night, General. I am certainly indebted to you for your clemency,
                  and hope you will save yourself and me any future trouble of a character like the
                  present."
               "Good night, Mr. Bourdette. You are a bold man; and if your countrymen were all
                  like you, we would have harder duty before us."
               My grandfather reached home in safety, and was awaited by the whole family, who
                  had not slept since his departure.
               But my pen betrays me, and I must close this tribute to the memory of the past.
                  The family underwent many vicissitudes during the subsequent six years of the war,
                  which the reader will find recorded in another part of this volume. The old house
                  was rebuilt shortly after the war, and its roof-tree a second time became grey
                  with moss whilst it covered the venerable heads of its owners, and they recounted
                  to their grandchildren the scenes they had witnessed, and again made it the abode
                  of comfort and hospitality. Often, as in my schoolboy days, I have sought the old
                  mansion through the forest of Weehawken, and could see the venerable pair seated
                  on the porch, and hear the echo of the woodman's axe and the tinkling of the
                  cow-bell, I have thought, even in my early youth, that a life thus spent, and
                  nearing its close, was far more congenial with nature and true dignity of
                  character, than all the applause of popularity or the fawning sycophancy of luxury
                  and fashion.
            
            
               
               SCENES IN PRACTICE.
               THE FOUR IMPELLING POWERS TO EVIL—INTEMPERANCE, AMBITION, ANIMAL
                  PASSION, AND THE LOVE OF MONEY—ILLUSTRATION OF THE LATTER BY AN AWFUL
                  TRAGEDY.
               A FEW years since, whilst visiting a country town to attend to an operation, my
                  professional advice was sought by a man whose extraordinary countenance impressed
                  me, in a greater degree than I ever remember to have been by any individual in the
                  lower walks of life. I subsequently found that the occasion of his visit was to
                  avail himself of my opinion as professional testimony, to assist in clearing up
                  some points which went to implicate him in one of the most deliberate and awful
                  murders in the whole catalogue of crime, ancient or modern. I took pains to
                  ascertain the facts, and listened to nearly all the evidence during the first
                  trial of two men, his son-in-law and nephew, who were executed as the murderers;
                  the first trial was then progressing in the village where my patient lived.
                  Ambition, intemperance, the morbid state, of sexual passion, and the love of
                  money, I take to be the four greatest impelling powers to crime; and my legal
                  friends must forgive me if I consider their efforts to defend a criminal they know
                  to be guilty, often prove them particularly liable to the former and the latter
                  vices; for such we have always considered the four.
               The love of money, however, as it is the meanest and vilest of human vices, is
                  usually fostered to its most disgusting ing developments by the more
                  cowardly—whether lawyer, physician, merchant or murderer. The weak-minded of our
                  clerical friends, usually nourish the vices of ambition and sensuality. The study
                  of human motive in its action on temperament and organism, has ever been to us,
                  the most fascinating pursuit; and it will be observed that the mere medical and
                  surgical relations of patient and physician, are always of secondary consequence
                  in the sketches we present our readers. We shall now endeavor, to place before the
                  reader the chief characters implicated in the tragedy we are about to recount, and
                  in the order of relation they seemed to us to occupy, from its inception in the
                  love of money, to its fearful consummation in three murders and the execution of
                  two of the murderers; how far a third was implicated, we will leave the reader to
                  determine; and whether the love of money does not require the cautions of the
                  moralist and the best efforts of the essayist, as well as any other crime. No vice
                  enables a man so effectually to play upon the weaknesses of his fellows;
                  especially when the devotee has accumulated enough of the powerful lever to
                  control the weak and needy.
               The patient who sought my chamber before I had yet arisen from my bed, was a man
                  of about fifty years, of medium height, remarkably well knit together, and plainly
                  clad in black; he was a small farmer living at W——. The lower part of his features
                  showed no peculiar trait, except penuriousness, denoted by thin and bloodless
                  lips, and compressed nostrils. The extraordinary traits of character that enabled
                  him to occupy a relation to the tragedy, we will leave the reader to determine,
                  were shown in the eyes and forehead. The eyes were small, grey, and very near
                  together; the eyebrows near but distinct, and neither luxuriant nor otherwise;
                  forehead of medium height and narrow; cheek bones not prominent; head small, "and
                  by no means flat, and not, as our phrenologists always say in villains, destitute of veneration. It was to the
                  utter woodenness of the face, and the immobility of the eyes my attention was
                  drawn; the latter might, for all their expressiveness, have been made of glass,
                  and the lids glued to them for the greater part of the time during which he was in
                  my room: he looked as though no other passion but avarice found a dwelling-place
                  in his soul. He was married, and had a family; his domestic relations were neither
                  marked by severity nor affection: indeed he was a wooden man, locking up his
                  purposes within his own soul.
               The purpose for which he sought me was in reality a foolish one; though he
                  doubtless thought my evidence, being a stranger, and therefore supposed to be
                  unprejudiced, might avail him if he could secure my private ear, and operate upon
                  me with a small bribe.
               But let the story be developed as it occurred: we will only request the reader to
                  remember the personal appearance of our patient.
               The small hamlet in which he lived, was the place of abode of a family consisting
                  of a brother, near his own age, a very good-natured man possessing some wealth in
                  money and a farm, his wife and two small children; an old bachelor, who was also
                  comfortably off in wealth, as boarder; a young woman as "help," and a boy of some
                  twelve years, also a servant, composed the rest of this family.
               Much attachment existed between the family and this bachelor, and it was generally
                  supposed that in the event of the death of either, the survivor would inherit the
                  wealth of the deceased. This prospective arrangement we must so far anticipate as
                  to say, was supposed by all the neighbors to be a source of great jealousy and
                  heart-burning between the brothers, viz. my patient and the head of the family. Of
                  course the bachelor was not viewed with favor by my patient, whose visits to the
                  household were few, but frequent and hypocritical enough to ascertain what money
                  was on hand, and to judge where, it and the will, if any existed, were kept.
               A son-in-law of my patient, and a nephew—the former a man of family, a
                  good-natured, blue-eyed creature of some thirty years; the latter a small,
                  good-looking, inoffensive, though lively and jocose youth of twenty-two—lived near
                  him, and were entirely under his influence. The reader has now all the actors, and
                  the victims before him; all are sufficiently characterized; the only marked man
                  being my patient.
               One morning, the whole hamlet were alarmed by the discovery that the brother and
                  his wife, the bachelor and the servant boy, were found murdered by blows from a
                  hatchet: the wife being in bed with half a candle in her hand; the
                  boy up stairs in bed; the husband and the bachelor on the road a few rods from the
                  house, and the body of one, I do not remember which, thrown into a hole in the
                  road. The hired girl was not to be found, but the two children were alive and
                  unharmed—in a truckle-bed under another higher bedstead; directly against which a,
                  door opened, so as to obscure it from view. The boy, we may here say, though
                  dreadfully wounded, eventually recovered—an idiot. Some money and papers were
                  found, which it subsequently appeared were only a part of what were in the house:
                  why any were left did not appear. From the moment of the discovery by the
                  neighbors, a chain of circumstantial evidence commenced, criminating the two
                  unfortunate young men, or the son-in-law and the nephew of the hardened man who
                  consulted me, and who managed, whether guilty or not, to escape punishment, and to
                  attain the most extraordinary influence over two human beings I have ever imagined
                  possible.
               The first circumstance that arrested the attention of the neighbors, was the
                  manner in which the son-in law received the intelligence of the murder. He was
                  ploughing, and on the announcement that
                  the whole family had been murdered, he uttered a mere exclamation of surprise—and
                     finished the furrow! The nephew managed to appear somewhat
                  horror-struck, and my patient also appeared a little shocked. They all assembled
                  at the house where the tragedy had been enacted, and the jury proceeded to
                  investigate the dark affair. Part of the candle was found, as we have already
                  said, clutched in the hand of the murdered woman: all of them had been killed by
                  blows from a hatchet, and her death-blow had been at once fatal. Whether she fell
                  asleep with that bit of candle in her hand, or whether it had been placed there by
                  the murderer to deceive, will never be known; but the other half of the candle, or
                  what was assumed to be such, because it was evidently recently divided, was found
                  in a lantern near the place where the bachelor and the husband were found
                  murdered. This was at a certain large hole in the road, for the filling up of
                  which, the son-in-law had been negotiating with the murdered man, as he was
                  road-master of that town. It was alleged, moreover, that he had been seen late on
                  the evening of the murder, with another man, riding towards the house; and tracks
                  where a horse had been tied near by, having a very peculiarly marked shoe on one
                  foot, were discovered; the smith who shod the horse, testified it to belong to the
                  son-in-law. What testimony was developed to induce suspicion of the nephew at that
                  time, I have forgotten, but both were imprisoned and indicted.
               Two trials were had; and on the first, neither was convicted, but on the second,
                  it was proved that money had been paid by the son-in-law immediately after the
                  murder, which was identified, from its peculiar character, to have been paid to
                  the murdered brother of my patient, for provisions sold to a merchant. Both the
                  son-in-law and nephew were sworn to as having been seen riding towards the house
                  late at night: there was some other very extraordinary testimony respecting a
                  letter, either as having been actually sent on the next day, and either preserved
                  by the person, or found undestroyed among the effects of the son-in-law,
                  announcing some event—what I cannot say—connected with the murder and not
                     known to have occurred till some time afterward, proving conclusively
                  that he must have been privy to it.
               One circumstance, and one only, arrested my attention as powerfully militating
                  against him on the trial. Such was his inoffensive appearance, that till the
                  moment I witnessed it, I believed he would be proved innocent. It is one that
                  could only produce its full impression on the mind of an anatomist: to a lawyer it
                  would be of no consequence. He had been allowed to sit among the members of the
                  bar beside his counsel, and had taken a position of apparent ease, with one leg
                  over the other, and his arm hanging over the back of the chair. A slight shade of
                  paleness only overspread his face, and no one could suspect him, a young man, a
                  father, and dwelling peacefully in a quiet hamlet, to be a murderer. When the
                  blacksmith was brought forward, and swore that the tracks made by the prisoner's
                  horse, where he had been tied to the fence, near the scene of the murder, had been
                  identified as only possible to have been made by the peculiar shoe he had fitted
                  to the animal, the prisoner convulsively contorted the arm that was hanging over
                  the back of his chair, and actually turned the palm upwards; and immediately twice
                  snapped his thumb and finger together, as is common with vulgar people when
                  expressing indifference. I imagined the tumultous movements of the poor heart, as
                  he got the unexpected and terrible warning of his doom. His father sat by, and
                  perceptibly lost the color that healthy toil and innocence had allowed to mantle
                  the furrows of his aged cheek. My heart ached for him. I looked to my patient with
                  eager interest: not a movement betrayed the least quickening of his pulse, nor a
                  breath of sympathy or alarm for his son-in law, his nephew, or himself. Knowing the opinion of
                  the lawyers with regard to his guilt, and with my previous opportunity to judge of
                  his moral nature by his face, my interest became powerfully excited in the result
                  of the trial. I would willingly have prolonged my stay, but my patient recovered,
                  and my duties called me home. Both the younger men were convicted of murder, but
                  my patient escaped.
               I but recently learned the following points in the history of the case; they have
                  convinced me of the correctness of my first impression as to who planned the
                  murder. Other medical eyes than my own were upon my patient; and his extraordinary
                  influence over the doomed men, was the subject of much wonder. The anticipation
                  that the prisoners would make a full confession, was destined to be disappointed.
                  My informant being a resident of the town and a medical man, had opportunities of
                  ascertaining the facts, which he communicated to me. I have drawn my own
                  conclusions from them.
               One of the gentlemen who defended the prisoners, was a young man of very
                  prepossessing exterior and most respectably connected. His business had been of
                  little pecuniary value up to the period of his being retained for this case. So
                  far as my ability to judge of the countenance extended, I should have supposed him
                  very easily influenced by a wicked and designing man. Both he and my patient had
                  free intercourse with the two prisoners, and it was observed by all who possessed
                  any feeling for persons under such awful circumstances, that they maintained the
                  utmost calmness and indifference: this was evidently kept up by the daily visits
                  of my patient, whose influence over them seemed absolute. The young lawyer also
                  was a constant visitor, and maintained before them a calm and indifferent
                  exterior. It was known from their deportment and conversation, that they
                  confidently anticipated a pardon; to the last moment of their lives this idea was
                  evidently kept in full excitement; and here lies the point which has always
                  excited my astonishment. Whatever part my patient had in the planning of this
                  awful murder may never be known; but his astonishing influence over these two
                  wretched men as well as over the young lawyer, has always amazed me, and
                  classified him with the most remarkable men I ever saw or imagined. Here we find
                  two young men, one a married man and a father, never suspected of crime or known
                  to be cruel, implicated by a series of circumstances of such irresistible power,
                  as to cause a jury of their neighbors to condemn them to death, maintaining the
                  utmost calmness to the last hour of their existence the father-in-law of one and
                  uncle of the other, apparently unconcerned and almost indifferent, visiting them
                  daily with his lawyer; the wife and her little children and his father, seeking
                  the condemned father and husband and son; the day of execution rapidly
                  approaching, and indifference and unconcern the only expression visible on the
                  face of this wonderful man; when he was to inherit the property of the murdered
                  family, *
                   and seemed, so far as the object and his countenance and deportment went,
                  the only one capable of committing the murder! The day before the execution, all
                  confidently anticipated a solution of the mystery; but the usual visits were paid
                  to the prisoners, including, I believe, those of a friendly clergyman, the same
                  stolid apathy was visible on my patient's face, the same cheerfulness on those of
                  the prisoners. All the sad arrangements had been made, the sound of the hammer in
                  the erection of the gallows had rung in their ears; they ate and drank and retired
                  to rest as usual, uttering no sound of confession, and apparently easy and
                  unconcerned. All who had looked upon their almost boyish faces, were astonished:
                  how could such hearts and such
                     
                     *I believe, however, he did not inherit, because of the escape of the two
                        children.
                   brains
                  hold out and see the approach of such a doom without a sign?
               The morning came; the last meeting with wife and children had occurred; all went
                  their sorrowful way to the little cottage which had once sheltered in innocence,
                  one whose name it was now a disgrace to bear. The aged father remained, with the
                  old wagon that had once carried his light-hearted boy to school or the hay-field.
                  For what was it kept in waiting now? Great God! why did not the feeble desolate
                  heart stand still and release the poor old man? The last prayer was said; the
                  habiliments of death were upon them; the arms were pinioned; the last minute had
                  arrived! Who passes the fatal summons to the condemned? Not the sheriff: he was at
                  the cell-door; but my patient! In a tone of jocularity he summons them, "Come,
                  come;" and is accompanied by the young lawyer! No unusual excitement was visible
                  on the faces of the condemned: they are evidently expecting a pardon! Had they
                  been assured of it? See how closely the lawyer and the hard-hearted father-in-law
                  stand near the ear of each prisoner! The whole party step on to the fatal
                  platform; they whisper with unmoved faces to the prisoners, and look knowingly at
                  each other; there is a slight misgiving visible on the faces of the condemned. The
                  vast assembly sway like the wind-moved forest. A moment—the cap is drawn, the
                  signal is given; the lawyer and the unmoved, iron-faced patient step back, and
                  confession is for ever impossible!
               On the farm of the poor old father is a tomb that covers the remains of the
                  unfortunate young men. They say he wished to be buried there; and I know not, but
                  I hope ere this his wish has been gratified. His two poor little grandchildren may
                  gather wild flowers there; for flowers, like love for a child, will bloom even on
                  the grave of a murderer.
               My patient, I hope, will live till he is fit to die; he could not die
                  without repentance. He gathered up the property he possessed and departed for the
                  West. His neighbors looked at him and shuddered as they passed; and the two little
                  children, who escaped their intended doom, and the graves of the murdered brother
                  and his wife, and the kind old bachelor, were too near him; the vacant face of the
                  idiot boy, too, would now and then flit before him; all were too near him; but
                  there was something still nearer: even he was uncomfortable. The young lawyer also
                  removed. Men talked about him; he was not acceptable in the social circle; his
                  first great lesson might be too suggestive of the next step in life, and what
                  might that not be?
               Reader, beware of money! It is not the chief good: the love of God and man is
                  better.
            
            
               
               ON CROUP.
               WHAT IS CROUP? ITS SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT.
               FEW subjects present greater interest to the American mother, than that sudden and
                  violent inflammation of the delicate lining membrane of the wind-pipe in children,
                  termed Croup. The extraordinary vicissitudes of our climate, with the known
                  frequency of its occurrence near the ocean, and the surprising carelessness, and
                  universal ignorance on the subject of dress, together with the prevalence of that
                  deplorable method of heating our city houses with furnaces, and thus
                  destroying the constitution, gives no hope of the decrease of this terrible
                  disease. Nevertheless, although far too common for the comfort of the parent's
                  mind, it is by no means as frequent as those miserable parasites, the numerous
                  quacks, both allopathic, homeopathic, and hydropathic, would have them believe.
                  Many a slight catarrh, that a little warmth and care would remove, is made the
                  subject of a domestic alarm and self-glorification by one of these harpies; and
                  the poor infant is drenched with emetics and slops, and parboiled with a warm
                  bath, till exhausted nature comes to its relief, and it falls asleep from sheer
                  exhaustion, and thus escapes its tormentor for a short time; But, alas! the poor
                  little creature is now pronounced "subject to croup," and it must be carefully
                  watched; it would never do to let it go with one medical bout. The mother keeps a
                  bright look-out for a "bark or a crow," and is constantly summoning the doctor. We
                  are very far from wishing to foster carelessness—heaven knows that the American
                  city mother is often careless enough—but it sickens us to see the daily misery
                  endured by the poor, timid, young creature, who is victimized by some of these
                  harpies.
               The first point to which we would direct the reader's attention, is the fact, that
                  croup, properly so called, belongs exclusively to the wind-pipe, or that portion
                  of it that lies between the top of that projecting bone, or rather cartilage, that
                  is so plainly visible in men in the middle of the neck, and all that part of the
                  wind-pipe below it down to the breast-bone. It is a sudden inflammation of the
                  delicate lining membrane of the wind-pipe, produced by exposing the child to cold
                  and damp air when perspiring more or less sensibly, or when going from a
                     warm room into the cold air. The blood is driven from the skin by the
                  cold air, and rushes to that lining membrane, and clogs up all its little
                  blood-vessels; thus closing up the wind-pipe, and producing spasmodic inspiration,
                  and a sudden and harsh cough, like the hoarse crowing of a young cock. Generally
                  speaking, this inflammation begins high up near the apparatus of the voice, or
                  what we call the larynx, or the part that incloses the vocal chords; it then
                  travels downwards below the windpipe, where it is single and in the neck, and
                  often runs on till it gets into the two branches that go off like the tines of a
                  pitchfork, one to each lung, called the Bronchia.
               
               In bad cases, i. e., where the child is pre-disposed from peculiarity
                  of constitution, or in those which are badly treated or neglected, a false
                  membrane is formed around the inner part of the wind-pipe, partially stopping it
                  up, and looking, when coughed up, or taken out of the dead body, very much like a
                  boiled stick of macaroni. As we shall have frequent occasion to speak of the
                  formation of membranes and would avoid leading our readers astray, we take
                  occasion to remark that the membrane formed in croup, never becomes regularly organized by blood-vessels,
                  &c., as in some other diseases of longer continuance, where newly organized
                  parts are necessary to form a wall round an abscess, and thus to stop the issue of
                  the matter into parts where it would cause inflammation and death, as in the
                  belly, for instance; or when nature forms a little sack around a splinter of
                  glass, or a leaden ball, that will remain for many years in the body. This croup
                  membrane is not organized; it does not grow from and fast
                     to the natural lining membrane that belongs to the wind-pipe, but it is
                  rather a mere mould, formed by the exudation of lymph from the small blood-vessels
                  of the natural membrane, and merely sticks to it; so that if the child could live
                  long enough without its presence causing suffocation, it might gradually decay,
                  and be coughed up piecemeal. There is a predominance of the white or
                     albuminous tissues in children. This is albuminous, but not
                     organized.
               
               For these desperate cases, the operation of opening the wind-pipe has been
                  proposed, so as to let the air enter below the obstruction, and thus preserve life
                  till nature and medicine might have a longer chance. Although it has been
                  successful, and may be resorted to in desperate cases with propriety, it does not
                  depend upon any fixed principle, and is therefore unphilosophical; because we can
                  never ascertain the extent of this false membrane. It may exist far below the
                  opening, which can only be made at the lowest in an infant a little below the
                  middle of the neck, and it may therefore be found quite useless. We have ourselves
                  been thus mortified, the case proving fatal after the operation. It was performed
                  on the fifth day as a desperate remedy, in a case very much mismanaged by a quack,
                  and at the request of the late Dr. Churchill, of this city, who was called in at
                  that late period. We have given it this prominent mention, because it is
                  frequently talked of by the young surgeon as a reliable resort, and may therefore
                  hinder der the adoption of those powerful medical means which are not only
                  justifiable, but imperative, in a desperate case.
               There is an inflammatory affection of the larynx, as we call it, i.
                     e, the highest part of the wind-pipe, in which the apparatus of the
                  voice exists, originating also mostly from atmospheric causes; though sometimes
                  from inhaling acrid fumes, and from that dreadful disease, syphilis. This is, for
                  obvious reasons, far more frequent amongst grown persons, In its distinct form, it
                  is almost unknown among children; and yet the croup, we think, far oftener begins
                  high up in the wind-pipe than low down; still, as it goes almost always rapidly
                  downwards, and spends its chief force there, it would seem to prefer, as it were,
                  the wind-pipe proper. Why these two diseases should differ so widely in the
                  selection of such different ages, and each one evince such an evident predilection
                  for its little space of the same continuous lining membrane of the
                  wind-pipe, is indeed remarkable. This predilection is probably the result of
                  changes in the organization, necessary to the proper performance of the functions
                  of the wind-pipe at the respective periods, as yet unknown to us.
               Dr. Watson, of London, remarks—"The interval that lies between the periods of
                     weaning and puberty, is the time during which croup
                  is chiefly to be apprehended. Comparatively few cases of it occur during the first
                  year of infantile life. There are more in the second year than any other. This is,
                  in all probability, connected with the change that ensues with regard to diet,
                  upon the child being weaned. Dr. Cheyne, whose experience of croup was very
                  extensive, says, the younger children are when weaned, the more liable they
                  usually are to this malady. From the second year onward, the number of children
                  affected with croup gradually decreases. Of ninety-one cases reported by Irwin,
                  only one was after the tenth year." General Washington is said to have died of croup; his case, however, was probably
                  complicated with general effusion throughout the mucous membrane of the lungs. We
                  have never seen the disease beyond the fifth year in this city.
               Croup usually, but not always, begins with the symptoms of a common cold.
                  Sometimes it comes on without any symptom calculated to attract attention.
                  Usually, the child sneezes and coughs. Dr. Cheyne remarks, "hoarseness in very
                  young children does not usually attend a common cold." It should, therefore,
                  arrest the mother's attention when it exists, as it is an almost invariable
                  attendant of the commencement (and always of the progress) of croup. When the
                  disease is engrafted upon or grows out of a protracted cold, some premonitory
                  fever accompanies it; the child is flushed, hot, and restless, and often starts
                  out of its sleep with a cry, twisting its head round and round on its pillow in a
                  peculiarly distressful, way. The peculiarity of the inspiration, and
                  the sudden, clanging, dog-like barking, and sometimes metallic ringing sound of
                  the expiration or cough, is never to be forgotten. Then, again, comes
                  the peculiar drawing in of the air, like the piston of a pump partly dry, and
                  letting in the air to the partial vacuum below. Some call it, as we have before
                  said, the crowing inspiration. There is no swelling in the throat, as
                  of the tonsils in quinsy sore throat, and no difficulty of
                     swallowing. This is enough to distinguish it from that disease, than
                  which it is far more unmanageable and dangerous.
               The progress of the disease is well characterized by Dr. Watson. He alludes in our
                  extract to those cases which are attended with the formation of the membrane we
                  have spoken of; but whether distinctly formed or not, the child when it dies, does
                  so from the lodgment of mucus which it cannot cough up:—"As the obstruction to the
                  passage of air increases, the blood ceases to receive its proper quantity of
                  oxygen, the skin grows dusky, the pulse feeble and irregular ular, and the feet
                  and legs cold. The cough also ceases to be loud and clanging; it becomes husky,
                  and inaudible at a short distance, and the voice sinks to a whisper; the head is
                  thrown back; the nostrils dilate widely, and are in perpetual motion; the face is
                  pale and livid, and sometimes bloated; the pupils often expand. In such cases
                  death usually follows."
               A remarkable fact connected with croup is, the frequency of its occurrence at
                  night. The child often goes to bed with no symptom whatever of the disease, and
                  the first alarm of the mother is caused by the loud barking cough. Dr. Condie
                  remarks, and we can testify to his accuracy from frequent observation, that cases
                  presenting this peculiarity are not of the grave character of such as form more
                  slowly; they are scarce ever accompanied with the formation of the false membrane.
                  When the disease is to prove fatal, it often does so within two days, and is
                  rarely protracted over five.
               Notwithstanding what we have said, when speaking of the value of a good case of
                  croup to a quack, especially if it belong to a nervous mother addicted to
                  "pathies"—the disease is assuredly very apt to recur. And indeed, why should it
                  not? One attack does not, like measles, or small-pox, or mumps, either add
                  anything to the system, or take anything from it, necessary for its
                  future immunity; on the contrary, the susceptibility and the influence of the
                  natural causes, cold and dampness, remain the same, gradually decreasing as years
                  advance. All we meant by our caution applies to the quack. The humane and reliable
                  physician will always give the mother full caution and instruction; and we hope
                  this article is sufficiently instructive on the symptons, and cautionary, to give
                  no absurd reliance on domestic practice; the disease is too awful and frequent,
                  and causes too much anguish under the best of treatment, to excuse any
                  carelessness on the part of one who ventures to attempt public instruction. We have earnestly endeavored to make
                  this volume a powerful aid to humanity and true science, as well as a scourge to
                  quackery. Empirics will always be found living in a glass house, and are equally
                  transparent to all who rightly use their eyes and ears. The true physician carries
                  his character in his face; and when he opens his mouth, he cannot be mistaken,
                  unless by some conceited fool who has his head filled with his own notions and
                  "pathies."
               Some people absurdly suppose croup contagious, because it will sometimes attack
                  two children in the same family, or several in the same neighborhood, at the same
                  time; but remember, the pre-disposition from natural constitution is generally the
                  same in one family, and the character of the weather that generally causes the
                  disease is, in the same neighborhood, of course the same. Dr. Allison, who wrote
                  and observed with great accuracy, says it is particularly common with the children
                  of washerwomen in Edinburgh. Many of them, as with us, dry their clothes in their
                  small underground apartments, where their children sleep. What is still more
                  conclusive, he has also observed that the disease is very frequent on Saturday
                  night, "the only day on which it is customary for the lower orders in Edinburgh to
                  wash their houses." The better classes in New York seem anxious to cultivate the
                  disease, by leaving the child's chest exposed, and over-heating their apartments
                  with that terrible engine of death, the furnace.
               The fatality of this disease will always depend in a greater degree than most
                  others upon its early treatment; but how vigorous, and of what character that
                  treatment is to be, ought always to depend upon the constitution of the child;
                  but, unfortunately, it is usually characterized either by the prejudices of the
                  physician, or the importunities of the mother. It is truly grateful to the
                  benevolent and humane, that for once, popular and routine treatment may really be
                  said, even m domestic hands, to produce more good than harm. With us in New York,
                  and we believe throughout America, some preparation of that blessed root
                  ipecacuanha, for surely it is "a good gift of God"—is usually kept on hand by city
                  mother, and given, mostly with good effect, in colds. The simple syrup, in
                  connection with the warm-bath, are remedies of sufficient power for most cases,
                  and we have no doubt they have saved many an infants life.
               The preparation called "Cox's Hive Syrup," is however quite another affair, and is
                  fortunately not quite so popular. It contains tartar emetic, and is, therefore,
                  far more active and often very irritating to the intestines. The frequent use of
                  this powerful medicine was most admirably hit off by Dr Shearman, in that
                  inimitably humorous article in No 6 of the SCALPEL, entitled "Tartar
                  Emetic; an excellent Sweating, Nauseating, and Vomiting Article for—the
                  Profession."—"Whatever be the matter respecting which you are totally uncertain,
                  tartar emetic is the remedy The child must be put into warm water, and take a dose
                  of tartar emetic. It will either make the child better or worse, or change the
                  symptoms decidedly. The uncertainty or the child will be removed, and the
                  disagreeable uncertainty terminated." But Cox's hive syrup and antimonial wine, we
                  hope are getting out of fashion. In two or three years more we hope to settle
                  them.
               Inasmuch, therefore, as every mother is likely to try the remedy first, she had
                  better do it during the very onset of the suspected attack. The symptoms of a
                  common cold will be her guide; and the dose for an infant of the
                     simple syrup, usually half a teaspoonful, to be repeated in half
                  or three quarters of an hour, if it does not produce vomiting, or at least put the
                  infant comfortably and sweetly asleep. After this trial of a second dose and warm
                  covering, she will find a warm bath of five or ten minutes a remedy of great power. We do not think she should
                  exceed these measures, without the advice of her family physician. Whether he is
                  to be sent for or not, will depend very much upon the mothers observation of a
                  previous attack, or upon her nervous temperament. We are far from advising her to
                  tamper with her child, and think if she have confidence in her physician, she
                  should summon him; if not, discharge him as quickly as possible.
               So widely different is the estimate of medicines in this complaint in London and
                  New York, that the sagacious Watson never speaks of ipecacuanha! The lamented
                  Beck, of whom it may truly be said, a more elegant scholar and a more correct
                  observer never adorned the New York profession, held it in exalted estimation, and
                  every practical man here will cordially assent to his estimate of its curative
                  power. But this difference is easily understood. The adoption of a-remedy even as
                  well tested as ipecacuanha, was unlikely with the English practitioner, who had
                  been accustomed to look with reverence upon tartar emetic—in the skillful hands of
                  their hospital physicians, who for the most part, are men of great acumen.
               For the same reason, bleeding and calomel are included prominently in Dr. Watson's
                  list of remedies. With us, at this day, bleeding is greatly restricted, and we
                  hope will continue so: leeching should exclusively take its place in children; it
                  is far more difficult to estimate the hearts action in a little struggling child
                  by the pulse; nay, we boldly assert it is impossible: feeling the pulse in them is
                  nonsense, and reflects deserved ridicule on those who do it. There is no necessity
                  to open a vein in a child's arm unless immediate suffocation is impending: leeches
                  may with the greatest propriety be substituted in almost every case. The number
                  for a child should be most carefully adapted to its size and the general strength
                  of constitution, for the effect will be found quite as powerful as a general
                  bleeding from the arm in an adult. No rule can be given as to the number from two
                  leeches at the first year, to five, increasing one for every year, if the leeches
                  are large, will draw quite as much as the case requires, in almost any instance
                  indeed if the emetic have been first tried, and the warm bath, or either
                  separately, the leeches may prove a more active remedy than the physician
                  expected; they must, therefore, be carefully proportioned to a thoughtful
                  estimate, and by no means used by the mother.
               The leeches should never be placed upon the neck with the view of drawing the
                  blood directly from the affected part: we have known more than one child bled to
                  death in this city by so doing; every breath it draws fills the veins already
                  turgid from the disease, and the leech bites cannot be stopped by pressure with
                  cobweb or sponge used as a compress, because there is no bone to compress it
                  against in the neck. Applied to the upper part of the breast-bone, from one to two
                  inches from the disease, they produce far better effect, drawing the blood
                  sufficiently near the part to exhaust the inflamed membrane, and allowing a firm
                  compression to be made on each separate bite directly against the bone. We have
                  been called upon in a case where the bleeding could only be stopped by passing a
                  needle from one side the little wound to the other, and twisting a piece of fine
                  silk under it: cutting off the surplus of the needle with plyers; this hint should
                  always be remembered by the young surgeon, as it is perfectly reliable.
               Of the use of calomel, we can only say that we heartily and entirely disapprove of
                  it in every case not actually desperate; if the disease has lasted over four or
                  five days, and is one of those where the membraneous formation is known to exist,
                  it may be used with some prospect of benefit; but not otherwise: the remedies
                  enumerated, if judiciously used, will prevent the necessity of so questionable a
                  measure in every case of the commencement of croup. Blisters are a harsh and questionable remedy—we would never use
                  them Mustard plasters made by enclosing a paste of half mustard and half flour,
                  moistened with vinegar, between old and well-worn muslin cloths, are an excellent
                  and safe substitute. They act in a few minutes, and may be often renewed on the
                  same spot, at half hours' interval. Were we speaking of quinsy sore throat, and
                  inflammation of the tonsils, we should describe a peculiar spasmodic affection of
                  the highest part of the wind-pipe, known as false croup—a disease, however, often
                  fatal and intimately connected with croup, as described in this article.

                        they shrivelled and charred under his burning touch."
                  
               
               Now, my dear reader, will you be so good as to tell me what this world was made
                  for? What are we to learn from this "economy of sin and misery?" What, from those
                  long-drawn sighs and sounds of woe? those tears and heart-breakings that fill the
                  earth? Why does rum exist? Why does sin deface the race, and fill the earth with
                  mourning? Is it because our good mother fell by apple-eating; or is it a necessary
                  constitution of things! You tell us about the solids and gases which compose the
                  body; how they elect one another; and how the chick gets his heart in
                  motion, and the blood to circulating; how the beard is of great use, and very
                  masculine, and was only allowed to man; that woman is almost an angel; and yet how
                  many bitter draughts and curses does she drink? I see now the fragile form of that
                  pale one who sat and sewed upon her bench, and coughed her handkerchief fall of
                  blood, and then died, with no one to love her; and beside her I see the proud form
                  of that other glorious being who was wronged and left with a dear
                  babe in her arms: the fire gleams from her speaking eye, as she tears open her
                  dress, and shows her aching breasts to
                  her hard-hearted mistress, full distended with that life-tide, that carries with
                  it the young mother's soul to the soul of her new-born infant! O what a proud and
                  holy thing is a mother's heart? that first gush of love, that new and brilliant
                  light that floods her soul, and makes it swell with angelic emotions when she
                  folds in her arms the first ripe fruits of her maternal elements? Do you ever see
                  a mother without emotion? if you do, you are the last of sinners, and deserve no
                  forgiveness nor peace when your brow is cold and your eye glazed. A mother, true
                  and exalted, is the holiest being that walks the earth; she knows no self; but on
                  her child she lavishes the burning flame of that newly kindled love, just lighted
                  in her soul, and burning more and more intensely as she approaches the tomb. Did
                  you ever see a young mother die, and with pale lips ask you, "Why her child did
                  not cry?" "if it was asleep?" and you could not muster manhood to tell her it was
                  dead? Then your heart has not drunk the bitterest cup of all. When you tell us
                  about galvanism, and muscles, and the air we breathe, why not tell us why so many
                  wrongs are heaped on the mother's heart? why she drinks so many bitter draughts?
                  why this holiest fountain is polluted with the bitterest dregs? why she quaffs so
                  many cups of sorrow, and the moon beams so lovingly its soft and holy light among
                  the clouds and the stars; the sun shines out in the vault of heaven, and yet
                  thousands of mothers mourn over the child of their love, and drink till death the
                  cup of hate? The quick intuitions of the spirit teach us by analogy; and when we
                  walk out under the clear old sky, we see the wheeling worlds sparkling in the deep
                  blue vault of heaven. Why has God made all those countless orbs, and scattered
                  them through the limitless fields of unmeasured space? Analogy tells us, that they
                  must be the abodes of human spirits—nurseries of the human race. The highest fact
                  observed on our own planet, is, that it is the abode of man: the grand workshop of
                  nature, where human spirits are individualized, is the most probable truth we can
                  imagine in all those distant worlds.. All over their vast fields, mothers are
                  ushering the race into being, are mourning, loving, dying. Unnumbered myriads of
                  mothers' hearts, each moment, palpitate with that new delight, and chant that
                  heavenly song— 
                     
                        "Hush my babe, lie still and slumber,
                        Holy angels guard thy bed,
                        Heavenly blessings without number
                        Gently falling on thy head."
                     
                  
               
               Do you think women are treated in those planets as we treat ours? Is the seducer
                  permitted to hate the being he has ruined? And do all women curse an erring
                  sister? And help trample her too confiding heart in the dust?
               Hold on now. I am not going to write a lecture on woman's rights; only going to
                  ask a few plain questions, which any true man would like to answer. Do you think
                  they are oppressed and wronged by labor too severe for their starved bodies, and
                  driven to destruction to feed their children? Are they deceived by flattery? Is
                  the dignity of their souls destroyed by an American education? Are they kept as
                  mere appendages, and decorated in plumes and tawdry tinsel, like so many parrots,
                  to look at?
               An incident will bring more clearly before the mind the ideas that I wish to
                  present. After a week's absence in a distant city, I returned to my home, late at
                  night, and when the family greeting, had passed, necessity hurried me off to
                  attend the wife and child of a wealthy neighbor. Doctor —— had been called in my
                  absence, and wished me for counsel, as the mother and her youngest child were very
                  ill with dysentery. One death had occurred in the neighborhood, in the practice of
                  an old and prudent physician, and this was deemed sufficient cause to call a
                     consultation. When shown into the
                  sick-room, I found the mother alone and quite comfortable. Her strength was yet
                  good, although the dysenteric movements occurred at the short intervals of every
                  half hour; this, together with a high state of mental excitement, precluded all
                  rest. Finding no tenderness of the abdomen, and a quick and cheerful eye, my
                  prognosis was prompt that she would certainly recover. In another room lay a
                  suffering child; its mouth was dry and parched, its bowels sore to the touch, and
                  badly bloated; the discharges attended with a violent tenesmus, which wrung the
                  little sufferer with anguish; and his dull and leaden eye told the tale that his
                  little frame must yield to the fatal enemy that had fastened on his vitals.
               As my credit was at stake, an old and very grave man was, at my suggestion, added
                  to the consultation, from a neighboring village, to guard our reputation from the
                  usual visitation of gossiping slander that always follows a fatal result in the
                  country.
               He examined the child duly, and gave it as his opinion that the symptoms resembled
                  those of Ipecac!
               The fatal inflammation had already progressed very far, and no one could doubt
                  that a large space of the small intestines was laboring under fatal ulceration,
                  and how Ipecac could be supposed to range with such symptoms was not quite so
                  clear. But death was ahead of the doctors, and the little sufferer passed quickly
                  away to a better world.
               Now commenced one of those tragical scenes, "that often occur in country practice,
                  and most deeply evince a necessity of a system of popular instruction for the
                  people, to acquaint them with the laws of health, and the only safe road to cure
                  in all curable cases. Another child had died in the neighborhood, and it was time
                  the doctor was changed again; it was plain enough to the people, that we did not
                  know much. The neighbors had decided on a change, and my friend asked me if I
                  could advise him who to send for, and I recommended the inventor of the
                  "Chingvang" pills, informing him that he was a much wiser man than myself, and
                  that the wife would get well without either of us. He came, and readily detected
                  the fact that he was in luck, his patient and fees were both safe; and I was
                  floored of course.
               He invited me politely, as in duty bound, to call "when convenient," which I did;
                  and things went on swimmingly for two days, when suddenly the scale turned; two
                  other children were taken, vomiting both bile and blood, and manifesting, from the
                  first, fatal symptoms. My friend was now in trouble; and, on one of my friendly
                  visits, on entering the apartment, his eye caught mine, and spoke as only the eye
                  can speak, "my credit is gone too, the children will both die." The mother was
                  slowly recovering, and as the children grew rapidly worse, the council of the
                  neighborhood decided to call further aid. Another regular was called, and being
                  one of the heroes, he advised (it is solemn truth, my dear reader.) one hundred
                  grains of calomel as a cathartic! His reason was, that in a similar case he had
                  given it and the child recovered. His medical brother thought it a little too
                  heroic, and consented to his giving fifty grains, which was done! Fresh blood in
                  copious quantities, followed the operation, and the pains become more severe, and
                  the little victim of disease and the doctor slipped from his suffering into the
                  grave. One sick one remained, and it was high time that a new change occurred. A
                  shrewd and simple old quack was curing cancers in the neighborhood, and sent word
                  to the family that he could certainly cure the remaining child; that after
                  cleansing the bowels with pills made of butternut bark, aloes, camphor, and
                  cayenne pepper, he would feed the little fellow with tea made of "twist root,"
                  that would stop the discharges in a few hours. It may seem strange, but this trial
                  was submitted to, and the wily old fool was called into the august presence of three or four M. D.'s and a score of
                  other counselors! Such is the way we are obliged to proceed in the West, or we are
                  called inhuman; we are obliged to remain and see that the patient is not killed
                  outright. He gave his pills, and as in the other case, fresh blood followed the
                  raking of the pills over that inflamed and sensitive membrane which lines the
                  bowels; the child screamed with torture, and was only relieved from his horrible
                  agony by enemas of morphine they were obliged to give. The twist root was duly
                  administered; but its good effect was prevented by the anodynes, and the old
                  cancer-killer escaped with a feather in his cap; alleging that the child was
                  killed by the morphine given in his absence.
               You may wish to know the virtues of "twist root," and what it is; but I can only
                  say, that it is probably nobody's business what it is, only it is an Indian remedy
                  whose virtues would not be appreciated by the learned. By this time, another child
                  in the neighborhood had fallen sick, and luckily passed, at the earliest
                  appearance of disease, into the hands of the first physician called; he used only
                  mucilages and opiates, syrup of marshmallow, and the little patient finally
                  recovered.
               But I set out to speak of the providence of God in permitting this economy of sin
                  and misery. I will, therefore, glance back through a space of fifteen years, and
                  show you a singular picture presented in the life of this father and mother, that
                  may serve to illustrate the mysterious wherefore. She was beautiful; a form well
                  moulded by health, with good address, coupled with a subtle black eye, with a
                  musical voice, and much benevolence in her smile, made her an agreeable companion,
                  and a patient in whom one would feel a deep and lively interest. Time had drawn a
                  veil before her heart, and a shadow had dimmed that lustrous eye; but the common
                  beholder would never know it; the demon had gone in there and concealed himself.
                  She was educated by a pious father; a man of noble nature and of strong religious
                  hopes; he had many daughters, and this one, in an especial manner, was the darling
                  of his earliest hopes, of all his prayers and heavenward aspirations. He had
                  carefully educated her, and designed to bestow her in marriage on some true
                  disciple of the cross, who should pass untainted through this selfish world, and
                  labor in the name of the blessed Redeemer, for the millions who perish for the
                  bread of life.
               The parental heart is a wonderful mirror, and the good old man had dreamed of
                  seeing his daughter, the noble companion of the sainted Harriet Newel and Mrs.
                  Judson; and her husband treading in the same noble path that was trodden by the
                  husbands of these great-souled women; but his heart was doomed to a sore
                  disappointment, and Providence had designed for her a different life. The heart of
                  the proud Eugenia had been wooed and won by an industrious young mechanic; their
                  vows had been again and again repeated. Her faith seemed fixed as fate itself.
                  Happy in his expectations, he had sought occupation in a neighboring village, to
                  replenish his purse, and furnish means of subsistence in anticipation of their
                  nuptials. His feet were swift to trace the path to the post-office, to receive,
                  from time to time, from the hand of his faithful and devoted girl, her repeated
                  assurances of love and affection. One day he had been excited by strange emotions,
                  his heart beat too fast, and a painful foreboding warned him of coming ill. He
                  eagerly grasped from the hand of the clerk a letter, on which was that familiar
                  handwriting, that so often had told the table of love; it produced coldness in his
                  hands, and a sweat came on his brow, and fear and faintness seemed to seize him;
                  he opened it and read his fate. The letter contained various charges, among which
                  was that of licentiousness, and a refusal, from the pious and saintly
                  Eugenia, to fulfill her promises. She affirmed, with great calmness, that she could never be happy with a man
                  whose feet had gone to the house of her "whose steps take hold on hell." Guiltless
                  of the crime, in a fit of indignation he tore the false letter into a thousand
                  pieces, and retired to his shop, and took up a file and began rasping a piece of
                  steel; every stroke seemed to cross his heart, and his grief grew more bitter as
                  reflection enabled him to trace in that bitter letter the work of an enemy's hand.
                  His first thought was to fly to her presence, and reproach her with her perfidy;
                  but soon a feeling of indignation prevented him.
               Alternating thus between hope and fear, time rushed on, and the next mail brought
                  him a line from, the hand of his faithful mother, that Eugenia was married to
                  young E——.
               The shock was severe; it fell like a hot thunderbolt on his heart, and he resolved
                  never again to have faith in woman.
               Truth is stranger than fiction, for the most exalted imagination cannot conceive
                  what a false heart will perpetrate. Young E. was tall and handsome, at least the
                  ladies thought so; his black eye was always sparkling, and his face was wreathed
                  in smiles; he drove a dashing pair of greys, with plated harness; and
                  prospectively he was rich, as his old father had made him his heir.
               Intemperance had converted the old man into a maniac; his head was often, as he
                  supposed, surrounded by crows and vultures, and mornings always found toads and
                  snakes in his boots. The rum delirium was doing its work. Young E. saw with
                     regret his father's drunkenness, but he viewed with
                     delight the broad fields, covered with short-horned Durhams.
               A few miles distant lived a poor, but warm-hearted family; the father's hard toil
                  had not been blest like his neighbor's, and the mother, with the meek heart of a
                  Christian, had diligently endeavored to meet her share of the small list of wants,
                  by her own toil; a lovely and dear daughter had unfolded into womanhood, and like
                  the gentle fawn she kept close to her mother's side, till necessity drove her into
                  the cold world to labor for clothes and bread. Her form was slight, and a softly
                  blushing cheek, and mild blue eyes, with flaxen locks, made up the stock of beauty
                  of this artless and innocent rustic. She was pure as a dew-drop pendent from a
                  rose-leaf. The dashing young farmer who drove the grey horses, soon succeeded in
                  winning the heart of this artless creature; he seduced and deserted her, and she
                  was about to become a mother; and it was thus I became acquainted with the story.
                  The distracted father sought redress in prosecution; but how cold and heartless is
                  the law I a verdict of three hundred dollars was brought against the fiend, while
                  he vindicated his virtue by bringing into court two other heartless scoundrels, to
                  swear that the child might be theirs! To make the cup bitter as hell to the poor,
                  shrinking, friendless, betrayed one, money had been furnished them to proffer
                  their blasphemous lie before the very face of heaven, and the lacerated heart of
                  this dear heart-broken child. In three weeks from the court which declared him the
                  father of the child of Miss L., the rich young rake stood beside the marriage
                  altar with Eugenia; the happy, chosen husband of her who had broken her vows with
                  the mechanic on a charge of libertinism, anonymously made by this fiend in human
                  shape, and of which he was as guiltless as the new-born babe who owed its
                  existence to his rival.
               Time sped on, and brought with it changes in fortune to all concerned. The proud
                  and soulless Eugenia, sat by her window, looking over the broad domain that she
                  had married. The future was full of promise to the happy mother, and the wealth
                  and splendor by which she was surrounded, seemed a solace for every grief; but
                  alas! time is full of tricks, and laughs at human wisdom. This grey-headed old
                  mocker, one day in the midst of sunshine and flowers, brought into her
                  neighborhood the deluded young artisan.
                  His character had been assailed, and himself wheedled and fooled by a coquette;
                  and as the law has a kind of mathematical righteousness, that now and then relaxes
                  its sternness to accommodate the craft, and mete out equal justice, he instituted
                  a prosecution for breach of promise against the wife of the happy young man who
                  had won his gay, accomplished, but fickle Eugenia. The rage of the old ladies rose
                  on him, in one storm of vengeance. What! sue a woman for a breach of promise,
                  "when there was just as good fish in the sea as had ever been caught;" and so
                  thought the young plaintiff, for after having his fun, and exciting due attention
                  to all the facts in the case, he withdrew the suit, to make way for the
                  accouchment. "True love never runs smooth." But our poor stricken mourner, where
                  was she? About the time of the above-named-occurrence, one night, mid the storm
                  and the tempest, a carriage stopped at the door of the old log dwelling where
                  dwelt the poor and the lowly. A few of the neighboring women were there, dressed
                  with their clean aprons and best fixings—they looked very knowing. The poor mother
                  sat aside, with her clean cap on to be sure; but to the eye of the most careless
                  physician, the deep lines of sorrow could be traced on her cheek, that gave
                  warning of the canker within. The torments of the damned have no terrors to a
                  sensitive female like such an ordeal. The wretch who betrays her goes acquit; but
                  on her head is heaped the accumulated scorn of every tongue, and the heart of her
                  own sex, that should surround her with every emblem of protection, is steeled
                  against her, and in most cases, if she receive any sympathy, it is from the
                  sterner sex. I blush to say it; but woman is false to her own sex in an hour of
                  such deep and bitter need. The poor bleeding sacrifice on the altar of treachery,
                  sat weeping alone and in agony; a mother's anguish was upon her; she might die in
                  the fearful struggle, but the whole deadly draught must be swallowed alone; no
                  smile to cheer her—her mother could not smile, and save the kind
                  words and soothing tones of the humble physician, the victim heard no cheering
                  voice. On her marble brow stood the sweat like drops of blood; a few hours
                  elapsed, and the sun broke in the east; its clear beams shot through the balmy
                  air, and kissed the rain-drops from bough and leaf. All nature, the earth, the
                  grass, the flowers, animals and man gave signs of gladness. In the low log
                  dwelling, skirted by a beech wood, where the robins sung at sunrise, could have
                  been seen the poor mother and her young daughter, now herself alas, a mother! the
                  doctor and the woman were gone; all was quite. Behind some dingy curtains, with
                  her infant folded to that bosom that now covered a betrayed and broken heart, lay
                  the pale young mother; the little downy cheek of her child rested on hers; its
                  warms breath rose over her face; its tiny cry startled her heart, and she looked
                  in its little sleepless face, and wondered if it was indeed hers; her heart spoke
                  in her bosom "it is yours," and when no eye but His who sees all things saw her,
                  she raised the innocent, her "destroying angel" to her lips and kissed it. That
                  bright ray of light that angels never feel—a mother's love—had gone into her
                  heart. She loved her infant in spite of the world, and straining it to her
                  breaking heart, she was compelled to be true to nature, through man, and nature,
                  and friends were false.
               That creeping idea—Miss—is a mother—went from tongue to tongue, and from ear to
                  ear until the fatal tale crept into the ear—the very heart of Eugenia, who, in
                  about three months, was to drink a cup less full of bliss. A woman's heart is a
                  mystery; it is an instrument of matchless music, when played upon by skillful
                  hands; but the rude operator, the lying genius, draws nothing but painful discord
                  from its sparkling depths. "I wonder," said Eugenia, to herself, as the picked up
                  a piece of velvet cloth she was shaping ing
                  into a strange form, much like a little cloak, "I wonder who that child looks
                  like." A strange emotion in her soul gave her sudden pain, and she burst into a
                  flood of tears: her woman's heart had guessed, what busy tongues were reporting,
                  that it resembled its father, and that she could see its resemblance to her
                  husband. The proud Eugenia, the wife of a rich young husband, swallowed the bitter
                  thought; and though in the solitude of her chamber her brilliant black eyes were
                  often wet with tears, none suspected her heart-canker. She too had played false,
                  and been sued for a broken promise, a perjured vow. These two false beings had
                  mingled their lives together, to produce a lie; for of such treachery, truth,
                  purity, sincerity, cannot be born. Every element of our own being is transmitted
                  to our offspring, and in the subtle faithlessness of a daughter, or the inbred
                  vice of the son, we see too clearly the moral crookedness of the father, and the
                  squirming vipers that so often nestled in the bosom of the mother. Every act of
                  our lives is absorbed into our being, and somewhere in our eternal career, it will
                  be given forth, stamping on the child a mark that defaces him for life. Let us
                  pass over some sixteen years of such music as humanity yields our profession
               On a bright sunny morning, a messenger called at my door, and requested me to
                  attend a family sick with chills and fever. All were sick but the mother; the old
                  miller, three sons, and two girls; and at this point of my narrative, I would drop
                  some reflections on miasma, but that moral miasma that infests the human heart is
                  more directly connected with the incidents which I am relating. Mrs. T. requested
                  me on my return from the miller's family, to call on another that lived off from
                  the main road, near the brink of the stream. Nothing like sublime scenery exists
                  in this region of Ohio; here some rude freaks of nature had imparted a slight
                  interest to the country. The stream had on either side rude bluffs, covered with
                  timber, with narrow
                  
                     The mother sat on an old stool, with a pipe in her mouth; her hair hung
                        matted over her shoulders; it had once been parted; her form was fragile,
                        her eye a light blue, with an open and generous facet but obscured with
                        filth; the bony fingers of one hand supporting her head, while the other was
                        folded across her chest. PAGE 339.
                   valleys, with groups of sycamores. The stream moved across these narrow
                  flats, and at some points left a space covered with trees, while the opposite
                  shore rose abruptly from the stream. I passed from the main road through a narrow
                  neck of woodland, and as I turned across a green meadow, I saw on the farther
                  side, near the river, under the shade of some butternuts-and sycamores, what I had
                  been told was a human dwelling. The good woman, whose heart was full of humanity,
                  had warned me of what I should meet, and begged me not to turn back, but to see
                  the inside of that human dwelling.
               A rude old hut made of logs stood before me; some bits of board were nailed across
                  the window hole, from which hung a few old rags; the door hung on wooden hinges; I
                  opened it by a wooden latch, and stepped in; a window hole was also cut on the
                  opposite side; rags filled the squares where no glass had been for years, not a
                  light of glass in either window. In one corner stood a rude old bedstead, with elm
                  bark for a cord; a coarse straw tick lay on it, over which was thrown half a
                  cartload of old rags; nothing resembling a sheet or quilt could be seen; the
                  cupboard, a rude structure, had on it three or four plates, a tin cup and basin, a
                  tea-cup or two, and some old spoons, and a few old knives and forks. This
                  habitation for humanity had no chimney, only some stone jambs, without any hearth;
                  and on the log which crossed at that point, sat three children, with their feet in
                  the ashes, covered with rags and filth. A lad of fourteen was shaking with a
                  chill, his eye was black and searching; a slim bony frame; and not a word could I
                  elicit from him; a silent melancholy languor marked all his acts. The two others
                  were younger, one a white tow-headed urchin, with blue eyes, and no breeches. The
                  mother sat on an old stool, with a pipe in her mouth; her hair hung matted over
                  her shoulders; it had once been parted; her form was fragile, her eye a light
                  blue, with an open and generous face,
                  but obscured with filth; the bony fingers of one hand clenched the stump of a
                  pipe, the other was folded across her chest. She smiled as I opened the door, and
                  gave me the only chair in the dwelling; a wooden frame, covered with rags. She
                  seated herself and went on smoking, gazing meantime into a few embers, that
                  flickered against the jambs. Not a broom or mop could be seen, the floor had
                  scarcely ever been washed. The table—but what use had these poor wretches for a
                  table, for they had nothing to eat? The father, in a drunken frolic, had attacked
                  a young man with a stone, and smashed in his skull, and was lying in jail awaiting
                  justice. I was glad he was gone, a human face, disfigured with rum, in the midst
                  of such a group, would have belied the doctrine of Swedenborg—that hell is a
                     stale, and not a place.
               
               Reader, you see, in that broken-hearted, mildewed, blasted, loathsome thing on the
                  stool, the young and innocent Miss L.; she that was so, before the foul and snaky
                  demon had entered her dwelling and crushed her in his coil. Cut off from all human
                  sympathy, she had married a drunkard; she carried with her to his
                     home, the drunkard's hell, the child you saw her kissing sixteen
                  years ago. The poor lad had never known human joy, or human sympathy, or human
                  love; the delight of the human devil, who ruled this group of wretches, was to
                  beat and kick him, and his poor mother had often shared the same fate in his
                  defence. His origin was constantly before him; abused, despised, hated, and
                  oppressed, he revolved his dark fate eternally in his -mind. He knew who his
                  father was, though brutally forsaken; a ray of light sometimes shot into his
                  heart; "My father is the wealthiest man in the county; shall I always live thus?
                  what have I clone, that he thus deserts me? He aspires to political honors; who
                  knows but I too may yet go to Congress?"
               All the year long, this human thing, created a little lower than the angels,
                  watched over these children; she fed them when she could, and smoked to drown her
                  anguish. The mother's heart is a sacred sanctuary; the brightest diamonds of the
                  human soul sparkle in it. I would guard it with a "flaming sword," as God guarded
                  the tree of life.
               How is this, my dear reader, I ask again? Can you tell me how is it, why, in this
                  land of light and Christian benevolence, the seduced one is doomed by the public
                  curse, while the seducer marries into the best families? Will you tell me Rum does
                  much of this; the neck of Rum shall be broken; but the rich rake did the cruelest
                  part of the hellish deed: shall not his neck be broken? Return with me to the
                  afflicted Eugenia. I took her infant in the little walnut box, and carried it to
                  her bedside. I knew how proud she was, how unfeeling she had been; I saw her heart
                  break with anguish, and I forgave her freely, and wept with her, for she had a
                  mother's heart, and her grief was a great one.
               The last child, a boy of sixteen, was now seized with the fatal disorder. Five
                  doctors came together on Sunday, and they did not quarrel, for the frequent deaths
                  had quieted their usual meanness, and they were humbled by the pestilence that
                  walked unseen, and laughed their skill to scorn. The father came to me and said
                  with a broken accent, "Cannot that lad be saved? I cannot lose him, I cannot have
                  him die." To whom, indeed, should he give his riches if he died? To his first
                  born? I said firmly, "I fear I cannot save him; if my brethren can do anything, I
                  shall not oppose them, but do not torture him with medicines; opium and mucilages
                  may save him." I looked into the father's eye, it was full of misery; no human eye
                  sheds a dear light when the soul has drank up a deliberate wrong
                  against a fellow-being, and it never will till God withdraws his fiat: the face is the index to the soul, and
                  shows its meanest and its loftiest attributes.
               I said to him, "There are many children worse than fatherless; feed and console
                  them." His lip quivered, for before his mind's eye stalked the ragged, bony,
                  abused, forsaken boy that I saw in the cabin of the drunkard; and the mother's
                  haggard form was beside him. I had seen them but a week before, the child a
                  withered outcast, the mother a blasted wreck. His father's every lineament was
                  there. Two days after, the form of the last son passed to the narrow house, and
                  lay beside the others. The invisible finger of God had pressed rudely upon the
                  heart-strings of the seducer and deserter, and they shrivelled and cracked under
                  his burning touch. He that forsook his child, and broke the heart of its mother,
                  was himself forsaken, and felt the stroke of the invisible avenger. My soul
                  refused to pity him. He was cursed with gold!!
            
            
               ON HOOPING COUGH.
               WHAT IS HOOPING COUGH? HAS MEDICINE ANY POWER OVER IT?
               IN a former article we considered the subject of croup, or that rapid inflammation
                  of the wind-pipe, characterized by sudden and violent fits of coughing, and coming
                  on at a few-hours' notice, and perhaps invariably from atmospheric causes. We have
                  now to consider a disease of a much more obscure and unmanageable character, and
                  one that has been productive of no less anxiety, not only from its distressing and
                  persistent nature, but from the quackery of those who are relied on to treat it.
                  Whilst we are perfectly satisfied of the causes of croup, and know that judicious
                  treatment will often cut short the attack and save life, we can by no means say
                  the same of hooping cough; for we unhesitatingly avow, that we not only do not
                  know in what it originates, but that there is no medicine with which we are
                  acquainted, that will have any regular and curative effect upon it.
               Hooping cough may occur at all periods of infant or adult life, and at all seasons
                  of the year; although experience proves it to be far less common during the two or
                  three first months of infancy. It is unquestionably an infectious disease;
                  although we may not be able to trace the first case occurring in a family or a
                  village—nay, although (and we ourselves have not a doubt of it) the first case may
                  occur from atmospheric or other causes unknown to us, and without any
                  communication with one who has the disease—still this case will undoubtedly
                  communicate the disease to an immense
                  proportion of all the children, or even adults, who have not had it, and are
                  brought into the same apartment with the subject who has it. We consider all
                  speculations as regards the nature of the poison, whatever it may be, that causes
                  the disease, to be worse than useless; because they occupy time and observation,
                  that may be more profitably bestowed on the symptoms and consequences; or, in
                  other words, those other and secondary diseases of the lungs and head, which the
                  violent fits of coughing so often produce.
               The disease commences with the ordinary symptoms of a common catarrh or cold, and
                  it is often said by mothers, that "it turns into hooping cough." They say the same
                  of measles and for the selfsame reason, or because it also begins with the
                  symptoms of cold. Now, physicians often call this an absurd conclusion, because
                  colds are not contagious, and measles and hooping cough are. Let the reader
                  reflect for one moment upon the immense universality with which both measles and
                  hooping cough appear over whole regions of country, and the absurdity of supposing
                  that all its subjects could have had communication with local centres where the
                  disease existed, and he will see at once that the mother is probably often
                  perfectly correct in her conclusions; indeed, we often cannot trace it to any
                  source of contagion, for the good and sufficient reason, that there has really
                  been no exposure. This is of no importance as it regards the fact of its
                  infectious character, however it may otherwise be produced. Very certain it is,
                  that those children who have never had it, and in whom it is desirable to defer
                  its occurrence, either from the existence of winter, or the debility of the child,
                  had better not be taken where it exists, for the chances are almost certain they
                  will take it.
               After the child has been exposed eight or ten days, or a fortnight (and we have
                  even known three weeks to elapse), it will, after having coughed more or less
                  during this time, begin to hoop. This hooping noise is produced by the urgent
                  necessity the child has to draw in or inspire air, after a great number of coughs,
                  all, as it were outward—or in other words, all attended with expiration. The hoop
                  is undoubtedly produced by reason of the opening or glottis, and also the little
                  branches of the windpipe (or; as we call its two great branches and its
                  innumerable divisions, the bronchiæ and their tubes), being more or less filled
                  with mucus; and thus the entrance of the air is rendered extremely difficult, and
                  the great opening of the windpipe is affected with spasmodic closure, from the
                  irritation of its nerves by the want of circulation in the blood-vessels. Now let
                  us. explain this spasm of the "glottis," as we call it.
               Where the child cannot, in consequence of the violence of the cough, draw in any
                  fresh air, the blood becomes temporarily poisoned for want of oxygen, and the
                  consequent accumulation of carbonic acid; and that becomes a powerful irritant to
                  the opening of the windpipe, and causes it to close with spasmodic force, The same
                  condition in this important opening will occur, in a less degree, on entering a
                  small unventilated room where there is much carbonic acid gas, either from a
                  charcoal or anthracite fire, or a great number of people; it causes much of the
                  coughing in assembly rooms, concert rooms, and churches—to frequenting which
                  habitually, so many persons owe their ill health.
               That the contagion of hooping cough is of a very subtle character, receives very
                  extraordinary confirmation from the fact, that it may be communicated to a child
                  within its mother's womb; this is also a proof that it first poisons the blood,
                  for it can only reach the child through the mother's blood. Dr. Watson, of London,
                  upon more than one occasion, has observed the child to hoop almost the instant it
                  was brought into the world; he cites the special case of the child of one of his
                  hospital nurses. The subject of contagion is a very curious one. The only point we
                     feel inclined to notice about it, is
                  one that we have been accustomed to view as an original observation of our own,
                  published some seven years since in our "Treatise on Diseases of the Sexual
                  System," in reference to syphilis communicated to the child from the father,
                  through the mother's blood; and since very extensively claimed by others. It is
                  this: that these diseases, in whatever kind of poison they originate, whether
                  atmospheric, vegetable or animal, must require another entity, equally distinct,
                  and both capable of being described, did we know what they are, in order to I join
                  with it and the two together, to produce the palpable disease, viz.—hooping cough,
                  measles, small-pox, syphilis or what not. I consider this sufficiently proved by
                  the fact, that some persons seem to be insusceptible of one or other of these
                  infectious or contagious diseases, as is repeatedly observed by every practical
                  man; the only possible solution of which phenomenon must be, that the individual
                  who is thus -proved to be insusceptible of the particular disease, does not
                  furnish the other item necessary to its production. This is a curious fact, and so
                  far as we know, first mentioned in the work alluded to.
               When the system has once been infected with hooping cough, it very rarely occurs
                  again; the person, for the most part, enjoying an immunity ever after. This is not
                  always true of any infectious disease, however; for we have seen measles, hooping
                  cough, mumps, scarlet fever, and small-pox—every one of them taken the second
                  time. The smallpox has appeared in this city, on a number of persons who were much
                  pitted from previous attack.
               It is not singular, that in proportion as the mucus which is thrown off in the
                  paroxysms of coughing, is thin and scanty, the cough should be more violent; when
                  it is thick and abundant, the air contained in the cells and bronchial tubes of
                  the lungs, acts more readily upon the mucus, and forces it out m the violent
                  expiration of the cough. During the fit of coughing!, the little creature will
                  instinctively fix its legs and catch hold of a table, the chimney-piece or its
                  mother's gown, with the view of fixing its arms so as to bring their upper
                  muscles, which are also attached to the ribs and collar-bone, in use, as temporary
                  aids to assist in raising the ribs at the earliest possible moment, so that a
                  supply of air may enter. Sometimes it becomes black in the face before this
                  occurs; all the cough being outwards, as it were, and no inspiration being
                  possible: it is this, by preventing the return of blood from the head through the
                  great jugular veins, sometimes causes dropsy of the head, and even apoplexy. The
                  blood accumulates, and either throws out its watery part from the delicate vessels
                  of the membranes of the brain, or else some larger vessel bursts, and the blood is
                  effused under the skull. This is not, however, common; and strange to say, without
                  these violent consequences, the hooping cough is not usually a dangerous
                  disease.
               Its period of duration is from six weeks to three months. It is usually most
                  enduring and violent in winter and changeable weather; for this reason mothers
                  should be extremely careful to avoid exposing a delicate child in the fall months,
                  or in variable weather. The idea that as the child must have the disease at some
                  time, the season is of no consequence, is therefore very wrong. A delicate child
                  may recover in the summer, who would inevitably die of either the head symptoms or
                  inflammation of the lungs in winter.
               Teething, from the determination of blood to the head during that process—I now
                  mean the earliest or first teething—is a very dangerous complication. Convulsions
                  often occur at that time; scrofulous children are also often victims to head and
                  lung complications in hooping cough: indeed, all feeble children during their
                  first two years, are far more seriously affected by it.
               Inflammation of the lungs and bronchitis, are its frequent attendants, and these complaints often demand
                  treatment, if the simple disease does not; both these affections greatly increase
                  the fever and general distress, and it is on their account that the child requires
                  to be watched by a conscientious, but not a meddlesome physician. The mother who
                  insists upon the constant administration of physic, is not only a fool, but she
                  may have to charge her child's death to that folly.
               It will not be expected, in an article of a purely rational and cautionary
                  character, addressed to the common sense of our readers, that we should go into
                  the detail of these consequences of hooping cough and their treatment. Such a
                  course would give a very poor idea of our estimate of their intellect, because
                  they cannot be accurate judges of the derangements of the lining force, and how
                  far it can go to constitute disease requiring treatment. With regard to the
                  propriety of any course of treatment designed, as physicians often absurdly say,
                  "to cut short the disease," we emphatically assert all such pretensions to be
                  absurd. It is evident enough, that every infectious and febrile disease,
                  originating from a specific poison, must have its regular period of
                     duration—i. e., it cannot be thrown out of the system, until it
                  has exhausted its force upon it. "When we have thus expressed ourselves, it is
                  plain enough that any set method of treatment can find no favor in our eyes.
                  Indeed we see no reason for mentioning any one medicine as more valuable than
                  another; or, indeed, any internal treatment whatever in the complaint. Nothing can
                  be more amusing, than to hear some theoretical gentlemen, who boast of their
                  "great experience" talk over their old see-saw practice of Sal Tartar and
                  Cochineal, Ipecac, &c., &c. The younger and heroic gentlemen, who must be
                  doing something, go in for Prussic Acid and other Samsons of the materia medica,
                  such as Calomel and Tartar Emetic; but it is all a mere matter of money-getting.
                  No medical treatment whatever for the simple and uncomplicated disease, but a most
                  jealous and religious attention to absolute warmth of dress, flannels
                  to the skin, and thick shoes and woolen stockings, if the child walks—should be
                  the parent's sole duty. The atmosphere of the room should never be below 70° in
                  winter, and in the summer all drafts of air, and the evening, air, should be
                  avoided. Gentle and repeated frictions with the hand of the mother, over the chest
                  and spine, will always do good. The child should never be stripped entirely when
                  washed; only portions at a time should be rubbed with a little alcohol and water.
                  Milk, eggs, and a little broth of mutton or beef, should form the diet. All syrups
                  and other trash, derange the stomach and injure the child's capacity to recover
                  from the paroxysms of coughing. The disease, under this treatment, will wear
                  itself out in six weeks or three months, and that is the whole of the matter.
               So long as the child recovers readily from the paroxysms, it needs no physician.
                  When other and more serious distress exists, that mother is either destitute of
                  feeling, or stupid with ignorance, who does not call in an honest and intellectual
                  medical man.
            
            
               
               RECOLLECTIONS OF CITY PRACTICE.
               BY A SEXAGENARIAN.
               No thought comes o'er the spirit with more subduing influence, than that which
                  assures us we outlive the warmth of early friendships. Often, when I gather a few
                  of the Autumn leaves, as they rustle by my footsteps in the old forest path, where
                  I love to revive the memories of the past, I trace in their fading outline the
                  hopes and aspirations of earlier life. But yesterday they danced-in the sunbeam,
                  whose rays had warmed them into being: now they have fulfilled the end of their
                  existence, and as they are driven about by the chill autumnal wind, they remind me
                  of the erratic course of my professional life, now long past its noon, and give me
                  an expressive warning, that I, too, shall be soon called on to pay back my own
                  contingent to that great laboratory, where all the old and familiar forms are
                  remoulded; but where, thank God, hope originates from despair.
               Yet there are some scenes I can never forget: their impression is ever and anon
                  renewed, as I retrace the course of my youthful life. Like that magic ink to which
                  the poor prisoner gives expression by the warmth of his own heart, and then by the
                  feeble light that glimmers through his prison bars, endeavors to trace the
                  characters that tell him he is still loved, though lost to the friend that traced
                  them, I gladly seize at times on the slightest vibration of some trembling
                  heart-tone, that tells me of buried joys, and dwell with fondness upon the kind
                  words of friendship, the dear old familiar face, "the eyes that shone, now dimmed
                  and gone." I love to linger over these leaflets of memory, and pore over them as
                  they take fitful form by the little warmth of sympathy that is yet left me, after
                  sixty years' collision with a rude world. I retrace their dim outline through my
                  own prison bars—for what are we all but prisoners to our bodies, our passion and
                  our absurd aspirations! Great God! when I look back on my eventful life, methinks
                  it is some dream of a former and partially-recalled existence, flitting like the
                  mere ghost of memory amidst the ruins of blighted affections and crushed
                  aspirations.
               And yet my professional habits still cling to me. With so long experience in
                  comparing my own weaknesses with those of my fellows, I am far from selfish. I
                  even yet enjoy a melancholy satisfaction in hastening to relieve the sufferings of
                  the poor of my neighborhood, though I know that my reward will be very small; or,
                  what is far more frequent, that I shall be paid with ingratitude, if not slander.
                  Sometimes, there are bright spots in my horizon, and I think myself more than
                  repaid by a new shirt or a couple of handkerchiefs—the gift of some poor but
                  grateful sewing girl. I treasure a few of these little presents with peculiar
                  care; but there is one—— * * * * Let me relate the history of her who gave it; it
                  may serve to warn some unhappy creature from trifling with the affections of the
                  innocent.
               I commenced practice, as you have often heard me say, in P——, nearly forty years
                  since. My good mother-and oh! how tenderly I loved her-managed, with the wreck of
                  her little fortune, to give me the best education that my erratic habits and the
                  then celebrated University of P—— would afford, and soon after I graduated, a
                  rapid consumption took her away from us. She left me, with an only sister, to test my abilities in procuring a
                  subsistence for both.
               My father had been dead since my infancy, and being the only male protector, I was
                  not unacquainted with the requirements of domestic life. My poor father, after a
                  failure in business, had managed, by a forced parsimony and over-exertions in a
                  commercial agency, that probably cost him his life, to bequeath us a small house,
                  in which my sister and I managed to subsist, by a continuance of the same severe
                  restrictions in our expenditure, that we were obliged to submit to during our
                  earlier years. As soon as we recovered from the desolating feeling of our mother's
                  death, my sister and I made our plans for the grand battle with the hungry wolf.
                  Our house afforded ample room for two gentlemen lodgers, who were contented to
                  take their quiet morning and evening meals with us. They soon removed any remnant
                  of the absurd professional pride I had begun to cultivate, by the deference and
                  respect they showed my gentle sister, and their high estimation of my medical
                  opinion. So sincere were they, that I soon felt their influence in my small
                  practice; scarce a day elapsed, that some patient did not help my pocket and the
                  professional dignity of my quiet office, by a consultation. Before the close of
                  the year, I had the inexpressible satisfaction of restoring the younger of my
                  mercantile friends, an only son, to the arms of a mother, after a long attack of
                  typhus fever. She came on from a distant town to assist my sister and myself in
                  nursing him. I was much attached to him. So highly-toned and gentlemanly a young
                  man I had never before met with.
               When I willingly assumed those duties of a nurse, that I would not permit his
                  delicate mother nor my sister to attend to, he used to take my hand and kiss it
                  with all the tenderness of a lover, as he would apologize for the trouble he gave
                  me. One day, lie begged me particularly not to lay the letters I brought from the
                  post-office, on the parlor table, as his mother had noticed that he received some
                  with great regularity, in a delicate hand. He seemed very pensive when he made the
                  request, and told me, with some impressiveness, he would have occasion, at some
                  future time, for a further exercise of my friendship. On several occasions after
                  this, on the receipt of these letters, which I regularly brought him, I observed
                  traces of tears. I did not obtrude my sympathy upon him, though God knows I had
                  learned to feel deeply for him. Cut off by my poverty and morbid pride, from the
                  society of my equals, and treated with the customary tender mercies of my seniors,
                  I felt the value of my friend's kindness and courtesy.
               He was yet feeble, and had been barely able to sit at breakfast for two mornings,
                  when, to our great surprise, he assured me he was obliged to go to a town in a
                  distant part of the State, to attend to some special commercial business, which he
                  only could transact; as he occupied the position of confidential clerk in a
                  commercial house in the city, and although I was much surprised at the suddenness
                  of this announcement, on the quiet assertion that the business could be attended
                  to by no other, I yielded to his assurance of its necessity, and saw him on board
                  the steamboat, with much anxiety and many cautions. The promised letter soon
                  arrived, announcing his safe arrival and the assurance that he would again be
                  "home" in a few days.
               I had noticed with pain and apprehension, my sister's subdued quiet, when our
                  lodger left us, and was, I hardly know why, uneasy and jealous at the tenderness
                  with which his mother took leave of her, and assured her she should ever consider
                  her as her own child, and me as her son. I was, moreover much impressed with the
                  singular design of a very costly bracelet she fastened on my sister's arm as she
                  left us; four hearts set in brilliants on an azure ground, surrounded with a
                  delicate border of gold, on which these words were engraved—" A mother's love for her child: once
                  there was three: let me dream they are still here." She had lost her other two
                  children a few years before.
               The gift and the sentiment were sufficiently delicate, and certainly it was worthy
                  of my dear sister as well as of the giver, whose life was purity itself; but
                  somehow it made me very thoughtful, and when a couple of weeks more had elapsed,
                  and our lodger did not return, and my sister seemed more subdued, and showed, to
                  my apprehensive and jealous eye, that she suffered, I determined to call on the
                  firm where my friend was employed, and ascertain when he would arrive. I was
                  certainly both surprised and shocked to see him, the mere ghost of a man,
                  occupying his accustomed position at the desk, in the private room of his
                  employers. His embarrassment was evident, and after a hasty inquiry of Ms health,
                  I was about retiring, when he hurriedly closed the door and begged me to be
                  seated.
               I soon saw from his manner, that he was about to make a communication trying to
                  his feelings, and as I had a tender regard for him, I begged him not to distress
                  himself, adding, that although friendship would seem to demand that I should share
                  his troubles, that I had perhaps better not become the possessor of his secret,
                  and that my sister and I would always be glad to receive him, if we could do so
                  with propriety. "Your sister! my friend—my brother; it was she and her love for my
                  mother, who prevented my seeking your counsel and your roof on my return; indeed,
                  had you not called, I should never have dared address you again." I now begged him
                  to explain, as my sister's sadness and the connection of his trouble with her
                  name, gave me a right to know what it was.
               He continued: "You remember my request about secreting those letters from my
                  mother. You must have noticed my distress upon several occasions after I had
                  received one." I answered him that I had, and had been very anxious for his
                  evident grief; but that I supposed they related to some tender secret I have no
                  right to inquire into, if unsolicited to receive it. "Oh, my friend, my brother!
                  but I have no right to call you by that of such damning villainy. When I confess
                  to you my crime, what will your sister say?"
               In the name of heaven, my poor friend, let me know your grief, and I will aid you
                  if possible. You are not, I trust in God, involved in pecuniary trouble with your
                  firm; are you a defaulter?—have you gambled? Tell me all."
               "Oh, worse, worse! I am a murderer! I have broken two hearts, and filled one
                  grave. help me, my friend, to repair the dreadful wrong I have done to her who is
                  as innocent as heaven. Go with me to-night, and I will add the measure of your
                  contempt for one who is not fit to address you longer. When you see her, you will
                  know what a wretch you harbored under your roof, and how bold in my villainy I
                  must have been, to venture to obtrude myself on the presence of your dear
                  sister."
               My temper prompted me to reply to him sternly, but prudence and pride prevented;
                  for I only suspected my sister's affection to be slightly engaged to this bad
                  though fascinating man, and my mother's spirit within me revolted at so vile a
                  contamination of her blood. His melancholy face, yet pale from his dreadful
                  sickness, had assumed an expression of intense abstraction; with knit brow,
                  half-closed eyes and compressed lips, he seemed looking into the future for the
                  approach of his merited punishment. I felt for him; such is my nature.
               our interview had lasted nearly to the business hour, and as he was in no
                  condition to face his employers, I took leave of him, telling him I would await
                  his commands after dark in the evening. He gave me the number of his lodgings, and
                  assured me he would be deeply grateful for my professional aid; my sympathy for his crime he
                  would not ask. He need not have added the latter expression, for I never had any
                  for the sin he had committed.
               I was detained at home in my office that evening, having lingered rather longer
                  than usual over my tea, whilst observing my sister's deportment on learning that;
                  our lodger had taken other apartments. I had observed quite enough for the
                  obliteration of my hopes of happiness, for I felt that I never could consent to
                  her union with a man for whom I could feel no respect. She was evidently attached
                  to him; there are a thousand ways in which the physician can judge of such things,
                  that other men know nothing of; whilst others think we are obtuse to all the more
                  delicate appreciations of feeling, we only seem to ignore them, because the
                  occasion for their exercise is so frequent, that they are calculated to detract
                  from the proper discharge of our more immediate duties. I merely told her, that
                  the necessity of protecting a female relative, had made it necessary for him to
                  take other apartments. I need have said no more to convey to her the entire
                  affair. She perceived my embarrassment, and, with a woman's instinct, read the,
                  whole; she, too, had observed the letters, and now her estimate of their character
                  was evidently confirmed. Poor girl! I noticed her paleness, her trembling voice,
                  and the unusual strength of the tea she swallowed; and whilst I mentally cursed
                  the destroyer of her happiness, I mercifully spared her my presence. I could not
                  question her on the subject, for my dear sister and I rather understood each
                  other's sympathy by intuition, than by expression. No words of sisterly or
                  brotherly endearment ever passed, between us, and so singular and reserved had
                  been our habits, that our lips had never met in that holy kiss of brother's and
                  sister's love, since the time when our poor mother folded our infant arms
                  together, when she would bid us good night, and leave us in our little bed, to
                  that sweet sleep she never allowed herself till midnight; for she-alas! my angel
                  mother!-was occupied with the needle, to eke out our subsistence.
               Leaving my poor sister, I sought the apartments where our lodger had taken his!
                  unfortunate victim, under an assumed name, as his wife. They were barely decent
                  lodgings, in the outskirts of the city, selected not for meanness—for he was
                  naturally extravagant—but in order to avoid observation. Inquiring for Mr.
                  Dullagher, I was introduced into a front room on the second floor; whilst waiting,
                  I heard my former lodger's voice and the words, "Don't be alarmed, dearest; he is
                  a gentleman in every respect." He entered almost immediately, and led the way into
                  the chamber where the poor young creature lay.
               I was prepared to see an interesting person, for I knew his extraordinary
                  admiration of female beauty; but my ideas were far short of the reality. A woman
                  may have features of faultless beauty; she may resemble a Venus or an Eve of the
                  statuary, but marble cannot look at you; its dead and soulless eye cannot reflect
                  the speaking glance, telling of cherished hope and blighted affection; it cannot,
                  like the living one, speak the bursting heart, whilst it looks tenderly, and with
                  forgiving glance upon its destroyer, and seems to beg you to spare him rather than
                  to pity her.
               Such a mournful and sweet face met my gaze, as I took the hand of my patient,
                  whilst her destroyer leaned his pale forehead against the wall and audibly sobbed.
                  I had never before seen so lovely a face. On my entrance, as I extended my hand to
                  her, she neither wept nor looked ashamed of her position. She greeted me in
                  silence; a moment elapsed, and as the sobs of her lover fell upon her ear, she
                  turned eagerly towards him, whilst the very fountain of love seemed overflowing
                  her woman's soul, as she rose up and extended her beautiful white arms to him. I
                  thought of Mary at the tomb of the Saviour. Nor do I believe that he would have
                  reproved her, had he stood before her in my place.
               
               "Why do you weep, Frederick? I lore you, and you used to say you asked no more of
                  heaven. Our purposed marriage, too, ought surely to satisfy you that you have done
                  me no wrong. I will now consent to it, whenever you please; for now I
                  believe it will comfort you, if I should have to leave you."
               "Oh, talk not so, my love—my life! You shall not die! I was drunk with ridiculous,
                  vulgar ambition. Oh, monstrous! to think that I could have refused you the
                  wretched consolation of a name tarnished with dishonorable baseness; that I could
                  see her only friend—her mother—droop away under the disgrace of the gentle
                  creature she had nourished through long years of chilling poverty, and see her
                  drop into the grave a poor wilted and forsaken thing, and leave her dear child
                  alone I Oh God, pity me! for I need it. What can wash me clear of this crime?"
               His eloquent self-condemnation was too just to fail in exciting her tears; she had
                  joined them with his, for he had now sunk upon his knees at her bedside. She had
                  raised herself in bed; and as her loosened and beautiful black hair fell in a
                  large mass over her eyes, it reminded me of the wing of the death angel. Nothing
                  is so expressive as the lustre of the human eye, relieved by a mass of black hair;
                  and nothing so mournful, when we remember its effect in life, to see it drooping
                  over those windows of the soul when they are closed in death.
               I withdrew into the front room, for I confess I had need of a moment's quiet, to
                  compose myself. I had yet made no inquiry into the medical character of the case;
                  and although I neither knew nor anticipated why their gloomy forebodings should be
                  realized, I know not why my own prognosis should have been a melancholy one. It
                  may have been the consciousness of the great importance I have always attached to
                  the influence of a happy state of the emotions, at so interesting a crisis of a
                  woman's life—it may have been her
                     His eloquent self-condemnation was too just to fail in exciting her
                        tears; she had joined them with his, for he had how sunk upon his knees at
                        her bedside. She had raised herself in bed; and her loosened and beautiful
                        black hair fell in a large mass over her eyes, it reminded me of the wing of
                        the death angel. PAGE 358
                  
                   evident delicacy—I know not why it was;
                  but from the moment my eye rested on that black tress of her hair; it was
                  associated with her death pall.
               I returned to the bedside, and her satisfactory answers to my questions convinced
                  me, that she was destined to pass her first great trial in a few days. I took my
                  leave, with such cheering words of encouragement as ever spring to the lips of the
                  physician, who will not consent to chill the warmth of his soul by the blighting
                  influence of selfishness, promising to call frequently.
               The unfortunate young man walked forth with me; his nerves were sadly shaken, and
                  I begged him to retire; but he said he had much to tell me. In a few words he
                  informed me, that his illness had been caused by reckless exposure to typhus on
                  board an emigrant ship, in consequence of the importunity of her poor mother, that
                  he would do her child the melancholy justice of marriage, when she saw the result
                  of her confidence in his intentions. He had deceived us all in her place of abode;
                  for she lived in a small town near the city of my residence—so near, indeed, that
                  he often made it the terminus, of an afternoon's drive. It was on one of these
                  pleasure excursions, that her angelic beauty attracted his gaze, as he rode
                  through the village. Strange to say, in a few days, although educated with strict
                  propriety, she allowed him to address her, under pretence of inquiring the way, as
                  she was returning with some colored prints to a book-store, the owner of which
                  employed her mother to color them and as she was the only other member of the
                  family, the duty of returning them fell upon her.
               Such was the address of this fascinating young man, that the poor mother fell into
                  the snare, and allowed him to address her daughter. There were times, he told me,
                  in which he would gladly have married her; but on his enthusiastic description of
                  her, his friends ridiculed him, and he
                  finally steeled Ms heart, until the attack of illness that made us acquainted with
                  his mother. During that attack, the letters he received from poor Ellen, so
                  subdued his spirit by their tenderness, that he resolved to hasten to her the
                  moment his recovery would allow, and make her his wife. The day on which, after
                  his illness, he announced his sudden departure on the pretended commercial
                  business, he received a letter, informing him of the greatly-increased illness of
                  Ellen's mother, who had been for some months in a declining state, in consequence
                  of the melancholy condition and disgrace of her daughter. He arrived only in time
                  to receive her last sigh, and to promise marriage and protection to her he had so
                  deeply injured.
               The poor girl's grief was terrible. As soon as her mother was buried, as she did
                  not wish to remain in the village, she left their little cottage, under the
                  protection of a trusty neighbor, who had been her mother's nurse and schoolmate,
                  and came with her lover to the city. He informed me it was his design to ask my
                  professional advice immediately, but he feared to expose himself to me, for he
                  knew my estimation of his crime.
               He was now thoroughly subdued by grief and apprehension for the dear girl he had
                  so terribly injured; he conjured me to save her, by every term of endearment. I
                  told him that I knew no reason why she should not recover from her confinement,
                  like any other woman; that a fatal event was very rare; but, considering the
                  unhappy influences of mental distress upon a delicate organism, where there was no
                  experience, and evidently very gloomy apprehension of the result, that he should
                  immediately grant her all the quiet that would follow from a marriage. He assented
                  instantly; nor would he leave me until we together called upon a friend of mine,
                  whose kind and excellent heart and soothing words had brought comfort to many a
                  dying and friendless creature, whose death-bed I was destined to attend. Our
                  compact was a mutual one, and we freely commanded each other's services night and
                  day. The marriage was appointed for next morning, before the business hour; and
                  the young-man seemed to derive comfort from the arrangement. I bade him good
                  night, and promised to be with him at eight o'clock.
               My sister was in waiting for me, and seemed more pensive than usual. Although I
                  was extremely anxious to know the actual state of her attachment to this
                  unfortunate young man, I knew it had not been openly professed; I thought it best,
                  therefore, to let the influence of a separation have its silent effect, and to
                  divert her, as soon as possible, by a visit to your city—during which I load, if
                  you remember, the pleasure of forming your acquaintance. I therefore bade her good
                  night, and retired dream of man's injustice. At eight o'clock I was with them.
               My clerical friend arrived at the moment, and we found our couple in the humble
                  parlor, quietly awaiting our arrival. Ellen looked very lovely, and the groom full
                  of devotion and tenderness. A sweet bouquet bloomed upon the little table, and I
                  noticed that the bride had been engaged embroidering a pretty design on a
                  handkerchief that lay on the same table; it was only partly finished, and she had
                  evidently laid it down on our arrival. Every thing about the room, and herself,
                  including her dress of deep mourning for her mother, was in perfect arid beautiful
                  order. On my expressing surprise at her industry at so early an hour, her lover
                  observed that he never rode out to her little cottage, however early, without
                  finding her at her needle or in her little garden. Dear child! I often think of
                  her sweet face and melting eyes, and that first association of the
                  dark lock of her hair, that fell over them when I first saw her—alas! how ominous
                  it was.
               After a short interview, our friend proceeded with the ceremony in the presence of
                  myself and our remaining lodger, who
                  had been intrusted with the secret, and who was the only person to whom the groom
                  felt willing to tell it. He was a quiet, well-disposed, and gentlemanly man, with
                  no very strong emotions of any kind; one of those excellent persons who slide
                  easily through the world, and are sure of great esteem whilst living, and it a
                  very respectable funeral." My good friend, the clergyman, though ii model of
                  excellence, was not oppressed with that delicate appreciation of the sorrows of a
                  woman's heart, that would have prevented him, if he had possessed it, approaching
                  that altar of the soul that is ever sacred to the true physician. Accordingly, in
                  his extemporaneous prayer, he was making rapid approaches towards that unfortunate
                  woman of the Bible, who was the subject of those touching remarks of the Saviour.
                  Fortunately I stood next him, and if his reverend elbow suffered by the manner in
                  which the abductor muscles of my thumb and finger tried to approximate with that
                  important joint between them, I can only say, I meant no disrespect for the cloth
                  or the occasion—but a holy sympathy for her who had elicited the evidently sincere
                  intention. My friend filled up the hiatus in his prayer, as well as might be
                  expected on so awkward an occasion; he subsequently begged me never to allude to
                  the circumstance, for the good man deemed it nothing short of sacrilege. I excused
                  myself, on the ground of doctors being exceptions to all rules; but I am fain to
                  say, I never regretted my promptness in applying the bit to his reverence's
                  tongue, by way of the nerves of his elbow; and think I shall take the precaution
                  to drill my clerical helpmate on a similar occasion, before his services are
                  required.
               A few clays only intervened, before I was summoned to, attend my patient in her
                  first great trial. I had seen her daily during the interval, and found her so
                  quiet and comparatively happy, that I anticipated no trouble: nor was there any.
                  Her husband waited on her with the greatest devotion and tenderness, and was so
                  greatly agitated and depressed during the labor, that I was finally obliged to
                  request my patient to entreat his absence. Never have I witnessed such relief as
                  his countenance expressed, when I led him to the bedside to behold his wife—her
                  face beaming with a mother's love for her first-born. I have often told my artist
                  friends, that if they would ever know the pencil's highest aim, they must witness
                  the change from the speechless, agony of child-birth, to that radiant soul-felt
                  joy that steals over the young mother's face, "when she feels for the first time
                  her first-born's breath." The face of my young patient was more beautiful than
                  heaven. That smile! Oh, it must have been reflected from some angers face, who
                  came to call her away from her husband and child; it was, like all other things so
                  beautiful and bright, soon to fade for ever from, earth. Let me hasten to the
                  close; for oh! how near it was. No unpleasant symptom appeared till the third
                  clay, and even then, the slight febrile symptoms that prepare the pure fountain of
                  nourishment for the child, did not excite my apprehension. All was still well,
                  when, on the fourth day, a violent chill succeeded an unfortunate and
                  uncontrollable burst of grief, at a prolonged view of her poor mother's
                  picture—the work of a young artist who had been sheltered in their humble abode.
                  The nurse told me, that it was of near an hour's duration, and it had not yielded
                  to her very judicious measures, when I arrived. The husband had been hastily
                  summoned from his counting-house, and ran frantically to my office. I was
                  fortunately at home, and in a few minutes at my patient's bedside. What measures
                  occurred to me were instantly put in practice, and I an once personally summoned a
                  near friend, for I am naturally desponding in such cases, and all my gloomy first
                  impressions were revived.
               Why prolong the sad narrative? All that three of us could do—for we had summoned a
                  very eminent professional brother—was
                  done. On the seventh day, it was evident the scene would soon be over. I can now
                  relate it calmly, for 'tis more than thirty years since, and my own griefs have
                  quieted me.
               It often happens, that a mother dying of those fatal fevers that follow
                  child-birth, becomes insensible to maternal love; but my young patient was an
                  exception. During the intervals of her pain, she manifested the fondest attachment
                  to her child. She barely allowed its occasional removal from her side, to give it
                  food. Once, during my presence at her bedside, she placed her hand upon her
                  breasts, from which the milk had quite disappeared, and looking mournfully at her
                  infant, could not control her tears. Poor baby, thought I, it is well for him that
                  he does not realize the difference; for he will never receive his nourishment from
                  that source Upon remarking that he fed well, and all might yet end happily, she
                  took my hand, and pressing it to her lips, she said, "You comforter; but never—no,
                  Doctor; I am sinking; I feel it in my freedom from pain." 'Twas, indeed, a fatal
                  symptom, "I leave you and him"—placing her hand upon her husband's head, who could
                  not control his emotion—"I go to join her. Be kind to him; he loved
                  me always—yes, from the first moment. I feel it." He uttered an imprecation on
                  himself; she instantly checked him, with more energy than I thought she yet
                  possessed. "Never, Frederick, my love; use such a terrible expression. Be always
                  calm—calm—calm—!" She was exhausted by the exertion, and gasped for breath. "Be
                  calm; your passions are your only fault; your heart is good. Doctor, he is good.
                  Remember the Saviour; he was calm, and oh, how pure was his love for all! Doctor,
                  will you—may I now, without selfishness, ask a boon of you, who are
                  all goodness? Do you know what he thinks of you?—how he loves you? Next to me,
                  Doctor, and his mother; next to us." I replied, that her slightest wish, could I
                  know it, would be sacred to me. "Then, Doctor, when I am gone, take him and my
                  dear child back to your roof and your heart. His mother never knew me, thank God!
                  I could not have looked at her." He cried out in his agony, "She would have loved
                  you, my angel, my darling; she would have worshipped you, but she would have
                  despised me. Oh, God! I am glad she knows not my baseness." The dying wife placed
                  her hand on his mouth. "Doctor, you have a sister: will she love it? Frederick has
                  told me she was like a sister to him and how she once valued a mother's love.
                  Doctor, will you love it for your mother's sake and for my sake? Take this little
                  gift" (handing me the handkerchief she was at work upon the morning of her
                  wedding; you shall see it some day, my dear Doctor), "and when you look at it,
                  remember the giver's prayer, and love my child." I received the gift, and placed
                  it near my heart. My tears blinded me; I felt the sacredness of the promise, and
                  bowed my head as I told her her wish should ever be as near to me as the memory of
                  the giver.
               Her husband's looks assured me of his sufferings and his gratitude. Believing that
                  she was not yet near her end by a few hours, I knew that one thing remained for me
                  to do, to make her departure happy; and that was, the presence of woman she who
                  was "last at his cross, and earliest at her Saviour's grave." I resolved, that
                  however it would harrow her feelings, I would bring my dear sister to her, and let
                  her receive the sacred gift of the- child from the hands of the dying mother.
               I pressed her thin cold hand to my lips, and hastened to my home, leaving her
                  alone with her suffering and now tearless partner. On my way, my knowledge, of my
                  sister's affection for the fascinating man, who had caused all this misery, made
                  me hesitate; but I knew her noble nature, and that she had cultivated self-control
                  till it made me revere her above all other woman. I resolved she should know all; that she should, with a
                  woman's instinct, form her own ideas of the husband's attachment to his dying
                  wife, and ever after be able to estimate correctly his real worth as a man.
               Bidding her hastily make her toilet, I placed her in my carriage, and for the
                  first time in my adult life, addressed her with deep and expressed feeling; for,
                  as I said before, we had hitherto known each other by intuition—not expression.
                  "My dear sister," said I, "you are about to experience a severe trial. The wife of
                  a dear friend is dying, and I wish you to receive from her hand an unprotected
                  infant. I have already promised her you will, but she knows not of your coming."
                  She turned pale, and I knew at once she had, with a woman's instinct, connected
                  the whole subject with the absence of our lodger, and what I had told her of the
                  necessity of its protection to a relative. In a moment, however, she answered me:
                  "Go on, brother; I have now but one wish—to please you." I understood her meaning,
                  and that she knew all. Pressing her for the first time to my heart, I observed she
                  trembled, but instantly controlled herself, imputing it to the chill air.
               On our arrival, it was necessary to introduce her to the bed-side. Our patient was
                  still conscious, but dying. The husband bowed his head and spoke not. Approaching
                  the poor dying young creature, I said: "You begged me to receive your child, and
                  asked me if my sister would love it. My mother's spirit whispered me, let my other
                  child answer, I have therefore brought my sister to you."
               My sister kissed her now pale lips; I raised the arm of the dying mother and
                  placed it about her neck. She slightly drew the weeping girl to her, and
                  distinctly said, "Bless you, my dear-bless you;" then, with much effort, she
                  continued, "I never had a sister, but my dear mother would have been happier with
                  you—oh! far happier. She loved her poor child, and will bless you for your
                  kindness. You will love my child; I know it, or you would not have come." My
                  sister kissed her again and again. "Bless you, dear—bless you. Where is he? Where
                  is Frederick?" "Here, dearest," groaned the poor husband, "here. Yet—Oh God! canst
                  thou not even yet—?" He was tearless; his countenance showed the fearful agony of
                  his soul. He placed his hand upon her heart, in doubt, for her eyes were now
                  closed, and she seemed to have ceased breathing. Suddenly she opened them with
                  evident intelligence, and fixed them steadily on the ceiling. I caught that
                  peculiar look of the dying, I had several times before seen, when all on earth is
                  passing away, and they seem to see into another state of existence. We stepped
                  aside from her face, fearful of distracting her gaze from him at that sacred
                  moment. To my great joy-for my heart ached for him—I heard the words distinctly
                  uttered, "Dearest—Frederick—mother—" All was over; poor Ellen was at rest.
                  Speechless with grief, we stood silent for some minutes.
               I closed those lovely eyes, and smoothed back that dark tress of hair that had
                  excited my gloomy forebodings; it was, indeed, her death pall. The poor husband
                  was stupefied; we did not leave him for some hours. And when my dear sister
                  wrapped the little motherless child in her shawl, and took it to the carriage, I
                  blessed God that she was left me, and that I had escaped the awful crime that had
                  so humbled the soul of the unhappy young man, who had thus early filled two graves
                  with the victims of his passion. After the last sad rites, he followed his
                  motherless child to my house.
               A subdued and changed man is now my friend and brother. When years had chastened
                  his spirit, and he had placed his dear mother by the side of his wife, I was
                  perfectly willing to entrust my sister to his tender care. I reflected upon my own
                  passionate nature, and that probably I
                  had only escaped the same unhappiness by the force of a medical education,
                  forbidding that awful crime by every appeal to my manhood, and pardoned him fully.
                  Suffering had changed him. You know how I love him. You know his noble heart. God
                  has given him wealth, and how many have been made glad by his bounty. Do you
                  remember his beautiful boy?—his child—our child. Oh, may God save him till this
                  weary heart is at rest! Man is born to. cherish some living creature, and I can
                  never love * * again.
               The preceding narrative is the written relation of scenes, occurring in the
                  practice of a dear friend in another city. Were it possible for the reader to
                  listen to the events as detailed from the lips of our friend—when the shutters are
                  closed, and the sofa wheeled round, he would regret as keenly as the Editor does,
                  the necessity of our acting as his amanuensis. All our entreaties have never been
                  able to overcome his modesty and induce him to write; we have vainly tried to
                  catch the inspiration of his voice and manner, but, we fear, in vain. The
                  conclusion of the sketch will explain to the astute reader the sacredness of his
                  relation to the memory of the dead—and the living characters and the delicacy of
                  our task. To the readers this explanation is necessary; the publication of this
                  volume having brought the Editor to confession.
            
            
               SCARLET FEVER
               WHAT ARE THE CAUSES OF ITS DREADFUL FATALITY—HAS MEDICINE ANY
                  CONTROL OVER IT?
               
                  
                     "The simpler variety of scarlatina is only fatal through the offtciousness
                        of the doctor."
                  
                  —Sydenham.
               
               THE existence of an atmospheric and infectious disease, depending upon unknown
                  causes, of a very fatal character, attacking almost exclusively those in the very
                  morning of life, is but too well adapted to enlist the sympathies of our hearts,
                  to insure a right use of the head in the investigation of the symptoms it
                  produces, and its awfully fatal character. As these are all the means we possess
                  in determining the serious questions we propose to consider, it behooves us to be
                  quite sure that we properly awaken the reasoning faculty of the general reader,
                  and whilst we present him with no hypotheses to gratify pride of opinion, supply
                  him with enough of such admitted facts as will insure an intelligent appreciation
                  of the true merits of the question of its treatment, respecting which, it grieves
                  us to say, there is a great variety of opinion in our profession. Indeed, we are
                  well aware that this, as well as many other subjects chosen for popular
                  instruction, have already subjected us to the aspersions of such as do not wish
                  any disturbance of the public mind and their own quiet consciences. The radical
                  reformer and the alarmist are great thorns in the sides of our medical
                  bourgeoisie.. The medical colleges and the academy(!) may serve their purpose yet a little
                  while, but the public mind is too much excited, and the desolate hearthstone
                  appeals too sensibly to the affections of the parent to allow this question any
                  longer rest. It is far too serious, and our avowed object to aid the public to
                  distinguish between the quack, with his collegiate shield of sheep's skin, and his
                  century-beaten mill-horse track of medical routine of practice is now too well
                  understood to allow us a longer respite.
               There are two points in the history of this disease which most impressively arrest
                  the attention of the physician, and they must be made to appeal with equal force
                  to the general reader, even before we give the characteristic appearances and
                  symptoms of the disease; for on them depends the justice of our strictures on the
                  routine treatment of the day. It grieves us to be obliged to press them earnestly
                  upon the attention, because we are aware they will excite the saddest memories in
                  many a bereaved heart. These points are well settled, and somewhat familiar even
                  to the popular mind, and we now intend to attempt their application.
               The first is, that in some seasons and districts, the disease shows itself from
                  the very commencement, in a very mild form; mothers calling it the "scarlet rash,"
                  and "scarlatina;" this latter being the name used by physicians to express the
                  general disease itself and not the degree or type. Scarlet rash, alludes of course
                  to the redness of the skin; and scarlatina indicates, as parents suppose, a very
                  simple affection quite different from scarlet fever, which they are apt to
                  associate exclusively with the swollen and ulcerated throat that so often marks
                  the fatal character of the higher type of the disease. This is entirely erroneous,
                  and may lead to indifference and death. The disease being infectious, and
                  generally attacking all the younger members of the family who have not had it,
                  often affords sad opportunities to prove that it originates always from one
                     kind of
                  poison whatever it may be: one child will have so slight an attack,
                  perhaps a mere redness of the skin, and no throat affection at all, that he will
                  not even consent to go to bed; whilst another will be attacked as early as the
                  second day in the most virulent manner, with all the throat symptoms, and in a few
                  days—even two or three—will, if subjected to the usual purgative, pass into a
                  typhoid state, from which no stimulation can arouse him, and death by suffocation
                  will rapidly close the scene. We have placed this admitted fact first, because it
                  has everything to do with the remarks we shall have to make on the treatment of
                  the disease, and our perhaps somewhat singular introduction.
               With regard to the manner of its origin, we have simply to say, we know nothing
                  about it, any more than of measles or hooping cough; still there is here also a
                  fact, that in our own humble view, positively proves it to be of constant
                  re-origination in various parts of the country, notwithstanding its also proved
                  infectious character. It is continually appearing, like the measles, in places
                  hundreds of miles apart, where there is known to have been no intercourse whatever
                  between the children, or the parents; we mention the latter, because though adults
                  rarely take it, in commercial life there is much travelling, and small pox it is
                  proved may be even carried in a letter thousands of miles. The sphere of infection
                  in scarlet fever, there is good reason to suppose, does not extend beyond the sick
                  room, or the exhalations of the affected person; it cannot be carried far by the
                  clothing of a visitor; the open air is known to dissipate it. There is nothing
                  unreasonable or improbable in the idea, that a disease, originating entirely in
                  atmospheric or deranged electric influences, may become so concentrated by
                  receiving some new and essential element for its propagation from the
                  system in which it is first hatched, as to become highly infectious to other
                  systems brought within the influence of the exhalations of the sick; indeed, as
                  may be said of small-pox and its more
                  terribly contagious synonym, they must both have been thus concocted at their
                  first appearance on earth: there must le two elements in them: and
                  yet, in truth, we know neither the primary essential nature of
                  scarlet fever nor its subsequent additions; if we did, we might be able to treat
                  it with more certainty. Let us, therefore, attend to its symptoms and see what we
                  can deduce from them in regard to its treatment.
               Simple scarlatina, when severe enough to produce any symptoms sufficiently marked
                  to attract notice, appears as a faint diffused redness of the skin, sometimes so
                  slight as scarcely to exceed the hue of a healthy child's cheek; there may be
                  slight chills, and sometimes shivering; possibly a little nausea—rarely vomiting
                  in these mild cases. The eruption appears usually on the second or third day. You
                  may always remark, that the later the eruption, the worse the attack; of course
                  all physicians of experience and most mothers, know, that if no eruption appear,
                  or if it come very late, and only partially, the attack of any cutaneous complaint
                  will be more serious; the eruption, as we suppose, is nature's own method of
                  throwing the poison or its influence out of the body.
               The disease may be distinguished from measles, which often prevails not only in a
                  noticeable degree at the same seasons, but actually approximates in appearance to
                  the eruption, in many cases, of mild scarlatina—firstly, by the watery eyes, the
                  sneezing and cough of measles; and secondly, by the usual appearance of the
                  eruption. The measles are more of a raspberry color—scarlatina, of that of a
                  boiled lobster. The eruption of measles is generally in patches, more or less
                  approximating the shape of a half circle, feeling rough under the finger, with
                  patches of healthy skin between them. The scarlatina eruption is like a diffused
                  blush, smooth to the touch, and merging into the general lobster shell eruption
                  all over the skin. They both begin on the face, and extend downwards. The eruption
                  of measles begins almost always on the fourth day after the first appearance of
                  the watery eyes and the hoarse cough, after which it begins to fade. The eruption
                  of scarlet fever, on the contrary, has no definite period of duration, sometimes
                  appearing as late as the fourth or fifth, and disappearing by the eighth day; this
                  is its most usual course, but it is to the frequent derangement of this symptom
                  that we look, as to the dial plate of the disease; just as it behaves, just so
                  will the throat be affected; it will escape entirely, be very slightly affected,
                  or pass to a malignant state.
               From the fourth day, in most cases, the eruption becomes fainter, and the external
                  or scarf skin (for the reader will remember the skin has three distinct layers)
                  begins to scale off or desquamate, as we say; it comes off the body and face just
                  like scales of bran, only of a finer texture, and by the seventh day, the patient
                  presents a much better and smoother surface. Sometimes the thicker cuticle of the
                  hands and feet will come off entire, like a glove or sock. All the symptoms of the
                  mild variety of the disease, most easily distinguished by the general observer,
                  will be found to show themselves on the skin, and he is apt to suppose that the
                  danger ends with its scaling off, or exfoliation, but he will soon see that the
                  real danger is just then about to commence; in these mild cases, dropsy and
                  debility often destroy life where the fever excited no apprehension.
               First, however, of the second, or that appalling variety that strikes such terror
                  to - the parent's heart. This originates, as we have said, from the same poison;
                  we have ample evidence, from the fact, that even when the first case in a family
                  proves to be a malignant and fatal one, attended with all the worst throat
                  symptoms, the child actually dying of suffocation as early as the fourth or fifth
                  day, a brother or sister, or several of them, may take the mildest form and
                  recover; and the reverse of this is just as often seen. This extraordinary difference in the result is closely
                  connected with the second impressive fact we alluded to in our introduction. It
                  may be owing to some different organization of the skin, inappreciable by us, or
                  the absence or presence of some element or balance of the living power in that
                  individual child, essential to the propagation of the severer form of the disease,
                  in its malignant form, or sometimes its total failure to attack the body. On such
                  hypotheses it is idle to speculate; but other and graver reflections arrest the
                  attention when we witness the routine treatment of these evidently dissimilar
                  constitutions, and compare it with the often terrible results.
               That man who possesses even the meanest reflecting power, may well ask himself the
                  question, how do I know when five or six children of similar bodily confirmation,
                  but always of different constitutional power, are all subjected, on
                  the first appearance of the symptoms, to the action of a purgative, and perhaps a
                  violent one; how do I know that I shall not so prostrate one or more of them, that
                  the system will not have power enough left it to throw out the eruption, and the
                  throat may receive all the brunt of the disease? We have known jalap and calomel,
                  and salts and senna to be given in this city, and that by respectable physicians,
                  as a standard prescription, to a whole family! and more than one instance in which
                  three and four consecutive deaths have followed! The action of a purgative
                  medicine is well known to reduce the action of the heart, and lessen the eruption!
                  nay, if the imprudent routinist were asked why he gave it, he could only say that
                  such was his intention.
               Now, let us ask ourselves the question, what is the fever that precedes the
                  redness of the skin? Is it not increased action of the heart? Is it
                  not more than an hypothesis, is it not almost certain, that this increased action
                  is meant by nature to throw the poison, whatever it be, out of the body by means
                  of this very redness and scaling of the skin? What are measles, small pox and
                  plague? Let us see what aid we can derive in proving this, by investigating the
                  malignant variety of scarlet fever; only called malignant because the disease
                  spends its force on the throat, often suffocating the child to death; we repeat,
                  it comes from the same poison; never forget this, and then you will
                  know how monstrous is the meddlesome ignorance of the routine practitioner.
               In this description of malignant scarlatina, we prefer presenting the observation
                  of one of the most acute physicians of Europe, notwithstanding, we have been
                  witness repeatedly to all the symptoms he enumerates; indeed, there is not a
                  physician of any experience who has not seen them again and again, in the dreadful
                  epidemic visitations of the disease in this city:—his remarks will show that
                  others as well as ourself share the opinion of the miserable results of routine
                  treatment. In scarlatina maligna, the rash is apt to come out late and
                  imperfectly, and sometimes not at all; and instead of being bright and florid, to
                  present a bluish or livid tint; sometimes it suddenly recedes, and then perhaps
                  appears again; and occasionally it is diversified by purple spots. Only see how
                  palpably nature shows she is struggling with her too feeble heart against a
                  dreadfully depressing cause! Redness, you will remember, is caused by the blood
                  being rapidly propelled through the lungs by a strong heart, causing
                  sufficient absorption of oxygen from the inhaled air; purple blotches show a want
                  of this oxygen, or a predominance of carbon in the veins, which return the blood
                  from the skin after it has performed its functions of exhalation of carbon and a
                  supply of material for growth.
               When the patient begins to complain of soreness of the throat, and you look into
                  the mouth and find the tonsils and throat of a dark red color, and especially if
                  the eruption is not well out on the skin, look out for trouble. Such is often the violence of the depressing
                  cause in some cases, that the patient begins to sink or become typhoid on the very
                  first day this redness of the throat commences! Death often occurs as early as the
                  fourth day. Says Dr. Watson—"Over this variety of the disease medicine has but
                  little control." Add this expression to the acknowledged axiom of the great
                  Sydenham at the head of this article, and then tell me, reader, if it is not time
                  that some one had the independence |o declare the truth, and protect the lives of
                  hundreds of children in this city from the appalling consequences of diplomat
                  ignorance!
               The symptoms of the throat affection are so well known to physicians, and
                  treatment avails so little, that we shall pass them entirely by, and hasten to the
                  consequences of the disease upon other parts of the system. One of the results of
                  the excessive swelling about the neck, is pressure upon the great jugular veins
                  which return the blood from the head. This causes congestion or fulness of the
                  brain, and often delirium, ending in a rupture of some vessel within the skull,
                  and consequent apoplexy. We have often, also, seen every symptom of dropsy of the
                  brain. This is of slower accession, and allows a little more time for the action
                  of remedies, for in the secondary symptoms there is far more certainty in their
                  use.
               The offensive and poisonous discharge from the ulcerations of the throat pass into
                  the bowels, for the patient has no strength to expectorate, and produces diarrhœa.
                  The windpipe itself has often been attacked with ulceration, and the child
                  suffocated in a spasmodic attack of coughing. If the child is delicate or
                  scrofulous, and should survive the attack, the reader will readily comprehend
                  additional debility should follow; this will locate in one or more parts of the
                  system. Swellings of the glands in the neck, of the eye-lids, and of the lips and
                  nostrils and joints, are common consequences. Ulcerations of the ear and nose, and
                  ulcers on various parts of the body, may also follow.
               The most common result, however, is dropsy; it usually shows itself beneath the
                  skin, causing swelling of the limbs, and occasionally dropsy of the cavity of the
                  belly. This symptom, Dr. Watson remarks, is most frequent in mild cases; we have
                  no doubt of it from our own observation. This affection is an excessively
                  obstinate and persistent one, and the impertinent and officious interposition of
                  the physician often renders it utterly incurable. Warmth and nutritious food, with
                  gentle frictions to the skin, are the only proper domestic remedies; the humane
                  and careful use of specific stimuli to the skin and kidneys, is admissible by the
                  careful physician only; no remedy can be conscientiously used by a parent. Dropsy
                  is said to be almost invariably the consequence of too early exposure to cold, and
                  usually comes on by the twentieth day; after the fourth week there is little
                  danger of it, the equilibrium of the circulation being by that time restored, and
                  the new cuticle consolidated. People beyond the period of adolescence are rarely
                  afflicted with it, nor are they, indeed, by any means as liable to scarlet fever;
                  few cases occur after 16 years. Dr. Watson remarks, that if asked for how long a
                  time a person was capable of communicating the disease to another, he would always
                  answer, "that he did not know." If he had lived here, he might know
                  to a day, if he would believe some of our oracular brethren; there is one order of
                  them who never fail to answer every question asked of them, however absurdly
                  impossible to suppose the knowledge attainable. Apartments will undoubtedly retain
                  the infection for weeks, as we know by personal observation; but it is soon
                  dissipated from the clothes of a person who has been near the sick.
               What we have said with regard to the treatment of this often formidable disease,
                  originates in no captious desire to
                  find fault with our brethren. We conceive all, and more than we have said, to be
                  richly merited by a large majority of the practitioners throughout our country.
                  The insane desire of nine-tenths of those who employ a physician, to have
                  "something done," has caused many a parent's heart to bleed. No medical man who
                  respects himself will ever yield to such ignorant presumption. Instances have
                  occurred in this city, in several cases under our own observation, of two, three,
                  and four deaths in a single family, all of which had been subjected to severe
                  medication; and one of our citizens, heart-broken at the loss of four daughters,
                  felt justly called on to give his views to the public on hearing the alleged fatal
                  treatment contradicted by the physician. To our personal knowledge, they all had
                  active mercurial purgatives, and several of them were very freely leeched I and
                  yet this very man insolently claims the highest position in the medical profession
                  in this city, Verily, if the children of his brethren were subjected to his
                  treatment, we would require no society for the relief of their beggared offspring
                  when they themselves were dead.
               From what we have noticed in twenty years' observation and conversation with
                  thinking as well as heroic practitioners, it is our solemn conviction that no
                  treatment whatever for the milder variety, and no active medicine for the severer
                  form, should be used. Absolute and unvarying warmth in led to the full
                     extent of comfort, ice to the head in cases of delirium supervening in
                  the latter stages, and brandy and ammonia to keep up the force of the circulation
                  if the pulse flags, and to keep out the eruption, are preeminently wise and
                  necessary measures, never to be neglected by the physician. These are not
                  medicines; they are pure and simple agents, whose action is understood as plainly
                  as that of fire and water. Ice constricts the blood-vessels within the membranes
                  of the brain, by its application in a bladder outside: and brandy and ammonia are
                  as pure natural stimuli as heat. There is no speculation, about these agents, we
                  know their power. As to the conditions that require them, that is another matter.
                  In the present aspect of the diploma market and collegiate produce, we advise
                  every parent to watch the natural indications of debility. Dullness of the eye,
                  frequent sighing, and general prostration of the limbs, are not to be mistaken;
                  they mean debility. If no pain in the head exist, the remedies had better be tried
                  by the physician. It will not do to wait; a day may decide the matter fatally.
               Dr. Watson considers laxative medicine and bleeding advisable. If the former be
                  used, it must be extremely gentle, and watched with jealous care. We can scarcely
                  conceive the lancet otherwise than dangerous in any case, and certainly have never
                  ventured its application. In cases of great oppression of the brain, leeches have
                  been used with benefit. It is barely a supposable possibility; if applied at all,
                  they should be placed on the back of the neck.
               We have used for ulceration of the throat, one drachm of the chlorate of potass to
                  a pint of water as a drink; a teaspoonful being slowly swallowed occasionally; it
                  certainly improves for the time, and sometimes permanently, both the ulcers and
                  the foul tongue. Gargling it is quite useless, as it cannot reach the disease if
                  thus used. Blisters we consider to be totally inadmissible. Caustic to the throat
                  has proved beneficial in our hands; but it requires to be carefully used, and
                  re-applied soon.
               Dr. Schneeman, a German physician, has lately recommended the novel treatment of
                  rubbing the pores of the skin from head to foot—actually every square inch of the
                  body—with the rind of fat pork, so as completely to fill them. It is alleged to be
                  absolutely omnipotent treatment. We have not known it tried here. It is certainly
                  contrary to every pre-conceived idea of the functions of the skin as an exhalant
                  or eliminator of the poison of the disease.
               
               Belladonna has been alleged to be so positive a prophylactic, or preventive of the
                  disease, as to render its attack almost impossible. We should certainly esteem
                  ourself more than culpable, did we advance any opinion calculated to prevent the
                  realization of so great a boon to poor humanity. For ourselves, we can most
                  conscientiously assert, we have found it entirely inert, if we may judge from
                  limited trials in family practice in past years. Yet so many high authorities
                  assert its claim as almost a specific preventive, that we give the formula for its
                  preparation, with the earnest hope that our conclusions will prove incorrect from
                  too limited experience. Two grains of the fresh extract may be dissolved in an
                  ounce of water, and two drops be given to a child of one year old, daily for ten
                  days; an additional drop for every year additional of age: not more than twelve
                  drops should be given in a day to any one. We consider warmth to be so great a
                  curative measure, that we again enforce it with all the impressiveness its
                  importance demands, "Life is warm, death is cold."

                     "A dark and melancholy work on a lightsome ground."
                  
               
               EVERY thing has its last. The last words of great men—of all men, are commonly
                  remembered. The rolling year has its last day, and man's eye glances for the last
                  time on the earth, his home, the faces of the loved ones, and dies. The last
                  farewell has sad words within it, and few human hearts that have beat long enough
                  to suffer, but have been pierced with the tones of a last word, a last sigh, a
                  last grasp of the hand—glance of the eye, that flashed from the soul its sorrow at
                  parting. Why is the last of all things so universally mournful, and symbolled only
                  by sighs and tears? This element in human nature seems to culminate at last in the
                  idea that all things will have an end, and the earth and sun fail, and the race be
                  summoned to a last reckoning, to a final account, in presence of their great last
                  Judge, and from His lips the last eternal word shall be spoken; and here human
                  belief seems reversed, and the next condition is taken to be endless, that shall
                  have no last, no star, no end.
               The beginning, the birth of all things, is joyous. It is the other pole of the
                  last; and joy beams as eternally in the eyes of the one, as sadness lives in the
                  coming of the other. A new flower, a new tree, a new plant, a new residence dence, a new friend, a new child, a new
                  thought, are all heralded with songs and thanksgiving; the birth or beginning of
                  all things has in it delight; the stars sang together at the birth of the world,
                  and the heavenly host sang their celestial anthems over the plains of Bethlehem at
                  the birth of Christ. Every mother sings her sweetest song over the birth of her
                  first child, and the gayest flowers, and the brightest hues, and the softest down
                  are selected to adorn and crown the advent of a new spirit into the earth. But
                  when that spirit takes its departure, and breathes its last sigh, the mother no
                  longer hunts for adornments, but sombre hues and mournful tones become her
                  spirit.
               The law of the universe seems to be a system of contrasts, in which light is
                  better known from its relation to darkness, and joy is made sweeter from its
                  relation to sorrow; the beauties and adornments of summer are shown in more lively
                  colors from a contrast with the leafless, cold dirge of dying winter. We admire
                  man in the greatness of his strength, in the pride of his beauty; but it is not
                  till we see him bowed with age, covered with sin, arid marred with wrong, that he
                  elicits our best thoughts, our holiest sympathies. Man, in the pride and splendor
                  of perfect obedience, could never have commanded the sympathies of love; but man
                  in his anguish and despair, broken by crime, and overwhelmed with sorrow, elicited
                  the spark from the celestial life that made Mary the mother of Jesus, and covered
                  the world with a radiance of glory. Sin is terrible when contrasted with holiness;
                  but the everlasting splendor that beams from purity is brighter when glaring by
                  the side of the dark orb of sin. Bacon has well observed that, "If you listen to
                  the harp of David, you shall hear as many hearse-like airs as carols; and the
                  pencil of the Holy Ghost hath labored more in describing the afflictions of Job
                  than the felicities of Solomon."
               Prosperity is not without many fears and distrusts, and adversity is not without
                  comforts and hopes. We see in needle-work and embroidery, it is more pleasing to
                  have a lively work upon a sad and solemn ground, than to have a dark and
                  melancholy work on a lightsome ground. "Certainly, virtue is like precious odors,
                  the more precious when incensed or crushed; for prosperity doth best discover
                  vice, but adversity doth best discover virtue. Indeed, to carry out this thought
                  to its boldest conclusions, is sin and imperfection in this world an accident, the
                  oversight of a woman in conflict with an appetite? But is it not rather a
                  necessary law of things, a stupendous system of reflected and
                     contrasted images, the deformity and hatefulness of the one,
                  mirroring more brightly to our souls the beauty and glory of the other?
               The best elements of our manhood are struck into being in conflict with meanness
                  and treachery, and the rack and the dungeon are often capable of giving to our
                  spirits their brightest glow and intensest fire. A fallen man redeemed,
                  comprehends more perfectly the heat of the fires through which he has passed, and
                  the glories of his high estate, than one created on a level with him in goodness,
                  without having labored to reach that state of perfection. The universe seems to
                  have this law of contrast within it, and our earth, as she revolves through the
                  cycles of her mighty destiny, has all the vicissitudes of cold and heat, sunshine
                  and rain, summer and winter. Some parts of the earth seem doomed to perpetual
                  frost, ice, and sterility, where the sturdy Norseman beholds in the conflict of
                  elements the god Thor smiting the Jotuns with the rod of his power; while other
                  regions are blooming with constant heat, and corrupting the air with her rotting
                  beauty; her vegetation blooms but to die, or to feed a life that is hardly worth
                  the air that sustains it.
               Well, reader, we must leave these reflections for your thoughts to work upon, and
                  return to our college life. This train
                  of thought is fit, you will say, when you read the tale that follows it.
               It was the last day of the last session of a medical college, that had been raised
                  in the forest and grew like the oak in size and strength, and flourished in its
                  manly beauty, but was now about to die. Its life had braved the toils of twenty
                  years, its founders were grey-haired or dead, and, like them, its last day had
                  come. Its professors had uttered their last word of advice with trembling lips;
                  and the student, flushed with new life and new hope, was about passing into the
                  world to work out a name and a history. Not a leaf dies but has its history; not a
                  flower blooms but can tell its tale; not an insect flits through its day life, but
                  has had its trials; the sun shone on it, and the rain, cold and pitiless, killed
                  him, and to-morrow his shining head and gilded wing is found on the withered stalk
                  where he sung his last song.
               It was on the stone steps of the old time-honored temple that I was standing with
                  a fellow-student, contriving how we should return to our homes, when our almost
                  empty treasury contained barely enough to carry but one a distance of three
                  hundred miles. The clouds had curtained all the heavens, and the winds were keen
                  as the knife; the white fleecy snow seemed merry with its death-life, and was
                  floating from place to place, piling a drift here, and sailing in a white cloud
                  there. We stood waiting for a "birth of Providence," for neither could dream what
                  was to be done in our singular strait. While conning over our lot, not knowing nor
                  caring much what a day brought forth, a stranger, wrapped in an antique drab
                  overcoat—the capes, numerous and ample, covering him to his waist, and the skirts
                  trailing in the snow—approached us and inquired for R——, saying that his cousin
                  had notified him that such a person was at that place, and he wished to engage a
                  teacher for two months, to supply the place of a young man who was obliged to
                  quit, to care for a sick father and sister. A bargain was struck on the instant,
                  and drawing from my pocket the sum of six dollars, all the wealth I possessed, and
                  handing it to my friend, I pressed his hand, and we parted.
               The face of the stranger was a curious compound of the droll, the devilish, and
                  the odd. We toiled our way through the vast drifted heaps of snow that covered the
                  face of the country, and concealed every thing from view, but houses, barns and
                  haystacks. We found his home amid the rude hills of old Herkimer, and his cheerful
                  blue-eyed wife welcomed us to as happy a home as wealth and goodness, and fun and
                  frolic could devise. My friend belonged to the race of gimlets that swarm up from
                  old Connecticut, and, like other thousands, he had wandered from home, and carved
                  out a fortune for himself by trading horses and laying stone walls among the
                  farmers in that primitive region. Ten years had elapsed, and he had risen by
                  industry from a laborer to be owner of the soil and one of the sovereigns. A rude
                  but manly heart beat under his old drab coat and red shirt.
               The next morning found me in an old school-house, on the very top of a high
                  mountain ridge, surrounded by as unlovely a group of rude, coarse boys, relieved
                  by a few more decent girls, as ever cursed (the heart of a schoolmaster. Snow was
                  six feet deep, and above that was piled in vast ridges by the howling winds that
                  swept nightly over the bleak summits of these barren hills. This rude group of
                  human calves left a deep impression on my mind. The country had been settled many
                  years, and civilization had worked incessantly for humanity, through the church
                  and the school-house; but humanity had no more to hope from more than a dozen of
                  these young men, than from a group of Saki Indians. Their heads were round, necks
                  thick, shoulders broad, bodies short, and their minds more dull than the
                  perceptions of some dogs. Scarce a winter ever passed here without a field-fight between the boys and teacher.
                  An old Vermonter who lived near the school, informed me, that during the last ten
                  years he had been hired by the district six times to take charge of the school,
                  and cast out the devils that infested the boys, at the end of the supple hickory.
                  Only a week had passed, before I crossed the track of a plot to seize and flog me,
                  which was only prevented by a sudden irruption upon the leaders, with a valorous
                  application of the lash, by the aid of which I worked them up in such pitiful
                  specimens of disobedience, as set the whole town into a laugh at the boys.
               In numerous places at the East, in the oldest settled counties, I have observed
                  these same animal tendencies in the rising generation, so marked and singular,
                  that no observer of nature could fail to ask the cause of this rapid deterioration
                  in our race of men. The rudeness of the parental life in clearing up and subduing
                  a new country, seems to embody itself in the children, and drag them headlong
                  towards the scale of the brute. Another cause, more potent than all, which
                  underlies the characters I have described is, that these children are the
                  offspring of the lowest forms of uneducated young men and women, who have married
                  in the Eastern towns and villages, and fled, with poverty and ignorance, into a
                  new region, to find bread and a home in the forest, where ignorance finds freedom
                  and contention.
               No attentive observer of the progress of our race, can fail to see that our
                  country towns, and villages, and cities, have in their population a vast multitude
                  of these uncouth, shapeless, and stupid specimens of unblest humanity. The vast
                  hordes of young men and women who enter married life, spurred on by passion, yet
                  besotted in ignorance, as uncultivated as the savage, cannot fail to leave a
                  posterity mentally degraded, physically imperfect, and monstrous in morality. The
                  examination of some thousands of convicts in the various prisons of our States,
                  clearly points to the above causes as prolific in results.
               A permanent and successful elevation of our race, can only be obtained by a rigid
                  application of hereditary laws, and they must be so applied as to leave these
                  specimens of crime, insanity, and disease, to perish with those who possess them.
                  That the existing generation modifies vastly the succeeding generations, is a
                  settled principle. Laws which allow the sickly, the insane the ignorant, the
                  drunken, and imbruted of our race, to multiply their deformed and vicious
                  imperfections, only, strike at the best interests of humanity, and put far off the
                  hope of the permanent progress of our species. We must leave the reader with these
                  reflections, and return to the thread of our narrative.
               I had been summoned, in my turn, to watch with the father and sister of the
                  teacher whose place I had taken, and the impressions of these night vigils are
                  indelibly engraven on my memory.
               The home was a low farm-house, surrounded by a fine orchard, and a thrifty grove
                  of young maples completely environed the house. It was a lovely spot, and nature
                  seemed striving to mock the possessor with its peaceful and enduring beauties.
               My young friend showed me into the sick-room. The father, an old man, with gray
                  locks and sunken cheeks, lay on a bed by the cast window, that opened into the
                  maple grove: a large tumor deformed the side of his neck; his eye was dull and
                  sorrowful; his ill-formed yellow brow covered in part by his long gray hair; his
                  extremities were paralytic, and he was at this moment under the influence of nux
                  vomica, which acted at periods of from fifteen to thirty minutes, and caused a
                  sudden contraction of the muscles of the limbs, which drew them suddenly up
                  towards his body, then, by a convulsive movement, they extended to their full
                  length with great violence, throwing his attendants from the bed, who were endeavoring to render the movements of his
                  limbs less violent and painful. The medicine acted on no part of the system but
                  the paralyzed extremities, and a post mortem examination showed the spinal cord in
                  the lumbar region almost totally absorbed or destroyed by disease, the sheath
                  which envelopes it barely remaining. This medicine in its action on the brain
                  transmitted motion across the diseased spine, while the will had ceased to move
                  his limbs. He languished a few weeks and expired, and we consigned him to a grave
                  in the yard, under the shade of the maple trees, a few feet from his house. His
                  wife was already buried in the same place, and a daughter, of whom we shall speak
                  as we pass. Our friend for whom we had performed the last sad rite, was born in
                  Rhode Island, and grew up to manhood beneath the paternal roof, but could not set
                  out in life till, like many others, he had perpetrated some act of perfidy, and
                  planted deep in his soul the seeds of sin. He had wooed and won the affections of
                  the daughter of a wealthy merchant, and, much to the chagrin and sorrow of her
                  parents, before the time appointed for their nuptials, she had become a mother. He
                  fled into Connecticut, and remained the space of eight months, and finally
                  returned to his native place. He had visited his child, and bound up the young
                  lady's broken heart by renewing his broken promises, and, while professing to be
                  making ready for the nuptial ceremony, he fled to the interior of New York, and
                  purchased a forest farm, and married the daughter of a wealthy farmer. The
                  betrayed and abandoned young woman, whom he had left, had become the mother of a
                  second son.
               He grappled manfully with the toils of life, and in a few years had cleared off
                  the forest and provided him with a home and a shelter. His wife, a short, stout,
                  black-eyed woman, sometimes proved, by a timely turmoil, her element of
                  individuality. Their first child was a son, and grew up a surly, stubborn,
                  immovable thing. When manhood was reached, he was a worthless dolt; his nature had
                  become" fixed, and he seemed to dry down into a mass of petrified wilfulness.
               Life between the parents was a glorious contrast, with power which commanded
                  obedience on the one side, and female wit and sagacity on the other, which eluded
                  all restraint and overthrew all reliance, and rendered life a valiant battle for
                  the victory. Somehow, these encounters always ended in a parley over the young
                  lady left in New England and her two darling sons. The perfidy and wickedness of
                  her husband had become known to the wife, and she seemed, in her furious moods, to
                  regard herself as the heaven-appointed avenger of injured innocence. The husband
                  could never assert his rights or allude to duty, but he was pointed to the
                  betrayed sister and deserted children. Sometimes he was bantered about her good
                  looks, and at others he was invited to bring the boys home, as company for the
                  others, and to aid him on the farm. Incessant sorrow harassed the life of the
                  young farmer, and as age approached, he fell into fits of melancholy, and took to
                  his bed. His tormentor never allowed him to rest, but was equal to any task, and
                  rendered her kindness as terrible as her anger.
               When these fits of sorrow came over him, and, like Job, he was cursing the day
                  that gave him birth, his watchful spouse would often call medical aid from a
                  distance, and the first notice of his kind wife's attention, would be the presence
                  of the doctor in the room of the heart-sick wretch. Her kindness and assiduity at
                  such times were unbounded, and, to the eye of the stranger, she was the most
                  devoted and tender of wives. On one of these visits of the unsuspecting physician,
                  he rose from the bed, where he had taken refuge from her anger, to be seated by
                  the fire, when the good woman threw a mantle over his shoulders ders, kindly requesting "My dear" not to expose his
                  feeble health.
               The strong man writhed and resisted under the torture of this burning lash, till
                  life seemed a concentrated curse; full of judgments. In one of these stormy seas,
                  when the waves ran high, they vowed eternal separation, and called on Heaven to
                  slay them with his thunder if they broke the vow. Xantippe reminded her wretched
                  spouse, that he would give out in less than three months, and receive the curse.
                  And so it proved. They had become calm, like two tigers after a fast, and retired
                  to rest as usual. The laws of nature, suspended for a time, came suddenly to a
                  focus, and broke in deafening violence over the heads of the culprits, in a
                  dreadful peal of thunder, and the quick-minded wife leaped, screaming for mercy,
                  into the middle of the room. This birth of Providence kept peace in the house for
                  some months. Their next child was a daughter, and on no human face did I ever see
                  horror, anguish, and despair so palpably written. She was, when I saw her, a
                  mother, and seemed in every feature of her face and character, to proclaim that
                  she was born of her father's despair. She was a sad, silent, sorrowful,
                  uncomplaining being, that seemed to have no emotions but her sorrows and her
                  miseries.
               Heaven at last seemed to relent in its persecutions of the unhappy man, and his
                  second daughter, a bright beautiful, and lovely child, became the idol of his
                  life. He carried her with him to the field, and made her his companion in his
                  walks and his rides. The child seemed to understand by instinct the sorrow of the
                  old man's heart; the sorrows, and sufferings, and tears, and repentance seemed
                  centered in this angelic and lovely child. She seemed indeed born of his regrets.
                  He bestowed on her all the riches of his heart, and educated her for a teacher.
                  She grew up as lovely in her womanhood as in infancy, and was still the solace of
                  her father's care; an angel of mercy intervening between the sword of justice and
                  the furies.
               It may be a mystery how so lovely a child could succeed to one so ugly and
                  unhappy; but the mystery will vanish, when we remember that u mind, like the
                  Spirit of God, moulds the universe into its own image."
               Chastened and softened by sorrow, and purified by repentance, the change in his
                  children followed the changes in his own mind. But the desolate father had only
                  reared this lovely being to point a keener dagger to his own bleeding heart. She
                  had spent many summers in teaching, and at last formed an attachment for a young
                  man, whom they regarded as inferior to her in acquirements, and both the parents
                  opposed the wishes of the child. She struggled, through a long summer, with her
                  attachment and her duty, and finally dismissed her school, and resolved to follow
                  the bent of her love. She procured a horse of her father, and started on horseback
                  to a neighboring village, eight miles distant to procure her wedding garments. Her
                  road lay along a gay and rapid stream; the road was steep, and led over hills; and
                  through valleys, and its banks were skirted with pine forests, and often in its
                  course formed beautiful eddies as it turned against the bank. She tied her horse
                  in the shade, descended to the stream, and glided beneath its crystal waves, and
                  found her bridal couch on a bed of pebbles. Her little dog had followed her, and
                  stayed all night by the horse; his low, howling moan attracted James Brown from
                  his work in the field near by; he drew from the stream the body of her whom he had
                  hoped to wed I When the friends came in search of the body, they found him seated
                  on the sand beside the corpse, a miserable maniac. The young people, from a
                  distance of ten miles, came together in vast multitudes, to shed the tear of
                  affection over the sad fate of the lovely and accomplished Harriet Nichols. The
                  stroke from the hand of the invisible
                  avenger crushed her mother's rebellious spirit, and in a few months, both were
                  laid in the quiet shade of the young maples.
               The old man's cup was not yet full; the bitterest drops were at the bottom. A
                  younger sister, scarce less lovely than Harriet, who had baptized her love in a
                  watery death, sank into a melancholy mood, and paled at last before the withering
                  breath of consumption. While her father lay confined by his accumulating evils,
                  she came down upon her last bed by his side; and her cheek grew pale, and her lips
                  thin, and her eyes grew bright as an angel's eyes; while the hollow cough and the
                  hectic flush, revealed the fire that burned to ashes the shell which held her
                  bright young spirit. The females of the neighborhood came in, and their
                  sympathy—which is always right, if it had intelligence to guide it—insisted on
                  sending for a notable botanic. Ignorance lighted the funeral pile over the body of
                  the poor victim, when the creature came.
               He was one of that swarm of vampires, that was the first fruits of the tribe of
                  rooters that swarmed through the State of New York, under the paternal teaching of
                  T—— and B——. He was, like the multitude whom he deluded, utterly ignorant of the
                  human organization, and above all the laws which controlled its vital forces.
                  There was no staying his hand; the sympathy of the females of the place was
                  omnipotent, and their Paracelsus went to work. "Heat is life, and pepper is heat,
                  arid lobelia is pepper," rightly applied; he cleansed the stomach, and. then
                  poured down his life-giving doses of pepper, and ginger, and bayberry bark, and
                  three days sufficed to blow out the little glimmering taper of life. The hectic on
                  her cheek grew brighter, her tongue grew dryer, her eye was the eye of a spirit,
                  and at the hour of sunset, her breath grew shorter and shorter; she looked out on
                  the trees, turned her face to the setting sun, and lay still and cold for
                  ever.
               Pardon me this incident, for I could not let it pass without alluding to the
                  multitude of awful cases I have since witnessed of a similar nature. Quackery is
                  ever the handmaid of ignorance, and I have never been in a community as a
                  physician, where ignorance did not or could not repeat this horrid scene. The poor
                  girl had enjoyed, for some weeks, the kind care of one of the most judicious
                  physicians, and to his had been added the advice of Prof. De L——; and nothing
                  remained from the first, but to smoothe her passage to a quiet grave.
               With here and there an exception, American women are easily deceived, and seek,
                  instinctively, men on a level with them in ignorance, to tune the most complicated
                  of instruments.
               Our medical colleges swarm with wretches unfit for any intelligent profession;
                  and, added to this vast supply from the regulars, is a rapidly increasing swarm
                  from the eclectic schools, and this stream is swelled by a smaller, but more
                  ignorant tribe from the Homœopathic colleges, all swarming like a band of locusts
                  over the country, preying upon the ignorance, feeding the credulity, and taxing
                  the empiricism of the masses, and especially the females.
               While the corpse of the daughter was awaiting interment, the old man, wearied of
                  life, and tired of its struggle and of himself, sank slowly to the grave. The
                  miserable, sorrowing, and wretched daughter, to whom I have alluded, was now left
                  alone, with two brothers, as mistress of the house. She had married an Irishman,
                  who had left her with two children, sons, to the charity of her father During his
                  last day, he turned his eyes often on the dead body of the daughter, and then on
                  the two boys left by their father, and, finally, calling to his bedside his
                  youngest son, he commended to his care his helpless sister and the two lads; and
                  in his broken slumbers he muttered the name of "Mary," the girl he had abandoned
                  in his hour of strength and prosperity.
                  The embers of life one by one went out, and at last he drew a long sigh,
                  pronounced again the name of "Mary," and gave up the ghost. In two days we
                  deposited the bodies of the father and daughter under the trees with the mother
                  and sister. It was spring; the graves were filled with water, into which we
                  dropped the coffins, and the gravel rattled on the lids.
               You have before you, reader, a plain narrative of facts. My friend who wore the
                  drab coat, an acute observer, who introduced me to this family, contended
                  absurdly, as I then thought, that the children of these parents represented every
                  moral and intellectual change through which the parents had passed. That such is
                  the law of all reproduction among human beings, is certain, I think. It is mind
                  that moulds the universe, and it is no less mind that moulds and shapes the new
                  being in the embryo state. In this we have a solution of the rapid degeneracy of
                  our men and women of the present generation. The mothers during gestation, are
                  loaded with toil and drudgery; they have no vitality left to bestow on the child
                  before birth, and observation seems to indicate, that the brain of the male
                  suffers more than his body, while the body of the female suffers more than the
                  brain. The female brain, as a whole, is Superior to that of the male in form and
                  fibre. A mother, with a family of six or twelve children, is the veriest slave on
                  the earth, and from day to day, for twenty or thirty years, her energies are
                  over-taxed, till she has no vitality for the daughter, nor brain for the son; it
                  is all consumed in toil, and watching, and anxiety. A race of men will never be
                  born in America, till this load of care and slavish toil is removed from the
                  mothers who rear the race; the slave and the brute, in gestation, have more care
                  and attention than our northern mothers. No angel in Pandemonium was so hideous as
                  archangel fallen; so the mother I have described, a thoroughly perverted being,
                  lived only to curse and hate the traitor to God and nature whom she had married.
                  Her instincts told her his baseness, and, in spite of herself, her woman's nature,
                  which loves, in its upright state, nothing that is not pure, hated and reviled the
                  wretch who had betrayed his friend, and forsaken his children.
               Step by step, the unerring laws of the human heart worked out a full and fearful
                  cup of most bitter woe for his lips to taste, and drop by drop, did he drain it to
                  the dregs. God works not by passing wonders, but in everlasting laws; and as our
                  minds are reared, thought by thought, and our moral nature by affection added to
                  affection, so must we rear the race to goodness and greatness.
            
            
               A LAUGHABLE SCENE—BAGGING THE GAME.
               IF it were not for the relief of the feelings by scenes of mirthfulness, few would
                  be able to endure our profession. Diseases of the mind, though often affording
                  exhibitions of a character far from ludicrous, now and then assume a most
                  diverting aspect, and the physician is often put to it to meet the; protean phases
                  "of the mind diseased." Never have I seen it in a more ludicrous aspect than once
                  witnessed in the case of a spoiled and wayward patient, who was so fortunate as to
                  be exceedingly rich and very ignorant. He was a miserable homunculus, with a
                  villainous intellectual development, almost acephalous (his head indeed very muck
                  resembled a frog's), and the end of a cocoa-nut with its three black spots was
                  almost ass intellectual as his face. He had a very wretched-looking little wife,
                  and two children, about a
                  match for their parents; all spoiled, sensual, sionate and vulgar.
               These people, nevertheless, had a great reverence for me, and I was obliged by the
                  necessities of a youthful practitioner to attend them, keeping a tight rein over
                  their vagaries when occasion required. They quarrelled awfully, and often came to
                  blows and scratches. One evening I was summoned to the lady's bedside in great
                  haste; she had as usual an attack of hysterics, in no way alleviated by the
                  refrigerating influence of her potations; for they had lately had a high time of
                  lit, and both were intoxicated when I arrived. Crimination and recrimination went
                  high, and I began to be tired of the scene. A fortunate thought struck me. They
                  had been at their usual game of scratching; both of their faces showed the
                  activity of the diversion. There had been a death from erysipelas at the next
                  door, and as they knew the deceased most intimately, they were very much alarmed,
                  when, with the view of carrying out my bright thought, I looked very anxious, and
                  told the lady that the scratches looked very like erysipelas. I knew they would be
                  at their customary diversion as soon as my back was turned, and I was resolved to
                  prevent it, and get a good night's rest. Accordingly I affected the deepest regret
                  at the omission in the case of the dead friend, of a practice I had formerly known
                  of great efficacy in erysipelas, and informed them I was resolved when she died,
                  that if another case occurred, I would by no means fail to try it.
               It consisted in continually fumigating the surface of the body with burned Indian
                  meal, and covering the face with a mask to exclude the light. Their alarm was so
                  thoroughly excited, that they gladly yielded to my suggestion, inquiring, with
                  really distressing solicitude, if it was not too late. Assuring them I would do my
                  best, I sent out for a couple of large salt sacks, and procured two of the
                  prettiest looking masks I could get at Woodworks; two chairs were
                     They had been at their usual game of scratching; both of their faces
                        showed the activity of the diversion.—PAGE 396.
                  
                   then placed in the sacks, and a pudding
                  pan full of Indian meal under each chair, an opening being cut in each bag at the
                  side to admit of the introduction of a hot brick, to produce the fumes from the
                  meal. Placing the beautiful couple with the greatest gravity, one in each sack at
                  a respectful distance, and back to back, with the view of avoiding any fomentation
                  of their bad passions by facilities for eyeing each other (and somewhat fearing,
                  in truth, too close inspection of my own countenance, for I found it hard work to
                  contain myself), I tied the sacks loosely around their necks, and the masks behind
                  their ears, and left them under the care of an Irish servant girl, and the
                  diversion of their own eloquence. I departed in triumph, having fairly bagged my
                  game, and telling them I anticipated an immediate call, which would detain me all
                  night in the upper part of the city. I kept them so for the best part of two days,
                  assuring them whenever I allowed an interval of a few hours for sleep, that it
                  would be necessary to resume the fumigations on the least return of their anger,
                  for it invariably produced an exceedingly alarming appearance in the scratches,
                  and they should begin to cicatrize before the remedy was discontinued. The result
                  was most fortunate, and by cultivating their good graces, I obtained such an
                  ascendency over their feeble intellects, that I had only to threaten the bagging
                  process to keep their hands off each other for several years after.
            
            
               
               EARLY HISTORY OF FORT LEE
               SECOND ARTICLE.
               IT may be thought, and perhaps justly, that when the events that connected this
                  lovely and romantic spot with the history of our country had transpired, the
                  future story of the solitary family that inhabited it, can afford little of
                  interest to the reader; and yet if there be any value in the example, of industry
                  and self-reliance, or anything noble in truth or integrity when blended with the
                  ready sympathy of hearts overflowing with love to their fellows, and hands open to
                  relieve distress wherever found, their history cannot be without interest. It has
                  ever been the custom of the writer, to study man in his individual character,
                  rather than in his more extended relations with masses of his fellows; whatever
                  interest he may secure to these pages, will depend entirely on such a
                  comparatively humble sphere of observation; and, as his professional habits
                  exclude him entirely from political and public life, he hopes the reader will
                  tolerate a slight tribute to the memory of those from whom he inherited all of
                  truth or affection that may be found in his rude character.
               Beattie, in his "Minstrel," may almost be supposed to have visited their glorious
                  forest home, and to have gathered his inspiration from the frowning palisades,
                  when he wrote 
                     
                        "There, rocks on rocks, piled as by magic spell,
                        Here scorched with lightning, there with ivy green,
                        Fenced from the north and west this savage dell.
                        Oft did the cliffs reverberate the sound
                        Of parting fragments tumbling from on high;
                        And from the summit of that craggy mound,
                        The perching eaglet oft was heard to cry,
                        "Or on resounding wings to shoot athwart the sky."
                     
                  
               
               As you ascend the road leading to the English Neighborhood, up the gorge that
                  separates the palisades from the road, there may yet be seen a vast rock which was
                  severed by lightning, and for half a century bore the signet of the awful element
                  that tore it assunder. I have looked on it with childish awe, as my mother
                  described the fearful scene when it occurred. Thunder storms are here of awful
                  grandeur. I have often heard the grand legato of the storm anthem as it rolled
                  away in the distance of the river, and seen the blinding flash of the lightning
                  followed by the startling staccato thunder-clap as it was echoed back from the
                  mountain wall. In the middle of the night, when all around was still as the
                  sepulchre, the heart would leap, as the sleeper was startled by the "parting
                  fragment tumbling from on high," as it was severed by the silently working moss of
                  centuries, and fell thundering to the shore below, where ages before its huge
                  kindred had gathered themselves to their graves. They lie about in vast masses, as
                  though torn asunder by an earthquake. Indeed, philosophers tell us in their books,
                  that the whole of the southern defile of the river is volcanic, and that it was
                  originally a vast lake, liberated by a mighty convulsion of nature from its
                  northern prison, where it had been confined by the rocky barrier for thousands of
                  years.
               The perching eagle sits in solitary grandeur on the cliff, or "sails across the
                  sky and o'er the rolling deep," watching its prey below, or screaming forth its
                  note exultant as it approaches its mate with its quivering victim, in her rocky
                  nest. There they yet dwell, a solitary pair, for they tolerate no interlopers, far
                  beneath the branching limbs of the
                  gnarled cedars that o'erhang that portion of the cliff and obscure their nest from
                  view. I have now in my possession a noble bald-head, shot by some creature who
                  certainly must have been created for a butcher, whose progenitors found their
                  home, probably for centuries, in the great cliff. No longer ago than last summer,
                  when lying, musing on my childhood, reclining on that rock where the immortal
                  father of our country stood with my uncle inspecting the progress of the battle of
                  Fort Washington, one of his descendants sailed majestically over me so near that I
                  could see his very eyes.
               The events related in a former article had transpired in the month of November,
                  1776; and at the close of the campaign, when the successes of the British had left
                  them nothing more to desire in that quarter—both Forts Washington and Lee, and all
                  the contiguous country and city being in their hands—several vessels were ordered
                  up the river by Lord Howe to bring the troops to the southern division of the
                  British army, for further operations in that section of our country. After the
                  memorable scene and my grandfather's toast in the courtyard of his ruined house,
                  and his midnight seizure by Gen. Kniphausen, and bold and defiant conduct at Fort
                  Washington, it may appear extraordinary to the reader, to find my patriotic and
                  determined grandmother escorted on board one of his Majesty's ships by several of
                  the British officers to attend a ball! Such, however, was the solitude of their
                  mountain home, and so great the reverence these really fine men bore to her lofty
                  and determined character, and their admiration of her social and enthusiastic
                  husband, that it would have been rude to have refused their polite attention.
                  Captain Wetherel, who had so kindly secreted and fed her beautiful pet in the old
                  cellar in the English Neighborhood, waited on my grandmother with a card of
                  invitation; it was accepted; and as it was to be a grand affair, a messenger was
                  despatched to the city for high-heeled shoes, and the grand old hooped satin
                  skirt, just now revived from its half century's sleep.
               My grandfather politely declined the invitation, because it would evidently have
                  been less appropriate for a rebel male to have been seen on board of his majesty's
                  ship than a woman; who, however determined her spirit, as a descendant of mother
                  Eve, may not be supposed to have been equally capable of resisting the festive
                  scene. The barge, canopied, carpeted, and superbly cushioned, arrived at dusk to
                  convey her to the ship, and the high-spirited Dutch woman was handed on board by a
                  red-coated officer of that king, to whose utter confusion and discomfiture her
                  French rebel husband had a few days previous drank that memorable toast. The ship
                  was lying in the river opposite Manhattanville. The ball went off superbly; my
                  grandmother meeting several friends from the city side, and some from Hoboken; her
                  own mountain eyrie being the utmost confine of northern Jersey civilization. The
                  bear, the wolf, and the wild-cat looked down from the rocky heights upon the only
                  cultivated spot, 
                     "That spread its mildest beauty to the southern sun."
                  
               
               The most courtly honors were shown her by the gallant English officers, and
                  presents of confectionery thoughtfully placed in the barge by the gentlemen for
                  the children. She was escorted home by several of the officers, and after the!
                  expression of their evidently heartfelt desire that the war would soon be amicably
                  adjusted, they took their leave at midnight and went on board to sail, next day,
                  for their new scene of action. The "adjustment" came, about as "amicably" as it
                  ever will when power is to be wrenched from despotic rulers in Church or
                  State.
               We had occasion to speak of the wild animals that abounded at Fort Lee: the bear
                  that gave origin to the original name
                  of Washington Market, was shortly afterwards followed by another of the
                  black-coated brethren; he made his appearance during peach time, and with
                  characteristic good taste, mounted a peach tree that had been blown over by the
                  wind, but was full of luscious fruit; here he was leisurely regaling himself, when
                  the keen eye of a frequent visitor, a female relative from the city, detected him;
                  quick as thought she loaded the family rifle, and at the first shot brought him
                  down! Think of that, ye delicate young ladies reclining on velvet ottomans and
                  shutting out the light of heaven by heavy curtains lest it spoil your beauty! A
                  brave act which would have immortalized this glorious woman, remains to be
                  chronicled.
               Norna Day was a woman worthy of the relationship of that family where she found
                  friendship and a frequent home. When the accursed monster Cunningham (who
                  subsequently met that well-deserved fate at Tyburn he had inflicted upon so many
                  defenceless American prisoners, in the rear of the old reservoir in Chambers
                     street,*
                   where, with the aid of a negro executioner, he hung dozens of our
                  countrymen at midnight), when this fiend of hell presided over one of the city
                  prisons—the identical building now occupied as the Hall of Records in the
                  Park—this noble-hearted woman was accustomed to importune the British officer in
                  command, for permits to go into the prisons with food for her unfortunate
                  countrymen. One day she presented herself at the door of the old jail, and showing
                  her permit, demanded admission. A wretched hireling jailor under Cunningham, rode
                  through the stone hall, which then went directly through the building, and calling
                  her by some outrageously insulting epithet, he attempted to ride over her; she
                  stepped adroitly aside, and with such an arm as would have made a knight in armor
                  look well to his movements, she drew an immense carving knife, she always wore
                  concealed under her dress, and with a single blow, directed at the thigh of the
                  myrmidon—she missed him and drove it to the very handle between the ribs of the
                  horse! his rider escaped by a miracle, having received but a slight wound in the
                  thigh. Norna and her slave passed by the falling animal, and distributed her food
                  to the suffering prisoners—unmolested by the fiend Cunningham, who was probably,
                  as was usual with him, drunk in his room; on her return, the horse was lying dead
                  on the porch. She continued to fulfill her benevolent mission during the entire
                  period of British rule in the city, and undoubtedly saved a great number of
                  lives.
               
                  
                  *Its site is now occupied by large marble buildings.
               
               How few of our citizens are aware of the horrors that were enacted in Chambers
                  street? Certainly several hundred of our wretched people were there immolated
                  directly under the eyes of British authority. The only excuse I could ever find
                  for my good grandmother for going to that ball, was her excellent heart; she knew
                  that the officers with whom she was accustomed to converse, were compelled to
                  discharge a duty hateful to their feelings as men, and only tolerated because of
                  the blinding results of a false education, received at the hands of hireling
                  sycophants, under the despotic rule of a monarchical and priestly hierarchy. I
                  believe that all who live away from the tyrannical influence of Church and State,
                  and have systems healthfully organized, or a proper balance of mind and body, must
                  be social and republican in their ideas. The British friends of my grandparents
                  were only warped by education: they were good men, many of them fathers; and more
                  than once have I heard this noble woman say, that she has seen the tears fall from
                  their eyes when discoursing on the "unhappy difficulties" between the two
                  countries. The real goodness of humanity is the same under a red coat with gold
                  buttons, or a homespun petticoat.
               
                  months left the lovely spot and the poor old ruined house to its owners, who were now, after a
                  severe winter, endeavoring to gain from the soil what little aid it might yield in
                  supporting their young family. They had ventured in the spring, after the
                  evacuation of the place, to replace their stolen cattle, and were obliged to
                  depend considerably on the fish they obtained from the noble river for their
                  food.; all the sheep and fowls were swept off by the marauding troops, and meat
                  was a rarity; they were glad to gather the fragments of the salt meat the soldiers
                  had thrown out of the cellar and wantonly hacked with their swords and
                  bayonets.
               One fine April morning, when her husband had gone to the mill to procure flour, my
                  grandmother perceived a well-defined and extensive ripple rapidly approaching the
                  little bay some hundreds or so of rods across, and whose waves almost kissed her
                  roses and white lilies as they overhung its waters at the foot of the garden wall;
                  it was so perfectly calm all over the vast river, that she knew from her keen and
                  practised eye, that the ripple was caused by fish seeking the shore, either in
                  pursuit of food or to avoid their native enemies of the deep water.
               The drawing of the seine (a long and narrow net floated by corks on its upper
                  border, and sunk by bullets on its lower one) was practised by blacks. Fastening
                  one end to the shore, and taking the net in a boat, they would row out, and making
                  a large circuit, inclose the fish that might chance to be within its embrace, and
                  gradually drawing in the circle sweep them on the shore. Such an operation would
                  sometimes secure them very fine striped bass, and occasionally one of huge size:
                  this was a great treat for the family, and very necessary to their
                  subsistence.
               There was no man but a black slave about the premises. My grandmother summoned him
                  from the field where he was ploughing, and in a few minutes they had planted the
                  net almost on the very spot where she had been handed into the barge with her high
                  heels and white satin hooped skirt, by the king's officer! Now she was dressed in
                  her republican costume of linsey-woolsey petticoat, and stout leather shoes; most
                  likely clambering into the fish boat with very little aid from the slave; he was
                  to row and she "to pay out net," holding or resisting the pull caused by the
                  "bellying of the net," as well and as long as she could; till it was all out, if
                  possible, and if not strong enough, being content with what she could manage. She
                  used to relate with much satisfaction, that she braced her feet against the seat
                  and held on till her hands were blistered, and paid out the whole net.
               They soon reached the shore, having succeeded in inclosing a large part of the
                  ripple. On beholding their prize, as the silvery scales began to reflect the
                  sunlight, they were surprised to find them shad! this fish rarely seeking the
                  shore in so large a river as the Hudson, and only in other rivers when they go to
                  spawn. They were doubtless driven in by porpoises; they counted out six hundred
                  and odd! My grandmother could now talk to her visitor about bear shooting without
                  losing caste; the exploit was indeed quite as great, and considerably more
                  laborious.
               An event occurred during the spring of this year, that greatly impressed my
                  grandmother with (what she always believed in) a superintending Providence. It was
                  known to many persons employed in country trade in the city, that a thriving
                  farmer lived up the river, in such seclusion as rendered it likely he was almost
                  defenceless, and that he probably had wealth was surmised, from his house having
                  been the temporary abode of Washington. An expedition was planned to rob, and
                  probably murder him. Four desperadoes ascended the river in a small boat, and
                  arriving after midnight, one of them mounted the rude pile of logs and timber that
                  served as a dock, to make fast their boat. It was low tide, and his companions
                  observing he did not speak for some
                  minutes, called out his name; he gave no answer. Another then ascended the dock,
                  and soon announced to his companions that the man was dead! The cause of his
                  sudden death was never known, as his body was thrown into the water ere they
                  arrived at the city to avoid investigation. Nor would the event ever have been
                  known, but for the dying confession of one of the accomplices. He stated the part
                  of the narrative we have given, and confessed that the just judgment of God had
                  overtaken them with the terrible warning, and prevented an awful crime, for they
                  instantly placed the body in the boat and departed for the city.
               My grandfather's escape was a narrow one, for he had been obliged to spend nearly
                  all the money he had saved, after the destruction of his house and the loss of his
                  cattle, to replace the latter, and to purchase food for his children; the old
                  tea-kettle of half-joes having been dug up from under the potatoes in the corner
                  of the cellar, and exhausted weeks before the robbers arrived. It is probable his
                  inability to gratify their demands might have cost him his life.
               Years elapsed; our country triumphed; order and plenty were restored to the old
                  homestead; General Washington's arm-chair and the punchbowl from which he drank,
                  sat in state in the high old room, and my grandmother wrote and re-wrote for her
                  friends, the receipt for the Indian cakes, he took to Virginia. The children
                  shouted to hear the magic echo from the old flat rock and the bluff, where the
                  wolves and the foxes yet barked, and the horrid rattlesnake and copperhead sunned
                  themselves audaciously. The garden, filled with roses, pinks, and white lilies,
                  burdened the air with perfume; often as I have approached the shore in my
                  childhood, rowed up from the city in some little market boat, and drinking in
                  eagerly the enthusiastic account of the last camp-meeting by honest Sam and John
                  Moore, graced by the contented smile of dear old black Jenny, with her
                  well-remembered "ha ye ever," and her gentlemanly son Cæsar (next to my
                  grandmother my worshipped oracles), I have distinctly scented the perfume of the
                  lovely old garden, and my heart leaped for joy as I saw the venerable woman,
                  followed down the garden-walk by a favorite grandchild, as she levelled her
                  spy-glass to see who was coming. But sorrow slept in the waves over which our
                  little shallop danced so merrily, and tears that rivalled their saltness welled up
                  from those clear eyes that welcomed us so kindly. Lot the story of the watery
                  deaths be lost with those who felt them so keenly. Time has nearly effaced their
                  memory, and if the waves swallowed up the loved ones, they have restored smiles
                  and gladness to thousands who have drank health from this enchanting spot; of all
                  our city suburbs the most romantic and delightful. From the geological structure
                  of the place and its freedom from marshes, it is the most congenial to infancy. I
                  have seen the infant carried on board the steamboat, on a pillow, so near the
                  point of death that it refused nourishment for days, and the very day after its
                  arrival the mother's heart has answered the smile of returning health. I scarcely
                  remember the death of an infant of native birth during a life acquaintance with
                  the place. If the necessary accommodations could be had, thousands of infants
                  might be saved, who now languish and die in the city from the exhausting influence
                  of teething during the heats of our trying summers.
            
            THE END.
         
      
      
         
         

            THE SCALPEL:
            AN ENTIRELY ORIGINAL QUARTERLY EXPOSITOR OF THE LAWS OF HEALTH AND
               ABUSES OF MEDICINE AND DOMESTIC LIFE.
            Edited by EDWARD H. DIXON, M. D., Consulting and Operating Surgeon, 42
               Fifth Avenue, New York.
            "Nature is ever busy, by the silent operation of her own forces, endeavoring to cure
               disease. Her medicines are air, warmth, food, water, exercise and sleep; their use is
               directed by instinct, and that man is most worthy the name of physician who most
               reveres its unerring laws."
            DE WITT & DAVENPORT have constantly on hand complete sets of the SCALPEL,
               comprising six years, from No. 1—January, 1849 to August, 1854, bound in cloth, and
               neatly lettered and indexed—two years in each book, making three elegant volumes, of
               500 pages each, at $5 the set. When No. 32 is reached, there will be another book of
               500 pages, at $2, and so on. The three now bound, contain the series of humorous
               descriptions of the personal and mental peculiarities of the more eminent Physicians
               of New York, by the Editor, himself, in a strain of unrivalled humor. Sarcastic
               articles on Medical Ethics and Practice in New York; Essays on various subjects of
               Domestic Life, Dress, Diet, Furniture, &c.; Plain Expositions of all the Diseases
               of Infancy and Adult Life; Essays on Domestic Architecture; Scenes in Northern,
               Southern, and City Practice; Diseases of Women; an infinite number of Anecdotes,
               &c., &c., &c., all being entirety original. In short, the
               SCALPEL has fairly earned the title of the greatest Health Journal of the day, and is
               pronounced by the entire press, in more than 16,000 notices, to be an inexhaustible
               mine of amusement, instruction, and genial wit.
            The work is issued in January, April, July and October.

            OFF-HAND TAKINGS; OR, CRAYON SKETCHES OF THE NOTICEABLE MEN OF OUR AGE.
            BY GEORGE W. BUNGAY.
            GREAT NATIONAL WORK.
            
               Embellished with Nineteen Portraits on Steel. Elegantly bound in cloth.
               Price $1 50.
            This is a work that should be in the hands of every American who is proud of his
               country, and of the men who have helped to render that country honored abroad by
               their contributions in Literature, Science, Commerce or Arts. Though some of the
               persons in the following list are handled pretty roughly, still, we think most
               persons will allow that the hard treatment they get is deserved.
            The Book is well printed on beautiful paper, embellished with Nineteen Portraits,
               engraved on Steel, in the finest style of the art.

               OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.
               The following very brief extracts from extended t notices of the book by leading
                  papers, will give the public some idea of the estimation placed upon it.
               
                  From The Commonwealth, Boston. "The book will sell—it will be read—it
                  will have a wide popularity. It is written in the right way for it, and if the
                  author don't get his 10,000 from it we very much mistake figures. He writes like a
                  man who is fully wide awake; his portraits sparkle with vitality. The engravings
                  are superb, and the letter press excellent; the binding galaish. Get the book if
                  you want one that will take your arm and be an agreeable companion."
               
                  From The Christian Freeman, Boston. "He never allows anything like
                  dulness to flow from his pen. His descriptions are graphic and to the life. Every
                  sketch might be termed a master portrait. He writes with an independent, fearless
                  pen, without fear or favor."
               
                  From The Boston Traveller. "Written in a spirited and off-hand style,
                  presenting well-drawn and characteristic portraits."
               
                  From The Newport News, R. I. "The portraits are dashed off with a
                  free and easy pencil, and are uncommonly natural and life-like."
               
                  From The Ægis, Worcester, Mass. Every one who desires a knowledge of
                  eminent living men, should have this volume." We could fill a volume with the
                  encomiums already received (although all parts of the country have not been heard
                  from), but we think we do not err in saying that a more attractive book, both in
                  interior and exterior, has never been offered to the public.

                  In "BEATRICE" she taxes all her energies, and the result is a work of deep
                     interest and great power. Its object is to expose the deceptive arts of Popery
                     and of the Jesuits, and this it does with great truthfulness and effect. It can
                     not be otherwise than greatly useful in aiding, to remove from the world the
                     great curse of humanity—Popery.

               HELEN MULGRAVE; OR, JESUIT EXECUTORSHIP, is the title of a narrative by a
                  converted Catholic, showing one phase of the well-known intrigue and rascality
                  which Jesuit priests are wont to practice, in the case of wills and estates of the
                  dead. It is a-tale to harrow-up every generous and honorable feeling—and is all

            The public are aware that we have lately been involved in a course of litigation
               respecting a Book on Convent Life, and the result is also known. There is a great
               diversity of opinion respecting the injunction and its attending circumstances; but
               there is but one opinion as regards the merits of the book we have now the pleasure
               of presenting, and which contains a fuller and more detailed account of the inner
               life of Convents or Nunneries, than we could have presented in any other form. In
               order to render this volume as full an exposition as possible of the abuses of which
               it treats, and to give publicity to facts which admit of almost immediate
               verification, in addition to the principal narrative, the CONFESSIONS OF A "SISTER OF
               CHARITY," written by herself, are also embodied, together with THE
               EXPERIENCE OF A NUN, the details of whose eventful history are deeply interesting; so
               that in this invaluable work, we have a most diversified and thorough exposition of
               the immoralities and impostures as practised in nunneries.
            Parents and Guardians who have the, most distant idea of sending their children or
               wards to these prison-houses, falsely called "Institutions of Learning," should not
               fail to read the palpable evidences of their criminality in entertaining such a
               thought, as set forth in this book—evidences convincing arid undeniable. The profound
               sensation which these astounding revelations are destined to create, has been already
               experienced to some extent in the literary world, among editors who have been
               furnished with proof sheets of the work. They say that "It bears the unmistakable
               marks of truthfulness upon its face; and yet the mind shrinks with terror from the
               necessity of believing that such horrid criminalities are practised in convents. But
               here is Truth pointing with her unerring finger to the record and the
               facts, and to her revelations we are bound to yield implicit belief."
