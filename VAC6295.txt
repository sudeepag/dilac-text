               CHAPTER I.
               I HAD discovered at least three gray hairs on my last birthday, and girls of the mature age of fifteen were beginning to call me "old Miss Rossiter," when the Armstrongs first came to Altona. Lest this should not fix the date definitely enough to suit the statisticians, I will add that it was in the autumn of 1851.
               There were only three of them,—Mr. John Armstrong, a tall, stern-featured man of fifty-five, or thereabouts, and his two sons, Kenneth and Clyde. The brothers, one of whom was eighteen, the other fifteen, were half-brothers only; and there was no mother. Mr. Armstrong's last wife, who had been, so rumor said, a beautiful but in many respects a strange woman, many years younger than himself, had died a few months previous to his arrival in our little town, and had been buried in the family vault in Greenwood,—buried in great state, with all the éclat that funeral pomp and pageantry, nodding plumes, crape streamers, costly catafalque, mourning carriages in long array, and other wonderful trappings of wealth and woe could give to the performance ance. I remembered having read an account of it in the daily Tribune, which was the delight and solace of my winter evenings; and when I learned that Mr. John Armstrong of New York, formerly senior partner in the great house of Armstrong, Verner & Co., had bought the Elliot place, I knew he was the very man who had buried his wife so elaborately.
               Being of Quaker descent, and slightly inclined toward Quakerism myself, the glowing account of this funeral had simply disgusted me. On the whole, I rather regretted the coming of these new neighbors. I deplored the introduction of the new element of fuss and feathers into our simple country life.
               Yet, after all, it was pleasant to think that the Elliot place was to be a home once more. Its gateway was just opposite to my own; and I remembered how, as I sat in the window of my unpretending little house, busy with needle, or book, or pen, I had been wont to lift my eyes that I might catch glimpses of the young, light-robed figures that flitted among the trees, wandered down the garden-paths, or gathered at nightfall upon the broad piazza. It had been pleasant to sit in the soft darkness myself after the stars came out, and watch for the lights as, one by one, they twinkled from window and doorway; and to share, in my own quiet way, the full, free, joyous life that was going on so near me.
               But that was long ago. The Elliot quarry proved an utter failure, having swallowed up, after the manner of quarries, at least two independent fortunes. The white-robed figures flitted out of the house, and out of my life. The lights went out; the windows were closed; the gateway was nailed up; the rose-bushes grew riotous; the syringa thrust one of its long arms through a broken pane in the library; and the honeysuckles clambered unheeded to the very eaves. For awhile some tame pigeons hovered about the place, sat on the ridgepole, perched upon the tall chimneys, or swooped to the ground in search of food. But at length they too took their departure, and Tara's Hall was left to its own desolation.
               Now, however, there was a change. Mr. Elliot's agent, who had held nominal possession of the place, marshaled a small army of workmen and work-women, and in an incredibly short space of time it was swept and garnished and made ready for its new owner. Shrubbery was trimmed, paths were freshly graveled, the lawn—green yet, although it was late in October—was freshly shaven, and all the rubbish that had accumulated through years of neglect was carefully removed. Paint had been cleaned, windows brightened, the new carpets that had been sent from the city had been laid down, and the old furniture, that had gone with the house, had been uncovered and rearranged.
               It was five o'clock in the afternoon, and Mr. Armstrong was expected to-morrow. I was just laying the cloth for my solitary meal, and smiling to myself, as I placed upon the table a tiny crystal vase in which a scarlet salvia glowed against a background of white chrysanthemums, when I heard a quick knock at my door.
               It was Patsy. Probably the tall, angular woman, with iron-gray hair drawn plainly back from her forehead and coiled in the closest possible knot behind, keen, gray eyes, a sallow complexion, high cheek-bones, an air at once kindly, shrewd, and observant, and garments that hung straightly about her gaunt, spare figure,—probably, I say, this woman had at some remote period of her life been the acknowledged owner of another name. But Altona knew her as Patsy,—just Patsy; and as Patsy will she come and go upon the pages of this book. In one hand she flourished a huge feather duster, and over her arm hung a motley collection of parti-colored cloths. Laughing and panting, she sank upon the chair I offered her.
               "Dear me!" she said, glancing down at her odd equipments, "I didn't know that I had brought all this trumpery with me. I'd just been round the house gathering up the odds and ends, and I thought I'd run across bareheaded, to see if you wouldn't come over for a minute and take a look at things. I'm just flustrated, Miss Rossiter, that's a solemn fact!"
               "Flustrated?" I said, giving another twist to the green setting of my salvia. "Flustrated, Patsy? How is that? I thought nothing ever put you out."
               She smiled grimly. "Work never puts me out; but jimcracks are too much for me. I don't know what on airth to do with 'em. Come over, Miss Rossiter, do now! and see whether I've got 'em anyway near ship-shape."
               "I do not doubt that everything is right," I said, throwing a light shawl over my head, "and as neat as wax, Patsy, if you have taken charge of the sweeping and scrubbing."
               "Yes, I can tell dirt as far as any other woman; and there ain't a fly-speck nor a mite of dust about that house, I'll be bound. But when it comes to the little fixin's, then I'm beat. But hurry up, Miss Rossiter; it'll be dark before you know it, and I don't want to light no lights, mussing up the lamps and things!"
               We had crossed the road by this time, and were going in under the tall, arched gateway. The house stood upon rising ground, and the drive wound upward beneath forest trees,—stately maples centuries old, and birches that were ablaze with golden light. I would fain have paused a moment to watch the changing shadows, as the long, slanting sunbeams shot through them from the west; but Patsy strode on with the tread of a grenadier, bearing me with her. She had business on hand.
               We entered the house, and she led the way into the parlor, on the right. Spacious enough, homelike, and cozy, I thought; or would be when the household gods, so long banished to other shrines, should have come back again. I stepped about the room, making some slight changes in the arrangement of the furniture, and then ran out into the yard to gather treasures of gold and coral and amber where-with to fill the wedgwood vases that stood upon the mantel.
               "You do beat all!" exclaimed Patsy, in the exuberance of her delight. "Them vases do look wonderful! But come here, Miss Rossiter," she whispered pered, "come here! I've got something to show you. What on airth shall a body do with this thing?"
               She had drawn me toward a small round table that stood behind the door; and, as she spoke, she removed a heavy linen towel from an exquisite Parian statuette—an Eve.
               "I thought I'd better cover it up while the men-folks was round," she went on, in the same constrained whisper; "'tain't decent, Miss Rossiter, that's a fact. I wouldn't ha' believed the Elliots would ha' had such a thing in their house, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes."
               I did not answer at once. I was too much absorbed in admiring the beautiful figure, which I recognized from a print in my possession; and presently Patsy went on:
               "What is't an image of, anyhow? Brother Jeremiah he saw a wax figure of Martha Washington once, when he was down to New York. But this can't be her, stark naked and holding something that looks like an apple in her hand. I should ha' thought maybe it was Eve; but there's that great piece o' cloth hanging onto the stump of a tree, and I take it there hadn't been none manufactured in the Garden of Eden, or Eve wouldn't ha' made aprons out o' fig-leaves."
               I smiled at her quick detection of the anachronism, while I informed her that her supposition was correct, and that it was Eve, nevertheless.
               "Well, I never! Eve, is it? Do you suppose it looks like her, Miss Rossiter?" And for a moment Patsy forgot her scruples in eager curiosity. "Do you suppose she was so tall and shapely, and had such hair as that? Ain't it wonderful?"
               Taking advantage of her mood, I said,—
               "Yes, wiser people than you or I have thought it wonderful, Patsy. Let us put it on this bracket in the corner. It will look better there than on the table."
               But her horrified face checked me.
               "Not right there in plain sight? Maybe it's all right, Miss Rossiter; and if they've a mind to put it there when they come, well and good. I hain't anything to say about that. But, if you'd just as lief, I'd rather put it up in the parlor chamber-closet, on the top shelf, till they do come." And wrapping poor Eve in her linen covering again, Patsy bore her upstairs and consigned her to ignominious seclusion.
               "I didn't mean no offense, Miss Rossiter," she said, apologetically, when she came down. "But some things is decent and some things ain't; and I don't believe in putting that naked woman right here in the parlor. Old as I be, it made me color up when I saw one o' the plasterers a-looking at it; and when he'd gone out I covered it up quicker'n a wink."
               If I had not known and respected Patsy's real simplicity and purity of heart, I might have been tempted to whisper in her ear, "Evil to him that evil thinks," "To the pure all things are pure," and other proverbs of that ilk. But, as it was, I merely said,—
               "Let us go into some of the other rooms. Are they all settled, Patsy?"
               We wandered over the house,—through the chambers, into the library and dining-room,—and out into the kitchen and store-room. All was fresh, bright, and sweet, and I expressed my admiration accordingly.
               "I've taken a sight o' pains, that's a fact," said Patsy, giving a door-knob an extra polish with her apron. "You see, I expect this Mr. Armstrong will come on with a whole raft of help from the city, and I wanted to show 'em that we country-folks know a thing or two! It's all clean, at any rate." And Patsy opened drawer after drawer, and cupboard after cupboard, all immaculate in their purity.
               It was time for me to go home; but while Patsy was closing windows and fastening doors, I lingered upon the piazza. Ah! how beautiful they were,—the pictures that met my eyes wherever they turned! Altona was nestled high up among the hills,—a little, irregular, picturesque village, with mountains below it and mountains above it, yet with broad stretches of meadow-land as you looked down the valley, through which sparkled a narrow, dancing stream that had nothing to do but play. If the Elliot quarry had not proved a failure, it would have been taken captive and forced to work. As it was, it wandered at its own sweet will, rejoicing, I doubt not, in its happy idleness. So, as I stood there in the late afternoon, the lovely valley stretched away before me, beautiful in its green repose. Around me on each side towered the mountains peak on peak, their summits wrapped in rose and purple, amber and amethyst; while lower down were peaceful, rounded domes, clothed with pines and hemlocks to their very summits. I only caught stray glimpses of the village: here and there a gleam of white, a warm red, or a quiet brown,—the sparkle of a window-pane, or a single spire rising through the trees. Even my own small cottage, which was nearly opposite, was quite hidden from my sight, so dense was the foliage that rose between.
               And to-morrow the Armstrongs were coming! I went home to the company of my birds and flowers; and that night I dreamed of the strange wife and her magnificent funeral, and awoke to wonder what had induced her husband to tear himself away from all the associations of a prosperous lifetime and bury himself among our mountains.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               I WAS by no means the only person in Altona who wondered why Mr. Armstrong had come thither; or rather, why he was preparing to come. I differed from many others only in this,—that whereas they openly queried, made all sorts of guesses, and reached the wildest conclusions, I kept my thoughts to myself. Certain vague, undefined, shadowy rumors had floated to us over the hills,—just enough to arouse the idlers, who in every community, especially in one so isolated as ours, are always eager to hear and to tell some new thing. Altona found her little bit of a mystery a rare treat; it quite vivified and brightened her calm, slow-going life, and she made the most of it.
               As for me, I was by no means a gossip nor an idler; yet I found my thoughts wandering constantly to the Armstrongs. Had there been wife or daughter whose presence might have converted any domicile, even the rudest, into a home, it would, perhaps, have been less strange that a man hardly past his prime, in the full vigor of his intellect and the rich maturity of his powers, should suddenly throw up a flourishing and lucrative business, and come to our quiet town with the intention of making it a permanent residence. But that, with his two sons just verging upon manhood, and no mother or sister to rule the house with gentle ministry, he should attempt to build up a home in Altona, was odd, to say the least of it. I wondered if he knew how long the winter evenings would be; and if he thought how his boys would miss the stir and bustle, the stimulus and excitement, of the life to which they had been accustomed.
               The next day they came, as was expected. Altona lay off the line of the railroad, and the daily arrival of the stage was the great event of the day. Patsy had been over the house again that morning, "straightening out things," as she phrased it, although it would have puzzled any brain but hers to tell what there was to straighten. Finally, at my suggestion, she made a bright little fire upon the hearth in the library,—for the day was chilly,—and also one in the kitchen. Then she came over to me.
               "I don't want to disturb you, if you're particularly busy, Miss Rossiter," she said, glancing at my table. "But, if you haven't no objections, I should like to sit down by this window for a spell, and watch for the stage. After working so hard to get the house ready for 'em, I kind o' want to see what sort o' creeters they be."
               "I presume they are very much like other people, Patsy," I answered. "They will be tired and dusty and travel-worn, like ordinary mortals."
               "Oh, yes,—the gentry," said Patsy, meditatively. "They're pretty much alike the world over, I guess. But I wa'n't thinking so much about them as about their help. I want to see what sort o' followers they bring with 'em."
               But when in due season the stage-coach swept past the house, turned in under the gateway, and dashed up the hill beneath the overarching maple-boughs, it held precisely three passengers.
               "Why, they hain't brought a soul with 'em!" said Patsy, turning round blankly. "Not a soul. The old man he's as straight and smart as a prince of the blood, and the boys are likely-looking fellows enough. The smallest one's been sick, I guess. Did you see how pale he was?"
               "No; he was on the back seat, and I did not notice him," I answered.
               "Well, he don't look fit to stand, much less to be traveling round. Miss Rossiter—!"
               I looked up, but Patsy was in a brown study. After a minute I said,—
               "What is it, Patsy?"
               "Nothing," she answered; "only I was a-thinking. That sick boy ought to have his dinner, and how is he going to get it, I should like to know? Nobody in the house but men folks, and the Lord knows they're just as helpless as babies, allus."
               I did not reply. She was capable of solving her problem without any of my help. Presently she went on,—
               "Would you, Miss Rossiter?"
               "Would I what?"
               "Why, would you go up there and see if you could help 'em get settled and comfortable? I'd go in a minute if they was poor folks."
               "Rich folks stand in need of kind offices sometimes as well as poor ones," I answered. "If that sick boy needs his dinner, he needs it,—that's all."
               She hesitated awhile longer, fidgeting in her seat.
               "I tell you what, Miss Rossiter, I'll go up, if you'll go with me. You just go along and tell 'em what's what, and I'll do the best I can for 'em."
               It was my turn to hesitate. I knew just exactly what our village Mrs. Grundy would say of Margaret Rossiter, if she was in such haste to make the acquaintance of the new-comers. But what had that to do with the question? It was just as Patsy had said. Had these neighbors of mine been poor, or had they been women, I should not have hesitated a moment to go frankly to welcome them, bearing the cup of cold water. Was neighborly kindness, then, a question of circumstance or sex?
               "Can't you go without me, Patsy? I am very busy to-day." And then I despised myself for the subterfuge.
               "No; they're more your sort of folks than they are mine, Miss Rossiter. I'm willing to help 'em all I can, but you must go up there with me, and tell 'em how 'tis."
               So it rested with me whether the sick boy should have a Christian dinner set before him that day.
               I rose, put away my work, and went to the pantry. There was a light, covered basket there, into which I put divers articles, to wit: a loaf of wheaten bread, a few new-laid eggs, a chicken ready for the gridiron, and a pat of butter. Taking these with us as a peace-offering, we started.
               "If they don't want to see us, and ain't civil, we can go back again," said Patsy, consolingly, as she strode up the hill. "We shall have done our duty, anyhow."
               With which thought I strengthened myself, as I followed after.
               But we were most cordially welcomed by Mr. Armstrong, who came out upon the piazza to meet us,—doubtless with a suspicion of our friendly errand,—and took us into the library. There we found Clyde, the younger son, who was evidently just recovering from a severe illness, lying upon the lounge, pale and exhausted; while the elder, Kenneth, was trying to arrange a palatable meal for him from the contents of their lunch-basket. It was not very inviting.
               "Wait a moment," I said. "Here is something that will do better, perhaps." And I lifted the cover from mine. "There is a fire in the kitchen, I believe, and Patsy will broil this chicken for you in a trice."
               Clyde thanked me with his eyes, if not with his voice; and, seizing the basket, Patsy disappeared. Mr. Armstrong explained their awkward dilemma by saying that, not caring to bring servants from the city, he had telegraphed to Mr. Elliot's agent to make all necessary arrangements; but that, on reaching the last telegraph station on the way up, he found the dispatch still lying there.
               "Your thoughtful kindness, madam," he added, "makes us comfortable for to-day, and I hope to be able to make all needful arrangements to-morrow. We are greatly your debtors for your prompt neighborliness."
               "If you feel compelled to thank any one," I answered, as I shook up Clyde's pillows, "it should be Patsy, not me. She made the suggestion that brought me up here."
               "The very paragon of servants," he replied, smiling. "Is she the rara avis she seems, or are others of her kind to be found here?"
               "Oh, Patsy is not a servant, sir, in your acceptation of the word. Your agent engaged her to take charge of the cleaning and arranging of the house; and she has done it. But she has a comfortable little home of her own; and, although always willing to come to the assistance of those who need her help, and not above being paid for her good offices, she would still scorn to be called a 'servant.'"
               "I understand," he answered, laughing, "and I assure you her scruples shall be respected. Such characters grow out of this mountain soil as naturally as do its pines and hemlocks."
               I rose to go; for in the adjoining room I heard the dishes rattling under Patsy's rapid hands, and I knew the chicken was nearly ready for presentation. But just then she came in to whisper to me that, although the store-room had been filled in advance, salt had been unaccountably forgotten.
               "I thought maybe they might have a little in their lunch-basket," she answered; "just enough for dinner."
               I made known her want, and it was supplied. But as she was leaving the room with it, Mr. Armstrong stopped her.
               "This lady informs us that we are indebted to you for a warm, homelike dinner, Miss—Miss——"
               "Patsy," she said; "just Patsy. Don't put any handle onto my name, sir; nobody does."
               "Well, Patsy, then. How can I best thank you?"
               "By saying nothing, sir, and eating the chicken, which is done to a turn." And out she bolted. In a second she put her head in at the door again. "It's allus best to have a fair understanding, sir; and I want to have you know that I ain't a-looking for a place. 'Tain't necessary. I've got a home of my own. But when I saw how pale that young man looked, I thought he ought to have something warm to eat, and that I ought to get it ready for him; so I came. That's all." And before any one could reply to her, the door closed, and she was off.
               And that's the way the Armstrongs had their first dinner in Altona, and made the acquaintance of Patsy.
               She consented to stay with them for a few days, until they could make other arrangements; and I began to foresee that they would find it hard to part with her. The days became a week, and the week had lengthened into a fortnight, when one evening she came quietly in and took a seat without a word. Knowing her ways, I simply nodded to her and went on with my reading. After awhile she spoke.
               "Miss Rossiter, what do you think is up now?"
               "I cannot guess, unless Mr. Armstrong wants you for a housekeeper, or something of that sort."
               "The very thing," she said, looking up suddenly. "Who told you?"
               "No one; but I have not lived in Yankee-land all my days for nothing. I guessed it."
               She rocked back and forth, gazing steadily into the fire that gleamed and sparkled on the hearth.
               "Miss Rossiter," she exclaimed, at last, "for the land's sake, tell me what to do! I'm in a regular quandary."
               "What do you want to do?"
               "That's the very point. I don't know."
               Now Patsy generally knew her own mind. Indecision was not one of her weaknesses. So I waited awhile, confident that I should soon hear more. Presently she went on.
               "They're just the nicest folks to live with that ever was, Miss Rossiter, that's a fact!" And Patsy's hand dropped upon her knee emphatically. "They know what they want, and how they want it; and when they get it they're satisfied, and there ain't no grumbling. I hain't got no fault to find with 'em; and Mr. Armstrong says he'll pay me just what I say, and I may have anybody I want to help in the kitchen and do the rough work. I should calculate to do the cooking myself, pretty much."
               "Aha, Miss Patsy!" I thought to myself, "you have 'pretty much' made up your mind, after all." But I said,—
               "Mr. Armstrong makes you a very fair offer. Why do you hesitate about accepting it?"
               "Oh, I don't know," she answered, wheeling round. "There are some things——They're queer—not just like other folks. I don't know what to make of 'em, sometimes."
               "I like people that have some individuality," I answered. "Stereotyping is a very convenient process, doubtless, but we do not care to have it applied to human nature."
               Patsy was by no means an ignorant person, reader, notwithstanding her perpetual warfare with Lindley Murray. It was not necessary to choose one's words or figures, lest they should be above her comprehension.
               "That's true," she said. "I thank the Lord that he didn't make us all after one pattern. I should get sick o' living quick enough, if the world was all made up of Patsys! But, Miss Rossiter," and here she lowered her voice, "that ain't what I mean. It's more than that: there's something kind of mysterious about 'em."
               "Nonsense, Patsy!" I said, laughing. "Mysteries in the broad daylight of this nineteenth century! Let the gossips down at the corners talk, if they must, but do you keep clear of their fol-de-rol. You and I are old enough to be sensible."
               Patsy did not reply directly to my words; but her voice sank to a still lower key, as she said,—
               
               "What ever brought 'em up here, Miss Rossiter? That's what puzzles me. The old man's as uneasy as a fish out of water; anybody can see that. He ain't used to this quiet sort o' life, and he ain't made for it, neither."
               "But that is neither your business nor mine," I answered, virtuously ignoring all my own queryings and surmises. "Mr. Armstrong has an undoubted right to live where he chooses."
               "Yes; and as he chooses; and I don't propose to interfere with it. But, Miss Rossiter, there was something queer about that man's last wife, just as sure as you live; about her life or death, I ain't certain which."
               "Why do you think so?"
               "Oh, I don't hardly know; I feel it, somehow. They don't never speak of her, for one thing; and one day, when I said something about her, Mr. Armstrong shut me up mighty quick!"
               "How was it? Tell me about it," I said. You see my curiosity wanted its little crumb of comfort, after all.
               "Oh, I was in the library one day, helping Kenneth hang some pictures and things. They've brought down that statoo of Eve, Miss Rossiter," she added, in a parenthesis, "and put it right on that very bracket; did you ever? But, as I was saying, we was hanging up pictures and things. There was a portrait of Mr. Armstrong, and one of his first wife,—that's Kenneth's mother; and, naturally enough, I spoke about his looking so much like it. He's got her very eyes and nose and hair, and the way his head is sot onto his shoulders is just like hern. His mouth is firmer and more set, somehow; but, take it by and large, it's a most wonderful likeness, and I said so. Then I said to Kenneth, 'Clyde must be the image of his mother, too, for he don't look a mite like you, nor like his father. There's just room for her picture over there, on 'tother side o' Mr. Armstrong.' Mercy! Mr. Armstrong was standing by the bookcase, with a big book in his hand, and he dropped it as if he'd been shot. I never saw a man's face change so: he looked blacker'n a thunder-cloud. Pretty soon he went out into the sitting-room, where Clyde was, and shut the door after him; and Kenneth whispered, 'We have no painting of Clyde's mother to hang there, Patsy. Hand me that Beatrechy.' And then I handed up to him a picture of a young woman with great, mournful eyes, and a white cloth wrapped round her head. I hain't no idea who she is. Some cousin, most likely."
               "But what about Mr. Armstrong? You said he stopped you."
               "Oh, yes. He came back in a minute or two and motioned to Kenneth to go out. Then he said to me, just as solemn, 'Patsy, there are reasons why I wish you never to speak of Clyde's mother,—especially not to him, nor in his presence. I cannot explain, but I can trust you to observe my wishes, can I not?' I was dumfounded, as it were, but I spoke up and said, 'Yes, sir, you can. I hope I know enough to hold my tongue when I'm asked to, civilly.' He smiled just a little bit: I saw it working round the corners of his mouth; and the very next day he asked me if I wouldn't stay and live with 'em always. I told him 'always' was a great while, and I should have to think on't for a spell; and I tell you what, Miss Rossiter, I've kept up a desperate thinking ever sence."
               I did not reply. It was a matter in which I did not wish to advise her; so I kept silent.
               "Miss Rossiter!"
               "What, Patsy?"
               "Kenneth said they hadn't got no picture of Clyde's mother to hang there on the t'other side of Mr. Armstrong. And maybe they hain't,—not to hang just there; but there's a picture of her in the house, I'll bet."
               "Don't be too suspicious, Patsy."
               "I ain't; and it's nothing to me, anyhow. But it's queer, that's all."
               "What makes you think there is a picture of Clyde's mother in the house?"
               "I'll tell you. Was you ever up garret, over there?" And she nodded her head in the right direction.
               "Never."
               "Well, there's a little narrow closet up there. What it was made for beats me; just to accommodate Mr. Armstrong, I guess. When the pictures came, I noticed that there was three of 'em, all of a size; each one wrapped up tight in some old blankets, so that the frames shouldn't get scratched. Two o' them pictures was taken into the library and undid; the other one was spirited away somewhere, out o' sight and hearing. The next day I was up garret, putting away things, when I heard somebody coming slowly up the stairs. It was Mr. Armstrong, with that third picture. He went straight to the little closet, as if he had studied the ground before-hand, put it in there and locked the door; then he put the key in his pocket and went down-stairs again. It was kind o' dark up there, and I was 'way off in one corner. He didn't see me at all; and it was all done in a minute, or I should have showed myself, for I ain't no spy nor eavesdropper. Now, Miss Rossiter, what do you think?"
               "I think it is all, as you say, queer. But we need not suspect evil because there are some things that we cannot comprehend."
               She was silent for some time; then she got up and went to the window.
               "I'm kind o' drawn to 'em, that's a fact, Miss Rossiter; and they need me,—that's another fact."
               I smiled to myself, but said nothing. Very soon she went on:
               "I sha'n't be bound to stay there no longer'n I have a mind to. I guess I'll try it for a spell, Miss Rossiter,—anyhow till Clyde gets strong again. He's had an awful time, they say."
               "Is he gaining?"
               "Slowly. But you never saw the beat of the way his father sticks to him and humors him and pets him. There's nothing in the house that's too good for that boy, you'd better believe; Kenneth's nowhere with the old man when Clyde's around. And that's pretty much always, for they never leave him alone a minute."
               
               "That is because they have been so near losing him," I answered. "He is hardly out of the valley of death yet, you must remember."
               So Patsy found a tenant for the little house that she had bought and paid for with her own earnings, packed up her rag carpet, and stored away her furniture; then she went to live with the Armstrongs.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               "BENJAMIN! BENJAMIN!"
               The words rang out sharply and querulously, as if born of inward anguish. Yet there was an infinite longing in them. They thrilled me from head to foot. Leaving my seat by the window, where I had been gazing out into the gathering twilight, I approached the bed on which Mr. Armstrong lay wrestling with disease, mayhap with death.
               "What is it, Mr. Armstrong?" I said, as I bent over him and moistened his lips with a cordial. "Is there anything I can do for you?"
               "Kenneth," he said, faintly; for the sudden spasm of strength that had given volume to his voice had expended itself,—" Kenneth. I want Kenneth. Has he come?"
               "Not yet, sir. But he has been sent for, you know. He will be here soon, I think."
               "To-night?"
               "I hope so; but it is a long journey. There may be delays and hindrances. He will come as speedily as he can, I know; for the message was urgent, as you requested."
               "He must come to-night, or it will be too late. Miss Rossiter, kneel down here and ask the God you believe in to let me live a little longer,—till I can see my boy again."
               He looked so old and worn! It was pitiful to see him lying there in his helplessness. Was this the strong man who, five years ago when he first came to Altona, had carried himself, to use Patsy's words, "like a prince of the blood"?
               He repeated the request, imploringly. "Pray that I may live until Kenneth comes. I must live! I will live, Miss Rossiter! But the struggle is hard, hard. Pray!"
               The God that I believed in! Did not he believe in Him too? I asked the question.
               "Yes, yes; I believe that there is a God, and that He hears and answers prayer. I don't believe all that you do, Miss Rossiter, but I believe that. So ask Him to help me to live a little longer. See there!" And he stretched out his hand. Purple stains were deepening beneath the nails, and upon his face was the strange, awful grayness that is the sure precursor of death.
               I knelt by his side, still holding the aged hand in mine, and prayed. It was a simple prayer, dealing with none of the high things of heaven and earth; not even touching upon the relation between that departing soul and its Creator. I only asked that Kenneth might come while yet his father had strength to speak to him.
               
               "Thank you," he said, as my voice broke, and I rose from my knees. "I think he will come."
               For some reason, that was to us utterly unaccountable, Mr. Armstrong had, ever since his illness became dangerous, been unwilling to have Clyde about him. The disease was not contagious, and there was no apparent cause for his denying himself the presence of his youngest child,—his Benjamin. I knew that the cry I had heard came from the depths of a yearning heart; and I knew, too, that Clyde was wandering restlessly about, grieving over his father's seeming waywardness. Just then I heard his footsteps in the library below.
               "Clyde is down-stairs," I said. "Shall I call him up? Poor fellow! he wants to be with you."
               A spasm passed over the father's face,—a look of unutterable love and longing. He stretched out his arms as if to clasp the empty air. I thought he was about to consent, and turned toward the door; but he stopped me.
               "No," he said, sharply. "Do not call him. And do not speak of it again: it tortures me. There are reasons, Miss Rossiter. I must not see him."
               I said no more, although I still considered his decision a half-delirious whim. Poor old man! I judged him more truly after awhile.
               The shadows darkened in the room, and deepened upon the old man's face, as it lay there upon the pillow, framed in by his silvery hair. It had grown so white during these five years! Its ebon had been just touched with gray when he first came to Altona. Now it was like the snow. Down-stairs I heard Clyde's restless footsteps, as he paced back and forth,—now in the library, now in the hall, now in the parlor.
               After awhile Patsy brought in a shaded lamp. I was glad of it, for the darkness was growing weird and terrible.
               "How is he?" she whispered, as she placed the light behind a screen.
               "Better," Mr. Armstrong answered, in a strong, clear voice. "Better; for I am almost through. I am only waiting for Kenneth. Has he come, Patsy?"
               "Not yet," she replied. "He can't come till ten o'clock, sir. Train gets into Bloomfield at nine, and it's a good hour's ride from there here."
               He did not answer by word, or look, or sign; his soul was, as he said, just waiting,—waiting for Kenneth. I watched him narrowly. There was no weakness, no irresolution, in his face now. That had passed, and with it the agony of death. He was biding his time in patient submission, sure that his indomitable will would serve him to the end. Once, as I gave him a cordial, he smiled.
               "It is not necessary," he said. "I cannot die till Kenneth comes. What time is it?"
               Nine o'clock—half-past nine—ten! The face I had been watching so long changed as the clock struck. A look of eagerness and unrest took the place of its quiet expectation.
               Five minutes more, and there was a sound of wheels upon the gravelly road, an opening and shutting of doors, Clyde's voice, Kenneth's. Presently I heard footsteps upon the stairs.
               
               I opened the door. Kenneth stood there—and Clyde. The father saw only the former.
               "My son! my son! Now God be praised!"
               "Father!"
               It was Clyde's voice. The arms that had been out-stretched to clasp Kenneth turned at the sound, and for an instant the younger son lay upon his father's breast, held in a close embrace.
               "Let me stay, father!" he cried. "I cannot leave you again. Kenneth, I must stay!"
               "Now, may God help us both, my Clyde; but you must go! If you love me—go!"
               Without a word, the young man withdrew himself from his father's arms, and left the room. I followed, and closed the door.
               We went down-stairs,—Clyde and I,—he groping darkly, although the hall was ablaze with light, until I took his hand and led him into the library. Then, without speaking, or even looking at me, he sank into a chair by the table, and dropped his head upon his folded arms. The boy was bewildered. He had been his father's constant companion. During his twenty years of life he had received from him only the most unchanging tenderness, the most unfailing sympathy. For the last five years they had been inseparable. Kenneth, soon after the family removed to Altona, had returned to college; and since his graduation, had been pursuing his medical studies in New York. But Clyde and his father had remained quietly in our little town among the hills, never leaving it save for occasional excursions to points of interest in the vicinity. They had read together, studied together, rode, walked, hunted, and fished in company. Discovering that his son possessed a taste for horticulture and landscape-gardening, and an enthusiastic and almost womanly love for flowers, Mr. Armstrong spared no pains nor expense to develop and cultivate that taste, to gratify that love. Under their united care and labor the grounds about "Grey-holt"—for so Clyde had named the place, out of reverence for the stately forest-trees that sheltered it upon the north—had become a miracle of beauty. At least they seemed so to our unaccustomed eyes. A small conservatory, with a fine southern exposure, had been added to the house; and there the two had spent hours each day, in the cultivation of rare and costly plants that could not endure the rigor of our northern winters.
               Recollections of all this sweet and familiar intercourse swept over me as I looked upon the boy's bowed head, and a wordless pity filled my heart. Wordless; for what could I say? I could not explain his father's persistence in banishing him from his room and presence; and failing of that, silence was my safest resource. So we sat there silently, almost breathlessly, while occasionally the murmur of voices in the room above us met our ears. Once in awhile I could even distinguish Mr. Armstrong's, raised for a moment in some stress of pain or excitement, or Kenneth's stronger tones, in earnest question or response. Then all was silent. Minute after minute passed, each seemingly of an hour's duration,—minute after minute, until the clock struck one.
               I looked at Clyde. He still sat motionless, with his face buried in his arms. Perhaps he slept. I hoped so. But I could bear that awful stillness no longer. Creeping past Clyde, I stole up-stairs, and tapped gently upon that closed door. There was no response. I laid my hand upon the knob. It turned easily in my clasp, and the door swung noiselessly open.
               It was as I had suspected: Mr. Armstrong had gone. But there was no sign of pain or struggle upon the face that met my gaze as I entered, and the lamplight fell upon the massive brow, the silvery hair, and flowing beard. It was as calm and placid as an infant's, yet grand and awful with the sublimity of death.
               Kenneth sat by the bedside, with his back toward me, and his head bent forward upon the pillow so that the dark locks mingled with the white. One arm was thrown across his father's breast. The other fell listlessly by his side, but in the hand was clasped a folded paper. A small writing-desk of Mr. Armstrong's stood open upon a chair near by, and a bunch of keys lay upon the carpet.
               I stepped forward and laid my hand upon Kenneth's shoulder.
               "Come away, dear Kenneth," I said; "this is no place for you now. You can do no good here, and Clyde needs you."
               A strong shudder swept over him, as he lifted his heavy eyes to my face.
               "Clyde?" he said,—"Clyde?" in a vague, bewildered sort of way. "Ah, yes, I remember. I will go down to him. I forgot. It is all so new and strange. Yes, I will go down to him, aunty. God help us both!"
               You will perceive that my relations with the Armstrongs had long since passed the bounds of mere neighborliness, and grown into warm and earnest friendship. Kenneth and Clyde had both fallen into the habit of calling me "aunty," and I liked it. In my somewhat lonely old-maidenhood,—for I was brotherless and sisterless,—it did me good to have those two young lives claim kinship with me. This relationship of election, of affinity, was perhaps dearer to me than if it had been that of blood.
               Mechanically, Kenneth picked up the keys, locked the desk, and restored it to its accustomed place. Then he returned to the bedside, and for a long minute stood gazing upon his father's placid face. Stooping, at last, he pressed his fingers upon the already-closed eyelids, kissed the marble brow, and turned away.
               "Poor Clyde!" he said, with a long, weary breath. "Yes, aunty, I must go down to him."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IV.
               "WHERE is he?" he said, as we descended the stairs.
               "In the library."
               But he did not go there at once. Pausing at the foot of the staircase, he looked irresolutely at the folded paper he still held, turning it over and over. Then he said,—
               "Aunty, can you get me an envelope and some sealing-wax without disturbing Clyde?"
               "I saw some in the parlor yesterday," I answered, "and pens and ink, too."
               He took a small lamp from the table, motioning for me to follow him.
               He put the paper in an envelope, and sealed it with his own seal. Then he took a pen, and after a moment's thought, during which his head dropped wearily upon his hand, he wrote as follows:
               "Kenneth Armstrong.—In case of his death, this paper is to be burned unopened."
               Taking up the lamp, he said,—
               "Come with me."
               I followed him into a small room, between the dining-room and the library, where the large safe was standing.
               "Hold the light, please," he said. And I stood by while he unlocked the triple doors and deposited the paper in the innermost recess. Then he relocked the safe. A noise in the dining-room startled me,—every noise startled me that night,—and I stepped to the door, which stood ajar. It was only Dennis, replenishing the fire.
               He touched his hat, after his usual fashion.
               "And how is it with the masther now, yer honor?" he asked, in a low voice.
               "Your master is dead," I answered; and then interrupting him, as he crossed himself and commenced to pour forth a torrent of "God rest his sowls," and "Howly mother, have mercys," I bade him tell Patsy, who would see that everything needful was done.
               I went back to Kenneth, and, as the rays from the lamp I held fell full upon his face, I was alarmed by its unearthly paleness. It was blanched to the hue of the grave. The dead face up-stairs was not as white, not as ghastly.
               Putting down the lamp, I laid a hand upon either arm, and pushed him with gentle violence toward a large easy-chair that stood near.
               "Wait a moment," I said. "You must not go to Clyde with such a face as that. Sit here while I bring you a glass of wine. You are worn out with your long ride, and the excitement of this sad coming home. Have you had any supper to-night?"
               He shook his head.
               "I thought not. Promise me that you will not stir till I come back."
               He assented, mutely. When I returned, with a small tray of refreshments, I found him lying back in the chair in a dead faint.
               
               My first thought was to call Patsy. With my second, came the conviction that I had better call no one. That this exceeding emotion, that had shaken the strong man like a reed, grew out of Kenneth's interview with his father and had some connection with the paper I had seen placed in the safe, I could not doubt. Vigorous, stalwart young men of three-and-twenty do not faint at the death of parents, be they loved ever so fondly. This was something more than ordinary filial sorrow. Whatever it might be, I would shield it from all curious eyes.
               Fortunately, restoratives were near at hand, and in a few moments I had the satisfaction of seeing him revive. In a quarter of an hour he was able to sit up and take a little of the food I had prepared for him.
               "You are not quite so ghastly now," I said, removing the tray. "Dear Kenneth, you must be strong,—for Clyde's sake."
               "Yes; for Clyde's sake," he answered. "Let us go and find him."
               We went into the library, but he was not there; nor in hall, nor in parlor, nor in dining-room, nor in kitchen. Up-stairs in the room, I heard the voices and footsteps of those who were making our dead ready for the grave, and I knew it was in vain to look for him there. I went into all the other chambers; he was in none of them. When I made my report, Kenneth and I looked into each other's faces in blank amaze.
               "Now, don't you worry," said Patsy, coming to the rescue with her strong common sense. "He's just stepped out to get a breath o' fresh air, most likely. He'll be in in a minute or two."
               But the minute or two passed, and he did not come in.
               "The young masther might chance to be in the conservatory, yer honor," said Dennis, who had been called into council.
               It was most improbable that he would be there, at this hour of the night, or rather of the morning, for it was now past two o'clock; but, nevertheless, I followed Dennis's suggestion. The moonbeams streamed in through the glass roof, the little fountain played musically in the centre of the room, the roses and heliotropes filled the soft, summer-like air with fragrance, the balmy breath of violets welcomed me. All was quiet, peaceful, and serene. The place had no human tenant.
               "He has gone out into the night," said Kenneth, as I returned to the library. "We must find him."
               "Now, Kenneth," interrupted Patsy, laying her strong, helpful hand upon his arm, "you're not going to stir a peg. You look fit to drop this very minute. Dennis and I'll go, and we'll find him in a jiffy."
               When Patsy first took up her abode at Greyholt, she had faithfully tried, as she said, "to put a handle onto them boys' names." But one day she gave up in despair.
               "It's no use, boys," she said, laughing; "I can't do it. I ain't used to it, nohow. If I say 'Mister Kenneth' to-day, I forget it to-morrow. I shall have to give up trying, I guess, for I feel as if I was making a fool of myself."
               
               And plain "Kenneth" and "Clyde" it had been ever since, quite to the content of "the boys" as well as herself; for they were not over-sensitive with regard to the matter, and her awkward attempts at wearing an unaccustomed livery had afforded them infinite amusement.
               "Get your lantern, Dennis," I said, without giving Kenneth a chance to reply. "The moon is behind the clouds half the time. Patsy, you must stay here with Kenneth. The people up-stairs may need you. I will go with Dennis myself."
               There was some demurring, but I carried my point; and by the time Dennis appeared with his lantern, I was ready.
               It was a whole hour before we found Clyde Armstrong. We went here, there, everywhere: in the woods back of the house, down by the creek, followed the windings of the one irregular village street, and finally thought of the big rock in the hill-pasture.
               "Bedad, Miss Rossiter, and does yer honor think the young masther has been spirited away?" said Dennis, at last, as he sat down on a large stone for a minute. "Indade, I had best run down to the village, me lady, an' knock upon the doors, and rouse up all the payple at once't."
               "No, no, Dennis, that won't do at all," I answered, for I so dreaded village gossip. "We will go home now; and if your young master is not there, we will see what can be done next."
               He helped me down into the road, for the way was rough, and then we walked rapidly on. Suddenly my companion spoke.
               "By the powers, Miss Rossiter, but will yer honor look yonder?"
               The moon favored us at that instant, and, following the direction of his finger, I saw Clyde sitting high up on a jutting rock above the dam, with his feet almost in the water, that was rushing swiftly to its fall. He seemed to be a target for the moonbeams just then, and his whole person and face were irradiated. He looked so strangely in that weird light that I thought of somnambulism and I know not what.
               "Now may the saints preserve us! But how will we get at him?" asked Dennis. "Feth, but the lad looks like an angel! Ye can see the glory in his hair."
               It was a beautiful picture; but it occurred to me that we had no time to spend in admiration.
               "We must get him home," I said. "There is no time to lose. Dennis, go round to the foot of the dam and look up. I think there are steps on that side: loose stones, by which he got up there. But don't you go near him without me; mind, now."
               "Indade, and I'll do yer honor's bidding. God bless me soul, but the lad looks like a wraith."
               I do not know what I feared, but my heart almost stopped beating as Dennis crept round upon the rocks. I half expected that if Clyde caught a glimpse of him he would give one leap into the swirling, seething waters below. I knew that he had suffered intensely during these last few days; I knew that his nature was impulsive, passionate, and that with him the deed was apt to come first, the thought afterward. I did not know to what wild act he might be driven by the agony, the long suspense, of that night. Certainly it could have been only in a moment of semi-madness that he had wandered off in this way and at this hour.
               Presently Dennis came back and reported. He could reach the spot where Clyde was sitting, easily enough, but he doubted whether the "fut of a lady" could succeed in climbing there. Meanwhile Clyde looked straight at us as we stood in the shadow, but did not notice us. Occasionally he threw a stick or a stone into the stream, but for the most part he sat motionless, gazing off into infinite space, or down into the whirling waters. Perhaps, after all, I had better not approach him, and Dennis could do the work better than I; so I bade him go on, cautioning him against precipitancy on the one hand, and too great delay upon the other.
               He nodded understandingly; and pretty soon I heard him call out, in the most matter-of-fact, commonplace way imaginable,—
               "Misther Clyde, wud yer honor be plased to descind for a bit? Miss Rossiter wud like to be spakin' wid ye; and, faith, this is but an onconvaynient place for a lady."
               All the while he was scrambling up the rocks faster and faster, and by the time he had done speaking he was by Clyde's side, with his hand on his shoulder. My breath came freely again, for the danger, if there had been any, was over. The young man rose slowly, passed his hand over his eyes as if to clear his vision, and came quietly down from his airy perch.
               If there had been any danger. I do not know to this day whether there was any or not. There was a strange, unnatural look in Clyde's eyes as he joined me, and, with all his native courtesy, drew my arm within his. But he uttered never a syllable. Neither did I; but I strode over that ground at a pace I had never equaled before. To get my charge home and into bed was the acme of my wishes.
               He asked no questions,—never mentioned his father or Kenneth. As we neared the gate I managed to convey a whispered message to Dennis's ear that sent him on at a rapid rate. I bade him see that the coast was clear, and say that I thought it was not best that any one should see Clyde that night.
               When we went into the house, all was still and dark and quiet,—as I hoped to find it. One small lamp burned in the hall.
               "It must be getting late," I said, in the most unconcerned way. "I suppose it is bedtime. Take this light, Clyde, and I will find another."
               "Good-night," he answered, and went up-stairs.
               I heard him go into his room. Then I stole softly to the door and listened there until I heard him get into bed, and the light ceased to shine through the keyhole.
               Kenneth and Patsy were waiting for me in the kitchen.
               "Well, if this don't beat the very Dutch!" said the latter, wiping her eyes. "Dennis has told us where you found him. That he should have gone there to-night, of all nights in the year!"
               Kenneth rose wearily. "We won't talk about it," he said. "And, Patsy," he continued, "we will say nothing of this to Clyde to-morrow; it is not best."
               "I agree with you there," she answered; "'least said is soonest mended,' 'most allus, to my thinking. But come now, children, we must go to bed,"—I had slept at Greyholt for a few nights,—"it's e'en-a'most daylight a'ready. The world don't stand still, if folks do go out of it, and the hours go on just the same whether we live or die. Breakfast'll have to be got to-morrow morning, and eaten, just as if nothing had happened."
               She took her light and went off.
               When we met around the breakfast-table, at a late hour the next morning, Clyde made no allusion whatever to the events of the night before. Some inward consciousness must have told him that his father was dead. No questions were asked, and no information was volunteered. But as we rose from the table, he asked, simply,—
               "Where is he?"
               "In his own room," answered Kenneth. And as Clyde, with a slow step, turned towards the stairs, his brother followed him.
               "No," said Clyde, "I must go alone. You had him last night; I must have him now."
               Kenneth turned back without a word. But after Clyde had entered that darkened chamber, and closed the door behind him, he stole softly up-stairs and kept watch there silently, listening intently for every sound.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               "THEY say the old man didn't leave no will."
               It was the week after the funeral. I had gone down to the village store to get two yards of brown alpaca to match a dress which was undergoing repairs. A chill north wind swept through the valley. Doors and windows were closed, and the building was filled with that indescribable combination of odors that belongs to a country store, and to that alone,—codfish, molasses, dried herring, tea, coffee, spices, tobacco, leather, hams, and camphor. Out of the strange conglomeration, my sensitive nose singled each separate odor and gave it due credit. A counter ran along each side of the front room. Upon the right were the "dry-goods," which comprehensive term included everything, from a counterpane to a ball of candle-wick; from the oranges and scarlets and blues—the bright plaids and gay ribbons with which our belles were wont to adorn themselves—to the sober browns and sombre blacks, which were the "only wear" of their mothers and grandmothers; from the broadcloth of the judge to the satinet of the plow-boy.
               On the opposite side, the shelves groaned beneath the weight of crockery; and farther down were boots, shoes, kegs of nails, brooms, mop-sticks, and a motley collection of tinware and Yankee notions. In the back-room—but we will penetrate no farther, lest we should lose our way among the plows, the wash-tubs, the barrels, the baskets, the salt-sacks.
               In the middle of the front room stood a rusty stove, with a wooden bench upon either side; and upon the benches sat two men—whittling.
               "They say't the old man didn't leave no will."
               These words met my ear as I bent over the counter comparing the brown alpaca with the sample I held in my hand.
               "Ain't none needed, as I knows on," was the answer. "What was the use of makin' one? There's jest them two boys, and of course they'll share and share alike."
               "Mebbe you're right; squire; I don't say't you ain't right. But I'm got a kind of a prejudice in favor o' wills. It allus seemed to be a sort o' solemn and dignified way o' windin' up a man's airthly consarns."
               "Have you made yourn, major?"
               "Law, no, squire! I hain't yet. It would seem kind o' like signin' my death-warrant. But I'm a-goin' to make one afore I die. You see," he added, lowering his voice a little, "I want to leave something to Mehitable's children; mine'll have enough."
               "I've heard of sinners that calculated on repentin' before they died," said the squire, thoughtfully. "But somehow they didn't seem to get at it. Shouldn't wonder, now, if it was about the same thing with makin' wills. Mebbe the old man calculated on makin' one, but Death was too quick for him."
               Here a man in a gray overcoat, who had been hanging over the counter on the opposite side, surreptitiously possessing himself of raisins from a box that stood temptingly near, sauntered up and flung himself upon the wooden settee by the side of "the major."
               "Talkin' about old Mr. Armstrong's will?" he asked. "It seems to be the general 'pinion that he didn't leave none, don't it?"
               "Hain't been any found," said the squire, sententiously.
               He of the overcoat leaned forward, and rested his elbows upon his knees.
               "Don't believe but what there is one—or was one, nevertheless and notwithstandin'," said he. "'Tain't no ways likely that Mr. Armstrong left all that 'are property without givin' no hints about where he wanted it to go to."
               "He wanted it to go to his two boys, of course," said the squire, buttoning up his coat. "And they'll have it: so what's the use o' speculatin' about it, Tom Bradshaw? 'Tain't any of our consarns."
               "Hold on a minute, squire," was the cool reply. "Don't go to puttin' on airs. I've got a word to say on this p'int. Where did the old man get his money, now? Have you any idee?"
               "Worked for it, I s'pose," said the squire. "He was a right down good sort of a man, Mr. Armstrong was,—not stuck up a bit. He's told me many a time how he used to drive team when he was a boy, and how rich he felt when he airned his first silver quarter."
               "He got his money," said Mr. Tom Bradshaw, slowly, measuring off his words with a tap of his forefinger,—"he—got—his—money—from— that—last—wife—o'—his'n. D'ye see the p'int now?"
               "You don't say so!" exclaimed the major.
               "Well, what if he did?" rejoined the squire. "No, I don't see the p'int. It don't alter the case a mite, not as I can see."
               "Why, Clyde was the last woman's child," Mr. Bradshaw went on, excitedly. "And if the property came through her, Kenneth hain't no right to it, don't you see? I kind o' mistrust there's been mischief a-brewin' somewhere."
               "So do I," said the major. "You see, squire, I never sot much store by the Armstrongs, anyhow. They're a queer set. It stands to reason when folks spend money after their style that 'twa'n't got by no hard labor. Easy come, easy go. Why, I've known o' the old man's givin' more for one single root to put in that 'are glass play-house o' theirn, than it takes to keep my folks in groceries the year round!" And here the speaker spat energetically, but with a discontented air.
               "But did that make you any poorer, neighbor?" asked the squire. "It didn't hurt me any."
               "Look a-here, squire," said Mr. Bradshaw, bringing his hand down heavily upon his companion's knee. "You jest look a-here. I believe there's lots o' deviltry goin' on in this 'ere world, and that there's a snug little nest-egg right here in Altona."
               "Hain't the least doubt o' that," retorted the squire. "Never had. Folks born and bred in Altona ain't no better'n other folks."
               "But look a-here, squire; you won't let me tell you. I want to jest state the case. Things ain't done in this 'ere world without a reason, squire; not without a reason."
               "Things shouldn't be said without a reason, neither, Bradshaw. Come, let's go home. I guess my grist is ground by this time."
               "I don't calculate to say nothing without a reason. Now, squire, hold on just a minute. I've been told by them that know, that all the while the old man was sick he wouldn't let Clyde come near him, but he was in a perfect panic to have t'other one come home. The day't he died, he was struck with death in the forenoon, but he was bound he wouldn't give up the ship till he'd seen Kenneth. And he didn't. He jest lived right along till he come; and then they was closeted for more'n two hours."
               "I'm glad the boy got there," said the squire, softly.
               "But I hain't got through," continued Mr. Bradshaw. "You keep a-interruptin' me. Now, look a-here! I don't want to make nor meddle. But jest as true as you're alive, the breath wa'n't hardly out o' his father's body before Kenneth was down-stairs, a-meddlin' with the big safe and rummagin' round among the papers—before they'd laid the old man out, or he'd told Clyde, or anything. That's a fact, squire. You needn't look so—so—incredoolous. I——"
               "You—what? How do you know this?"
               "I—I—was told by them that knows."
               "Well, then, I guess we'll quit and go home. Tom Bradshaw, do you jest keep that mouth o' yourn shet. That's the best piece o' advice 't I can give ye." And the squire strode off.
               This conversation took place while I was choosing my alpaca and matching twist and sewing-silk. Probably, as I was a near neighbor of the Armstrongs, and was known to be a friend also, my presence would have checked the speakers had they been aware of it. But I was muffled in cloak and hood and stood directly behind them. They did not recognize me. Taking up my bundle, I started for home.
               I was not surprised at the revival of the gossip with which Altona had so refreshed herself five years previously. A man's death sets all tongues wagging, and it is always easy to cast stones at the dead lion. In this case there were peculiarities that gave some ground for gossip. The floating rumors with regard to Clyde's mother, the strange woman who was buried in Greenwood, and whose picture I knew, though they did not, was stowed away in the closet in the garret; the isolated life led by Mr. Armstrong and Clyde; the fact that they went nowhere, and that hardly one of their old friends had visited them in their seclusion; their free expenditure of money, which to the old farmers about them, accustomed only to steady labor and scanty gains, seemed almost fabulous, and to their hard-working wives even criminal,—all these gave scandal a foothold upon which to totter if it could not stand. The truth was that Mr. Armstrong and his sons did not live luxuriously. They were no Sybarites. Crumpled rose-leaves did not disturb their repose. But Altona was determined to see in simple affluence immense revenues; in culture, taste, and refinement, unheard-of luxury; in a free and generous style of living, wonderful prodigality. And what she was determined to see, as is usually the case, she saw.
               Yet Mr. Armstrong's utterly blameless life had, after awhile, disarmed criticism, and silenced gossip; or, if it spoke, it was in whispers only. Now that he was dead, I was not surprised that his affairs should be discussed and re-discussed, and that some of the old stories should be re-told. This was no more than was to be expected. But when Mr. Tom Bradshaw spoke of Kenneth's visit to the safe, I was startled. How did he know of it? I remembered that I had heard Dennis in the dining-room that night; but I was sure he had not seen Kenneth. And if he had seen him, good, faithful fellow that he was, what motive could he have had for pouring the story into Tom Bradshaw's ears? The idea was preposterous.
               This Tom Bradshaw had at one time been in Mr. Armstrong's employ, and had been summarily discharged; why, I knew not.
               Pondering all these things in my head, I went home, got my supper, and sat down to my evening work. About eight o'clock Patsy came in.
               "Miss Rossiter," she said, after she had toasted her feet for awhile, "I wish I knew what those boys was a-going to do."
               "Do?" I repeated. "What do you mean? What should they do?"
               "About going or staying, I mean. 'Tain't no ways likely that those two young fellers are going to go right along living here, now't their father's gone."
               
               Patsy was right. Yet this thought had not occurred to me before. My work dropped upon my lap, while I was trying to peer into the future and to see how it would look unbrightened by the young lives whose freshness and fullness had added so much to mine. Whatever might have been the motives that had induced Mr. Armstrong to bury himself in Altona, it was hardly probable that they would be equally binding upon his sons.
               "Kenneth's been to college," continued Patsy, "and has just begun studying medicine. He can't go on with his studies here; and my opinion is that they'll just sell out and go back to New York again."
               "Have they said anything about their plans?"
               "Not a word. But I wish they would. You see," she went on, drawing her chair nearer to mine, "I've got a chance to sell that little place o' mine, down at the corners, at a fair price; but I don't know what to do, because my plans depend on theirn. It's kind o' running down, the place is; and it costs me considerable every year to keep it in repair. If I'm a-going to stay here and keep house for these boys, I'd better sell right out and be done with it. If I ain't a-going to, I shall want the house to live in myself. And that's just how 'tis, Miss Rossiter."
               Patsy had turned her face away as she spoke, but I saw her stealthily wipe away a tear with the corner of her apron.
               "Why do you not ask Kenneth what he intends to do?" I asked.
               "Oh, I hate to! Besides, Miss Rossiter, if I should undertake to talk to them boys about leaving on 'em, and their father just gone and all, I should break right down and make a fool of myself, I know I should,—just as I am this very minute!" And the tears flowed unrestrainedly now.
               I said a consoling word or two,—words intended for my own benefit quite as much as for hers. But, in truth, there was not much to be said. I felt very sure that "her boys," as she loved to call them, would soon pass out of her life, as out of mine.
               "I didn't know how much I lotted on 'em," she said, at last, wiping her eyes and trying to steady her voice, "until I begun to think about their going away. Clyde he's a piece of fire and tow—blazes up one minute and out the next. You never know just where to find him. There ain't no long spells o' mild, settled weather with him,—spells when it don't neither rain nor shine. It's either a thunder-burst or clear sunshine. He's awful onreasonable sometimes, too. But then when he is sweet he's clear honey, and you forget he's ever been sour. You can't lay up anything against him, somehow. He's like some children,—there's something wonderfully taking even in his naughty ways."
               "Yes," I answered, "he is very unreasonable sometimes; but I fancy he is never 'naughty' to you. He thinks Patsy is about right."
               "Dear me!" she said, laughing, "he'll get just as mad as fire all at nothing, and it's just as likely to be at me as at anybody; or at Kenneth, even. But it don't last long: that's one comfort. And Kenneth knows how to get along with him; that's another."
               
               "It is fortunate that the two are so unlike," I replied. "If Kenneth had as little self-control as Clyde, one house could not hold them."
               "Kenneth? He's strong and firm as a rock, and tender as a woman. But it's time I was to home and abed. Miss Rossiter, s'pose you try to find out what's going to be done? If there's going to be any changes, I ought to know it."
               Strong and firm, yet tender as a woman. I thought of Patsy's words after she had gone, and I sat alone by my fireside. I thought, also, of the night when I had seen that strength broken down, that firmness a failure. I thought of his deathly pallor as he placed that mysterious paper in the safe and turned the key upon it.
               Reticent, too, and cool; for even in that moment of weakness no word that he could have wished unsaid had escaped him. He would never betray his secrets, if he had any, unawares.
               Scarcely a day passed during which I did not see my young neighbors, and on the morrow I had an opportunity to fulfill my promise to Patsy.
               "Will Clyde go with you when you return to New York, Kenneth?" I asked.
               He started.
               "Clyde? No. I am not going back to New York, aunty."
               "What? Not to finish your medical studies, Kenneth? You can do but little with them here."
               "I shall not attempt to go on with them," he answered, while the young face changed, and a shadow of pain swept over it. "I've given up all idea of making myself immortal, just at present, Miss Rossiter."
               "But your father had great hopes of you, Kenneth; and I always fancied that ambition was one of your easily-besetting sins. You don't mean that you have abandoned the idea of becoming a physician?"
               "Entirely," he answered. "I shall 'throw physic to the dogs' henceforth, and devote my energies to agriculture. Clyde's conservatory will keep him busy; and as for me——"
               "As for you, you will die of inanition. Kenneth, I doubt if you are coming to a wise conclusion. Clyde may be contented here, for he has become accustomed to the life. But for you, so differently trained and educated, to think of becoming a fixture among these hills,—the idea is simply absurd!"
               "I do not propose becoming a fixture, aunty,—nor an idler. I shall find work enough ready to my hand."
               "But, the world is so large, and Altona is so small! I thought you were going abroad as soon as you had obtained your degree?"
               He did not answer for a moment, but sat gazing from the window upon the far blue hills that shut us in on every side. I knew that in that instant all the treasures of the Old World—its art, its architecture, its storied castles, its historic battle-fields, its skies all written over with memories, its mountains, its monuments, its graves—passed before him in one vast panorama.
               Then he turned to me with a faint smile.
               
               "That was one of my dreams," he said. "But it is all over now. Father's death has changed everything. Clyde and I will stay here in Altona. Do you want to get rid of us?"
               "Get rid of you? Ah, Kenneth! But you will feel differently by-and-by. The grass grows green upon all graves after awhile. Your hearts are very sore now, and life has indeed changed its face. Yet Time, the healer, will surely do his work, and then——"
               "Ah, it is not that! it is not that!" he cried. "God help me,—but it is not that! Miss Rossiter, my lot in life is fixed: it lies right here in Altona."
               I knew then that this was renunciation,—the voluntary surrender of all a young man's ambitions and hopes, his dreams of being and doing, at the call of some real or fancied duty. Some exaggerated idea of loyalty to his father's memory, some caprice of conscience, some whim of reason or of judgment, I thought it, even while I honored the young man none the less.
               But I speedily set Patsy's heart at rest; and the little brown house was sold.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               THAT winter passed very quietly. The most noticeable feature of the life at Greyholt had been Mr. Armstrong's extreme devotion to Clyde. They had been the most inseparable of companions,—indeed, the father had seemed utterly swallowed up in the son, and to have merged his existence in his. Perhaps there was no real reason for supposing that he loved one son better than the other. But his love for Kenneth was so different in its character and its manifestations from that which he bore Clyde, that one could hardly compare the two emotions. He gloried in his elder son, was proud of him, trusted him. But he cherished the younger as the very apple of his eye.
               Now Kenneth's devotion to his brother became equally noticeable. He seemed to have stepped at once into his father's place. Quietly, unobtrusively, he filled Clyde's life from out his own fullness. To leave no void, no emptiness there, to crowd his days with pleasant doings, to fill his brain with happy thoughts, seemed to be the end and aim of his existence. Nothing daunted him, nothing repelled him. Clyde's freaks of temper, his occasional wayward-nesses, his self-will, that would at times override all obstacles and overrule all laws, his passionate impulses, his unreasonable caprices,—all these seemed only to fill Kenneth with a tenderer, a more long-enduring patience.
               
               "Talk about being patient as a woman!" said Patsy, one day. "Patient as Kenneth Armstrong, I say. That's the way it ought to read."
               But it must be confessed that Patsy had also been right when she said that Clyde's faults were more engaging than other people's virtues. He had been charmed in his cradle, I think; and love flowed out to him as from its own excess. There was an indescribable fascination about him, that won all hearts.
               The two young men had but little intercourse with the village people. It was not that they "felt above them," or studiously held themselves aloof. It was simply the working of a natural law. Like affiliates with like. Either one of the brothers would have shone like some "bright particular star" in a circle to which he was adapted and whose habits of thought and feeling were in accordance with his own. But they were not at home with the Altonians. At the merry-makings, the social gatherings to which they were occasionally invited, they were apt to be shy, silent, and constrained. The somewhat rough and noisy jollity abashed them, while it jarred upon some fine chord of their natures that was not in harmony with their surroundings. Of course this does not apply to all Altona. There were some souls in that little country town who were the peers of any in the land,—who were in earnest sympathy with all that was finest, truest, and purest.
               So their evenings were spent chiefly at home in their own cozy library, save when, upon clear, moonlit nights, they were tempted out for a rapid drive over the sparkling snow, or down to the creek, where the glare ice waited for the music of the skater's steel. If, sometimes, I grew tired of listening to the ticking of my clock, or of thinking my own thoughts, and throwing a shawl about me, ran over the way to see what my neighbors were about, I knew just the picture that would greet my eyes as I stepped upon the piazza and glanced in at the low window. I knew that the small, inlaid centre-table with the curiously carved legs would be drawn into the middle of the room, in front of the open fireplace, where a bright wood fire would be leaping and sparkling. Upon one side of it I should see the lamplight falling upon Kenneth's dark-brown hair, tossed carelessly back from a low, broad forehead, kindling his cool, gray eyes into subtle fire, and lending his cheek a warmer glow; on the other, Clyde's curls of reddish gold would be catching a deeper tint from the glowing flames, and his large, black eyes would be flashing with merriment, or earnest with thought. The table between them would be loaded with books, magazines, reviews, and newspapers. They would be reading together; or, with books dropped upon their knees, they would have floated off upon some sparkling tide of talk. Or the red and white chessmen would be waging mimic war, and kings and queens, knights and bishops, would be trembling in dire dismay. And I knew that as my step crossed the threshold the books would be thrown down, or the chessmen be made to beat an ignominious retreat, and two young voices that I had learned to love would vie with each other in welcoming me. Then, mayhap, Patsy would come in with a basket of rosy-cheeked apples, or a dish of hickory-nuts; and sometimes, though very rarely, she would join the little circle. She expected to reign undisputed queen in her own realm, but she was shy of intruding upon the domains of others.
               Several times during that winter I had occasion to know that the excitement about the will, and the curiosity awakened by the circumstances attending Mr. Armstrong's last hours, had not entirely subsided. Strange questions were asked of Patsy; and many a time Dennis came back from the village with his head filled with vague, idle rumors,—rumors that I was fain to believe he helped rather than hindered, partly out of an Irishman's love of mischief, and partly out of an honest contempt for scandal-mongers. More than once I heard of Kenneth's visit to the safe; and it was even intimated that selfish motives were at the bottom of his devotion to Clyde. Had not the property belonged to Mr. Armstrong's last wife?
               The brothers knew nothing of all this. It usually happens that those most nearly concerned are the last to hear an injurious report, a scandalous story, or a rumor of doubtful import.
               And why had the father been buried in Altona? There was a costly vault in Greenwood, where two women who had loved him awaited his coming. Why, then, did they wait vainly, while his dust mingled with our yellow sands, and our pines cast their long shadows over his grave?
               These questions, also, were often asked. It was not enough to say that such had been his wish. Why had he wished it? Why had he not chosen to sleep among his kindred? None of his kith or kin were buried in Altona. There were many in Greenwood.
               I watched Kenneth closely that winter. He was a curious study to me. Since that one conversation, during the course of which he had said to me, "It is not that; God help me, but it is not that!" he had never alluded to the matter. Whatever the burden might be that had fallen upon his young shoulders,—or that he had voluntarily lifted to them,—he bore it silently, uncomplainingly. He had changed. He seemed suddenly to have sprung out of youth into mature manhood. The vague unrest, the eager longing of the spring had settled into something akin to the fullness, the rich repose of summer. Was he happy? I doubted it sometimes, when I saw the far-away look in his eyes, or caught a gleam like the bursting forth of smouldering flame. But he was cheerful: he was at rest. As Patsy had said, he was firm as a rock; and having once chosen his lot,—or accepted it,—he had no regrets, no misgivings.
               And so the quiet months passed on, until it was June.
               June in Altona! If you have never been among our mountains, you can have but a slight idea of the meaning of these three words. It was as if the yearly miracle was but just completed, and the earth had sprung, new-born, from the hand of its Creator. Such a wealth of green lay everywhere, from the dark hue of the pines, on through all the gradations of color, to the tender, delicate tinting of the young hemlock-shoots. The maples were in full leaf, the birches were tipped with airy tracery, the pendent boughs of the elm-trees drooped, heavy with their trailing wreaths of verdure, the cedars gave out their resinous perfume, the oaks wore their emerald crowns, as if rejoicing in the sunlight. In the meadows, the young grass was soft and tender as a baby's cheek. On the hillsides and on all the uplands the grain was springing fresh and green. The wild roses were in bloom; blue violets smiled from every shady nook; scarlet honeysuckles, purple columbines, golden eardrops, and a thousand other flowers, made the woods beautiful with their presence. And over all hung the vast sapphire sky, where only a few light, fleecy clouds lay tranquilly against the blue.
               All this young, tender beauty is very evanescent, and soon gives place to the deeper tints, the more gorgeous coloring of midsummer; but while it lasts, it is incomparable for delicacy and sweetness.
               And one morning in June it was when Clyde came in with his arms full of azalea-branches, laden with the exquisite pink flowers that are so heavy with perfume. Flinging down his fragrant burden upon a table that it nearly covered, he looked about him with surprise, not unmingled with dismay.
               "Oh, oh, oh!" he ejaculated, at last. "Aunty, what are you turning Cozytoft upside down for? at this time of year, too? I thought spring house-cleaning was over long ago."
               Curtains were down, one carpet, at least, was up, and Cozytoft was in a great state of confusion. I waited to drive in the tack that was to re-fasten the said carpet in one corner at least, before I looked up from my knees and answered him.
               "Strange things have come to pass since I saw you on the night before last, at sundown, Master Clyde,—very strange things. You don't get the news up on the hill; and if you won't come to Cozytoft after it, why, you don't get it, that's all."
               "But I have come after it," he said, throwing himself upon the floor, and holding the carpet in place for me as I nailed it down. "I have come after it News? Tell me what it is, like a good aunty," he added, coaxingly.
               "You'll run right off to tell Kenneth," I answered, "and then I shall have to put my carpet down alone. No; I think I'll keep my secret for the present."
               "A secret? Worse and worse! or rather, better and better!" he cried. "What is it, Miss Rossiter?" I was "aunty" or "Miss Rossiter," just as it happened. "I'll stay and help you put down the carpet, and put up the curtains, and make myself useful generally. Kenneth may find out the secret the best way he can. What is it, aunty?"
               "There is to be a boarder at Cozytoft," I answered,—"a city boarder. Think of that, sir! And I am to have a little handmaiden to help about the housework. Isn't that a choice bit of news?"
               "I shouldn't think it was," he replied, dubiously. "A boarder—at Cozytoft! I don't like it, aunty. It will not do at all."
               "Why not?" I asked. "I think it will do nicely. I shall have pleasant company, and——"
               "Who is it?" he cried, interrupting me. "You don't say who it is! Some stately divine, with gold-headed cane and spectacles, who will overpower you with his theologies; some pale, long-haired student, with a trunk full of philosophy; or some strong-minded woman, with short, frowzy hair and an ill-fitting dress. I give you joy, Miss Rossiter!"
               "Thank you," I said; "I would get up and drop you a courtesy if I were not so busy. Guess again, Mr. Clyde Armstrong. You are not right yet."
               "Some young Nimrod, then," he continued, "who will come up here to shoot robins and tame pigeons, and then, when his vacation is over, go home and boast of his hunting exploits; or some newly-fledged disciple of Izaak Walton, who doesn't know a trout from a pickerel. Say I am right, aunty: it will do me proud to make the young gentleman's acquaintance."
               I laughed. "You are saucy, sir; and now I will not tell you at all. You must wait and see."
               Clyde grumbled and scolded like a spoiled child. What did I want with boarders, anyway? Just to keep my friends away from Cozytoft, he supposed. And a very effectual plan it was likely to prove. When all that theology and philosophy and strong-mindedness, to say nothing of Nimrod and the angler, had taken possession of the place, there would be but little room for its old frequenters. For his part, he proposed to bid me farewell when he left the house that morning, and never to cross the threshold again until the autumn winds, blowing straight from the north, had swept the intruders away, as leaves before the blast.
               "Take care, Clyde," I said; "if you get your fingers under this hammer, I won't answer for the consequences."
               "Much you will care about it!" he answered, tossing back the auburn locks that fell over his eyes as he tugged away at the carpet. "Much you will care! You have been hammering on my heart-strings ever since I came in here this morning. It's too bad, aunty! I would not have believed it of you,—and all for the sake of a dozen strangers!"
               "Are you doing a sum in arithmetical progression?" I asked, laughing. "You started me with one boarder, then you had five, and now you have got up to a dozen. I shall have to build an addition to Cozytoft, at this rate."
               "You'd better keep a hotel and be done with it," he said. "I'll give you a sign: my great eagle's nest swinging from a liberty-pole. Nimrod would like that."
               "On the contrary, I fear it would frighten him. Give me a humming-bird's nest, and I will hang it in a corner of the piazza, suspended by a silken thread. You are very absurd, Clyde."
               He strode off in a pet, or something more. But in ten minutes he was back again, as I knew he would be.
               "Miss Rossiter," he said, putting his head in at the window, "perhaps you do not know that azalea-blossoms fade very quickly if they are not picked from the boughs and placed in water?"
               "Yes, I know it," I answered; "and those beauties are drooping already. But what am I to do? I must bring order out of this chaos before I can stop to arrange them. I suppose I might put them in a tub of water, just as they are?"
               "Oh, no! that won't answer," he cried, leaping in at the window. "Don't you know? These woody branches won't absorb any water. The flowers must be picked off; and it will take some time."
               "Now you see what a convenience it would be if my boarders were here," I said. "Nimrod ought to be a lover of nature, and I am sure he would love June pinks. But of course I can't ask you to arrange them."
               "Why not, I should like to know? Nimrod should not touch these flowers if——Bring me the big punch-bowl, aunty, that did not come over in the Mayflower, and some cord and a pair of scissors."
               I brought them, and then began to plait my freshly-ironed curtains. By the time they were plaited, the bowl was overflowing with its wealth of beauty and perfume. Clyde brought in the step-ladder, and helped put up the curtains. Then we cleared away the refuse stems and leaves, arranged the furniture, and placed the punch-bowl on the centre-table.
               "There should be some flowers on the mantel," said Clyde, taking a deliberate survey of the cool, fresh, shaded room. "That is all it needs, with some trailing vines for the bracket in the corner."
               Away he dashed, and presently returned with graceful, drooping fuchsias, a handful of roses, from creamiest white to deepest crimson, and long sprays of the delicate mountain-fringe. While he was arranging them, I went off to the kitchen.
               Pretty soon I looked up, to see him standing in the door.
               "What now, aunty?"
               "Oh, there is sponge-cake to make," I answered. "My 'boarders' will have ravenous appetites, I expect."
               "Which you will attempt to satisfy with sponge-cake. Wise woman! I should have supposed roast beef the better thing. But where is your 'neat-handed Phillis'? Why doesn't she do this?"
               "Baking sponge-cake is one of the fine arts, Mr. Armstrong. She can do some things well, but this is not one of her accomplishments. Besides, she has gone a-strawberrying, and cannot conveniently do two things at once."
               For two minutes he was silent, watching the platter of snowy foam as I heaped it higher and higher.
               "Who is coming, aunty?" he said, presently, leaning with both arms upon the table. "What's the use of all this mystery?"
               "There is no mystery at all," I answered. "I should have told you all about it at first, if you had not flown off on such a tangent that I could not reach you."
               "Tell me now, then,—if it isn't Nimrod. I don't care to hear about him."
               I laughed. "It is not Nimrod. It is—Miss Elsie Meredith."
               "Who is she?"
               "She is—Elsie Meredith—niece and ward of Dr. Howard Bellinger, of New York."
               "But what brings her up here?"
               
               "Oh, Dr. Bellinger is an old friend of mine: he was born in that white farm-house where the Gilmores live now, and he has drawn me to school on his sled many a time. Elsie wanted to spend the summer in the country,—pure, unadulterated country,—so he said; and her uncle very naturally thought of Altona as the fitting place. Quite as naturally, too, he wanted me to make a home for her."
               "Did you ever see her?"
               "Once only,—five or six years since. She was a pretty child then. Where is Kenneth to-day?"
               "He has gone over to Highborough,—to the bank, and will not be back till to-morrow night. Heigh-ho! This Miss Meredith is better than Nimrod; but I am sorry she is coming. Aunty, will it be necessary for me to put on a dress-coat and lavender gloves whenever I call at Cozytoft? I want to do the correct thing."
               "Do just as you please, sir. Dress-coat or linen blouse, lavender gloves or no gloves at all: it is all one. Do you think the coming of this girl is going to overturn all my household arrangements?"
               "Aunty, your cake is burning, unless my nose deceives me. When is she coming?"
               "To-morrow."
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               TO tell the truth, I had myself some of Clyde's misgivings with regard to the new boarder. I had lived alone so long that I had learned to regard Margaret Rossiter as excellent company. I quarreled with her occasionally, it is true, and often took her severely to task for some doing or not-doing. But on the whole we got on very peaceably together, and I was a little sorry to have our relations disturbed. This girl—this Elsie Meredith—who was coming, might make herself agreeable, or very disagreeable: it was just an experiment.
               But we do not live "unto ourselves;" and, at all events, I had done right in consenting to make a home for the motherless ward of my old friend. So the next morning I gave a few last adorning touches to the pretty chamber I had already prepared for her, straightened the ruffled pillows upon the little white-draped bed, looped back the muslin curtains in fresher and more graceful folds, placed a basket of purple pansies upon the toilet-table, and then went downstairs, and seated myself, with a quiet heart, to await her coming.
               The stage was due about noon. It was now half-past ten, and I took up my work-basket, thinking there was abundant time to hem a certain strip of ruffling before my guest should arrive. But before I had taken a dozen stitches, the sound of tramping hoofs drew my eyes down past the clump of maples, to the bend in the road just opposite the dam.
               Tramp—tramp,—nearer and nearer. A spirited bay horse, which looked strangely familiar, swept round the turn, carrying a lady, in a dark-blue riding-habit. I had time but for a single glance, when she turned, waved her hand lightly to some person or persons behind her, touched her horse with the whip, and he shot forward, like an arrow from a bow.
               Very few ladies rode in Altona; and we all thought ourselves at liberty to stare at any long-robed figure on horseback. So I stepped to the door to gratify my curiosity. Just as I did so, the lady drew upon the reins, and wheeled her gay charger into my yard. At the same instant two other riders came in sight. Was the foremost one—surely it was—my old friend Dr. Bellinger? and the other was Kenneth Armstrong.
               So this was Elsie Meredith. I went forward to greet her. As she saw me, she threw her reins upon the horse's neck, gathered up her flowing robes with one hand, and placing the other upon the pommel of the saddle, sprang lightly to the ground.
               Was this the "pretty child" I had seen a few years before?—this beautiful and graceful woman who, even in that first glance, dazzled my eyes with her unwonted loveliness? I had scarcely had time to speak to her, when the gentlemen dismounted.
               "My old friend Margaret!" exclaimed Dr. Bellinger as he ungloved; "or must it be 'Miss Rossiter,' in consideration of the years that have passed since you and I 'went gipsying, a long time ago'?"
               "It shall be 'Margaret,' or 'Miss Rossiter,' just as it pleases you," I replied, as I gave him my hand. "We have helped each other into mischief and out of it too many times to stand upon ceremony now, Dr. Bellinger."
               "And this is Elsie," he said, turning to his niece, who still stood with her hand upon the horn of the saddle. "This is Elsie."
               A most simple introduction; but his voice and manner said more plainly than words could have done that there was but one Elsie in all the world for him. I did not wonder. After a word or two with my beautiful guest, I turned to Kenneth, who stood leaning against his horse, hat in hand, watching us in a sort of happy silence.
               "And where do you come from, Kenneth?" I asked; "or rather, how do you happen to be of this party? I thought you went to Highborough yesterday."
               Dr. Bellinger laughed. "Things don't happen in this world, Margaret. They are ordered. But I beg your pardon, Mr. Armstrong. Tell your own story."
               "Not out here in the sun," I said. "If there is a story to tell, we will hear it in-doors."
               But as I spoke I looked in dire dismay at the horses. Cozytoft did not furnish the amplest accommodations for "man and beast." Kenneth perceived my dilemma.
               "Dennis!" he called, as he caught sight of a figure behind the hedge on the other side of the road. "Dennis!"
               Dennis appeared, touching his hat as soon as he caught a glimpse of his young master.
               
               "Welcome home, yer honor," he said. "Yer honor's welcome home."
               "Thank you, Dennis. All well, I hope?" Then there was a whispered word or two, and, to my infinite relief, the horses disappeared. We went into the house.
               "Now for the story, Kenneth."
               "Which is not a story," he answered.
               But he explained the "happening" by saying that Miss Meredith and himself were old acquaintances, and that, very unexpectedly, they had recognized each other at the breakfast-table that morning. It seemed that Dr. Bellinger had wished Elsie to have a better view of the wild, picturesque mountain scenery than she could have on the Bloomfield route, and had accordingly gone up on the other side, stopping at Highborough.
               "In my day, you know," said the doctor, "a stage ran regularly between Highborough and Altona. But your new railroads have disarranged things generally, and I could not get a carriage for love or money. Elsie is a famous horsewoman, however, and Mr. Armstrong proposed that we should ride over. So here we are, full an hour earlier than you expected us."
               "What a string of commonplaces!" exclaimed Miss Meredith, laughing, as she untied her hat and smoothed down the golden tresses that had been disarranged by her long ride. "I thought you were about to draw upon your vivid imagination, and give us a tale of romance and adventure."
               "Certainly, Dr. Bellinger, we had a right to expect pect as much, after your allusion to special orderings," I said. "But where are your trunks?"
               "On the way," she answered: "they will be here presently; and the driver will take back the horses. But if you will show me where I am to live this summer, I will try to make myself tolerably presentable without waiting for them."
               "To live!" exclaimed the doctor. "You are to have all out-of-doors for a dwelling place. 'No pent-up Utica' this summer, Miss Meredith. Remember that, if you please."
               She went off, laughing lightly, with her blue robes trailing after her, and her wavy hair, half escaping from its net, catching a new gleam from the sunshine as she went up the stairs.
               As I followed, I turned to look at Kenneth, intending to ask him to stay to dinner.
               Dinner!
               There was something in his face that startled me. I cannot tell you what it was, even if I try. It was as if some dormant power of his nature had suddenly wakened into life and vigor; as if a flame that had long been checked, smothered, held back by opposing elements, had at last burst the barriers and sprung forth a glad, rejoicing thing. And with it all there was a certain quiet content that I had not seen since his father died.
               He was not looking at Elsie. On the contrary, his steadfast gaze had gone out through the low window, with its clustering vines, past village and forest, field and meadow, to the far horizon closing down upon the mountain-peaks. He had not exchanged a dozen words with her since they had been in my house; yet, by some subtle, inward consciousness, rather than by any effort of reason, I felt that Kenneth Armstrong loved this new guest of mine. Was that what had brought her here?
               I followed her up-stairs in a sort of maze, and then led the way to her chamber.
               "Ah, this is charming!" she said, glancing with pleased eyes about the pleasant room; "so fresh and cool and sweet! I foresee that I shall be very happy here, Miss Rossiter."
               "I hope you will be," I answered, turning one of the blinds, that the perfumed breath of the clover-field might find freer entrance. "I have lived here by myself for many years, and know but little of the ways or the wants of young ladies, Miss Meredith; nevertheless, I think I can make you content and happy up here among the mountains."
               There was a light step behind me, and in a moment a pair of soft white arms—for she had laid off her riding-habit—were about my neck.
               "Call me Elsie," she said. "You are Uncle Howard's dear old friend, and I cannot be 'Miss Meredith' to you: it is too formal. Call me Elsie, and I shall feel more at home with you."
               "'Elsie,' then," I replied, returning her caress, and wondering as I did so at the exquisite purity of her complexion, at the dazzling whiteness of her neck and arms, at the wealth of golden hair, that, loosened from its confinement, fell almost to her knees, enveloping her as in a luminous cloud, at her soft eyes of clearest, darkest blue, at her ripe red lips, and her young cheek's changeful glow. I gazed at all this loveliness, as a woman of forty might be supposed to gaze at it,—with a little sigh of regret for her own lost youth, with a little tender envy of the beauty that was so patent, yet so unconscious, and that needed no painstaking, no thought, to make it irresistible. I wondered if this young girl knew how fair she was, and if her soul was as beautiful as the dwelling it inhabited.
               Yet I hardly doubted this. Some beauty impresses you as being an emanation from the soul itself; and hers was of this sort. You felt, after all, that it was not the pure, calm forehead, not the softly-tinted cheek, the starry eyes, nor the flowing tresses, that made her so fair. It was something that lay behind all these. The true soul of her beauty would look out of those wondrous eyes, and smile from those tender lips, even when Elsie Meredith should be an old, old woman, wrinkled and gray.
               She stepped to the window. Greyholt, embowered in trees, lay just opposite, and in full view. From the rooms below, we could only catch a glimpse of the piazza.
               "Is that Mr. Armstrong's place?" she asked; and I fancied that the color on her cheek deepened a little, just a shade, as she spoke.
               "Yes, that is Greyholt," I answered. "Do you know the family well?"
               "Oh, no; I do not know the family at all," she said. "I knew Mr. Kenneth Armstrong after a fashion; that is, as we know people whom we meet in society,—a sort of surface acquaintance. I did not even know that he lived in Altona until we met at Highborough this morning."
               So that was the end of my incipient romance, as far as she was concerned. She had not come up here lured by the remembered music of a lover's voice or by the magic of his smile. On the whole, I was glad of it. Old maids are "particular," you know; and perhaps I should have liked my young guest the less if I had been forced to think that she had come to the mountains in pursuit of an unacknowledged lover,—even one as worthy of a maiden's love as Kenneth Armstrong.
               Dr. Bellinger returned to New York after a few days, during which he gave himself wholly up to the delight of living over again the old boyish days when Altona had been all the world to him. Father and mother were gone, it is true, brothers and sisters were scattered or dead, and the farm had passed into other hands. None of his kindred remained to welcome him. But the wild wood-paths were still the same; the trout-stream brawled and sparkled just as it had done when, a barefoot boy, he had followed its windings all day long; the school-house looked so strangely familiar that he listened involuntarily for the shout and halloo of boisterous urchins, who had been wrestling with the world for many a year; the blue, overarching sky was just as peaceful and serene, the mountains were as royally magnificent, as when his young heart first thrilled before their solemn grandeur. The thrush and the veery sang as sweetly, the humming-birds darted as blithely from flower to flower, the timid partridges lured him from their nests with tricks as quaint and as human as those their far-off ancestors had used for the same wise purpose; the very humble-bees droned away in the hot noons as drowsily and tunefully as in the days gone by.
               "And the strawberries are just as red and odorous, and the honey just as sweet," he had said, on the last evening of his stay, as he sat at my table and helped himself liberally to both. "Elsie, when our ship comes in, we will retire from business and make unto ourselves a paradise here in Altona."
               "Say rather, when there are no more sick people in the world," she had answered, laughing, "no more work to be done, and no more wretched, homesick souls for you to look after. We shall not have our paradise yet awhile, Uncle Howard."
               Until after he went, I saw comparatively little of Elsie, for he kept her with him all day long. No spot that had been trodden by his infant feet, but must be visited by hers also. Where he had wandered, she must wander; where he had rested, she must rest. And, last of all, they went to the graveyard on the hill, and cleared away the weeds and brambles from two half-forgotten graves.
               Neither did he forget the old villagers who had petted him when a boy, nor the farmers who had been friends of his father's, and whose hard yet kindly hands had borne him to his rest. Elsie must see and know them all; and before she had been a week in Altona she had a larger circle of acquaintance than Kenneth and Clyde had made in all the years of their living there.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VIII.
               THE days flew on silver wings,—for me, I mean. When I had thought, with a slight feeling of dread, of having my quiet broken in upon by the advent of Elsie Meredith, I had little dreamed what the influx of that fresh young life would be to me; for it was life in the truest sense. Elsie lived, from the lightest golden wave of her sunny hair to the gayly-slippered feet that peeped from beneath her morning robe.
               "I did not come here to be a trouble to you, dear Miss Rossiter," she said, one morning. "Do not make a 'boarder' of me, but let me take my place as a daughter of the house. May I?"
               And from that time, even as a daughter might have done, she had gone about the house, adding touches of beauty here and there, giving a new grace to this, a fresher charm to that, tending the flowers, training the vines, and brightening up the old place generally, until it seemed dearer and lovelier than ever. She had brought her books, her music, her work; and ere long there were traces of her presence everywhere,—a graceful disorder that, even to my eyes, was more charming than the prim neatness that had been almost inseparable from my way of living. She pervaded every room. Even the kitchen acknowledged her presence in lighter and more savory omelets, in translucent jellies, and in heaps of snowy foam piled high on tremulous waves of gold. She touched nothing that she did not beautify, if it was only a custard.
               In the long summer afternoons, when the house was still, and the soft, perfumed airs stole in through the open windows, we read and worked and talked together, almost as mother and daughter might have done. Sometimes, it is true, when the sweetness of this new relationship struck me with fresher force, a pang came with it, and, for a moment, I felt as one defrauded of his birthright. The instinct of motherhood was strong within me, as it is in many a woman who lives a lonely, isolated life; and I could but think how, had the lot appointed me been a different one, fair daughters of my own might now have clustered about me, renewing my youth in the beauty and freshness of their own.
               Kenneth dropped in occasionally, but less frequently, perhaps, than had been his habit heretofore. As for Clyde, he did not come at all. I had been busy at home, and had not exchanged one word with him since our conversation with regard to Miss Meredith on the day before her arrival. I knew that the old whim still held possession of him, but flattered myself that if he were let alone he would come to his senses after awhile.
               But one morning, when Elsie had been with me about three weeks, I was out in the yard tying up some carnations, whose heavy buds, swollen almost to bursting, drooped wearily to the ground. Pretty soon, without looking up from my work, I became aware that some one was stealing softly along behind the opposite hedge. Presently he came out, near where I was at work, in a position that was not visible from the front windows of Cozytoft. It was Clyde, as I had suspected.
               "Good-morning, Miss Rossiter."
               "Good-morning, sir."
               He leaped over the fence. "Aunty, aren't you going to shake hands with me?"
               "Yes, if you think you deserve it; not otherwise."
               He looked at me keenly, drawing his straw hat farther down over his eyes. But he did not extend his hand.
               "That is for you to decide," he said. "I've been dreadfully lonesome for three weeks, Miss Rossiter."
               "Have you? I'm glad of it."
               "For three weeks. Just think of it," he went on, not deigning to notice my interruption. "For three weeks I have been banished from Cozytoft, and now you refuse to shake hands with me!"
               "Have I refused?—and who banished you from Cozytoft, I should like to know?"
               "Why, you did. Aunty, how long is this state of things going to last? Because I am getting tired of it. If it is to continue, I think seriously of putting an end to myself."
               "Good!" I said. 'I honor your pluck and bravery. It is a truly noble thing to be able to shuffle off this mortal coil and not so much as groan over it. What mode of self-destruction do you chiefly affect,—pistols, drowning, or the hari-kari?"
               He turned on his heel and walked off. But by the time I had tied up one more carnation, he was back again.
               "Miss Rossiter, I am thinking of going away to spend the rest of the summer."
               Putting my arm within his, I led him off into the shadow of the shrubbery.
               "How long are you going to keep up this farce, Clyde? Be a good boy, now, and come and see us this evening."
               "Us!" he repeated. "What kind of a person is this Miss Meredith?—an ogress?"
               "You know as well as I do. Don't try to make me believe that you have not watched her going out and her coming in. You know the very shade of her hair and the color of her eyes, that are bluer than your English violets."
               He laughed. "You are a wonderful woman, aunty: omniscient, and omnipresent, and all that sort of thing. But I am afraid of her; that's the truth. I'm not much used to young ladies, you know; and I would rather face a regiment. I wish she was in Beloochistan!"
               "I can't stay here to bandy words with you any longer, Clyde," I said; "I must go in and order dinner. Will you come to see me to-night?"
               "Where will she be?"
               "In the moon, or making a visit to the planet Jupiter."
               "Then I'll come," he answered, gravely. And, leaping the fence again, he walked away.
               That afternoon Elsie came down-stairs with her broad-brimmed hat on, a large, thin book under her arm, and a small basket in her hand.
               "Whither awa'?" I asked.
               
               "To the woods, after ferns to press," she answered. "They are in full beauty now. And I think the orange-lilies must be out. I found any amount of buds the other day, but no flowers."
               Just before sunset I saw her coming slowly along the cross-lot path through the east meadow, laden with lilies herself, while Clyde Armstrong carried the book, and the basket overflowing with mosses and delicate, trailing vines. They were chatting like two old friends. Evidently Clyde's terror had been of short duration. He held the gate open for her to pass in, and then followed; a scarcely perceptible shade of embarrassment crossing his features as he caught a glimpse of me upon the piazza.
               "Ah, Miss Rossiter, I have played truant, I fear, and kept tea waiting!" cried Elsie, as she came up the steps and seated herself upon the upper one,—throwing off her hat and pushing back the damp, soft curls that clustered about her forehead. "But the woods were so beautiful to-day,—and see, I have found such treasures! Not frankincense and myrrh, but coral and amber and pearls and gold."
               Dr. Bellinger was at once a naturalist and a philanthropist. One could hardly tell which interested him most,—a rare fossil, a strange plant, a curious orchid, an odd mollusk, or a singular specimen of the genus homo. If the latter needed help, however, that settled the question, and the Doctor at once turned to the human subject. Elsie possessed the same tastes, either by inheritance or acquirement. Nature was to her a marvel and a mystery; and she revealed herself to her as to those only who approach her shrine in humblest love and reverence. Whatever Elsie sought she found, whether it was the shyest flower or the tiniest bird's-nest. All wild things seemed to love her. The bees droned on unmindful of her presence; the birds perked and plumed themselves and sang all the more sweetly when she was listening; bright-winged moths fluttered about her; the quaintest chrysalides dropped at her feet. The little brown tree-toad would hop upon her arm and sit there blinking quietly. Squirrels would deliberately cross her path, looking at her with fearless eyes. Perhaps it was because she was utterly fearless herself, meeting them with no fine-lady screams and tremors, but upon one broad plane of love and charity. Certain it is that even the creeping things that to most of us are objects of fear and repulsion, to her eyes were clothed with beauty as with a garment, and she shrank neither from their touch nor their presence.
               So when Elsie spoke to me of her treasures of coral and amber and pearls and gold, I knew there was no girlish exaggeration in the words. While woods waved and stars shone and waters sparkled, all out-of-doors would be to her an Eldorado.
               But how could I help looking at Clyde to see how he had endured an afternoon's ramble with this "ogress"? He caught my eye and smiled, shaking his head at me from behind Elsie's broad hat, which he had picked up and was garlanding with the small, evergreen wreaths of the partridge-vine.
               "We have had just the pleasantest walk, aunty," he said. "I never knew that the west woods were half so beautiful before."
               
               "That is well," I answered. "But come in and take your tea, both of you. You must be hungry after such a tramp; and Matty's biscuits are impatient to be eaten."
               Just then Kenneth came round the corner, and I called him.
               "Come, Kenneth, we are just going to tea. Won't you join us?"
               He came up the path with his sweet, rare smile,—Kenneth was grave rather than frolicsome,—taking off his hat and letting the wind blow his brown locks about.
               "Patsy gave me a cup of tea some time ago," he said. "But I am apt to find your invitations irresistible, aunty. You know that from sad experience."
               As we seated ourselves at the supper-table, Elsie looked from one to the other with an amused face.
               "How is it that you happen to have two such tall nephews, Miss Rossiter? I do not understand it."
               "Oh, it was 'ordered,' as your Uncle Howard would say. They were alone and I was alone: so we adopted each other."
               A world of merry badinage followed, Elsie protesting against this order of things as a bit of manifest injustice.
               "To think that you should be 'Miss Rossiter' to me, a member of your own household," she said, "and 'aunty' to these two stalwart youths! I enter a protest on the spot."
               "Miss Rossiter, how far is it from the Slough of Despond to the Hill Difficulty?" asked Clyde, slyly. "No, you need not look at me for an explanation, Kenneth. This is not a riddle to be read of all men."
               "Be it far or near," I answered, "the Hill dwindles to a molehill as one approaches it. What if Miss Meredith were to be adopted also?"
               Clyde looked at her with a comical air of anxiety and relief.
               "Miss Meredith, do you suppose you could utter the word 'aunty' in your own behalf?"
               "Not I," she answered, laughing; "I never follow suit. But how would 'Aunt Margaret' do?"
               "Capital!" cried Clyde. "'O rare, pale Margaret!' I'll exchange with you, Miss Meredith. But this is a serious question, ladies." And he went on to discuss the various aspects of the case, setting forth the rights, duties, and responsibilities of each of the parties concerned, and at last, on a leaf torn from his diary, drew up, in high-sounding phrase, a sort of a covenant or "act of adoption," to be signed by Elsie and myself.
               Kenneth, meanwhile, sat by, quietly watching the two, with a happy smile playing about the corners of his mouth. Now he laughed outright.
               "I wonder if any one has been far-sighted enough to perceive the other relationships growing out of this wonderful 'act' of Clyde's drawing up? It is 'signed, sealed, and delivered,' however. There is no escape now for any of us!"
               Elsie looked with bewildered eyes from one to the other.
               Clyde clapped his hands. "Kenneth, you are a very Solomon! My fair cousin, I salute you across this vast expanse of tablecloth." And he stretched his hand over the little round table.
               Smiling at him, she placed hers in it for an instant, but withdrew it before he had time to raise it to his lips.
               Meanwhile, Kenneth looked at Clyde much as one would look upon the gambols of a kitten.
               We rose from the table, and went out upon the porch. The light breeze that had rustled the maple-leaves all day had died away. All was soft, sweet, dewy, and still. Two or three stars shone tranquilly amid the blue, and the moon, a pale crescent, hung just above the brow of Mount Hoar. Fireflies were dancing over the meadow, and the long, sad notes of the whip-poor-will sounded from the woods behind Greyholt. The quiet serenity of the night impelled us all to silence. Clyde, who had been in unwonted spirits, for a time resisted its influence, and tried to engage Elsie in a running fire of repartee. But it jarred.
               "Hush!" said Kenneth, laying his hand lightly upon his brother's arm. "Hush, Clyde; in such a night as this, 'silence is golden.'"
               But after awhile he rose softly and went into the parlor, whence he soon returned with Elsie's guitar.
               "'Silence is golden,'" he said, as he hung the black ribbon about her neck, "unless when it can be broken by music. Miss Meredith, will you sing?"
               "What shall it be?" And she struck a few tender chords with fingers that gleamed like ivory in that pale light.
               "What you please. But," he added, after a moment's thought, "I heard you sing the song of Elaine—'the lily maid of Astolat'—once."
               "Where and when?" she asked, lifting her eyes to his. "I do not remember. It is very sad; but you shall have it, if you will."
               And she sang: 
                     
                        "Sweet is true love, though given in vain, in vain;
                        And sweet is death, who puts an end to pain:
                        I know not which is sweeter, no, not I.
                     
                     
                        "Love, art thou sweet? then bitter death must be;
                        Love, thou art bitter; sweet is death to me.
                        O love, if death be sweeter, let me die.
                     
                     
                        "Sweet love, that seems not made to fade away,
                        Sweet death, that seems to make us loveless clay,
                        I know not which is sweeter, no, not I."
                     
                  
               
               Elsie's voice was peculiar. I never heard another like it. Not strong in itself, it yet thrilled you with some strange, magnetic power. It was a "thrilling, tender, proud, pathetic voice," like that we read of in "Aurora Leigh,"—clear as a silver bell and softer than the faintest whisper of the night-wind;—a soaring voice, too, that seemed born not of the flesh but of the spirit. Long afterward, when she had learned to know her well, Patsy said to me, "If that girl ever goes to heaven, she'll have to take that voice of hers along; you see if she don't. They hain't got anything half so sweet up there, I'll bet, with all their harps and things." She did not mean to be irreverent. But there was an individuality about the voice. You could not think of Elsie in earth or heaven apart from it.
               
               As she sang, Kenneth stood with folded arms, leaning against a pillar, looking down upon the fair, sweet face upturned in the faint starlight; while Clyde had taken his position at her feet. The latter toyed with the fringe of her shawl, and half leaned toward her, as if drawn by some power stronger than himself, as the notes rose and swelled, then died away in long and lingering cadence. The former wore upon his face the very look that had startled me on the day when Elsie first came to Altona. I had not seen it since; and so cool and reticent had been his bearing toward my guest, that I had taken myself to task for my vain imaginings.
               "Go on," he said, in a low, husky voice, as she ceased singing. "Something else, please!"
               Dropping her guitar, she leaned back against the woodbine of the porch, and without accompaniment sang one of those grand old Latin hymns that for countless generations have borne the souls of men up to the very gates of heaven. Her voice soared higher and higher,—pure, full, and clear,—until it seemed as if those gates were opened and we heard the harpings and the chanting around the great white throne; then it dropped to earth, like a falling star, and all was still again.
               The mere commonplaces of society seemed out of keeping in Elsie's presence. No one of us thought of complimenting her upon her singing,—it would have seemed like profanation. We sat awhile silently, in a rapt, lifted mood,—one of those moods in which, doubtless, we hold communion with angels unawares.
               Then Kenneth unfolded his arms and drew a long breath.
               "Thank you," he said, softly,—"thank you. Good-night."
               He laid his hand upon Clyde's shoulder with a touch that said, "Come." And the two brothers went down the garden-path, across the road and under the arched gateway, disappearing at last beneath the overhanging boughs of the maples.
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               "IS it to be 'Elsie,' or 'Miss Meredith,' my fair cousin? Tell me which, quick! before I make my morning salutations."
               Such was Clyde's greeting the next morning, as he peeped into the parlor where Elsie was busy with her ferns and grasses. She turned her bright face toward him with a smile.
               "It must be 'Elsie,' I suppose, if the fates have made us cousins. 'Miss Meredith' would be too formal in such a relationship. But, in good truth, I never was over-scrupulous in such matters. You will not——"
               She hesitated, and Clyde said, softly,—
               "What?"
               "You will not, I am sure, be any more likely to forget what is due to me as a lady because you call me by the name my mother gave me."
               
               A quick flush rose to his forehead. "Thank you," he said, bowing over her hand with a low reverence. "You shall never repent doing me this grace."
               There was a silence between them for a moment: Elsie's thoughts were wandering back into her past.
               "My mother," she said, softly, at last,—"she is like a beautiful myth to me,—and nothing more. Do you remember yours?"
               Clyde started, and a look of bewilderment and pain swept over his face. It was like the sudden, unexplained terror of a child who peers into the darkness in seach of it knows not what. His cheeks blanched, and his features contracted.
               Elsie, generally calm and self-controlled, gave a little scream of dismay. "Oh, what have I done? what have I said?" she cried. "Mr. Armstrong, you are ill. What can I do for you?"
               Her voice seemed to restore him to himself. He passed his hand over his eyes and pushed back the hair that had fallen upon his forehead. Great drops of sweat stood like beads upon his temples.
               "It is nothing," he said, in a voice that trembled a little,—"it is nothing; a momentary spasm, that is all. What were we talking about?"
               I had passed out of the parlor soon after Clyde came in, so that I had not heard their conversation. An hour afterward, Elsie came to my room, where I was busy with some sewing, and narrated the above episode.
               "It is the strangest thing," she said. "What can it mean, Aunt Margaret?" We had already made a compact of our own that that should be her name for me henceforth. "Can it be possible that, after the lapse of so many years, the mere mention of his mother could affect him so powerfully? Besides," she added, slowly, as if going through with some process of mental analysis, "his emotion seemed to spring less from grief than from dread and horror. I shall never speak to him of Mrs. Armstrong again; that is certain."
               "It is best that you should not," I answered. "I should have warned you. Years ago, when the family first came to Altona, it became evident that, for some reason, the last Mrs. Armstrong was not to be talked about. I doubt if Clyde has heard her so much as alluded to from that day to this."
               "But strangers like myself——"
               "They seldom see strangers; and they have but little intercourse with the village people. There is some mystery about Clyde's mother, Elsie. So much it is only right that you should know. Six years ago I laughed at Patsy for saying so; but it is the truth, nevertheless."
               Elsie remained quiet for some time; then she said, "What do you think it is, Aunt Margaret?"
               "I do not know, dear; I cannot even guess. Of course the most natural supposition is that she disgraced her family in some way, and that her memory is exquisitely painful to them, especially to Clyde. They seem to try to forget her utterly,—to make her even as if she had never been."
               "It is terrible!" said Elsie. And as the slight tremor in her voice made me look up from my work, I saw that her cheek was flushed and large tears were stealing over it unnoticed. "Oh, I am sorry for her, Aunt Margaret! No matter what she did, she was Clyde's mother. She had borne the unutterable anguish for him, she had played with his baby curls, and pillowed his head upon her breast. Just to die—why, that were nothing! But to be so forgotten, so ignored,—to be such an outcast from love and memory,—oh, it is terrible! Aunt Margaret, whatever she may have done, one can have only pity for her!"
               "That some sin of hers was the foundation of all this sorrowful mystery," I answered, "it is impossible for me to doubt. But God's mercy is infinite, his love is long-enduring. We will believe that his great compassion sought her out in her wanderings, and that she is now in some far land where she is done with grief and tears. Perhaps she is sorry for us, Elsie, and for her children, who are not done with earth and earthly sorrows."
               "When did she die, Aunt Margaret?"
               "In 1851; a little while before they came here."
               "Her husband—what sort of a man was he?"
               "He may have been a stern man in his younger days. Probably he was. But he was noble and upright. He led an utterly blameless life here; and his devotion to Clyde was most touching."
               "A Christian, Aunt Margaret?"
               "That depends upon what you mean by the word. He believed that Christ was the Way, the Truth, and the Life; and I think that he strove to follow Him, even though afar off. He was reticent, like Kenneth. He did not 'wear his heart upon his sleeve,' even in religious matters."
               Elsie drew a long breath, and laid her head upon my lap, while her hand sought mine. "I am glad he was good," she said, simply.
               For a few days I imagined that Elsie held herself somewhat aloof from the two young men. This little shadow of mystery had startled her, as I could plainly see. The dead mother came up between her and them. But the impression wore off after awhile; and before many weeks had passed, I became aware that the leaves of the old, yet ever new, romance were being slowly turned before my eyes.
               Between Elsie and Clyde there had grown up—perhaps sprang up would be the better phrase—the frankest and most brotherly and sisterly affection. He hovered about her as a bee about a flower. He made constant demands upon her: his gloves needed mending, and Patsy was busy; there was a new flower in his conservatory, and Elsie must needs see it; his pet "seabright" had come off the nest with a brood of animated puff-balls no larger than her thimble, and they waited her inspection; he had found the rarest spray of clematis, and she must paint it, with feathery mosses for a background; he was tired, and she must read to him; his head ached, and only music could cure it. He brought her the earliest fruits, and the loveliest flowers, arranged as only he could arrange them. The glory of the sunset paled unless she saw it with him; the stars lost half their brightness when they ceased to shine on her.
               Yet, with all this, there was such open, boyish frankness in his manner toward her,—such an excess of demonstration, so to speak;—he spoke so freely of his admiration for her; he tried to monopolize her in such a peremptory, childlike way, that it was impossible to think—it seemed absurd to think—that any deeper feeling underlay it all. And she met him in the same spirit. The most casual observer could have seen that her heart held for Clyde only the calmest and most passionless affection.
               Between her and Kenneth there was a slight, impalpable veil of reserve. It was not coldness; it was not distance. Indeed, they drew very near each other, but they did not touch. It was not a cloud. It was more like the filmy gossamer that sometimes lies upon the roses in the cool, dewy freshness of a summer morning, and which vanishes utterly when once the sun arises. When their sun arose, this would vanish also.
               For Kenneth loved her. I who knew him so well read this secret clearly. He had loved her, I was satisfied, even before she came to Altona. Very possibly it had then been but an incipient love, of which he was hardly conscious,—one of young manhood's sweet, intangible dreams, from which the shock of grief had partially awakened him.
               But, whatever it might have been then, now it had grown to be the one love that should color his whole life. Not that he betrayed this by any unmanly weakness; not that there was anything in his words or bearing at which the most fastidious delicacy could have taken alarm. As I have so often said, he was strong and reticent. He could wait. He would not uncover the seed to see if it had sprouted. He would not tear open the rosebud that he might drink in its fragrance before the time. Sometime, please God, he would woo and win this fair girl, this peerless woman, and she should be his,—his wife,—the crown and glory of his manhood. But he could be patient, as nature is patient, and wait for the development of fruit and flower.
               For Kenneth Armstrong knew that if he did not frighten her by undue precipitancy, he could win Elsie Meredith's love. He knew that he was strong enough, that his love was potent enough, to draw her to himself if only he had wisdom and patience. But her nature could not be forced or hurried. It must turn slowly and deliberately to the man of her choice; and, once having turned, it would henceforth know "neither variableness nor shadow of turning."
               Do not think that he told me this. He was the last man on earth who would have babbled of his loves or his griefs. Some things I saw, and my own intuitions taught me much. But in telling this story I must occasionally blend the knowledge I now have with that which I then had, and look at things from the vantage-ground that the years have given me.
               I have said that there was a slight veil of reserve between himself and Elsie. I think he was well pleased that it should be there. He would brush it away upon some day of days. Meanwhile it was sweet to dream of all that lay behind it.
               It was easy to see that Clyde's affection for Elsie gave Kenneth great delight. Ever since his father died, he had thought first of his brother, then of himself. Now as he looked down the years he saw how much this girl whom he loved, and who in his heart of hearts he believed—as he had reason to believe—was beginning to love him, would be to Clyde also. She would make a home for him too. It would be a new interest in his life. They would have so much in common: every flower that bloomed, every star that shone, every bird that sang, every insect that danced its brief life away in the summer sunshine, would be an additional bond between them. Clyde loved music too, although he was not a musician himself; and Elsie's rare voice would be to him a source of never-failing joy.
               And, by-and-by, it might be that God would send fair children to call him father, and to climb upon his knee. His heart beat quicker at this thought, and a mist of happy tears gathered in his eyes. Yet even then his gladness was half for Clyde. They should be his children also, brightening his life with their innocent joyousness, and making of it a still dearer and fairer thing.
               For no dream of Clyde's marriage ever flitted across Kenneth's brain, even in the night-watches. No child of Clyde's smiled out of the far future, with its father's great dark eyes, tossing back from its white forehead rich waves of tawny hair.
               To all of us it seemed that Elsie's influence over Clyde was something to rejoice in. He was calmer in his moods, more quiet and self-controlled; he seemed less passionate, less the child of impulse, that summer than ever before. Then she enlarged his circle of interests, and brought him into closer relations tions with his kind. For her uncle's sake, Elsie kept in her heart a warm place for all who had known or loved him in his boyhood. She had the power, which it may be both the brothers lacked, of adapting herself to all classes of people. She was at home alike with the rich and the poor, the high and the low, the learned and the unlearned. The little ragged barefoot boys who brought me trout from the mountain streams were as interesting to her as the "curled darlings of fortune" who walked with their French nurses on Broadway or the avenues. But, aside from all this, she conscientiously kept up her acquaintance with all those whom her uncle had pointed out to her as his old friends. She remembered who had given him the little spotted pig that he had carried home through the woods, in a bag slung over his shoulder; in whose hill-pastures he had gone a-black-berrying; who had shod his first colt, and who had taught him how to make willow whistles. She knew the women who had been kind to him; which one had knitted him the striped mittens; which had made "turn-overs" for him; and which had kissed him and bade God bless him when he started out to seek his fortune. She visited them all, until her smile and voice became familiar pleasures, and the little children nestled at her feet, or clung to her garments with beseeching hands.
               Sometimes Kenneth went with her; sometimes I went; but oftenest Clyde, who had constituted himself her knight-errant, ready at all times to do her will and wander wherever she bade him. But through her, both the young men were brought more frequently in contact with their neighbors. In some way she bridged over the chasm between them; or, when she could not do that, she threw an electric chain of thought across, upon which their sympathies passed and re-passed.
               "If this Elsie of yourn had lived in Salem in the days when they was a-making such a fuss about the witches," said Patsy, one morning, "she'd ha' been took up, forzino."
               "Why so?" I asked, smiling as I mentally contrasted my sweet, golden-haired Elsie with the withered and wrinkled crones who had suffered on Witch Hill.
               "Oh, I do' know," she answered. "There's no denying of her anything. I expect if she should ask me for my head, I should take it right off and give it to her. I hain't any other idee. It's wonderful how she gets round folks and makes 'em like her whether or no. Dennis he thinks the ground ain't good enough for her to tread on. The way he does bow and scrape and touch that old hat of hisn whenever he gets a glimpse of her is a caution to common folks. And as for big dictionary words, the minister ain't no comparison! What are you laughing at, Miss Rossiter?"
               "At Dennis's 'dictionary words,' as you call them," I answered. "How do you think he twisted the King's English about, in order to tell Clyde he had been driving too fast last night?"
               Patsy shook her head. "Couldn't guess. Only I'm sure he went round Robin Hood's barn with it. Where there's two roads, he allus takes the longest."
               "'Misther Clyde,' he said, ruefully, smoothing down the Brownie's chestnut mane, and pointing to some tiny flecks of foam upon his sides,—'Misther Clyde, there's no animal in nayture that, when animated, its constitution will withstand being druv beyont its liabilities!'"
               "That's near-about equal to what he said to me about the eggs." And Patsy's eyes twinkled. "It was last winter, and Dennis was dreadful careless about bringing of 'em in; and if he hadn't been, the nest-eggs was all the while getting froze. So one day, when I was down to the store, I happened to see some o' them new-fangled china ones, and thinks I to myself, 'I'll try 'em.' So I bought half a dozen of 'em, and took 'em home and showed 'em to Dennis. He was as tickled as a boy with a new top, and says he, 'Miss Patsy,'—he never says 'Miss' to me only when he feels oncommon good-natured,—'Miss Patsy, them eggs 'll make them hens lay spon-tan-eously, without root or culture!' I thought that was settin' of 'em up pretty high; but we did get more eggs afterwards, that's a fact."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER X.
               IT was in June that Elsie first came to me; and I think it must have been some time along in September when I first began to perceive that something troubled her. She was not given to tears or sighing, and her uneasiness betrayed itself chiefly in a sort of restless activity that drove her from one employment to another with scarce a moment's cessation. She seemed to be striving not to think. Something, I fancied, had come between her and Kenneth.
               That it would all come out right in the end I did not doubt, for I had unlimited faith in both; and less observant eyes than mine might have seen that there was a strong mutual attraction. So I consoled myself by remembering that while "the course of true love never did run smooth," it was pretty sure to overrule all obstacles and triumph at last.
               Meanwhile I watched them tenderly, weaving this one golden thread of romance into the brown "warp and woof" of my daily living. Elsie became a curious study to me. It was not long before I began to see that when out of Kenneth's presence she was disposed to be cool and critical, to weigh him in the balances of her judgment, to test him in the crucible of her reason. Something that she had seen in him, or missed in him,—I could not tell which,—had aroused her from love's first unquestioning dream, and she was trying to look at him with clear eyes, undimmed by mists or glamour. On the other hand, I saw that the charm of his presence was as potent as ever. She would enter the room where he waited her coming, incased, as it were, in armor of steel. Cool, quiet, and self-controlled, she would seat herself at a distance from him, and for awhile their conversation would remain upon a dead level, never rising above commonplaces. If her eyes met his, it would be with scarce a gleam of soul-recognition in their blue depths. But ere long, some word, or tone, or look of Kenneth's would touch the electric chord, and her whole being would respond, as the harp responds to the touch of the master. It was pretty to watch her then: to see the slow color come stealing to her cheek, to see the frost of her manner dissolve, to see the lines of her face grow soft and gentle, and her eyes light up with warm and tender radiance. Finally the armor of steel would drop off noiselessly, some unaccountable change of position would bring them nearer together, until at length they would be sitting side by side,—the brown hair and the golden in dangerous proximity.
               Then Clyde would come straying in,—if, indeed, he had not been there before,—and, throwing himself upon the carpet at their feet, with his elbow resting upon a low ottoman, would claim his share of the warmth and brightness. And it was never denied him.
               Elsie had expected to return to New York about the first of October; but before the woods had begun to kindle their autumnal fires there came a letter from Dr. Bellinger which changed all her plans. Some unlooked-for business emergency called him abroad, and he wrote to request Elsie to remain in Altona until his return, in December. Meanwhile their house in West Fourteenth Street was to be shut up.
               She was both glad and sorry. And I, watching quietly the little drama that was being played before me, felt sure that a large part of both the gladness and the sorrow grew out of her relation to Kenneth Armstrong. I began to wonder if there was any other lover in the case,—if her feet had become entangled in any of the nets that are continually spreading themselves in the path of young maidenhood. Many a girl becomes caught in some flimsy web, seemingly the veriest gossamer, yet from which she finds it impossible to extricate herself; and this web, woven by the wrong hand, holds her heart a restless prisoner, so that it cannot answer the call of its true lord and master. Then, again, it was very possible that she did not read the story of Kenneth's devotion as I read it. Clyde was evidently unsuspicious, and perhaps her perceptions were at fault in this matter.
               But, at all events, after a day's unrest, she quietly settled herself for a stay of two or three months longer in Altona; so planning her life, however, so crowding the hours, as to leave little leisure for dreaming.
               One still day, early in October, we four—Elsie, Kenneth, Clyde, and myself—were all in my little parlor. Elsie, in a dark-blue dress, relieved only by soft laces at throat and wrists and the two or three bright curls that drooped from her heavy golden coil, sat at her easel painting a wreath of autumn leaves; and I was busy with some bit of needle-work. Clyde was fluttering about as usual, now chirruping to my canary, now quarreling with Elsie as to the arrangement of her picture, with learned arguments pro and con, now making a confused medley of the contents of my work-basket, and anon laying sacrilegious hands upon the guitar that lay upon the table.
               "What are you trying to do, Clyde?" said Kenneth, at last, as a low, pathetic strain died away in horrible discord. "Is that a tune, or not?" And he clapped both hands over his ears.
               "A compliment to my musical abilities!" Clyde answered, with a gay laugh. "I was playing 'The Harp that once through Tara's Halls,' and you coolly ask me if 'it is a tune.' Where are your ears, sir?"
               "Just released from a state of torture," was the reply. "Sit down and keep quiet, Clyde, for I have something to read to the ladies."
               "Not I; I am not in a listening mood just now. But read away, Kenneth; I'll be back presently." And very soon we heard him calling to Dennis as he strode up the hill in the direction of the conservatory.
               "What have you there?" I asked, as Kenneth drew a small volume from his pocket.
               "Nothing new," he answered. "But will you hear 'The Lotus-Eaters'? This dreamy, misty, Indian-summer-like day gives us the very atmosphere in which the poem should be read."
               "Let us go out-of-doors to hear it, then," said Elsie, pushing back her easel,—"out in the pine-woods, back of Greyholt. Here's your shawl, Aunt Margaret, and I will get mine in a trice."
               We followed in Clyde's footsteps, putting our heads in at the open sashes of the conservatory for an instant to tell him where to find us, and then went on into the dim and fragrant silences where pines and hemlocks reigned supreme. All was warm and sweet and still; and there, leaning against a fallen, moss-grown giant, Kenneth read to us: 
                     
                        "In the afternoon they came unto a land
                        In which it seemed always afternoon.
                        All round the coast the languid air did swoon,
                        Breathing like one that hath a weary dream."
                     
                   And so, on and on, until he came to the fifth stanza of the choric song: 
                     
                        "How sweet it were, hearing the downward stream,
                        With half-shut eyes ever to seem
                        Falling asleep in a half-dream!"
                     
                  
               
               Kenneth was a remarkably fine reader, and as he half chanted the dreamy poem in a low, dreamy monotone, in the light of that dreamy afternoon, all life seemed indeed to resolve itself into a dream. Toil seemed a curse, labor a weariness, and we mere motes and atoms in the sunshine, to be drifting, drifting, on some slow, resistless current silently to the end. I saw Elsie's cheek flush and pale, and the shadows deepen in her eyes as he read: 
                     
                        "Is there any peace
                        In ever climbing up the climbing wave?
                        All things have rest, and ripen toward the grave,
                        In silence ripen, fall and cease:
                        Give us long rest or death, dark death or dreamful ease."
                     
                   But as he went on, "How sweet it were," etc., she started from her seat and laid her hand over the page.
               "Stop!" she cried,—"stop! Do not read any more. Stop!"
               Kenneth looked at her in astonishment, and imprisoned the "rash intruding" hand in his, for an instant, ere he closed the book.
               "Not another line, then,' he said, tossing the volume upon the ground. "But what is the trouble?"
               Instead of replying, she turned suddenly away from him, while tears rained from her eyes. After a moment she strayed away from us, farther back into the woods.
               Kenneth turned to me with a troubled, questioning glance.
               "Leave her to herself," I said. "She will be back presently. The words of the poet touched some chord in her nature that vibrated too keenly. That is all."
               After awhile I saw her returning by an indirect path, with a sweet, shy air of embarrassment hovering about her like a new charm. But she went straight up to Kenneth, with flushed cheeks and wet, starry eyes.
               "Forgive me," she said. "I fear I was rude. But, oh! that poem pained me more than I can tell."
               He shook his head as in deprecation of her apology. Then, smiling, he answered,—
               "You must do penance by explaining yourself. Why did it pain you?"
               "I do not know that I can tell you," she said. "I believe it was the unutterable weariness betrayed in that prayer for rest. Yet it is the weariness of stagnation, not of toil."
               She picked up the book, and turned over the leaves, murmuring,— 
                     
                        "But evermore
                        Most weary seemed the sea, weary the oar,
                        Weary the wandering fields of barren foam."
                     
                  
               
               "We are all dreamers, more or less," she went on; "but I want no poems in praise of dreaming, unless it may be the dream of doing. And even then, unless the brave dream culminates in a brave deed, I fail to see where the good comes in. I feel like crying, 'The pity of it, Iago! O Iago, the pity of it!'"
               "But," said Kenneth, after a long pause, and uttering the words as with a painful effort, "there are people in the world who have lost even the dream of doing."
               "But why should they lose it?" she answered, turning toward him impetuously. "Why should any man, how can any man, be content to sit down in dreamy idleness, however beautiful or however æsthetic it may be? Self-culture may be all very well,—of course it is well. But it must be culture with an end in view,—springing not merely from a wish to grow into a fuller, nobler manhood one's self, but from a desire to do one's best for God and for humanity. There is so much to be done, there are so many fields white with the harvest, and the laborers are few. Yet the great God moves chiefly through human agencies,—and shall his work stand still while men are dreamers or idlers?"
               Elsie's words were uttered in a tone of strong appeal, and I saw that they thrilled Kenneth from head to foot. He looked at her for a moment, as in the days of old a man might have looked upon an inspired sibyl who stood before him in vestal purity declaring the oracles of God. Then his eyes dropped beneath her searching glances.
               "'They also serve who only stand and wait,'" he repeated, in a low, constrained voice.
               "Yes," she said, "if they can do nothing better. But most of us can. You can, Kenneth Armstrong. Yet you are dreaming your days away in this valley of repose,—you, who might be working so grandly for God and for man; you, who might be carving out for yourself a place and a name that should shine out through the ages,—a guiding star to myriads of wandering feet."
               I saw it all now. It was out of the trouble and perplexity of her own heart that these stinging words were wrung. To Elsie's earnest, thoughtful eyes Kenneth seemed an idler, a mere dreamer. It was not strange; for even I, who had known all his young ambitions, found myself often at fault concerning him.
               He did not answer her; and after a little she went on, speaking as if it were a painful task to which she had forced herself and which must be gone through with:
               "It was said in New York—it was whispered about in society—that you were ambitious both to do and to be; that you were so earnest a student, so indefatigable a worker. Great things were prophesied of and for you. Yet you have put off the harness even before it had become fitted to your shoulders; you have ceased working even before it is noonday."
               The voice, which had been strong and clear when she began to speak, ringing out like a bugle-call, faltered and broke. Her momentary strength had departed, and the sibyl, the pythoness, sank—or shall I say rose?—into the gentle, loving woman. A wondrous pity shone out of her violet eyes as she crept nearer to Kenneth and laid her hand upon his knee.
               "Forgive me," she said,—"I have hurt, I have wounded you."
               Well might she say so; for, though his eyes and forehead were buried in his hand, his cheek was blanched to the hue of marble.
               "I did not wish to wound you," she went on, almost like a penitent child. "I am sorry. But, oh! I have felt that I must say this,—so long, so long!"
               At the pleading voice, his hand was slowly withdrawn from the eyes it hid, and he laid it lightly upon her head. Only for an instant. Then,—
               "I have nothing to forgive," he said, in a low, tender voice. "Nothing at all. You have spoken strong and noble words, and I honor you for them. They were true words, too,—as uttered from your stand-point. But I cannot explain what justly seems so strange to you. There is but one thing for me to say. A man's work cannot be measured until the day is ended and the labor done. If I may not bring in full sheaves to lay at the Master's feet, I will drop my gleanings there at nightfall, and perhaps He will accept them."
               This had gone far enough, and I was thankful that sounds in the distance gave me an excuse for turning the conversation into a different channel.
               "'Could we but keep our spirits at this height,'" I quoted, lightly, "we should not need bread and butter. 'But this clay will sink its spark immortal;' and here come Clyde, Patsy, and Dennis, laden with what looks marvelously like food for the flesh. I prophesy that we are to have an impromptu feast in this sylvan solitude. What say you?"
               Kenneth rose, and shaking himself as one who would fain throw off a burden of unwelcome thought, peered under the hemlock-boughs at the small procession advancing toward us.
               "I quite agree with you," he said, smiling with lips, if not with eyes; "'yonder cloud' is 'shaped like a camel,' or 'backed like a weasel,' or it is 'very like a whale,' just as your ladyship pleases to have it."
               "I please to have it neither the one nor the other, good Polonius," I answered. "I'm hungry.—Clyde, you are a jewel! Sweet friends, here be peaches and cream, biscuits that are amber without and snow within, yellow drifts of sponge-cake, and dried beef as tender and delicate as rose-leaves."
               "And, feth, here is the tay in the tay-pot, yer honor," said Dennis, looking about him in dire dismay at his inability to touch his hat with both hands full; "and here is the tay-kettle. It was not aisy to carry them through the woods without spillin' a drop, or gettin' a bit of a scratch upon the shinin' sides of aither one. But Misther Clyde threatened to hould a dissolution over me head if the laste harm befell to 'em."
               "A 'dissolution,' Dennis? Pray what might that be?"
               "Indade, it's not meself that's knowin', yer honor." And Dennis, carefully depositing his precious burden upon a rock that stood "convaynient," had at last the satisfaction of paying due reverence to Elsie, who had asked the question. "But I'll take me oath upon it, it was a 'dissolution' that he said should be held over me if the laste scratch came upon the lid of the tay-pot."
               "An execution,—an execution, Dennis!" cried Clyde, with a merry peal of laughter. "I said there would be an execution on the spot,—not a 'dissolution.' You see," he went on, "I laid violent hands upon sundry of Patsy's treasures, and I feel bound to take the best possible care of them—by proxy."
               "I should think so," I said, as I lifted the cover of one of the wicker baskets. "Tea-cups as fragile as egg-shells, and a solid silver tea-pot for a picnic in the woods! I don't wonder that Patsy looks disturbed in spirit."
               "Poor Patsy! I'll make myself a very Puck for the rest of the evening, and 'put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes,' if such is her pleasure. That will set the matter straight,—if my good angels will only take care of the tea-cups!"
               And a very Puck he was, truly, until the deepening shadows warned us home,—the merriest, maddest, tricksiest sprite that ever turned the world upside down, doing mischief in unknown quantities,—sinning and repenting in a breath. But I was thankful for even a disturbing element that afternoon. Kenneth and Elsie were both more quiet than usual; and had it not been for Clyde's sallies, which covered their silence and kept Patsy and Dennis in smothered convulsions, his little feast, beautiful as it was with fruit and flowers, odorous with the resinous breath of the pine-trees, and musical as with the harpings of many harpers, would hardly have been a success.
               It was nearly dusk when we got home. Elsie hesitated for a moment; and then, taking a lamp from the mantel, she said,—
               "I am very tired, Aunt Margaret, and I think I will go directly to my room. Good-night."
               She kissed me and went up-stairs.
               But when, three hours afterward, I went up to my own chamber, her door stood slightly ajar, and I looked in. She was lying upon the bed in a soft cashmere wrapper, with her face turned toward the wall.
               I went in and bent over her.
               "Are you asleep?" I asked. "I fear you will take cold."
               She looked at me with wide-awake eyes.
               "No," she said; "I am only tired."
               I took her hand, which was hot and feverish. "You are ill, I am afraid. Let me do something for you, dear child."
               "Not ill, either," she answered. "Perhaps I am a little ashamed of myself. I do not quite know whether I am or not. Aunt Margaret, am I like a little dog baying at the moon? Tell me." And she drew me with gentle violence down upon the bed beside her.
               I smiled, but shook my head. "Do not ask me that question," I said. "I cannot answer it."
               "Yet you know him so much better than I do. Aunt Margaret, you do not know—I cannot tell you—but I have been so disappointed in Kenneth Armstrong. And this afternoon I could not help speaking."
               "How disappointed?" I asked.
               "I am not sure that I can make you understand it," she answered. "I did not know him intimately in New York; but still we met often enough for me to learn his rare qualities of head and heart. Then many of the professors and students in the medical college were friends of his and of mine, and I heard his praises chanted in most glowing terms. I heard him spoken of as one who was fired by all lofty ambitions; one who would be willing to do all, to dare all, to suffer all, if need be, for the furtherance of grand and noble ends; one who was sure to accomplish great things for science, for the world, and for himself. Yes, for himself; and I honored him none the less for that. I would like my hero to stand upon some lofty pedestal in the strong light of noonday; and that so standing, the searching eyes of the multitude might be able to find no spot or blemish in him. Then, after awhile, I heard that his father was dead, and that he had left town."
               A soft flush stole up to her white forehead, and she turned to me with eager, questioning eyes.
               "What is it, Aunt Margaret? I am puzzled at myself and at him. He has disappointed his friends; he has fallen out of the ranks, and the great army is going on to conquest and to victory without him; he is, as I told him, dreaming his days away in a sort of æsthetic idleness. Yet as he answered my tirade to-day, the grand patience of the man seemed to me almost godlike; it made the not-doing seem as noble as the doing. It was the old story,—the little dog baying at the moon, and the moon shining on unmoved by all the clamor."
               "But the moon was moved in this case, and very perceptibly," I answered. "So the similitude ceases at once. I cannot throw any light upon the matter, Elsie. It is as great a mystery to me as to you. But this much I do believe. Kenneth Armstrong is obeying the voice of some real or fancied duty. Men have died ere this for an idea,—a mere fiction of the brain; and he has in him the stuff of which martyrs are made. He would go to the gibbet or to the stake for a principle."
               "He and Clyde are so unlike," she said. "One is the steel, the other the flint. I have sometimes wondered what the effect would be if the two natures should ever come in sharp collision."
               "There would be an explosion, probably. But it will never happen, I think; for their devotion to each other is as unusual as it is beautiful."
               Elsie lay silent for a few moments. Then she said, with a little toss of her head in the direction of Greyholt,—
               
               "Which is master over there,—Kenneth or Clyde? Every house must have a head."
               "Kenneth, nominally, as the elder,—while Clyde has his own way in most minor matters. Nevertheless, I think Kenneth would rule in an emergency. But look here, my child. Your watch points to the 'wee sma' hours ayont the twal.' It is time you were asleep."
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               YES, I know it. Some things, O my reader, you must take for granted. Some things you must believe, not because I prove them, but because I say that they are so.
               Yet there is truth, and a certain force, in the charge that you bring against me. You say that while I tell you that Clyde was passionate, wayward, self-willed, obstinate, and often moody, you have read ten mortal chapters of this book, and have seen no evidence of it. There has been a little display of playful petulance. That is all. You say that I should show him to you as he was.
               Ah, dear friends, I loved the boy, and I want you to love him too. If God had laid a child upon my breast whose poor little body was in some way deformed and distorted, do you think I would strip off the veiling garments and show you all the unsightliness? No. I would cover the limbs with full and softly-flowing robes, and no eyes save those that are most tender, most pitiful, should ever gaze upon them. And if the face was fair and sweet, if the eyes were like the blue heavens, or dark with the glory of midnight skies; if the hair were paly gold or a lustrous jet, I would show you these, and say, "Behold, God is good. My child has its own beauty."
               So I shall hide from you my poor Clyde's deformities as far as I may. The true artist strives to place his subject in the best light; and, moreover, he strives to paint the possibilities of the man. He tries to look beneath the crust of worldliness, of selfishness, to sweep away the littleness, the falsities, and to place him upon the canvas at his best. He would paint the man at his highest, not at his lowest. Even so shall I give Clyde the advantage of the best possible light. I shall so arrange the lights and shadows as to conceal defects and heighten beauties as far as I am able. None of us are wholly good or wholly bad. He was very far from being either.
               But if he had been bad,—which he probably was not, in your sense of the word,—shall we carefully conceal all bodily defects, lest they should offend delicate sensibilities, and lay soul-deformities bare to the scrutiny of every curious eye? Forbid it, Heaven!
               But to my story again.
               For a week after our little supper under the hemlock-boughs, we saw very little of Kenneth. Clyde said that he was "busy,"—looking over some business papers of his father's,—and so on. But we knew, Elsie and I, that this was not what kept him away from us. We knew that there was a sore spot in his heart that was slow to heal. It could not yet bear an idle touch. Elsie had wounded him sorely.
               "And what right had I to do it?" she asked, one day, in a spasm of self-reproach. "Is my shield so spotless that I should presume to call him to account for the one blot upon his? Why did he not turn about to me and say, 'Physician, heal thyself? But, oh, Aunt Margaret, Aunt Margaret! the worst of it is that every word is true,—or seems so. There is nothing I can take back or unsay. 'True from my stand-point,' he said. How is it from his, I wonder?"
               But when he did come to us, his manner was equally free from self-assertion and from self-depreciation. There was no trace of sensitive pride or of false humility in his bearing. It simply said, with a kind of sublime patience, "I wait."
               I left the two alone for awhile that morning,—for a reason of my own. After Kenneth had gone, I asked,—
               "Is all right? Did you allude to the troublesome matter?"
               "No, Aunt Margaret," she answered, "and I never shall."
               I did not reply to this, and presently she went on:
               "Aunt Margaret!"
               "Well, dear?"
               Her lip quivered, and the color deepened in her cheeks.
               "I cannot understand Kenneth Armstrong. But—I say it not irreverently—it seemed to me to-day that if he had said anything it would have been what One said long ago,—'What I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter.'"
               Dr. Bellinger, as I have said before, was a practical philanthropist. Not content with giving of his abundant means, with heading subscription-lists, and faithfully discharging onerous duties as president of one benevolent association and member of the board of directors of several others, he gave to the poor and the suffering what was often more precious than gold, personal sympathy and kindliness. From her earliest childhood Elsie had been in the habit of visiting with him the bedsides of the sick and the dying, and of ministering to their needs with her small, childish hands. She had been taught to shrink from no service, however menial, if so she might help or comfort those of whom Christ had said, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."
               She did not leave this habit of her life behind her when she came to Altona. There was very little of extreme poverty there; but suffering and sickness and death came to our mountain fastnesses even as to the crowded tenements of New York; and there was enough of penury and privation, also, to make good those other words of the Master, "The poor ye have always with you." Many a one might have dwelt among us for one summer, or for two, or three, and never discovered that there was a soul in the town who needed help. We had no beggars, and poverty with us kept in the background, hiding its head as if ashamed. But Elsie's sympathies were strong and far-reaching; and young as she was, she had learned that all hunger is not of the body; that charity is not simply money-giving. Many an over-worked farmer's wife whose soul yet hungered and thirsted for the beauty it had no leisure to gather about it, found her home brightened by some little touch of graceful adornment; many a boy whose growing intellect was crying out for food, found the books he longed for placed mysteriously within his reach; many a young girl whose heart was just awakening to a sense of its needs, and who was struggling against the influence of uncongenial associations, and the coarseness—perhaps the wickedness—of those about her, found help and sympathy and sisterly counsel where she least expected them. To many a humble home that summer, Elsie's marvelous voice brought the very soul of music. It was Mendelssohn and Mozart and Beethoven and Schubert all in one. On many a whitewashed wall her pictures and sketches were all that Rome and Venice, Dresden and Milan, would be to you. It was a part of her creed that her gifts were to be used for others, and so hallowed by the using.
               The next morning we were quietly busy at Cozytoft: Elsie putting the last stitches in a little pink frock she was making for the birthday of one of her protégées, and I sorting out and setting in order the contents of my writing-desk. Presently a shadow darkened the window, and Dennis came up on to the piazza, touching his hat as usual.
               "Miss Rossiter," he said, with one or two extra flourishes, "I have the honor to inform you that Mrs. Blunt has three twins."
               "Three twins!" I exclaimed. "What do you mean, Dennis?"
               "Or rayther, perhaps it behooves me to say, two twins and an odd one," he went on, scratching his head and looking bewildered. "By the powers, it bothers the soul of me to know whether they be twins or not. But anyhow there's three of 'em."
               "Three what?" I asked. "You don't mean three children?"
               "But indade and I do, savin' your honor's presence. Three byes."
               "Dennis, I don't believe it. You are spinning one of your yarns."
               "Indade, then, by my soul, I am not. I would not dare to be foolin' wid an honorable lady like yourself. Sure an' 'twas the docther that was tellin' me the good news as I was comin' up from the village wid this bit of a bundle. And he said, moreover, that there were more of 'em than there was any raison to expect, yer honor, and that there wasn't like to be clothin' enough for the three of 'em."
               "Well," I said, "I'll see about it. Run along now and tell Patsy. Mrs. Blunt is a second cousin of hers, I believe."
               "By the powers, and is she, thin? It's meself that'll be tellin' her the good news in a jiffy." And off he went.
               "I wonder if she will name the trio Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego," said Elsie, laughing, as she folded up the little pink dress. "It is fortunate that this is finished, for I foresee that there is some sewing for us to do at once."
               
               "Yes," I answered, "Mrs. Blunt is a frail little body, hardly able to take care of one child. We must go to sewing for them forthwith. There is plenty of flannel and muslin in the house; that's one comfort."
               We went to work upon the little soft garments immediately, and by four o'clock one suit was completed. Just then Clyde came in.
               "Working for Bellatrix, Betelguese, and Aldebaran?" he asked, as he tossed his cap upon the table.
               "Yes," I answered; "though it seems to me your astronomy is somewhat mixed. One suit is done, and I wish you would undertake to deliver it, if you can possibly get so near the heavens to-night, and tell Mrs. Blunt there are more coming."
               "'So near the heavens'?" repeated Elsie. "Why, where does Mrs. Blunt live?"
               "'Way up on the old turnpike,—pretty well up the mountain," Clyde answered. "The road is all out of repair and grass-grown; hardly passable for carriages, I imagine. But there is a magnificent view up there, Elsie,—the finest sweep of the hills to be found in this region; and I have been wanting an opportunity to show it to you. Will you ride with me? It is just the evening for a swift gallop, and Prince and the Brownie have not been out of the stable to-day."
               Elsie assented; and in half an hour they were off, Clyde disposing of the little bundle of clothing in some one of his deep, mysterious pockets.
               That October was one long to be remembered for its skies,—blue and bright as those of June,—its soft, balmy airs, its warmth, its fragrance, its beauty. There were frequent showers, but they fell in "the beaded drops of summer-time,"—not in the wild sweep of autumnal rains; and while the woods were clothed right royally, and the hills flaunted their banners of crimson and purple and scarlet and gold, the meadows were fresh and green, and the pastures still gay with the golden-rod, and fragrant with the spicy, aromatic breath of the little white downy-stemmed everlasting,—the immortelle of our New England woods. The day had been even sultry; and as sunset approached, the strange, unnatural heat grew more and more oppressive. A lurid, ghastly light lay upon the hills, and the grass and the trees looked wan and spectral, as during the approach of an eclipse. Still, not a cloud was visible.
               I was up-stairs in my chamber, when I heard the loud slamming of a door. In another instant a pair of blinds on the other side of the house blew together with a great crash. Quickly and silently I went through the bedrooms, fastening blinds and closing windows; then went down to the parlor with a strange dread at my heart. Just as I did so, Kenneth rushed into the house without any ceremony.
               "Which way have they gone?" he cried,—"Miss Meredith and Clyde, I mean. Dennis says they are riding."
               "Did you not know it?" I asked. "They have been gone an hour,—up the old turnpike road,—to Mrs. Blunt's."
               
               "I did not know they were out," he said. "I was writing in the library, and supposed Clyde was here. Hark! do you hear that?"
               There had been a preternatural stillness in the air ever since the one sudden gust that had startled me up-stairs. But now, as I listened, I heard a low, faint rumbling as of distant thunder, and the trees bent and swayed before the couriers of the approaching tempest.
               "We are going to have a fearful storm," he went on. "If they would only stay at Mrs. Blunt's until it is over! But, which way were they coming home?"
               "Round by the point. Clyde wanted to show Elsie the view from the rock."
               Kenneth groaned heavily. "Then they are on the way before this time. Which horse did she ride?"
               "The white one,—Prince," I answered.
               For a moment we were silent. The soft, rosy tints had faded from the sky, and dense black clouds had gathered overhead. Not a drop of rain had fallen, but now the rumbling and crashing of the thunder was incessant, and the fierce, forked lightnings leaped here and there amid the blackness, like fiery serpents darting on their prey. The wind sighed and wailed like a lost spirit; and as the sun went down, the very blackness of midnight seemed to settle upon the earth. Another moment, and both earth and heaven were lit up with a lurid glare that might have come straight from the region of everlasting flame, while our ears were deafened by the din and tumult that fell from above and arose from around and beneath us.
               "My God, but this is terrible!" exclaimed Kenneth, as he tore his hand from my clasp. "Don't hold me, Miss Rossiter, for I must go."
               "Not out into this storm!" I cried. "You can do no good. They must be home presently." And I clung to him, holding him back by main force.
               But he shook me off, and seized his hat mechanically.
               "Prince is afraid in a thunder-storm," he said, hoarsely. "That last clap must have driven him wild."
               Before the last words were fairly uttered, he was outside the gate, and I saw him, by the light of the lurid flashes, gazing up the road.
               My very heart stood still with dread and horror. Matty crept in from the kitchen, and crouched on a cricket at my feet. And still the thunder crashed and bellowed and muttered; still the lightning burned with fearful intensity. Presently I saw Kenneth toss his arms wildly in the air, clasp them for one instant, as if in supplication, and then dart forward as on the wings of the wind.
               I rushed to the east window. Just then the sultry fires lit up the brow of the hill, and for one moment I beheld a vision.
               A flying steed, white as the driven snow, against a background of ebony clouds,—a mass of tossing drapery,—a gleam of golden hair streaming out upon the night wind, a white face fixed in terror and despair, and two hands clutching the silvery mane.
               
               Kenneth took it all in at a glance. He thought as the drowning think: a lifetime was condensed into one moment's space. Straight down the hill flew the frightened horse. At the bottom of it, if he kept the road, there was a short turn, sharp and sudden as a right angle. If he did not keep it,—there was a deep ravine straight ahead, with cruel stones at the bottom. Elsie Meredith was riding right into the jaws of death, either way.
               Kenneth told me, afterward, that for one instant he stood transfixed by terrible doubt and irresolution. To stop the horse was simply impossible. Then a sudden thought flashed upon him like an inspiration. Near the foot of the hill, and close to the road, was the smooth stump of a tree that had recently been cut down. Could he plant himself firmly upon that, with one arm wound about a strong sapling, an offshoot from the parent tree that had sprung up at its very root, with the other he might be able to snatch her from the horse as he swept past. It was a forlorn hope,—but the only one. In less time than you have been reading this paragraph, he had darted across the road and taken his position.
               Ah! what a wordless prayer for help parted his white, set lips for an instant, as Elsie drew near, clinging to the mane with both hands, her slender form swaying in the rapid motion, as a rush sways in the wind! Then he shouted,—
               "Elsie! Elsie! to the right! to the right! I can save you!"
               The clear accents pierced the nearly deadened ears; and, looking up, the white-faced rider saw Kenneth almost within reach. Instinct rather than reason taught her to give a sudden pull upon the mane. The horse swerved to the right. Kenneth's extended arm clasped Elsie's waist and drew her from the saddle, white, trembling, incapable of speech or motion. For an instant he held her clasped closely to his heart, while the steed rushed onward, the very incarnation of the storm. A moment more, and above the wild roar of the elements rose the long, loud, piercing cry of an animal in mortal terror. Then came the crashing of branches, the clattering of stones, a swift rush, a heavy, sickening thud, and Kenneth and Elsie knew that Prince lay at the bottom of the ravine, torn, mangled, dead.
               It was too much. Elsie fainted. She had looked a horrible death full in the face and kept her reason; but now that it had turned aside, and life smiled upon her once more, nature yielded.
               All this happened within fifty rods of my house; and I watched it from my window,—watched it as well as I could in alternate light and darkness. I saw Kenneth bend for one moment over the inanimate form that lay within his arms, with a wild yearning to kiss the pure, pale lips, the drooping eyelids, the white, still forehead. But he did not. Reverently he put back the soft hair that had fallen over her face, laid her head tenderly upon his shoulder, and bore her swiftly homeward.
               I met them at the door. His face was like marble, and he reeled as I extended my arms to receive his precious burden.
               "Do not be frightened, aunty," he said, as, refusing to give her up, he carried her into the parlor and laid her on the sofa. "She is not hurt, I think, excepting as the fright and fatigue have hurt her. I——"
               "I saw it all," I hastened to say. "I saw it all. But where is Clyde?"
               "Clyde? Oh, merciful Father! I never once thought of Clyde," he cried. "It was for him I feared in the first place, for—it is constitutional, I suppose—a thunder-storm has affected him strangely ever since he was a child. I knew he would be fit neither to guide his own horse nor to take care of Elsie. I grew wild as I thought of it all. But when I saw that horse come tearing down the hill, and knew there was but a hand's-breadth between her and death, I forgot everything else. I have not thought of Clyde since. I forgot——"
               He ceased suddenly,—and was gone before I could reply.
               In five minutes he was back again, with a lantern in his hand.
               "I have Dennis," he said, "and am going in pursuit of Clyde. Is she better? Has she revived?"
               "Partially. She will be all right presently."
               He caught my hand in a quick, convulsive grasp, and was gone again.
               The thunder was dying away in low, distant mutterings, and the red lightning had exhausted itself. The rain was falling in torrents.
               I went back to Elsie. She lay just where Kenneth had placed her, with closed eyes,—as motionless as a statue. But the breath fluttered softly through her parted lips, and, as I looked, two large tears stole from beneath the lashes, and rolled slowly down her cheeks.
               She felt the presence that she did not see, and put out her hand in search of mine. As I took it, a strong shudder shook her from head to foot, and she opened her eyes.
               "Where am I?" she exclaimed, starting up. "Who brought me here? Where is he—Kenneth? Is Clyde here?"
               I laid her gently back upon the pillow again. "Kenneth has gone to find Clyde. They will both be here very soon, I trust. But you must not talk now, my child. You need rest."
               "It was terrible, terrible!" she murmured. "Aunt Margaret, from the moment my horse began running, I saw myself lying in the bottom of the ravine yonder—dead!"
               I kissed her by way of answer, placing my finger upon her lips the while. Then, seeing she had not yet recovered strength enough to go up-stairs, I arranged her pillows as comfortably as I could, brought her a cup of tea, turned down the lamp, and bade her go to sleep. In a short time she did my bidding, falling into the deep, heavy slumber of exhaustion.
               She had hardly done so when Matty opened the door, and beckoned me with a wild, scared face.
               "Oh, Miss Rossiter!" she whispered, "Mister Clyde's horse has just gone home; but there wasn't a soul on to him, and the reins were a-dangling."
               I went to the door and listened. The fury of the storm was spent. The rain had nearly ceased, and from behind ragged rifts of cloud the full round moon, remote and clear, looked down with chastened, tender light. I threw my waterproof cloak about me, pulled the hood over my head, and went out.
               It seemed to me that I heard noises in the direction of the ravine. Was it the wind, or the still pattering rain-drops, or faint, returning echoes of the storm? Or did I indeed hear a voice—a human voice—something between a cry and a moan—coming up from the dark abyss?
               I could not tell. But I resolved to know; even while a superstitious horror seized me as I thought of Prince lying a mangled heap at the bottom, and wondered if the ghosts of departed steeds did ever walk the earth "in the dead waste and middle of the night." I dared not trust myself to think of Clyde. But, if the noise I had heard did indeed come from the ravine, I must know what it was.
               Just as I reached the spot, however, I saw Kenneth and Dennis coming round the foot of the hill, and advanced to meet them. As I did so, that same uncertain sound reached my ears again.
               "You here, Miss Rossiter?" said Kenneth, as the rays from the lantern flashed full upon my face and form. "How about Clyde? Has he got home?"
               "No. But the horse has come. Kenneth," I whispered, drawing closer to his side, 'there is something stirring in the ravine. There! do you hear that? Can Prince be alive, after all?"
               He shook his head. "Nothing could be alive after such a fall as he had."
               The moon was still shining, but its beams did not penetrate the darkness of the chasm. Kenneth leaned far over the edge, and swung the lantern so that the light would fall below. We caught one glimpse of Prince—a heap of white upon the blackened stones; and I knew well what was the thought that sent so strong a shudder through my companion's stalwart frame. But in a moment he swung the lantern again.
               "See, aunty, see!" he whispered. "There is something crouching there beside it. Do you not see it? There! there!"
               "Kenneth, Kenneth, it is a human being,—it is Clyde!" I cried, softly. "Nay, nay, but he is alive," I added, quickly, as the lantern dropped from his nerveless hand. "He moved,—he spoke. He is not dead, Kenneth! Speak to him."
               Kenneth bent over the abyss, and called, "Clyde! Clyde!"
               But the figure, which we now distinctly saw sitting with its forehead bowed upon its knees and its arms clasped about them, gave no sign in recognition or response. Soon, however, it moved visibly.
               "It is Clyde, I think, and apparently unhurt," said Kenneth, after a moment. "But, aunty, how did he ever get there? Clyde! Clyde! Speak to me, Clyde!"
               The figure raised its head. It was Clyde. Just then the moon from directly overhead poured its light into the narrow ravine, flooding the spot where he sat with silver radiance. I saw the very shimmer of his curls as he looked upward.
               He seemed dazed,—stunned,—but astonished neither at his own position nor at ours. Pretty soon he said, putting his hand to his head with a vague air of bewilderment,—
               "It is cold here, Kenneth,—oh, so cold!" And he shivered, clasping his arms more tightly about his knees.
               There was a strange, unnatural tension in the voice, that made it very unlike Clyde's. Before we could answer, it reached us again, sharp, querulous, yet intense.
               "Come! come quickly!" it cried. "Elsie is cold, I tell you! Come!"
               Years afterward, when the inner life of these two souls had been more fully revealed to me, I recalled what, in the excitement of the moment, I had scarcely noticed,—the look of pain and dread that swept over Kenneth's face as he heard these words.
               "I am coming," he answered, hastily. "Be patient, Clyde. I will be with you very soon."
               The ravine was hardly more than thirty feet deep, but rocky and precipitous.
               "By the powers, but how will you convey yourself to him, yer honor? It's a mighty onconvaynient place of descint," said Dennis, with an anxious face, as he leaned over the chasm.
               "I must climb down," was the reply. "He must have done it, and I can do it. Dennis, go for the horse and buggy, and drive round to the head of the gorge. He can never climb up again; that is certain."
               While he spoke, he was divesting himself of his coat, and making ready for the perilous descent. Clyde had apparently forgotten our presence, and was again crouching in the shadow. Once I saw him groping about as if in search of something.
               "Take care of the lantern, aunty," said Kenneth, as he swung himself over the edge, planting his feet firmly upon a narrow jutting rock. "I would not like to be in total darkness, if the moon should perversely hide herself." Then he shouted, cheerily,—
               "Look out for me, Clyde. I am coming!"
               I watched him breathlessly, as he crept slowly down the steep side of the abyss,—now clinging seemingly to the bare face of the rock, now poised upon some projecting point which scarcely afforded foothold for a humming-bird, now trying the strength of some hardy shrub and swinging himself downward by its aid. Once I suppressed a scream as he stepped upon a loose stone and sent it hurtling into the depths below. Once my heart stopped beating as his foot slipped upon the wet, uneven surface, and he saved himself only by throwing himself violently forward and catching at a branch that swung opportunely near. But at last the descent was made, and Kenneth stood by his brother's side at the bottom of the ravine.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XII.
               MY own senses must have been preternaturally quickened that night; or else the action of the storm had so cleared and vivified the air that sound was borne farther than its wont. Certain it is, that as, wrapped in my waterproof, I stretched myself upon the damp ground and peered over into the moonlit chasm, almost every word from below reached me.
               Clyde had neither looked nor stirred since Kenneth left the upper earth. Now the latter laid his hand upon his bowed head.
               "Here I am, Clyde," he said, with a cheery ring in his voice. "But this is a rough place to get to; I should not like to try it over again. Now we will make our way up to the head of the gorge, where Dennis will meet us. Come on, my boy."
               But Clyde looked at him without moving, for an instant. Then he stretched out his hands imploringly,—
               "Help me to find her!" he cried, in sharp, piteous accents. "I want Elsie! help me to find her."
               Kenneth took the two hands in his, and I saw him kiss his brother's forehead as he answered, soothingly,—
               "Elsie? Why, she is not here, Clyde. What are you thinking of? She is safe at home."
               "Don't lie to me! I know better than that," was the passionate response. "She is here, dead or dying on these cursed rocks, and I cannot find her. See here!" And he dragged Kenneth round a jutting crag, and pointed shudderingly to the white mangled heap that had been Prince at sunset.
               "Yes, I know it," said Kenneth, still caressing and soothing Clyde as if he had been a child. "Yes,—poor Prince! But I tell you the truth, my brother; Elsie is safe at home, asleep in Miss Rossiter's parlor. Is it not so, aunty?"
               "I left her there half an hour ago," I replied, feigning a calmness that I did not feel. "Come home, Clyde, like a good boy. Elsie is all right."
               But Clyde shook his head incredulously, and his voice grew intensely mournful and pathetic.
               "I know," he said; "you wish to spare me. You would lure me away from this dreadful place,—this den of horrors. You feel that it would kill me to know that I had killed her. But, Kenneth, I am neither a fool nor a baby. There lies Prince; and where is she? Crushed beneath him on the cruel stones! I know it, and you know it! Standing there, white and impassive as a statue, you know it! She is dead, dead!"
               It had been impossible to interrupt him, for he would not be interrupted. You might as well have talked to a stone. Gradually his voice grew higher and shriller, until the last words were almost a shriek. As he uttered them, he dropped upon the ground, and buried his face in his hands.
               Kenneth knelt beside him and loosened the clenched fingers. He was indeed white to the very lips, but his voice was calm and steady.
               
               "Look at me, Clyde," he said; and taking his brother's face in his two strong hands, he turned it toward his own. "Look at me. I have never deceived you, and I shall not deceive you now. Elsie is not killed; I caught her from the saddle myself, and the next moment Prince lay yonder, while she lay fainting in my arms. But she is not hurt: God's angels were with her in her perilous flight, and not one golden hair was harmed. Tell me that you believe me, Clyde! Speak, for God's sake!"
               But a dumb spirit had taken possession of him again; and he made no answer by word or sign to Kenneth's earnest entreaties. A sudden thought struck me, and I flew back to the house.
               Elsie had awakened from her nap, and was sitting in a low chair by the fire which our thoughtful Matty had kindled, pale but quiet. I had no heart for many words.
               "Can you walk," I said, "as far as the ravine?"
               "Yes," she answered, "if it is necessary. What is the matter?"
               "Clyde is worrying about you," I said. "He will not believe that you are safe. We will give him ocular evidence, if you have strength to get there."
               I threw a cloak over her shoulders, and a veil over her head, and drew her arm within mine.
               "Where is he?" was all she said.
               "In the ravine,—but Heaven only knows how he got there without breaking his neck. Even Kenneth, with his cool head, found the descent difficult and hazardous. But wait here a moment, while I reconnoitre."
               As I looked down upon the two brothers, I saw that their positions were unaltered. Still Clyde sat in dumb silence, and still Kenneth was pleading with him. It seemed to me that a sudden coup de main was the only thing that would bring him to reason. So I marshaled my forces.
               Placing my arm about Elsie, I drew her to the brink of the precipice, where the full strength of the moonlight concentred upon her. Then I threw back the cloak in which she was enveloped, and lifted the shrouding veil, from beneath which her long hair fell around her like a mantle.
               "Kenneth! Clyde!" I called, in a voice that would tremble in spite of me, "I have brought Elsie to you. Look up, and see how the blessed moonbeams are crowning her."
               Both sprang to their feet. Kenneth turned toward her a face that, for one instant, was irradiated,—wearing such a look as a Parsee, in some rapt hour, might lift to the god of his idolatry. Then the light faded, as suddenly as it came. Clyde, after one quick upward glance, sank slowly to the ground again, while his two outstretched hands were clasped as if in prayer.
               "Speak to me!" he cried; "if you are not a spirit, speak!"
               Elsie leaned forward, with a smile upon her lips. But just as she was about to open them, thoughts of all that had happened that night—of life and death and eternity,—and, perhaps, of the love that could hallow them all—swept over her, and, instead of speaking, she burst into tears.
               
               Kenneth turned lightly to Clyde. "Spirits do not weep," he said,—"not that I ever heard. Are you satisfied now that she is real flesh and blood? If so, we will try to make our way up to the head of the gorge before the moon goes down."
               He waved his hand in adieu, and I waited to hear no more, but hastened home with Elsie. When we came out of the darkness into the warm and fire-lighted room, I turned to look upon the young face that had grown so dear to me, with fresh wonder and delight. Excitement had brought back the color to her cheeks, the glow and sparkle to her eyes. The dampness had given a new beauty to her hair, which fell in long, loose, golden waves even to her knees, and there coiled up in a host of tiny curls. And to all this glory of light and color was added a rare and subtle charm, a witchery of voice and tone and manner that intoxicated even me. There was a sweet and tender consciousness about the girl that night which I cannot describe to you. It had all the glory of the dawn, all the delicacy and beauty of the spring. It was what the dew is to the rose, the fragrance to the flower, the bloom to the grape. It crowned her with the grace of perfect womanhood, and I felt that far down in her heart of hearts she kept "the secret of a happy dream she did not care to speak." I wondered if in that moment of dread and danger when he snatched her from the very jaws of death, Kenneth's soul had spoken to her soul, revealing that which his lips had never dared to utter. I wondered if, when her bodily senses were sealed and she lay as one dead within his arms, the electric chord of sympathy pathy between spirit and spirit had still vibrated, and she had been inly cognizant of all his love and longing.
               But I wasted no time in idle speculations that night. Fair and sweet and winning as she was, she must go to bed like ordinary mortals. She needed warmth and food and rest and sleep as imperatively as the most commonplace girl that ever moulded biscuits or drove the cows to pasture. So I hurried her up-stairs, undressed her as speedily as possible, and left her to darkness and to dreams.
               Then I crept stealthily down to the parlor again, knowing that it would be impossible for me to sleep until I knew that Kenneth was safely at home with his charge.
               Hours of watching and waiting are long hours, and it seemed to me that it must be long past midnight, although the clock pointed only to half-past ten, when I heard the sound of wheels and Dennis's familiar chirrup.
               I stepped to the door; the moon had gone down, and I held the lamp high above my head, that its light might stream down the path and illuminate the faces for which I sought. They stopped just at the gate.
               Kenneth's face was fixed, set, ashy pale in that weird light, and wore a look that startled me.
               "Is all right?" I asked, hurriedly.
               But his voice came clear and steady. "Yes,—all is right,—or will be in the end. Good-night, aunty. You ought to be in bed, after all this excitement."
               But I was not satisfied. I wanted a word from Clyde, and went down to the gate. The lamp did not waver in the still night air.
               He looked tired, exhausted,—but he was Clyde; and it was Clyde's smile, though faint and weak, that lighted his eyes for an instant as he turned toward me. The strange tension, the unnatural rigidity of face and manner that had startled me in the ravine, had passed away. Yet still there was something about both the brothers that I could not read. I felt that some revelation had come to both that night,—that life to both of them had suddenly assumed a new aspect and become endowed with a new meaning.
               "If Clyde is not sick after this, it will be a wonder." I whispered to Kenneth. "If you need me in the morning, let me know."
               As we sat at a late breakfast the next forenoon, Dennis came in with the young gentlemen's compliments, and was Miss Meredith suffering any from the combined effects of the ride and the storm?
               Miss Meredith was not suffering in the least,—she was as well as ever, was the reply. But how was it with the young gentlemen themselves?
               Dennis could not say. He had not seen Mr. Clyde that morning, and thought he had not left his room. But he did not think he was sick, or Mr. Kenneth would have said so. As for Mr. Kenneth himself, he was all right, although Dennis fancied he looked a bit paler than usual,—which was not strange, he added, bowing to Elsie with great significance, when one considered the circumstances.
               A little fluttering color stole into Elsie's cheek at this, but she bore it off bravely.
               "Wait a moment, if you please, Dennis; I would like to send a note to Mr. Kenneth." And rising from the table, she ran up-stairs.
               Dennis looked after her in undisguised admiration.
               "Indade and by my troth, Miss Rossiter," he said, "she is quite angelical-like this morning. The blue eyes of her are like two stars, and her cheeks are like white roses wid a blush at the heart of 'em!"
               She came down very soon, with an open note in her hand, which she laid beside my plate. It read thus:
               "Come to me to-day, if you can. You saved my life last night, and I have not yet thanked you."
               "Send it by all means," I said, in a low voice, in response to a half-timid glance of inquiry. She knew what was fitting as well as I did, and I understood very well that the action sprung solely from a womanly longing for sympathy. "Send it by all means. Not that it is necessary, for I do not doubt he will be in before night, whether you send it or not."
               Dennis departed.
               It suddenly occurred to me that morning, as I was folding away the clothes from the wash, while my thoughts were busy with the events of the previous night, that Kenneth had evinced no surprise at Clyde's sayings or doings. He had asked no questions, and exhibited no curiosity. He had simply accepted the situation exactly as he found it, conforming his own actions to it and demanding no explanations. I had not noticed it at the time, but now this feature of the case forced itself upon my attention tion, and set me off upon a train of speculation from which I only returned in season for dinner.
               Elsie was up-stairs most of the forenoon; but once, as I stood at my pantry window, I heard some one go softly out of the front door. Soon I saw the flutter of a scarlet shawl along by the fence; and ere long a head appeared, crowned with something soft and white and fleecy, fringed with nodding, dancing atoms. A graceful, girlish figure moved lightly along the yellow road; then it turned to the right, and presently I saw it standing upon the edge of the ravine, gazing down into the yawning gulf below.
               It stayed there for a few moments, mute and motionless. Then it went back to the road again, and followed it up the hill till it reached the stump of the old elm-tree, upon which Kenneth had stood the night before. It was a quiet, secluded spot, removed from human eyes,—for no house but mine was within sight.
               Elsie—for of course it was she—glanced up and down the road. She was utterly alone,—alone, as she thought, with God and her own soul. For an instant she stood quietly, with folded hands and drooping forehead; then knelt by the huge bole, throwing her arms about it, and pillowing her cheek upon its scarred and moss-grown face.
               After awhile she rose, gathered a few leaves from the thrifty sapling in whose fresh young veins the life of its dead parent was pulsing, carefully lifted some bits of moss and lichen from the stump, and came home with her treasures.
               She stole gently up to her room, and I saw her no more until dinner-time.
               Years afterward, upon a blank leaf of Elsie's prayer-book, I chanced one day to see three faded, yellow leaves, and some sprays of feathery moss. Beneath them was a date,—October 10th, 1857.
               Still farther down the page were these words,— 
                     
                        "Out of the jaws of Death
                        Hath he delivered me."
                     
                  
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               AFTER dinner Elsie went into the parlor, and as I heard her moving lightly about the room I knew that order and beauty were following her steps. Nature had bestowed upon her what is always one of her choicest gifts to woman,—the power of evoking beauty from common things. Let her enter a bare, plain, commonplace room, and by a few graceful touches, a picturesque arrangement of the simple furniture, an artistic disposal of unconsidered trifles that had been hidden away in the background, by a flower fitly placed, or a cluster of brightly-tinted leaves, she would change the whole aspect of things, and give a sort of poetic beauty to what was perhaps in itself not beautiful. And this seemingly without thought or effort. It was in her small world as it was in His great one, when God said, "Let there be light,"—and there was light.
               
               So when I heard her in the parlor, which Matty had swept and dusted that morning, I knew that she was making it beautiful in anticipation of Kenneth's coming. I knew that when I went in I should find it sweet with mignonnette and heliotropes and tuberoses, and gay with scarlet verbenas, purple asters, and golden chrysanthemums. I knew that the great punch-bowl, which, as Clyde had said, did not come over in the Mayflower, would be overflowing with its wealth of verdure,—graceful, feathery ferns, and delicate maiden's-hair,—or bright with the coral drops and shining emerald leaves of the checkerberry-vine; that my beautiful Madonna would smile down upon me from a glow of crimson woodbine, and that trailing wreaths of the same would hang from window and doorway.
               Now, if I had undertaken this, its accomplishment would have required half a day, at the very least. But there was some subtle sympathy between Elsie's fingers and the flower-stems. She gave them a touch here, a twist there, she turned this spray to the light and broke off a few obtrusive leaves from that,—and lo! they were arranged. She perched herself upon a high chair, and tossed the woodbine over the cornices, and,—presto! it fell at once into the right position, as with willing obedience. I should have needed tacks and a hammer, and a step-ladder. All she required was the long, trailing vine, and one toss of her pretty arms. Inanimate things lost all their natural depravity, which is such a hindrance to most of us, when she dealt with them.
               Then she went up-stairs.
               Going up myself half an hour afterward, and finding the door of her chamber ajar, I peeped in, as was my wont.
               She had on a loose dressing-sack, and had just been brushing and arranging her hair. That, like the vines and flowers, was obedient to her will, obeying her behests with all submission. It was always dressed according to the mood of the moment, simply or elaborately, as the case might be, and seldom twice alike. To-day it was arranged as I had never seen it before: I cannot tell you how, for I am not skilled in the art. I only know that golden braids lay like a coronet above her white forehead, while a shower of curls fell upon one shoulder.
               My first thought found utterance in impulsive speech as she turned toward me:
               "My child, I wonder if you know how beautiful you are!"
               She laughed a little low happy laugh, while her sweet face flushed, and something marvelously like a tear softened the lustre of her eyes.
               "Am I, Aunt Margaret? I am glad of it."
               Then, as if conscious that her reply was a subterfuge, she added, under her breath, "Yes, I do know it, and I thank God for it."
               I was not expecting just this answer. I had never in all my life before seen a girl who would plainly acknowledge that she knew herself to be beautiful. Most girls, in reply to such a remark as mine, would have blushed and simpered and made faint denials of the soft impeachment, pretending to wonder at my absurdity. But Elsie said, frankly, "Yes, I know it." I stopped to think about it a little.
               She answered the unuttered thought, coming up to me, and throwing her arms about my neck: "Aunt Margaret, perhaps it is not quite the thing for me to say this. Girls are expected to be as blind as bats to the pictures their mirrors show them. But I do thank God that He made me fair, just as I thank Him that He gave me health and reason and any other good gift. For it is a good gift, and one for which a woman may well be thankful, let the croakers say what they may."
               "You are right," I said, "and gifts that we can thank God for will not hurt us. I see no reason why you should not thank Him for your beauty as well as for your voice. Some time you will be glad——"
               But there I stopped. She looked at me inquiringly.
               "I will not finish that sentence now," I said. "One of these days, maybe, I will give you the 'conclusion of the whole matter.'"
               She turned quickly away, and the swift, hot color flooded neck and brow. So keen were her intuitions, so clear her perceptions, that she was apt to catch the merest hinting of one's thought. She had done so now. She did not need that I should finish the sentence. She knew I was about to say that some time she would count over every gift, as the miser counts his gold,—rejoicing in the amber glory of her hair, in the blue splendor of her eyes, in the snow and carmine of brow and cheek and lip, in all the grace and sweetness of her womanhood, as well as in her marvelous voice and her wealth of mind and heart, if so be that she might lay them all at the feet of the man she loved. For his sake she would glory in them, as she had never gloried for her own.
               Something of all this—a faint foreshadowing—looked out of her eyes that day, and gave a tenderer beauty to her face. It was for Kenneth's sake that the long tresses had been braided and the flowing ringlets curled. It was for his sake that the blue dress was at last chosen,—for was not blue his favorite color? and the pearl ornaments put on,—for had he not said they were becoming? and the little cluster of geranium-leaves and tuberoses made to nestle in the shining hair,—for had he not once spoken of their delicate perfume?
               It was a pretty sight at any time to watch her at her toilet, and to see how speedily laces and ribbons settled themselves into graceful shapes at the touch of her deft fingers. But that day, lying back in the dimity-covered easy-chair, I smiled to myself as I noticed her innocent, unconscious self-revealings. Kenneth's lightest fancy was remembered and deferred to. Suddenly she looked round at me, clasping a curiously-wrought bracelet upon her arm.
               "What are you staying here for, my lazy Aunt Margaret?" she asked. "You must go straight to your own room, and dress yourself. We 'receive' this evening, you must remember, Miss Rossiter! so run right away and put on your black silk, with the old thread laces that I like so well."
               Dear me! My black silk was set apart for special occasions. I never thought of putting it on of an afternoon at home. Besides, it struck me quite forcibly cibly that Miss Meredith would be able to entertain her guest, or guests, that day, without any of my help. However, to please her I arrayed myself with unwonted magnificence and went down to the parlor, where she was already busy at her little work-table making a second suit of clothes for "Mrs. Blunt's three twins."
               It was easy to see that her thoughts were not upon her work. But she never dawdled. She either did what she had to do quickly and well, or she let it religiously alone. So, when at last her fingers refused to do her bidding as expeditiously as usual, she threw the little garment into her work-basket, and drew from its depths a volume of Mrs. Browning.
               Matty called us to tea in due season; and after we had tried to please her by doing justice to her toast and muffins, we returned to the parlor again. There was a little shadow upon Elsie's face, and she put on her thimble with a sort of desperation.
               "I must finish this little slip to-night," she said, "no matter what comes. I am growing lazy."
               I amended the sentence, mentally, by substituting "who" for "what,"—thinking, with a half smile, that I would not care to be held responsible for the completion of her task.
               But the evening waned away, and he did not come. Neither did Clyde. Greyholt might have been at the antipodes, for all we heard of it or of its inmates that night.
               The next day it rained, and the next, and the next. Generally rain was sure to bring Clyde, if not Kenneth, to Cozytoft; a fact which was apt to remind me of a formula common to children in the beginning of a letter,—"As I had nothing else to do, I thought I would write to you." When the two young men had nothing else to do, they were very prone to find their way to my parlor. But now four days had passed, and we had not had so much as a glimpse of them; neither had Patsy been over upon any of her multifarious errands.
               On the morning of the fifth day I put on my india-rubbers and donned my waterproof.
               "Rain or no rain," I said, putting my head in at the door of the room where Elsie was busy at her easel, "I am going to see whether there is any one alive at Greyholt. Perhaps this flood has swept them all away. But what are you doing?"
               "Come and see," she answered.
               It was a mere sketch, but it told its story perfectly; it needed no interpreter. There lay the stalwart knight, dreaming upon his luxurious couch,—undisturbed by the strong beams of the morning sun which were streaming in through the open casement. Casque and armor lay upon the floor, shield and buckler leaned against the wall. Outside, but visible through the window, was a band of armed men, whose curveting steeds and waving banners proclaimed them ready for tilt or tournament, or for the fiercer conflict of the deadly fray. Near the couch, gazing upon the sleeper with wonder and with pain, stood a woman fair of face and noble of mien. The very curve of her bending figure, the very pose of her head, said as plainly as words could have said it, "Awake, thou that sleepest!"
                  
                     
                        "Forgetful of the falcon and the hunt,—
                        Forgetful of the tilt and tournament,—
                        Forgetful of his glory and his name,
                        Forgetful of his princedom and its cares!"—
                     
                   I cried. "Elsie, it is Enid and Geraint!"
               "Thank you," she said, simply. "You have read the story. Yes, it is Enid and Geraint. But it is just a sketch. I shall never work it up." And she turned it to the wall with a weary air.
               Picking my way across the muddy road, and going up under the dripping boughs of the maples, I went round to the kitchen door. Patsy was in her neat store-room, packing away the butter from yesterday's churning.
               "Patsy," I said, going straight to the mark, "what is the matter? Is either of the young gentlemen sick?"
               She turned and looked at me, with the upraised butter-ladle in her hand.
               "I don't know what's the matter, Miss Rossiter. Something is up, but what, is more than I can tell. They ain't sick, neither of 'em, to my knowledge. But Clyde's been desputly upset ever since the night Prince was killed. 'Twas a dreadful narrow escape, now, wasn't it?"
               "Where are they?" I asked, with a nod of assent to her question.
               "In the library. I wish you'd go in and see 'em, Miss Rossiter. I never ask no questions,—for Kenneth he knows enough to attend to his own concerns, and I don't want to meddle nor make. But I kind o' guess that Clyde's got on his high-heeled shoes about something or nuther; and when he does get 'em on, it's mighty hard for Kenneth, I tell you. They hain't eat enough to keep a robin alive since that night,—both of 'em put together."
               "Perhaps they won't want to see me," I said, hesitating a little as my thoughts ran backward. "I told Kenneth to send for me if I was needed."
               "Never you mind that," she answered, turning her butter vigorously. "Miss Rossiter, you're near about old enough to be mother to them boys, and don't you go to putting on airs with 'em now. Maybe you can do 'em good. At any rate, I think it's your bounden duty to try."
               So through hall and parlor I went, and tapped on the library door. Kenneth opened it.
               He looked ten years older than he had done five days before. "All thy waves and thy billows have gone over me," seemed so clearly whispered to my spirit as I looked upon his face, that I involuntarily listened, half expecting to hear his lips repeat the words. Yet he was calm and quiet in manner, and took my hand in his warm clasp as cordially as ever.
               "Won't you come in?" he said.
               I looked past him into the room. Clyde sat by the window, gazing moodily out upon the sullen skies, the dripping trees, the cold, wet earth. He too had changed. He looked worn, troubled, harassed. As he saw me he sprang forward, caught my hand, and drew me toward the fire, which since the storm had grown to be a daily necessity. There was a hungry craving in his eyes that startled me.
               
               "Well, young gentlemen," I said, lightly, "what vows have you taken upon yourselves now? Have you turned hermits or recluses? I half expected to find you in the brown habit of the barefooted Carmelites."
               "Vows of silence, for one thing," returned Kenneth. "If you look closely, you will see the seal upon my lips."
               Apparently the words were spoken in jest. He thought I would so receive them. But as I caught his eye I felt that some bitter truth was underlying them. They were spoken to his own soul, and not to me.
               From beneath his heavy, frowning eyebrows, Clyde shot a fierce glance at Kenneth.
               "It is all his work!" he cried. "I will not bear it! I am not a baby, and I will be kept in leading-strings no longer. From this day forward, Kenneth Armstrong, I take my own course. I will not submit to your dictation."
               The words seem tame enough as I have written them down. But emphasized by his flashing eyes, his eager, passionate voice, his haughty, impetuous bearing, they were anything but tame. I looked from one to the other in a maze of sorrow.
               Kenneth was leaning against the mantel, twirling an ivory pen-holder he had just taken from the rack. As he met my eye, his fingers closed upon it convulsively, and it snapped like a pipe-stem. But he manifested no other sign of emotion. Ere he had time to speak, Clyde returned to the charge.
               "I will do as I choose; I will come and go as I please," he said, tossing back his tawny locks with the air of a young lion. "Because you are three years the elder, you think I belong to you, soul and body. You would make me the slave of your caprices. But I tell you I will be ruled by you no longer. I am free!"
               I turned to leave the room. The scene was growing too painful; and, besides, I felt myself decidedly de trop. But Clyde strode swiftly to the door and closed it.
               "Stay here, if you please, Miss Rossiter! You came just in time to hear my declaration of independence. Do you hear it too, Kenneth Armstrong? From this day forward I am my own master."
               His hand was on the door-knob, and I could not escape if I would. I think I must have looked frightened,—I know I felt so,—for Kenneth turned to me for one instant with a reassuring glance. Then he gave his attention to Clyde again.
               "Of course you are your own master, Clyde," he said, very gently, and with no trace of heat or bitterness in his manner. "Of course you are free—to do whatever is best and right. We are none of us free in any other sense."
               "Don't philosophize," returned the other, sharply "I am in no mood for listening to platitudes. All I want to know is this. Do you accept the situation? Do you understand that your assumed control over me ceases from this hour?"
               Kenneth's countenance changed at last. An indescribable expression of yearning pain swept over it. He went up to Clyde, who was pacing back and forth across the room, and placed a hand upon either shoulder,—looking him full in the face with his clear, strong, gray eyes. But there was a sorrowful quiver in his voice, as he said,—
               "Clyde, I understand, I shall understand, only this. I am your brother. We are bound together by the closest, tenderest ties. Just as long as God gives me life and being I shall love you, help you, and care for you. You cannot emancipate yourself from my love, for it will follow you to the world's end."
               I might have left the room, for the door was no longer barricaded. But I was gazing with a fascinated gaze upon the two brothers. For a moment or two Clyde looked into Kenneth's face unblenchingly, as a young eagle might look upon the sun. Then his eyes began to waver; they glanced right and left, up and down,—while Kenneth's were as steady as that sun itself,—until at last the white lids dropped over them, veiling their burning brightness.
               Then Kenneth leaned forward and kissed his brother's forehead. "Oh, trust me, Clyde!" he whispered, with a strange tenderness in his voice,—a tenderness that thrilled to my heart's core. "Trust me! Only so can we walk safely to the end. Believe that your happiness, your interests, your welfare are as dear to me as my own, and all will be well. I do not seek to rule you, Clyde. I only try, as best I may, to fill our father's place."
               Clyde's head drooped more and more, until it almost touched Kenneth's shoulder. Then he raised his arms as with a mighty effort, clasped them about his brother, straining him to his heart for an instant, and rushed into the hall and up the stairs.
               Kenneth sank into a chair as one utterly exhausted, and covered his face with his hands. I was stealing quietly away, when he put out his arm to stop me. "Don't go," he said.
               I went back to him and laid my hand upon his throbbing temples. How hot and tense they were! "You have won the victory," I said. It was necessary to say something, and I uttered the first commonplace that occurred to me. But I was not prepared for his response.
               "Yes," with a weary sigh,—"I have won it for to-day. But it will have to be won over again to-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow!"
               I said nothing in reply to this. What could I say? There was something in the relation of these two that I did not comprehend. Silence was my best resource.
               Yet at length my woman heart found expression in one brief question. "Kenneth, can I help you?"
               He shook his head, and his lips formed the monosyllable "no." But no sound escaped them. At length I heard Clyde's footsteps overhead, and rose hastily.
               "I had better go now," I said, "before he comes down."
               Kenneth rose also. For a moment he looked at me with all his heart in his eyes. Then he held out both hands to me.
               "Miss Rossiter," he said, "I believe there is no other woman living who could have witnessed this scene and asked no questions."
               "I have none to ask," I answered. "If it were possible for me to help you in any way, I should be only too glad to share your confidence. But I cannot seek it."
               "Oh, if I could but give it!" he sighed. "But I told you, you know,"—and here his lips parted in a faint smile,—"I told you that I had taken the vow of silence. My lips are indeed sealed."
               After a moment I said,—
               "Kenneth, you are both troubled,—Clyde and you. Is it well for you to keep yourselves shut up here? A sorrow brooded over is a sorrow magnified. I doubt if you are acting wisely."
               "Perhaps not," he answered. "I do not know. There is much to be said on either side. Aunty, I am just groping in the dark. If I make mistakes, may God forgive me!"
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               NOT a word had been said of Elsie,—no allusion to her note had been made,—no apology offered by Kenneth for his neglect of the invitation contained therein. I dreaded to go home to meet her questioning eyes.
               But I need have given myself no uneasiness. She made no inquiries, by word or sign, and I simply told her that Clyde was not looking well, with sundry vague allusions to bad weather, etc. In my heart I was ashamed of myself; yet what else was I to say? I was not a whit wiser than when I went to Greyholt. I could have described the scene which I had witnessed, as I have described it to you. But had I any right to do so? I knew that Elsie was troubled; yet if I had felt at liberty to tell her all I had seen and heard, it would only have increased her trouble and perplexity. Ah, sweet spirit of silence! sometimes thou art indeed blessed.
               Elsie was very quiet that day. That is, she did not sing, neither was she inclined to talk. But work was her great panacea; and she went from one employment to another in her own still, unobtrusive way, yet steadily, as if goaded by the demon of unrest. There were no pretty loiterings in window or doorway; no pauses when she sat with happy, smiling eyes lost in a young girl's dreamy reverie.
               But that evening I paused in my reading to listen to the click of the gate-latch; and presently the well-known footsteps sounded on the gravel-walk.
               Clyde's appearance belied my words. I had told Elsie that he was not looking well; but it seemed to me that night that I had never seen him looking better. His large, luminous eyes glowed with softened fire; his cheeks, so wan and haggard in the morning, wore again the rich coloring of youth and health; his lips curved in a rare, proud smile; and as he stepped quickly across the room to bow with chivalric deference over Elsie's hand, I thought I had never seen a finer specimen of manly beauty. It was a strange beauty, too, of the warm blonde type, with such lustrous eyes of burning black, and clustering waves of hair that changed from reddish gold to darkest auburn, according to the degree of light that fell upon them. He seemed a young Adonis that night, rejoicing in the strength and glory of his dawning manhood.
               What shall I say of Kenneth? Clyde had apparently forgotten the events of the morning: he was as gay, as sunny, as free from any sense of care and responsibility as ever he had been. You would not have believed, had you seen the graceful, half-tender beauty of his bearing toward his brother, that those perfect, smiling lips could ever have uttered the words I had heard that forenoon. I half doubted the evidence of my own senses, and wondered if my memory was playing tricks with me.
               But Kenneth's nature was in one sense like granite. Impressions once received were long-enduring. He bore upon brow and lip, and in his heavy, shadowed eyes, perceptible traces of the conflict through which he had passed.
               That was a strange evening. All its brightness emanated from Clyde, who, half reclining upon a low divan at Elsie's feet, looked up in her face as a devotee might look upon a saint. He was happy,—there was no doubt of that, whatever might be said of the rest of us. It seemed to me that the astral lamp burned more dimly than its wont, and that the open fire, which was of itself a never-failing fountain of light and radiance, had ceased to do its office. There were shadows in the far corners of the room; they hovered about window and doorway and ensconced themselves in forbidden places.
               I glanced up at the cornices and at the dusky-haired Madonna over the mantel-piece. The woodbine wreaths were still there; but, ah! their crimson had changed to dingy brown, and the leaves were crumpled and sere. The vases were empty,—save one in which "the last rose of summer" still lingered. Out in the garden, which had been so gay with the late autumnal blooms but a few short days before, the heavy rains had made wild havoc, and the broken flower-stalks trailed upon the cold, wet ground. The faded ferns had been removed from the punch-bowl, and nothing was left but the checkerberry-vine, still gay in its scarlet and green.
               I looked at Elsie, sitting over against the fire-light. No golden coronet crowned the fair forehead to-night, no flowing curls drooped daintily upon the shoulder. Her soft hair rippled plainly back over the small, shell-like ears, and strove to hide its shining wealth in the meshes of a simple net. No azure robe set off the snowy whiteness of her skin; but a plain black dress, such as I might have worn, left her beauty wholly unadorned. The pearl ornaments rested in their casket up-stairs; and one little knot of blue ribbon fastened the narrow linen collar at the throat.
               As for me, instead of the shining silk in which, to please Elsie, I had arrayed myself the other night, I wore my every-day brown alpaca. Neither the house nor its inmates were in festal trim. That was not one of our gala-days.
               The contrast struck me forcibly. I think it struck Elsie also; for, even while she strove to answer Clyde's gay sallies, she grew paler, colder, stiller.
               Clyde monopolized her, as he was prone to do; and after a few words of courteous, kindly greeting, Kenneth devoted himself chiefly to me. But often, as we talked, I noticed that his eye wandered away from me to the two who sat by the fireplace; and that whenever it did so wander, its shadows deepened, and the strong, firm mouth which could yet be so unspeakably tender, quivered as with sharp and sudden pain.
               Once my eye followed his. Elsie, as usual, had some pretty bit of crocheting in hand, and was busy with her white and scarlet wools, in and out of which the ivory needle darted swiftly. Just then she had reached some critical point, and with head bent and eyes completely veiled by their long, curved lashes, she was counting her stitches. Clyde, with one hand thrust in the glittering mazes of his hair and his elbow resting on his knee, sat watching her,—reading her face as intently as a monk might read his missal. But, alas! there was a passionate glow and fervor in the glances which still failed to warm her almost colorless cheek, that never yet burned in the eyes of an anchorite. Something in Clyde's looks or bearing revealed to me the whole truth,—it told me that he too loved Elsie Meredith.
               It flashed upon me in a moment, and I caught my breath in the suddenness of the shock. Kenneth and Elsie had become inseparably connected in my thoughts. But Clyde! This was indeed a new and disturbing element. Even his strange looks and words in the ravine had not awakened my suspicions. I thought that the sudden terror of the storm and the terrible shock of Elsie's supposed death had overcome his strength and made him semi-delirious for awhile; and I had not dreamed of this.
               But I knew it now,—and Kenneth knew it too. One glance at his stern, set face told me that. Yet the sternness seemed directed toward himself; not toward the two at whom he was gazing.
               It was a positive relief when Kenneth rose to go, so making his adieus as to include Clyde and render it impossible for him to remain longer without discourtesy. But in the general shifting of the kaleidoscope that took place just then, Kenneth and Elsie were thrown together, while Clyde drifted over to me.
               There had been a touch of pain and weariness in Elsie's face all the evening. I wondered if Kenneth saw it as she glided up to him and hesitatingly laid her hand upon his arm.
               "I have so wanted to see you," she said, glancing up at him with timid eyes. "I wrote you a note,—but perhaps Dennis forgot it."
               "I have been much engaged," he answered, evasively, resisting the temptation to imprison within his own the small, white fingers that caressed his sleeve. No marble statue could have been, apparently, more insensible to the gentle touch,—and it was presently withdrawn.
               "I have wanted to thank you for—for what you did the other night," she said, betraying by the enforced steadiness of her voice the restraint she was placing upon herself. "I dare not allow myself to think——"
               "Do not speak of it," he interrupted. "It was nothing. I should have done the same for the veriest stranger, or even for an enemy. You owe me no thanks."
               "But I must thank you, nevertheless," she continued; and I felt, if he did not, the pang his indifferent words had caused her. "The stranger, or the enemy, could do no less than that."
               For an instant he wavered. There were burning words upon his tongue, which he longed to whisper, but did not. Instead, after a moment's pause he repeated, quietly, "It was nothing." Then he turned to Clyde.
               "Come," he said. "It is getting late. Good-evening, ladies."
               Elsie took a candle, and started to go up-stairs. As she reached the hall door, she turned toward me.
               "Oh, Aunt Margaret!" she cried, "if Uncle Howard would only come back! I need him. I want to go home!"
               "I know it, dear child," I answered, tenderly. "But he will come soon,—in a month or six weeks."
               She pushed the hair back from her forehead with a weary touch. "Yes,—but that seems like an eternity." And she passed up the stairs.
               I did not follow her, but went back to the fire, and for a long hour sat peering into the glowing embers, trying to read the destinies of these three whom my heart had adopted as its own. Life plays at cross-purposes with us every day; but the enigma she had now propounded for my solving was beyond my skill. I began to see that it could not be answered, but must be worked out step by step, like a problem in mathematics. And to at least one of the parties—probably to more than one—each step would be a separate pang.
               What would Kenneth do? What did he intend to do? Had he marked out a course for himself, and would he tread it unshrinkingly to the end? Was he, as appearances to-night had indicated, preparing in a spirit of lofty self-abnegation to immolate his love upon the altar of brotherly devotion? Would he sink quietly into the background, and, if she could be won, receive from Clyde's hands as a sister the woman he had hoped to call his wife? Would he shut his eyes henceforward to the pure, maidenly love, not for Clyde but for himself, that he could not fail to see was growing in Elsie's heart?
               I did not know Kenneth Armstrong well enough to answer these questions, although I believed him capable of almost any act of self-sacrifice. But as the weeks rolled on, I grew more and more at a loss. Between him and Elsie there seemed a great gulf fixed; a gulf that neither of them attempted to pass. He did not shun her presence, but neither did he seek it, except when compelled to do so. Cautious and kindly always,—for, true gentleman that he was, he could not have been otherwise,—he yet seemed to have set a bound for himself over which he never passed. There were no more of those long talks in which soul spoke to soul even more clearly than lip to lip. He never read aloud to her now, "lending the rhyme of the poet the beauty of his voice," and thus giving utterance to the passionate devotion he could not quite conceal, but for the avowal of which the time was not yet ripe. There were no more loitering in the soft twilights, no more quick answering glances when the same high thought stirred in the heart of each.
               She sang for him sometimes, but it was when we were all together: never when they were alone. And I remarked that he never called for the old songs that had so thrilled him in the past. Whatever could in any way bring them into their old relation—which, while it had not been that of openly avowed lovers, had yet long since passed the bounds of mere friendliness—he seemed instinctively to avoid.
               Yet—and here was the puzzle—he was not giving her up to Clyde. He had apparently withdrawn from the lists himself; but he still threw every possible hindrance in his brother's way. Watching them both, with eyes sharpened by affection and anxiety, I soon saw that Kenneth's every thought was concentrated upon the effort to keep Clyde and Elsie apart,—to pile up obstacles between them mountain high.
               I did not like this. In the first place, what law of ethics, human or divine, demanded of Kenneth such a sacrifice as he was making? It seemed to me a sort of mock heroism. There was a touch of the melo-dramatic about it, which did not suit me. If a love had grown up between him and Elsie, everything in their positions, characters, and circumstances went to prove that it was a God-appointed love, with which no fanciful ideas of brotherly obligation should be allowed to interfere. I doubted if he were doing right. Why did he not go to Clyde and say, frankly, "We both love this girl, but my love is an older, a stronger love than yours. Mine is full grown; yours is only in the bud. I have already wooed her: not in words, it is true, but in the acts that speak louder than words, and I believe that she is beginning to love me. In this matter you should yield to me, not I to you."
               But even as I thus wearied myself with questionings, I knew that Clyde would not yield to Kenneth, and that such an appeal would have been made utterly in vain. If anything were said, it would have to be this: "We will enter the lists together and give each other fair play. Let the best man win."
               Ah! Kenneth could never say that. The training of his whole life forbade it.
               But why make a half-sacrifice? If one must die, surely it were better to die like a man than to sneak out of life like a coward. Had Kenneth strength to shut Elsie out from his own heart, but not strength enough to see her won by another? Or was there a little of the dog-in-the-manger even here, where I had thought all nobleness was garnered?
               But whatever my queryings might be, I kept them to myself. I did not dare to meddle with these three souls. If they had been my own children I would not have dared to lay my sacrilegious hand upon the delicate mechanism that a touch might harm beyond repair. There are balances upon which even a mother has no right to lay so much as a feather's weight. There is a holy of holies in every one of the souls that God has committed to her keeping, into which even she has no right to enter; there are hidden arcana into which even she must not seek to penetrate.
               So I simply observed, and waited for the developments that I knew must come at last.
               Kenneth, it seemed, had no such fears as those to which I have just alluded. He was not at all afraid of interfering with matters that had better be let alone. Clyde hardly found in his own shadow a more inseparable companion than Kenneth, during the hours in which there was a probability of meeting Elsie. If the younger brother wandered off under the maples, and, crossing the yellow road, walked up the little graveled path that led to Cozytoft, you may be sure that the elder was never far behind. Elsie had not had courage to mount a horse since that fearful night-ride; but if Clyde proposed a drive, Destiny, in the shape of Kenneth, always interfered in some way to prevent its being a tête-à-tête. If a ramble was proposed, "aunty's" shawl was brought by the same adroit manœuverer, and we all started out together. I could see that Kenneth strove by every means in his power, by hunting up employments for him, by little excursions into the surrounding country, by suggesting improvements and alterations in the green-house and in the laying out of the grounds, by searching out new interests to occupy his thoughts, and by filling up, as far as was possible, every available moment of his time, to keep Clyde away from Cozytoft. Sometimes he succeeded for days together; but failing in that, he strove to neutralize the evil by introducing into Clyde's intercourse with my fair guest such a strong proportion of broad, open daylight light, such a matter-of-fact element, so to speak, that the atmosphere became unfavorable to the growth of sentiment.
               Yet in spite of all this it did grow, day by day. Clyde's devotion became, to me at least, more and more apparent.
               Many a heart has been "caught in the rebound." Would the saying prove true in this instance? Elsie would have been more or less than woman if, in contrast to his brother's studied coolness, this devotion had not been grateful to her. Besides, she had always liked him: they had had much in common; and in the free brotherly and sisterly intercourse that they had held all summer, they had drawn very near to each other. All that was brightest, most charming, most winning in Clyde blossomed in the sunshine of Elsie's presence. He never betrayed to her, or before her, any of his waywardnesses, his caprices, his freaks of temper. She drew out the best that was in him, and to her he was all that was gentle, noble, and manly.
               As a rule, I think it is true that personal beauty in man makes but little impression upon women. They do not demand in their heroes smoothness of outline and perfection of feature, preferring even a rugged exterior if it betokens the strength for which they instinctively seek. But Clyde's beauty was so striking, so peculiar, that I could not help regarding it as one of the surest arrows in his quiver. It had its influence even upon me, and I was getting to be an old woman. I loved to look at him as I loved to look at a beautiful picture or a fine statue; the glory of his hair was a delight to me, and the very poise of his shapely head gave me a sense of æsthetic pleasure. I could not help asking myself, sometimes, what effect it would be likely to have upon me if I were a young girl and this paragon were my lover.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               CLYDE was growing restive. The curb chafed and worried him, even while, so adroit was Kenneth's management, he was not distinctly aware that he was curbed. I knew that his brother perceived it, but I saw also that he made no change in his course. If anything, his vigilance increased; and I lived in constant fear of an outbreak between these two. If I could only do something to help them! For even in my blindness I felt that they needed help.
               "Kenneth," said I, the next time I saw him, "I should think you and Clyde would like to go off on a journey somewhere. You have not been away since you came from New York,—and Clyde has taken no long trip since your father first brought him here. It would do you both good."
               "'Traveling is a fool's paradise,' according to Emerson, and 'the wise man stays at home,'" he answered. "I have already journeyed enough to discover what our Philosopher par excellence calls 'the indifference of places.' We carry ourselves with us wherever we go."
               "But we all need change, variety," I rejoined. "You are both young men. You need, especially Clyde, to see more of the world."
               Kenneth's face darkened, and he spoke quickly, almost sternly:
               "Do not put such ideas into his head, I beg of you, Miss Rossiter. It would be the greatest misfortune——But I beg your pardon for my hasty words. Only believe me, the less that is said to Clyde about seeing the world, the better."
               "Then you might go to the Adirondacks. The world has not wandered up there yet—or but a small fragment of it. Jim Wilson says the hunting is very fine, and he brought home some splendid venison."
               "That's a bright thought of yours, aunty," he said, turning round with a sunnier smile than I had seen upon his face for many a day. "That's a bright thought. We will go to-morrow, if I can get Clyde started; and by the first of the week we'll send you a saddle of venison such as Jim Wilson never dreamed of."
               But Clyde peremptorily refused to go. For his part, he preferred civilized life; he had no fancy for "roughing it," especially now when the weather was growing cold and inclement. When he turned hunter, he would go to the Far West, get an Indian tribe to adopt him with all due ceremonials, marry some dusky beauty, and settle down in a wigwam. He did not believe in half-way measures. But Kenneth could go if he pleased. Why did he not? Indeed, Clyde would be very glad to have him go, and thought he had better start at once, by all means.
               To which proposition Kenneth did not agree. So my bright thought went after the myriad of its kindred that have been lost in the deep sea of oblivion.
               Patsy flitted in and out that week oftener than was her wont. But it so happened that she never chanced to find me alone. At last one evening as I saw her tall, spare, yet not uncomely figure making its way along by the hedge, it occurred to me that she might have something to say that she did not care to say before Matty. She was in the habit of consulting me with regard to sundry details of household arrangement concerning which she thought I could read the tastes of the young gentlemen better than she could.
               So when I saw her coming I stepped out at the back door. Her face brightened as she saw me, and she beckoned me to one side with an air of mystery.
               "Miss Rossiter," she whispered, "I'm proper glad to get a chance to speak to you alone. There's been lots o' things a-troubling me lately."
               "Is that so, Patsy? I am sorry. But what's the matter? Don't the new recipes I gave you work well?"
               "Oh, I hain't tried 'em," she answered. "I never could do much with rules for cookin'. I mostly put in a little o' this, and a cupful o' that, and a pinch o' t'other, and stir 'em all up well, and it comes out about right, most generally. I tell you what, Miss Rossiter, cookin' comes by natur'. If you hain't got the faculty, book rules won't do you but mighty little good. No, indeed! it wasn't the recipes that troubled me, not by a great sight."
               "Well, what was it, then?"
               "You've got your shawl on? Come off here out o' sight and hearin', Miss Rossiter, and I'll tell you all about it. Matty she's good-hearted enough, furzino, but she's got dreadful long ears."
               We wandered off out of range of the windows, and Patsy took off her apron and spread it over a rough board to make a seat for me. Then she sat down herself.
               "It's Tom Bradshaw, Miss Rossiter. That's what's the trouble."
               "Tom Bradshaw! What difficulty can there be between you and him, Patsy?"
               "Not a mite of any. You know he used to work for Mr. Armstrong?"
               "Yes, I believe so. But I do not remember much about it. He did not work for him long, did he?"
               "No, not a great while; and now you're coming to the very p'int. He was turned away. I never knew justly what for,—but I kind o' reckoned it was for sneaking round, prying into what wa'n't no business o' hisn. At any rate, that's just what he's been a-doing ever since he was born."
               "But what of it just now?"
               "Oh, you see he's owed the Armstrongs a grudge ever since; especially Kenneth, who had something or nuther to do with his being turned off. He's told awful stories about him, first and last, Miss Rossiter. I declare to goodness, it just puts me out o' all sorts o' patience."
               "Let him talk," I said, reassuringly; for Patsy's face proved the truth of her words, and her voice trembled with excitement. "He can't hurt Kenneth. It is not worth while to mind his nonsense."
               "But he has hurt him, Miss Rossiter; he does hurt him. He's a dreadful plausible chap, and he makes folks believe just what he tells 'em."
               I did not answer her for a minute. My memory had gone back a year, and I was thinking of the conversation I had chanced to hear in the store between Tom Bradshaw, the major, and the squire.
               "Folks down to the Corners are getting dreadfully interested in Clyde lately, seems to me," she went on, after awhile.
               "How in Clyde, particularly? What do you mean?"
               "Oh, I do' know."
               But it was evident that she did know. So I waited in patience till she was ready to tell me.
               "Miss Rossiter," she said, at last, "do you know anything about these boys' business matters?"
               "Not much. I imagine that there is not a great deal to know."
               "Did the old man make a will?"
               "Not that I know of. Why?"
               "Did the property belong to Clyde's mother, or to Kenneth's?" she went on, entirely ignoring my question.
               "We have no reason to suppose that Mr. Armstrong's property came to him through either of his wives. He was extensively engaged in business for many years; and I presume he made his money as most other men do,—by working for it."
               Patsy gave two or three satisfied nods. "Just so," she said,—"just so! That's just what I've told 'em allus. How folks will talk!" she added, reflectively.
               "But how are the people in the village getting interested in Clyde?" I asked.
               "Oh, it's Tom Bradshaw, that's all. He does say, Miss Rossiter, that when Kenneth came out of his father's room the night he died, he went right straight to the safe and began overhauling the papers, putting some in and taking some out, before he'd been in to see Clyde or anything. Now, you know it ain't so, for you was with Kenneth when he come downstairs, and when he was a-hunting all over the house for Clyde. You know it ain't true; and I hope you won't make no bones about saying so."
               "But, Patsy," I said, "it is true that he went to the safe that night, for I went with him and held the light myself."
               "You don't say so!" And Patsy turned round to me with amazement and dissatisfaction in her face. "I didn't believe one word of it. But don't tell me 't he went to taking out papers and destroying of 'em, for I know better."
               "No," I replied, "he took none out; but he put one in,—one that he had in his hand when I found him by his father's bedside that night. That is all I know about it, Patsy. Kenneth has never alluded to the matter, and of course I have asked no questions. But how was this untimely visit to the safe discovered? I have never mentioned it before to a living soul; and it is not probable that Kenneth has spoken of it."
               "Tom Bradshaw pretends't he was told on't; but it's my private opinion that he was a-prowling round where he hadn't no call to be, and peeked in through the winder. It's just like him, for all the world."
               She hesitated a moment, and then looked at me with a new trouble in her rugged, yet kindly, face. "That feller's hanging round Clyde too much lately, Miss Rossiter, and 'tain't for no good. I've been wanting to speak to you about it for a fortnight."
               Around Clyde! What now? "But how does he manage it? I should not think Kenneth would allow him to come on the premises, if he has such a spite against the Armstrongs."
               "Mercy! I don't suppose Kenneth has the least idea of it. He don't hear much of the gossip that's going on, now I tell you. Tom's got a dreadful wheedling kind of a way with him, and he just pulls the wool right over Clyde's eyes, making believe that he's so wonderful interested in his ponies and chickens and things. It's all gammon, the whole on't. Kenneth don't see much of him, anyway. He kind o' hangs round out o' sight, and watches, and then slips into the green-house when Clyde's by himself. I've seen him there lots o' times lately, and it means mischief, just as sure as my name's Patsy."
               "But what kind of mischief, Patsy? I am not sure that I get your idea."
               "He means to make trouble between them two brothers," said Patsy, with a jerk of her head. "He wouldn't want no better fun. Miss Rossiter——"
               I waited for her to go on, but here she hesitated. So after a little I said, "Well, what is it, Patsy?"
               "I want to ask something, and I don't know as I've any right to. But you know I set e'en a'most as much by them boys as if they was my own."
               "You may ask me just what you please, Patsy. I shall not misjudge your motives."
               "Of course you ain't bound to say nothing if you don't want to," she remarked, with a considerate air. "My asking hain't nothing to do with your answering. But I've been worrying, for a spell back, about them and this Elsie Meredith;" turning round with an expression that seemed to say, "Now, if you think I'm a fool, why, say so!"
               "Why have you worried?" I asked. "Would not the old house be brighter and happier if there was a sweet young mistress there to bring sunshine into the vacant rooms and fill them with life and joy? It would not make much difference with you, Patsy, for I imagine she would not care to make any violent changes in your department."
               Her face flushed hotly.
               "For the land sakes! I hope you didn't think I meant that. I wa'n't a-looking out for number one. But I tell you what, Miss Rossiter," dropping her voice to a lower key, "I knew two brothers, once, who both fell in love with the same girl, and there was the worst kind of a row."
               I did not answer her: I was thinking. Very soon she went on,—
               "Now, you needn't say nothing, if you don't want to. But if I'm a natural born fool, it would be a kind of comfort to know it!"
               "I did think at one time," I said, "that Kenneth was attached to her. But he has changed lately."
               
               "Kind o' cool, ain't he? I thought so. It come on him all of a sudden, too. But Clyde he's in dead earnest. Now, if Kenneth don't want her, what does he want to act so for?"
               "Act how?"
               "Why,—interfering between 'em. He's allus hanging, round. Clyde don't have no fair chance to do his courting."
               "How did you learn all this?" I asked, looking at her in some surprise.
               "I ain't blind as a bat yet," she answered. "I can see through a millstone, when there's a good big hole in it, if I am nigh on to fifty year old. But, Miss Rossiter, don't it beat all how news travels? It does seem as if these boys couldn't so much as sneeze but what the whole town was a-talking about it."
               "The village people are not talking about this matter?"
               "Yes, they be. They've been speculating and surmising all summer. First they would have it that Kenneth was a-courting of her. Now they say she's given him the mitten, and that Clyde's the favored one."
               "Oh, well," I said, "there will be just so much gossip while the world stands. But I supposed Elsie was much beloved in Altona."
               "So she is. Folks ain't saying anything against her. But they do say that Kenneth ain't doing just right. They say't he's determined that Clyde sha'n't get her. You see, Tom Bradshaw's made 'em believe, down there at the Corners, that Kenneth ain't playing fair about the property; and it stands to reason, if that's true, he don't want Clyde to get married and raise a family. Then, too, they think he's kind o' like a dog in the manger, and that if he can't have her himself, he's bound Clyde sha'n't. And that's just the way it goes."
               This troubled me more than I can tell you. I did not care greatly for the gossip of the town; and, besides, what right had I to find fault with those who did not know Kenneth so well as I did? Had not some of these very doubts and questionings come up in my own mind?
               But I dreaded the effect upon Clyde's sensitive, easily-disturbed nature, if these things came to his ears. Tom Bradshaw had powerful weapons in his hands, if he chose to use them.
               While I sat in a brown study, crushing the withered grass beneath the toe of my boot, Patsy laid her hand upon my arm.
               "Miss Rossiter, I'm real troubled, or I wouldn't ha' come to you. I've been a-beating about the bush this whole during time; but the truth o' the business is, that I believe this leaven o' Tom Bradshaw's has begun to work a'ready; and it'll leaven the whole lump before we know it."
               "Why do you believe so?"
               "Oh, things don't go on to our house a bit as they used to. Them two boys used to seem so happy together. To be sure, Clyde would make a rumpus once in awhile; but Kenneth could manage him just as easy, and bring him around after a little; and then he'd be just as good as pie for a spell. But now there's something wrong all the time. It seems as if the air was chock full o' thunder and lightning, and you got a clap right in your face and eyes afore you knew it."
               "Patsy, tell me one thing. You don't doubt Kenneth? These things don't shake your faith in him?"
               "Shake it? No, sir! not a mite! I don't go back on my friends quite so easy. I calculate to swear by Kenneth Armstrong just as long as I live, right or wrong; and I'm sorry if anything I've said has made you think otherwise. I'm willing to walk by faith and not by sight, sometimes, according to Scriptur'." Tears sprang to the keen gray eyes, and Patsy furtively wiped them with the corner of her apron. "I've felt as if I wanted to be a-praying for them boys all this week," she went on, with a half sob; "and I should, if I'd only been a professor! But as 'twas, I s'posed my prayers wouldn't amount to much. Leastways, that seemed to be about the p'int o' Mr. Eldridge's last sermon."
               "When a heart that is troubled goes to God to lay its burden at his feet," I said, "I don't believe he stops to ask whether it is the heart of a 'professor' or not. He 'giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not.' So we may both ask him to help those who need help, Patsy."
               "Well, it's time for me to be a-going," said she, rising. "I've got sponge to set to-night. Miss Rossiter, it does women lots o' good to talk over their troubles; now, don't it? I feel better a'ready, though there ain't no airthly reason why I should."
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               PATSY was right; the leaven was working.
               Now, Tom Bradshaw was not a deliberately bad man. Indeed, I may as well say right here that there will be no villain in this story. I am not writing a romance. I am only telling you about the Armstrongs, and the experiences, some strange and some sad, that we had in common. So I cannot manufacture my own materials; and we were average people up in Altona. None of us were very good or very bad. As Patsy used to say, we were "just about middling." The very worst of us were not all bad; and as for the best of us,—ah, well!—even Kenneth and Elsie and my beloved Patsy were not quite perfect. They were only mortals, after all.
               No, Tom Bradshaw was not a villain. He was envious and conceited and narrow; lazy too, and fond of loitering about with open eyes and ears wherever he might see or hear some new thing. He was apt to lay his meddling fingers upon matters that did not concern him, and, with a mischievous tongue to help him, he had succeeded in doing more harm in the world than many a worse man has been able to accomplish.
               He was a self-deceiver also,—unable to read the secrets of his own heart, or to sound its subtle depths. I presume he had not the slightest idea that a settled dislike to Kenneth was the real root of his sudden interest in Clyde. Probably he had no deliberate, avowed intention of making trouble between the brothers. Clyde was innocent and unsuspecting. He was younger than Kenneth, who was only a half-brother, after all, and had seen much less of the world. Somebody ought to put him on his guard and tell him to take care of his own interests. Even brothers were not always to be trusted. That was all he was going to do. It was merely a praiseworthy effort to help his neighbor.
               So when he began, as he did, to instill his venomous poison into Clyde's ears, drop by drop, I do not doubt that he flattered himself he was doing God service. Men have so flattered themselves many a time, when they have been doing devil's work for devil's wages.
               I began to long for Dr. Bellinger's return. Elsie had not been placed directly in my charge. I was not responsible for her sayings and doings. She had passed the period of tutelage, and was a woman, capable of thinking and acting for herself. But in a certain degree I felt myself responsible for her happiness. She had been, all through the summer months, so bright, so joyous, so full of love for all created things,—the very incarnation of hopeful, happy girlhood. Now, as I saw her day by day growing paler, stiller, sadder, more reserved, keeping herself to herself, and giving me fewer and fewer glimpses of her true life, her inner life, it gave me the keenest pain. She seldom mentioned Kenneth's name now. I knew that he was a riddle, an embodied mystery, to her. She saw him often, it is true; Clyde would come, and if Kenneth did not come with him, he was sure to follow in five minutes. For her sake I regretted this most deeply. There was no real intercourse between them, and I knew his presence was a torture. To her? Yes; and to him also. Underneath all the studied coolness, the gentlemanly reserve, I counted the very throbbings of his heart, and knew that he was torturing himself as well as her.
               Very needlessly, too, I thought. If his design was to prevent Clyde from making an avowal of love to Elsie, if he meant so to manage matters that he should have no private interviews with her, I felt that he might as well give it up. That Clyde's love should find open expression ere long, seemed a foregone conclusion. Not that Elsie, consciously, gave him any encouragement. I think she was so absorbed in the effort to take care of her own heart, and in trying to understand the sudden change in Kenneth, that she was totally unaware when Clyde passed the border land of friendship and entered the enchanted domain of love. She did not see that his eyes were opened, and that henceforth there was for him a new heaven and a new earth. His devotion was very sweet to her, and helped her to bear Kenneth's coldness. But she did not translate it aright,—she did not give it its true meaning.
               By this time November had worn away,—not flown away, as the summer months had done,—and it was the 1st of December. Matty had been to the post-office, and returned, bringing a letter with a foreign postmark for Elsie.
               Her eye brightened as she broke the seal and glanced down the first page. "Uncle Howard is coming," she said. "He will be here in Altona three weeks from to-day. He sailed from Queenstown on the 25th."
               That was good news. It was better that Elsie should go away; better for her and better for my other two.
               The next morning, as we were at breakfast, she said,—
               "Aunt Margaret, do not speak of Uncle Howard's letter. I will just pack my trunks and slip away quietly when he comes. I hate leave-takings."
               Two or three days after this, I met Kenneth just outside the gate.
               "Miss Rossiter," he said, abruptly, "when is Miss Meredith going back to New York?"
               "Before a very great while, probably," I answered. "You know her uncle, when he went away, expected to return some time in December."
               He did not say, "Thank God!" but he looked it,—looked it so plainly that on the impulse of the moment I said, half impatiently,—
               "Kenneth Armstrong, if you love Elsie Meredith,—and you gave us all reason at one time to suppose you did,—why do you not tell her so like a man? And if you do not care for her, why do you not keep away from her? You torture her, and you torture yourself, and you torture Clyde."
               He turned white as a sheet,—white to the very lips. But my heart was hardened against him that day, for I had been mentally contrasting the Elsie I had just left in my little parlor—a quiet, saddened woman— with the fair young Elsie who but two months before I had watched in her bright, conscious loveliness, as she stood at her mirror adorning herself for his sake. So I had no pity for him, but went on. I fear I had forgotten the rules I had laid down for myself about not "interfering" between these three.
               "I doubt if you are doing right," I said. "I will not pretend to be able to read you. Sometimes I think that you still love her; sometimes I think that you do not. But you have no right to play with her heart, as a cat plays with a mouse. If, after having taught her to love you, you do not care for her, leave her alone; keep out her way; do not darken her sunshine with your presence. Let Clyde fight his own battles."
               There! it was all out now,—what I had been wanting to say for a month past. I had spoken eagerly, impetuously, in a spasm of sudden heat,—as I must always speak if I said anything of that sort. I had not courage enough to lecture a bearded man, like the one who was looking down upon me, in cool blood.
               A hand fell suddenly upon my arm, compressing it until I shrank with pain.
               "Stop, Miss Rossiter!" he said, in a low, intense voice. "Stop! You do not know what you are talking about. You are as one who beats the air."
               "I know you have no right to put three people to the torture needlessly," I retorted.
               "Needlessly? Would to God that it were needless! But, Miss Rossiter, there is no way of escape for any of us. If there is, I have failed to see it. Prayers and pleadings have been all in vain."
               
               "Kenneth," I persisted, still thinking of the sweet face whose memory blinded my eyes to the deathly pallor of his,—"Kenneth, this seems to me like sheer nonsense. I do not believe in fatalism. If we make mistakes, they are seldom irremediable."
               "I have made no mistakes," he answered, sadly. "I think I have made none. But, oh! aunty," and here his voice softened, growing so tender and beseeching that I could hardly bear it, "do not you distrust me or blame me. I cannot turn aside from the path before me. I did not mark it out for myself; I am not treading it in foolhardy strength and confidence. Miss Rossiter, believe me, I am trying to do right."
               He held out his hand, and I placed mine within it. Yes, I would believe he was "trying to do right." But I still feared he was actuated by some fanciful, exaggerated idea of duty that would not bear the scrutiny of clear-eyed common sense; and I told him so.
               He smiled faintly. "Some time, perhaps, you will know me better," was all he said.
               That night Dennis came in in a great hurry. "Thanks be to God, yer honor," he exclaimed, snatching off his old felt hat with a profound obeisance,—"thanks be to God, yer honor, Patsy is in great distress wid her head, and she wants to know wud you be plased to come over for a bit?"
               Now, one would naturally have supposed that Dennis was giving thanks for poor Patsy's distressing headache,—which was by no means the case. It was only a way he had. He was quite likely, in his own behalf, to thank God for a jumping toothache in precisely the same tone of voice with which he swore at the boys who threw stones at his hens and stole his early watermelons. "Thank God!" was a modified sort of oath with him, much like Deacon Jones's innocent "by thunder!"
               "Yes," I answered; "I will go to her immediately. Has she been sick long?"
               "Indade, yer honor, I'm not able to state with exactness. But, accordin' to the best of me abilities, it was about three o'clock o' the afternoon that she ascinded to her bed-chamber, and she has not left it since, savin' for a few minutes to prepare the tay."
               I found Patsy not dangerously ill, but flushed, feverish, and suffering from neuralgic pains in the head and face.
               "I ain't a-going to be sick," she said, with an involuntary groan, as she rocked back and forth with both hands pressed to her face. "I meant to fight it out and say nothing to nobody. But the pain kept a-growing wuss and wuss, and I thought maybe 'twould kind o' ease off if you'd come and sit here where I could look at you for a spell."
               "You must not look at me at all," I said. "You must undress and go right to bed. Doesn't the room feel chilly? Why haven't you a fire in this bright little stove? or do you keep it for ornament?"
               She laughed, but presently covered her face, and began to moan again. I found plenty of dry wood in her wood-box, and had soon rekindled the fire, which in her heat and feverishness she had neglected.
               
               "Now," I said, "you must go straight to bed, while I go down to the kitchen and make some mustard-plasters and get you a cup of hot tea."
               She protested, but I went. Her kitchen and pantry were like wax-work for neatness, as usual. Dennis was out in the wash-room, regaling himself with his pipe and a newspaper. I saw nothing of the two young masters of the establishment.
               "Dennis," I said, "go over to Cozytoft, quietly, and tell Matty I shall stay here to-night, and ask her to send me the wrapper that hangs in my closet."
               When I went up-stairs again, I told Patsy what I had done. She demurred at first, urging that it was unnecessary, but, finding that remonstrances were useless, gratefully acknowledged, at last, that she had dreaded the long, lonely night.
               "I shall take a pillow and blanket," I said, "and lie here on the lounge, and if you need anything I shall be near at hand. Now, turn over and try to go to sleep while your face is a little easier. I will sit up awhile and attend to the fire. What have you to read up here,—anything?"
               "Yes," she said, "there's a lot o' magazines and things on the closet-shelf; I've got through reading 'em, and was calculating to take 'em down-stairs and put 'em away to-day. It's lucky I didn't."
               What do you think I found on the shelf? The New York Ledger, and diluted literature in the shape of weak "Ladies' Magazines"? By no means. There was a well-thumbed volume of Macaulay's Essays, and two or three other books of that ilk, and sundry odd numbers of "Putnam" for 1855. Patsy had really read much and thought much. She chose strong meat for her diet, not "milk for babes."
               But I was not quite equal to the Essays that night, so I took one of the magazines, and was soon absorbed in that strange story, "My Three Conversations with Miss Chester."
               Patsy was restless, uneasy, and groaned heavily in her fitful sleep. Two hours passed, and I still sat there reading, though my watch pointed to half-past eleven. At last she threw the covering from her shoulders with an energetic air.
               "It's no use," she said; "I may as well get up and play it's morning. This pain drives me 'most crazy."
               "No, no," I answered: "you will take cold if you get up. But isn't there something else that we can try? You are a good nurse, Patsy; tell me what to do for you."
               "If it wa'n't so much trouble," she said. "Sometimes it works, and then again it don't; but anyhow, I guess we won't try it to-night, it's such a fuss."
               "But what is it? Tell me that, Patsy."
               "It's an onion, roasted in the ashes," she said. "That used to be mother's sovereignest cure for the faceache,—bound on, you know, piping hot. But there ain't no sense bothering with it to-night. Patsy's tough, and I guess she can stand it."
               "Where are the onions?"
               "Oh, there ain't any up out o' the cellar, Miss Rossiter. Now, you just hold on."
               But I took the lamp and started off in pursuit of the "sovereignest cure."
               I had on light slippers, and stole noiselessly about the house for fear of disturbing the other sleepers. There was a good bed of hot ashes in the kitchen stove, in which I speedily buried my onion, and sat down to wait for it.
               As I sat there meditating upon Patsy's case, it occurred to me that there was, or used to be, a bottle of laudanum in a certain cupboard, and that it might be well for me to get it to use in case of emergency.
               The dining-room was separated from the kitchen by a narrow passage. Between it and the library was a small room, to which I have taken my reader before, in which the safe was kept. In that room was the cupboard; and thitherward I went in pursuit of the laudanum.
               The doors between these rooms were open, as was usually the case. So was the one from the library into the hall. As I stood at the cupboard, taking down bottle after bottle in search of the right one, I was startled by a stealthy tread upon the stairs, and a sudden glow of light upon the library wall.
               Startled, not because I was frightened,—what was there to be afraid of?—but because, as was but natural at that hour of the night, I was in an unpresentable deshabille. It was one of the young gentlemen, probably, on his way to the kitchen for a glass of water. Without a moment's reflection, I put out my light and drew back into the corner behind the dining-room door, thinking to remain there quietly till the intruder had accomplished his errand and gone up-stairs again.
               The door swung open inward, so that I was still in the "safe-room," as we called it. The stealthy tread drew nearer and nearer, but it did not pass through the room, as I had planned. It paused just in the range of my vision, and Clyde knelt down before the safe and applied a key that he held in his hand to the lock.
               My heart stopped beating. What did this mean? Kenneth, I knew, always carried the key of the safe: he had done so ever since his father died. No one but him had ever unlocked it since that time, and many of the papers had never been disturbed, but lay just where they were placed by the elder Mr. Armstrong's own hands. Why was Clyde there at the dead of night?
               I could see his face distinctly. It wore an eager, excited look, flushing and paling by turns; yet it was stern and determined, even while his hand trembled so that it was with difficulty he adjusted the key to the wards of the lock. But he succeeded at last, and the bolt flew back with a sharp click.
               There was another door, however, and still another, to be unlocked before he could reach the particular portion of the safe in which important documents were kept; and each of them was to be opened in a different way. Clyde was not familiar with the process, and it took him some time. I should have said that I stood there behind the door, trembling like a leaf with excitement and strange dread, for full half an hour before he succeeded in opening the three doors. Probably it was not five minutes.
               The light fell full upon his face as he leaned forward and with eager fingers began searching among the papers. Most of them were labeled, and he merely glanced at them, and laid them back again. At length I thought he looked disheartened and discouraged. The stimulus of success was wanting, and he threw quick glances over his shoulder, as if afraid of his shadow. Evidently he had failed to find what he was looking for.
               In one corner of the safe, deep in shadow, stood a small chest or box fastened with a spring lock. It caught Clyde's roving eye at last, and he pounced upon it, bringing it forward, and placing it upon the carpet at his feet, while his features worked strangely. Here doubtless was the object of his search; but it was still out of reach, for he had not the key to the box.
               He examined the lock, shook it, beat upon the lid with his hand. But it resisted all such idle cajoleries. Then from the depths of one of his pockets he produced a bunch of keys, and tried one after another. The very last one upon the ring fitted, and he raised the cover.
               A smothered but triumphant "ha, ha!" burst involuntarily from his lips as he seized an envelope that lay within, and held it up to the light. I knew it in an instant. It was, of course, the very one that Kenneth had sealed and directed on that never-to-beforgotten night when Mr. Armstrong left us.
               But just then, before he had broken the seal, I became aware by some subtle instinct—for I could not see him—that Kenneth had entered the library. Clyde felt his presence, too, and turned with a low cry of anger and dismay, that was almost like the snarl of an animal balked of its prey, just in time to meet his cool gray eyes as he crossed the threshold.
               As Kenneth caught sight of the envelope in Clyde's hand, his cheeks blanched, and his lips were compressed until only a thread of crimson was visible. Stepping quickly forward, before his brother had time to resist him, he quietly removed the paper from his grasp and thrust it into his own bosom. But as Clyde sprang to his feet with a muttered oath, and confronted him with blazing eyes and the front of Mars himself, he spoke to him as calmly and kindly, and with a manner as free from heat and passion, as if they had been training vines together in the conservatory.
               The brothers had evidently both been in bed. They shared the same room; and doubtless, while Kenneth slept, Clyde had stolen down to prosecute his investigations. But he had not been rapid enough in his movements, and Kenneth's vigilance had thwarted him.
               "What are you doing, Clyde?" he asked, quietly. "I am astonished to find you here at this hour of the night. Where did you get the key?"
               "In your pocket, sir!" cried Clyde, wrathfully. "You need not look at me in that way. I am no thief or meddler. My right to my father's papers is as good as yours. I ask no leave or license of you to open this safe."
               "I am sorry you took all this unnecessary trouble," said Kenneth, very gently. "You have not dealt fairly with me, Clyde. You have never given me the slightest hint that you wished to examine these papers. I would have opened the safe for you any day. I will look them all over with you to-morrow, if you wish."
               "All? all? Will you show me the one that you snatched from me,—the one you have in your bosom?" he cried, with an intensity of passion that I cannot describe to you. "That is the one I want: the only one I care for; the one you brought here the night our father died,—even before he was cold, and before you had come to me in my agony and told me he was dead. Why have you never spoken to me of that paper, Kenneth Armstrong? There should be no such secrets between brothers. If all your dealings have been open and fair and honest, why have you not told me of its existence?"
               "'Open and fair and honest'! What do you mean, Clyde?" cried Kenneth, for once thrown off his balance. "Who has been poisoning you against me? Who told you about this paper? I have never mentioned it to a living soul."
               "That's the very thing I complain of," said Clyde, tauntingly. "You should have mentioned it. Am I not John Armstrong's son? What right have you to his papers that I do not possess also? I will see that document, Kenneth. If you will not show it to me of your own free will, the law shall compel you to do so."
               "You are beside yourself, Clyde. That paper is one of which the law can take no cognizance. It has nothing to do with it. You have nothing to do with it. It belongs solely to me; given to me by my father's own hand. I placed it here for safe-keeping ing, as he told me to; but it has no connection whatever with the papers relating to the estate."
               "What is it, then?" said Clyde, with smothered fury in his tones. "What is it? Do you expect me to believe this mysterious story without any proof of its truth? Do you mean to say that the paper you have kept concealed so long is not—our father's will?"
               "Oh, Clyde! Clyde!" cried Kenneth, "how can you be so cruel to me, so unjust to your better self? Our father's will? He made none, Clyde. We two were all he had, and he wished that there should be no division of the estate. 'It is all yours and Clyde's,' he said that night. 'There are no debts. You two are my natural heirs, and all I have is yours.' Was not that enough? He loved us both so tenderly; and he wished us to live together, bound by closest ties, with one roof to shelter us, until the day of our death. This was the last wish that he expressed. But we thwart his will as entirely by living in a state of discord as we should by parting ourselves asunder as far as the east is from the west. Oh, Clyde, be satisfied, and trust me even as he did!"
               But Clyde's face did not soften. "It all rests with yourself," he said. "Show me that paper, and I will be satisfied. There can have been no secrets between our father and you in which I am not concerned. The idea is preposterous. I demand equal knowledge with yourself as to the contents of that paper; and as sure as there is a God in heaven I will have it. You cannot thwart me always, strong as you think yourself."
               
               Clyde's first fury had subsided. As he made this demand, with his clear, undaunted eyes fixed upon Kenneth's pale face, I thought I had never seen such dignity and grandeur in his bearing. Whether he was right or wrong in his suspicions, it was evident that he believed with all his soul that he had been grossly injured by Kenneth, and, perhaps, by the dead father who had been so dear to him; that he had indeed been "wounded in the house of his friends."
               For a moment or two there was silence between them. At length Kenneth said, returning Clyde's steady gaze with one equally steady,—
               "Clyde, have I ever lied to you?"
               There was no answer; but Clyde's mouth lost a little of its fixed rigidity.
               "Answer me truly, Clyde, I implore you, by all the hallowed memories of our childhood. Have I ever lied to you in all my life long?"
               The reply was so low as to be scarcely audible, but it was emphatic.
               "No."
               "Then, believe me, I shall not begin now. I tell you the entire truth, my brother, when I say to you that I am as ignorant as you of the nature of the paper that has so disturbed you. I have never read it. I have never been told what it contains."
               Clyde's countenance hardened again. "You cannot expect me to believe that. It is too absurd, too melodramatic. The envelope is addressed in your own handwriting. It is sealed with your own seal. Now you ask me to believe that you know nothing whatever of its contents. It is too much Kenneth. My reason forbids me to believe it."
               Kenneth's face flushed hotly, and he laid his hand heavily upon Clyde's shoulder. "You must believe it, Clyde. You shall not leave this spot until I make you believe it. See here!" And he took the envelope from his breast. "That is my handwriting, is it? and that is my seal? Well, I own it. I have no thought of denying it. But now—nay, take it in your own hands: I give you full permission—tear off that envelope and see what you will find beneath it. Tear it off, I say!" he repeated; for Clyde, overawed by the sudden change in his brother's manner, and by his rapid, impetuous speech, was holding the envelope idly in his hand, and glancing from it to Kenneth's face with anxious, troubled eyes. "Tear it off, I say!"
               He was obeyed at last, but Clyde's fingers trembled so that they could scarcely perform their office. Within the outer envelope was another, closely sealed. As it met his eye, Clyde cowered like a whipped child, and covered his face with his hands. The paper dropped at Kenneth's feet.
               He picked it up, and held it before Clyde's eyes, forcibly removing his hands. But now he spoke gently, even tenderly.
               "Whose handwriting is that, Clyde? Whose seal is that? Did I forge the one and surreptitiously use the other? You know better. You know that no eye has seen the paper that lies folded within this envelope since our dead father's rested upon it as he placed it there. He gave it to me that night, Clyde, sealed as you see it now. He did not tell me what it was. He only placed it in my special keeping, and told me that if certain contingencies arose years hence, I was at liberty to open it. He told me also to place it in another envelope, to direct it to 'Kenneth Armstrong,' to seal it with my own seal, and to write upon it an order that in case of my death it should be burned unopened. I obeyed him to the letter, and at the earliest possible moment. You stand here as my judge to-night, Clyde. Did I do right or wrong?"
               Clyde did not answer, but his mien had lost all its loftiness, and all its bravado as well. His head drooped toward Kenneth. The stronger nature was once more gaining the ascendancy over the weaker.
               "He did not tell me, in so many words, to keep silent about the matter. But he placed this trust in my hands. Was I to begin babbling of it at the very start? Speak to me, Clyde. This must be settled once for all. It never must come up between us two again. Tell me, did I do right or wrong?"
               Clyde's lips moved, but no sound was to be heard. Kenneth bent his head and listened intently.
               "Answer me, Clyde. This must be settled. Right or wrong?"
               "Right," he answered, feebly,—but he did not lift his eyes to his brother's face. It seemed as if he dared not.
               Kenneth clasped him to his heart in an embrace that was at once tender and strong. His face was radiant with joy ineffable. Even so do the angels in heaven rejoice over us when, having been tempted and misled, we turn again to the friend that sticketh closer than a brother.
               "God bless you, Clyde!" he whispered. "We must trust each other, we must cling to each other, even unto the end. There is no other salvation for us."
               They stood silent, heart to heart, for a moment or two. Then Clyde raised his head.
               "Kenneth," he said, "I ought to make amends for suspicions that I now see were a grievous wrong to you. I wish I could do something to make you very happy, to pay for all this."
               The dark gray eyes lightened, and I think he spoke from a sudden impulse with which reason had little to do.
               "Clyde," he said, "is there not something else that has come between us lately?"
               "I—don't know," was the faltered reply. "What is it?"
               Kenneth bent forward and whispered something in Clyde's ear that brought the quick blood mounting to his face. It was like the leaping up of a sudden flame.
               "You have felt that I came in between you and her," he went on,—"that I strove to keep you apart, and to throw hindrances in your way. Is it not so, Clyde? And it steeled your heart against me."
               Clyde gave one quick, passionate cry as he threw himself again upon Kenneth's breast.
               "It did! it did!" he cried. "I have seen that my love for her was utterly distasteful to you, and that you would be glad to thwart it. But I cannot believe it even yet, Kenneth, when you know her to be what she is! Indeed, I fancied once, before I dreamed of loving her myself, that you might give her to me as a sister some day. Oh, Kenneth, you have put me to the torture!"
               Kenneth passed his hand tenderly over the thick, wavy locks that touched his shoulder. "My poor Clyde!" he murmured; "if I could only have spared you!"
               Then, after a little, he went on, speaking slowly and deliberately, like one who was, as it were, feeling his way through a labyrinth of perplexing thought.
               "I hoped that this would prove to be but a boyish fancy, Clyde; that I could ward off the danger from you, and from her, without the necessity of speaking one word upon this subject. But I have seen, latterly, that it was impossible."
               He hesitated,—and when he spoke again his voice was almost inaudible. It was the voice of one in extremity.
               "Clyde, you said you wished you could do something to make me happy. You can lift from my heart the heaviest burden it has ever borne, if you will promise me never to speak a word of love to Elsie Meredith."
               Clyde reeled in Kenneth's arms like a drunken man. "I cannot do it!" he cried. "It is too cruel, too unjust, when she is everything that you ought to honor and admire. I cannot give her up to gratify a mere caprice of yours."
               "It is no caprice," said Kenneth, sadly. "I ask nothing for which I have not a reason. But, Clyde, you are very young yet; so young that it is hardly to be believed that this is the one grand passion of your life. If you will be content to leave the matter in abeyance for awhile, I think this early love of yours will pass away like a dream."
               "It is not so! it is not so!" was the answer. "You know nothing about it, Kenneth. You are yourself so cold, so passionless, that you have no conception of what love is when it glows in a heart like mine. Why, to win Elsie Meredith I would crush every other hope beneath my feet; to reach her I would trample every other heart in the universe into the dust."
               "Is it so, my boy?" asked Kenneth, gazing mournfully into the flashing yet tearful eyes that were upturned to his. "Is it so? Then may God help us all! But, Clyde, I ask you to do nothing that I have not done myself. You think me cold, passionless,—but you know nothing of my life. Once—it is no matter when or where—I placed my own heart beneath my feet and trampled on its dearest, holiest love. I had to do it, Clyde; but, crushed and bleeding, the love lives yet, and will live—eternally."
               Clyde raised one hand and passed it over Kenneth's face with a woman's caressing touch. "My poor Kenneth!" he said. "But you—you are strong; you are brave to bear and to endure—and—you do not feel as I do. We are differently constituted. I—I could not give up a love. It would be impossible!"
               "Not if duty demanded it?"
               "Not if ten thousand duties stood in the way, glaring at me with their angry eyes. Kenneth, I tell you plainly, and once for all, no power in heaven or on earth shall keep me from marrying Elsie Meredith, if she will be my wife."
               Kenneth bowed his head. Was it in acquiescence or despair? I could not tell which.
               When he spoke again, it was in a hoarse, changed voice.
               "You must go back to bed at once," he said. "You are fearfully excited."
               He paused for a moment, raising his hand as in the act of benediction. "May God give us his peace, dear Clyde!" he continued. "I begin to think it a better gift, and a rarer one, than joy: his blessed peace."
               He looked as if he needed it. Clyde glanced at the open safe.
               "Go," said Kenneth. "I will lock it."
               But Clyde still hesitated,—lingering at his brother's side.
               "Kenneth," he whispered, at last, "I must take my own course in this matter,—but I shall never distrust you again—never!"
               "Until the next time," was the involuntary reply. "Well, I can do no more, Clyde. I must leave you in God's hands. Good-night."
               Kenneth locked the safe, and pretty soon his feet sounded up the stairs, and I was left in darkness.
               I stole out to the kitchen, found a match, and relighted my lamp. Alas for the poor onion! I took the remains of it from the ashes, and went up to Patsy.
               All was quiet, and she was sleeping peacefully in a restful, health-giving sleep. I did not disturb her, but lay upon the lounge until the gray dawn shone dimly in the east. Then I rose softly and went home.
               No one ever knew what I saw and heard that night. You, O reader, are my first confidant.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               I WONDER if it was fore-ordained that I should tell this story? At all events, my good angels took care that there should be no hindrances, no broken links, in case I ever did tell it. If there was a character upon earth that I regarded with utter detestation, it was that of a gossiping, meddling Paul Pry, of either sex. Yet it seemed as if the persistent efforts of the most malicious eavesdropper, the most cunning spy, would not have enabled him to hear and see what, without any volition on my part, was being continually thrust upon me. Listen to what happened the next morning.
               About the middle of the forenoon I went over to inquire after Patsy and to see if I could help her in any way. We were in the habit of interchanging neighborly kind offices. Until Elsie came to me, I had kept no servant for many years. Living by myself in the most convenient of cottages, with everything just where and just as I wanted it, I had found it more pleasant to wait on myself than to have some one continually in my way to do it for me. But many a time during the years she had lived at Greyholt holt, when I had not been well or when I had been particularly busy, Patsy had come to the rescue with her willing heart and strong hands. So now I went to see what I could do for her.
               She "slept like a top," she said, after I went down for the onion. The very mention of her mother's remedy must have cured her, for she did not awake until late in the morning. But she looked worn and tired. The severe pain of the previous day had told even upon her strong frame, and seeing that she was about to make some pastry, the materials for which were all ready upon the broad white shelf beneath the pantry window, I insisted that she should go to her room and lie down, while I made the pies. She consented, after much demurring; and, rolling up my sleeves, I was soon deep in the mysteries of butter, flour, jigging-irons, and mince-meat.
               The blinds were closed, the slats being turned enough to admit the light, and the window was let down from the top. It was a bright, sunny day. No snow had yet fallen, excepting a few flakes that melted as they fell. Snowbirds and chickadees and a few tame pigeons were hopping about the yard, picking up the crumbs Patsy had thrown to them, or hunting among the shrubbery for seeds and insects. A great peacock strutted bravely in the sunshine, spreading his magnificent tail and calling upon his whole small world to admire him. A few feet off, through the glass windows—or walls—of the conservatory, I could see the tiny fountain throw up its silver jets, and catch tantalizing glimpses of dark-green leaves contrasting with brilliant scarlets, pure blues, warm oranges, clear whites, and glowing crimsons. How peaceful and serene it all seemed! It was hard to think that even into this Eden the serpent had entered, leaving evil and sorrow behind him.
               Just then, as, with a plate poised upon one hand, I was about to cut the undercrust into its appointed shape, Kenneth and Clyde came round the corner and stopped beneath the window, ostensibly to watch the birds, to whom they had thrown a handful of buckwheat. I was about to tap upon the pane with my floury fingers, when I remembered that it had always seemed to annoy them if they happened to see me doing anything like "housework" inside their doors. If they had seen my occupation, they would at once have started off in pursuit of a girl, saying that if Patsy was not well enough to do the work she must consent to have more help; which would have broken her heart, as her disability was not likely to be of long duration. So for her sake I kept silent, although I longed to throw back the blinds and threaten to make each of them a "turnover" with plenty of raisins in it.
               They began to talk presently, but in such low tones that I heard only the murmur of their voices. I rattled the dishes, dropped a fork, and put down the flour-pan with unnecessary noise, in order to convey to them an intimation that some one was within hearing; but gradually their tones grew more and more distinct.
               "I thought last night that I should never mention this subject again," said Kenneth. "But, oh, Clyde, I cannot help it. I must make one more effort to save you."
               "To save me from what?" And there was a sharp metallic ring in Clyde's voice that argued ill for the cause his brother was pleading. "To save me from what? One would think I were about to throw myself into the embraces of that terrible maiden we read of in the old chronicles, whose iron arms contracted slowly about her shuddering, writhing victims, folding them closer and closer in cruel mockery of love, until death put an end to their torment. To save me from what, Kenneth? Speak out, man!"
               "From endless regret, and, it may be, from the bitterness of remorse. And"—his voice faltered, and it was a moment or two before he went on—"to save her from life-long sorrow."
               "I am willing to take all the risks," Clyde answered, coolly. "'Regrets'! 'Remorse'! Does a man regret that he has reached heaven? Does conscience scourge him because he is blest beyond his deserts? What do you mean, Kenneth? Do you think me about to commit incest, or some horrible crime of a kindred nature? 'A man may not marry his grandmother.' Perhaps you have been studying up the genealogies of our respective families, and have discovered that Elsie Meredith holds that revered relationship to me?" And he laughed scornfully.
               "No, Clyde," was the answer. "Genealogy does not touch the question—in that way. But, oh, my brother, I tell you once again that there are weighty reasons why you should not seek to make this girl your wife. I cannot tell you what they are. I have swornnot to do it. But for our father's sake, for my sake, for God's sake, I implore you to listen to my warning before it is too late."
               "Perhaps, if you are so deeply in earnest, you had better try to win the young lady over to your side, and make an accomplice of her," said Clyde, sarcastically. "If you should appeal to her, your eloquence might not fail of its desired effect."
               "I shall not do that, Clyde. You need not fear that I shall ever mention this matter to her. It has been hard enough to speak to you, and to feel that my motives would probably be misunderstood, and I myself be charged with cruelty and wanton caprice. I shall never speak of it to her."
               "I can see but one cause for your anxiety on this point, Kenneth," said Clyde, after a long pause. "If I were to die without other heirs, this estate would all be yours."
               My very heart stopped beating. That insinuation on Clyde's part was too cruel. How would Kenneth bear it? But when he spoke there was no anger, no resentment, in his voice.
               "You are more likely to be my heir than I am to be yours," he said; "I shall go wifeless and childless to my grave, Clyde. There is but little doubt of that; and assuredly I have never given you reason to think me grasping or avaricious. But what evil spirit has taken possession of you, thus filling your heart with jealousies and suspicions of your best friend? Last night I thought I had slain my dragon; but he has a thousand lives."
               "It is your own fault," was the reply. "You never will slay your dragon while you deal in mysteries. If instead of talking Greek you would express yourself in plain English, I might listen to you. But you will never frighten me with bug-a-boo stories—or with hints of stories—that might be told. Scarecrows lost all their terrors for me years ago. Tell me why it is that I must not, or should not, marry Elsie Meredith, and I will promise,—not to give her up, mind you,—but to take the matter into fair consideration."
               Kenneth drew a long breath that was almost like a groan. "I cannot tell you that, Clyde, although I admit the apparent justice of your demand. Some time, if you are patient,—or if you are not,—you will know. It may, perhaps, be only when you have passed beyond the veil, and look back upon this life with eyes that see clearly all its pitfalls, all its dangers. You will do me justice then, if you cannot now."
               The faltering voice touched Clyde. It was only the surface of his nature, after all, that had been disturbed by Tom Bradshaw's artful insinuations. Away down deep in his heart there was unshaken confidence in Kenneth. It was the one rock upon which he leaned. Do I make you comprehend this, in the face of all his bitter words, his jealousy and distrust? Ah! you are happy indeed, if there has been nothing in the relations of your soul to its best Friend that can furnish the counterpart to this picture. We doubt, and wonder, and question, and refuse to take God's word, still demanding of him the reason why,—even when we know that he is infinitely wise and infinitely tender,—even when we feel that our trust in him is our only rock of refuge.
               "I did not really mean what I said about the heir-ship, Kenneth. It was the echo of another's thought, to which I should not have given expression. Forgive me!"
               I knew they had clasped hands, although I could not see them.
               "I can forgive you—even unto the seventy times seven," said Kenneth, at last. "But, oh, Clyde, you try me sorely, sorely; and the trial is renewed day by day."
               Then, in the pause that followed, a sudden thought seemed forced upon him.
               "'The echo of another's thought,' you said. Whose thought, Clyde? Tell me that; for you owe it to me."
               But there was no answer.
               "Whose thought?" he repeated. "Who is striving to make mischief between you and me? It cannot be Miss Rossiter. Yet she went with me to the safe when I put the paper there the night our father died,—and no one else knew of it."
               This was the very conclusion to which I had feared he would come. I had felt that he had every reason to suspect my prudence, my integrity. Would Clyde exonerate me? I listened intently.
               "It was not she, Kenneth. Believe me, it was not she!" he answered, earnestly.
               "Who was it, then? I have a right to demand this, Clyde. Who is it that is striving to sow the seeds of bitterness between us?"
               
               If Clyde would only tell him! But he did not. He persistently refused to tell, and Kenneth was too wise to press the matter beyond certain bounds. As they passed from beneath the window, Clyde said,—
               "I would make any other sacrifice to please you, Kenneth. I would pluck out my right eye, or cut off my right hand, if you demanded it. But I cannot give up the chance—it is only a chance, for she may not listen to my suit—of winning Elsie Meredith. Could you do it, Kenneth? If you loved her as I do, could you give up the hope of one day making her your wife,—the dear hope of calling her yours, your very own,—without one effort to woo and win her? Could you do that, Kenneth?"
               They had paused again, still near the window, but out from the shadow of the house, where the strong sunlight illumined the face of each. Kenneth's grew white, even to the lips, while Clyde was speaking.
               "Yes," he said, as with a painful effort. "I could do even that, for your sake, Clyde."
               "Then you never dreamed what love is," was the answer. "Love is a law unto itself. It does not stop to think of duties and sacrifices. It does not weigh and measure. It gives all; it dares all; it demands all. You do not know what love is, Kenneth, and it makes me impatient to hear you talk about it."
               "Perhaps I do not," was the response, made sadly and wearily. "Perhaps I do not. But we will not discuss the matter. You must take your own course, for I see that no words of mine are of any avail."
               They passed out of sight, and I heard no more.
               "It is a victory that will have to be won over again to-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow." This was what Kenneth had said to me weeks ago. Surely events were proving the truth of his words.
               From that day there was a change in Kenneth. It seemed to me that he had ceased to struggle, or, in the matter of Elsie, to oppose his will to Clyde's. He had done all, said all, that he could. Henceforth affairs must take their own course.
               But there was no bitterness, no pharisaical "washing of hands" with him. He was, if that were possible, tenderer of Clyde than ever. If there was also a deep, manly tenderness in his manner toward Elsie, she did not seem to notice it. The girl had taught herself to look upon their past as dead and buried. She hoped for no resurrection; and if sometimes the pale clay seemed to move a little, and the grave-clothes in which it was bound to stir, as if there was life beneath, she evidently regarded it as a mere vagary of her own imagination. I could see that she was fast teaching her heart to believe that Kenneth had never cared for her.
               And, meanwhile, at the very moment when her sensitive womanly pride was quivering with pain at the thought that she had misconstrued him and taken for love what had been mere liking; when she was reproaching herself for indulging in the dream that had brightened the summer days for her, Clyde came to her, laying his heart at her feet. Many a girl has accepted one lover in a fit of pique at the desertion or inconstancy of another. Would Elsie do this,—thus striving to prove to Kenneth that she had cared for him as little as he for her? Or would she really be able to transfer her affection from one brother to the other?
               I could not tell. I think we all sat with hushed hearts, waiting—just waiting—to see what the days would bring forth; Elsie as well as the rest of us. She liked Clyde Armstrong. They had much in common. There was a similarity of tastes between the two that had made them much to each other as companions and friends. She had just awakened to a sense of her great need of love. It is a knowledge that, sooner or later, must come to every woman; and to her it had come through pain and anguish. Almost with the knowledge of the need had come the love,—a full, golden cup, brimming over with the ruby wine. Would she drink, and so find peace?
               Clyde showed a marvelous patience,—a patience he had never been known to manifest before. Always, hitherto, whatever he wanted he must grasp at once. Now, in a moment, love seemed to have taught him the wisdom of the serpent. Or else—and perhaps this supposition was nearer the truth—he 
                     
                        "feared his fate too much,
                        And dared not put it to the touch
                        To gain or lose it all."
                     
                  
               
               Kenneth and Clyde had both been in, one afternoon, on their way up from the post-office, and had brought me my mail. There was a letter for Elsie also.
               "Dr. Bellinger's handwriting, and the New York postmark," said Clyde, as he gave it to her. "So he must have got home. I wonder if he came in on the Scotia last Saturday?"
               "Probably," she answered. She hesitated for a moment, and then broke the seal.
               "And when is he coming up?" asked Clyde, while his cheeks flushed a little. "Very soon, I suppose?"
               "Yes," she said, evasively. "Before a great while." Then she refolded the letter, which was a short one, and slipped it into her pocket, merely adding, "He had a very pleasant passage, Aunt Margaret, if it was in the winter."
               Snow had fallen a day or two before, and the roads were in fine condition.
               "You will soon be going home, then," said Clyde, with a little touch of sadness in his voice. "How is it about that sleigh-ride? We were to have one, you know, and the moon is at the full to-night. It will be almost as light as day. Shall I bring the Brownie round at seven o'clock with the full complement of furs and sleigh-bells?" 
                     
                        "'Keeping time, time, time,
                        In a sort of Runic rhyme,
                        To the tintinnabulation that so musically swells
                        From the bells, bells, bells, bells,
                        Bells, bells, bells,—
                        From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells,' etc.?"
                     
                   she said, with a half laugh. "It sets one's blood dancing, does it not? But I think we will not go to-night, Clyde. It is very cold, and I am not just in the mood."
               Did she read, as I did, a secret in Clyde's eyes? If she did, she did not gain much by staying at home; for that evening he came, and came alone.
               I was in the dining-room, busy about some little matter. Elsie was in the parlor, touching her guitar softly, and crooning low, tender songs as she sat in the glow of the fire-light. I can hear the quaint refrain even now, as it floated out to me through the open door: 
                     
                        "For men must work, and women must weep,
                        And the sooner 'tis over, the sooner to sleep,—
                        And good-by to the bar and its moaning!"
                     
                  
               
               My young neighbors were in the habit of coming in without any ceremony; especially of an evening, when they were very sure of finding us in the parlor. So when I heard Clyde's step in the hall, I kept on with my work, assured that he would speedily find his way into the warm, fire-lighted room where Elsie was singing.
               She came out to me presently, with a scarlet flush upon her cheeks, and a disturbed, anxious look in her soft eyes.
               "Come in the other room; do, Aunt Margaret!" she said, in a quick whisper. "I want you; I can't do without you."
               "Pretty soon," I answered; "but I have just arranged this pattern, after great tribulation, and must finish cutting out my work first. I will come before long."
               It was better that I should stay where I was. If Clyde had anything to say, it might as well be said at one time as at another; the sooner the better, I thought.
               Elsie hesitated for a moment; then went slowly back to the parlor, leaving the door wide open. In another minute I heard her talking with great animation and fluency about some book she had just been reading,—a book for which, as I happened to know, she did not care a straw.
               Clyde rose quietly and shut the door. For half an hour there was a low, continuous murmur of voices in the other room. I could distinguish Clyde's, raised at times in passionate supplication and entreaty; Elsie's, earnest, subdued, compassionate. Alas, poor Clyde! I was very sure how it would end, and my whole heart yearned over him in unutterable love and pity, even while I felt that his impulsive, stormy nature was one upon which no woman could ever rest in trust and confidence. Elsie could give him pity, sympathy, a quiet, sisterly affection; all these, indeed, she had given him. But I felt in my very soul that night, that she could not give him the love for which he sought. It was not Kenneth that came between them; it would have been just the same if he had never been born. Yet I doubt if she was fully conscious of this until the demand was made. There are some questions that a woman's heart refuses to answer when she questions it herself.
               I grew uneasy as the minutes rolled on. They had talked long enough. Should I go in and interrupt them? I had finished cutting out my work, after ruining one sleeve by turning the figure wrong end up; and if I kept my promise to Elsie, I must join them.
               
               But just then there was a stir, a movement of chairs, a rising. Clyde was going.
               They went out into the hall. The door into the dining-room stood ajar. They did not notice it, or they did not care; it may have been either.
               "I cannot regard this as final," said Clyde, in a voice that he vainly strove to render calm. "I will not so regard it. Oh, Elsie! Elsie!" he cried, in intense, passionate whispers, "I will compass heaven and earth to win you! I cannot resign the blessed hope of calling you mine,—my own, my love, my wife! The fourteen years that Jacob served for Rachel would seem but as a day if at the end I might claim you. Only say that you will not steel your heart against me,—only give me one word of hope,—and my love shall work miracles to make me worthy of you."
               Elsie was weeping; a little storm of sobs and sighing swept in through the open door, as her singing had before.
               "Oh, Clyde! do not say any more," she said. "I cannot bear it. I would love you if I could. I wanted to love you, and that is why, when the knowledge of this first dawned upon me,—only a little while ago,—I did not at once repulse it. I wanted to love you, Clyde. But now that you have spoken, there is not one fibre of my being that answers to your call. My heart tells me this so plainly that I dare not ignore its warning."
               "But I will make you love me!" he cried. "The strength of my love shall draw you to me in spite of yourself." Then in soft, pleading tones he added, "I know I am not worthy of you, Elsie. I know I am high-tempered, passionate, capricious, and that my life has thus far been spent to little purpose. But it shall not be so in the future. For your sake I will do battle with Apollyon. For your sake I will make myself a king among men, and only your hand shall crown me."
               "Worthiness has nothing to do with it," she answered, very sadly; "though a woman may well doubt whether a man will do for her sake what he has not done for God's. But words are of no avail, Clyde. It is enough that I feel I can never give you the love you seek. Less than that would not content you; and I could not wrong my womanhood by giving it, even if it would."
               "Would not content me!" he exclaimed, grasping at a straw, and ignoring her last sentence. "Oh, Elsie! the least crumb from your hand will content me. I do not ask that you should love me as you would love a nobler, better man. But I am starving,—famishing: do not turn me away empty."
               Poor boy!—for he seemed to my forty-five years hardly more than that,—could he not see that every word he spoke was increasing the distance between them?
               "Say no more," she said, with a serious dignity in her voice and mien. "Say no more, Clyde, for I cannot listen. The man who wins my love must be able to command it. He must come as a king, not as a beggar. But let us part as friends, dear friends. Believe me, I have given you all I can."
               I got up and went out into the hall. If Clyde did not like the interruption I could not help it. For both their sakes it was time that he was gone.
               Elsie stood at the foot of the stairs, leaning against the baluster. Clyde had dropped upon the lower step, and, with his hand clasping hers, was looking up in her face beseechingly. Their relative positions, their very attitudes, were significant. Even so, had they been man and wife, would he have sat always at her feet; even so would he have looked up to her for guidance and direction. There are women who might have been content and happy in such a relationship; but not so Elsie Meredith.
               He rose when he saw me, and a faint attempt at a smile hovered about his mouth for a moment. He passed his hand across his forehead, and looked about him with a half-bewildered air. Then, as if thought and memory had come back to him, he turned to Elsie.
               "You are not banishing me?" he said. "I may come to see you again?"
               "Certainly," she answered. "I hope we shall be friends always, Clyde."
               He took the hand she had extended, clasped it in both his for an instant, and bowed his forehead upon it. Then he groped blindly toward the door.
               I opened it for him without a word. Perhaps he knew it, and perhaps he did not. But I think he was quite unconscious of my presence.
               As the door closed upon him, Elsie flew up-stairs. In any extremity of feeling, whether of joy or sorrow, she always sought solitude; and I did not seek to stay her.
               I drew aside the muslin curtain that shaded one of the long, narrow windows by the side of the door, and looked out. It was, as Clyde had prophesied, as light as day. A dark figure, wrapped in a long cloak, was pacing back and forth outside the gate.
               It was Kenneth.
               Clyde stood for a moment upon the piazza, leaning against one of the pillars; then he staggered down the snow-covered path. Kenneth saw him coming, and one glance told him the whole story. Letting the gate swing to behind him with a sharp clang, he strode swiftly up the path to meet him, and folded him in an embrace so close that Clyde dropped his head upon his shoulder like a tired child.
               There was a little iron settee under a tree near the gate. I saw Kenneth place Clyde there; I saw him chafe his cold hands, and press handfuls of snow to his lips and forehead. But I did not go out to them. They were better off alone.
               After a few moments, Clyde rose to his feet, and Kenneth, taking off his cloak, wrapped it about him. Then the two brothers, the one supported by the other, went slowly up the hill, under the leafless boughs of the maples, to their own house.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               CLYDE had protested against sentence of banishment, and Elsie had told him, in effect, that she had no desire to pronounce such a sentence, and that she hoped they might be friends in the future as they had been in the past. Nevertheless, I was surprised when, the next afternoon, he walked in with an air as careless and unembarrassed as usual. I do not mean that he showed no traces of the conflict of the previous night. He looked older: there were shadows about his eyes. There was an unconscious drooping of the eyelids, a tension about the mouth, that spoke of suffering and unrest. But he approached Elsie with the same ease, the same frank, open friendliness that had always characterized his manner toward her. He had not, in the least, the bearing of a rejected lover. She looked disturbed when he entered the room; an expression of doubt and dread swept over her face, and the color deepened on her cheek; while about him there was no unpleasant consciousness, no sign of embarrassment. What did it mean? Had he made up his mind to accept the situation manfully, to give up the struggle, and, his troubled spirit making no sign, to go back silently to their old friendly relations? All I knew of Clyde Armstrong forbade me to believe this. Not so would he receive this blow; not so would he submit to the downfall of his hopes.
               In Kenneth I could perceive but little change. He was very quiet, as he had been for weeks. Knowing as I did that he had tried to prevent Clyde from making an avowal of his love, it was but natural that I should look for some evidence of relief or satisfaction when his suit was rejected. But if it was there, I failed to discover it. He simply devoted himself to Clyde, soul and body, as he had so long done. To Elsie his demeanor was precisely what it was before: sincere, kindly, courteous, but with the "thus far and no farther" that had so effectually sundered them, as clearly marked, as decided as ever.
               Dr. Bellinger came in due time. Elsie would fain have persuaded him to return the next day; but he demurred.
               "No, no, child," he said, drawing her upon his knee. "No, no; don't be in a hurry. I want to see Altona in her winter glory. It is always well to make the most of one's opportunities, Miss Meredith," he added, with the air of a philosopher, "and I want to make the most of mine. I may not have such another chance in thirty years to come. Margaret," turning to me with a quick, enthusiastic gesture, "I thought to-day, as I was coming up through these valleys and under these hills, that in all the wanderings of three decades my eyes had rested upon no fairer land."
               "Three decades!" I repeated. "It is not possible that it is thirty years since you left Altona, Dr. Bellinger?"
               "But it is quite possible," he answered. "I was a boy of twenty then. I am fifty years old, Miss Rossiter!"
               "Poor old uncle!" said Elsie, passing her hand through his now silvered locks, and smiling into his fine, thoughtful face. I was about to say unfurrowed face, but, upon second thoughts, I repent me. Time had done its own chiseling upon it, and there were lines upon the broad forehead and about the firm, steadfast mouth that had not been there in his boyhood. He had thought too much, felt too much, lived too much, to have retained the smooth roundness of his youth. "Poor old uncle!" she said, "what a decrepit veteran he is getting to be! Half a century old! Doesn't he want an ear-trumpet, or a new cushion for his gouty foot?"
               He pinched her ear, and then, springing from his seat with her in his arms, he carried his laughing burden across the room and made a feint of seating her upon the mantel-piece.
               "'Decrepit veteran'! 'gouty foot'!" he exclaimed, fiercely, as she struggled to escape from him. "I'll teach you a lesson or two to-morrow, Miss Meredith. We'll walk up the old turnpike to the top of Bluff Hill, and look off. Which will first cry 'hold,—enough'? You or I?"
               She made him a merry answer. The excitement of his coming, her delight at seeing the man who had for years stood to her in the place of a father, had brought a glad light to her eyes and made her seem more like her old self than she had for many weeks. I flattered myself that Dr. Bellinger would not observe the change that was so perceptible to me. But that evening, when she had left the room on some trifling errand, he turned to me gravely.
               "What have you been doing to my little girl up here, Miss Rossiter? She is not at all the same child—or woman—that I brought here last June."
               I made some confused, incoherent observations relating to the great changes, both in mind and body, that, in certain stages of development, a few months would often bring about.
               "Tut, tut!" he said, worried out of his usual calm gentlemanliness. "It is not that. Elsie is a woman,—past the age for such sudden changes. Something is wrong with her, physically or spiritually; I am not quite sure which. I expected to find her as round and rosy as that little damsel of yours who baked the muffins for tea. What's the trouble, Margaret? What has she been about?"
               "I cannot tell you, Dr. Bellinger," I said, in a voice that would tremble a little. "I have tried to take good care of her; but you know——"
               He interrupted me hastily. "I know I am not such a brute as to think otherwise," he said. "I knew just what a warm, love-lighted home I was bringing her to, and just what brooding, motherly care you would give her, before I placed her under your roof. But I am perplexed and troubled, Margaret. Elsie has changed very much. She seems to me to have stepped suddenly from light-hearted girlhood into mature, thoughtful womanhood. She makes an effort to blind me, and to assume with me her old frolicsome ways. But the disguise is thin, and my eyes pierce through it; I see the suffering underneath the smiles."
               I was thankful that Elsie's return to the parlor just then prevented the necessity of a reply.
               
               The next day the two were gone for hours. I think Dr. Bellinger became satisfied, by the time they had climbed Bluff Hill and ascended to the top of Wetherby's Ledge, that Elsie was not a prey to consumption or any other bodily ailment. She came back to supper with glowing cheeks and a good appetite.
               The glow faded after a little, however, and the unrest and longing came back to her eyes. I saw the doctor watching her with the closest interest, and, woman-like, I wondered how much he read. He was both sage and philosopher; yet I took the liberty of doubting whether there were not certain signs and hieroglyphics which I could translate better than he.
               During Dr. Bellinger's visit of the previous June, he had become a great favorite with both my young neighbors. His heart had kept all the glow and freshness of its youth. In one sense he was as young as they. But in his wide experience, his knowledge of men and things won from extended travel, his erudition, his keen, incisive intellect, his familiar acquaintance with the world of literature, art, and science, in short, in all the garnered wealth of his half-century of noble living, they found a charm that they could hardly have found in the society of any man of their own age.
               So I was not surprised when, soon after tea that evening, they made their appearance, taking great credit to themselves for having left Elsie and me in undisturbed possession of him for full twenty-four hours.
               The doctor did most of the talking that night, the rest of us merely asking questions and making suggestive observations for the purpose of drawing him out. His late European trip—for during his three months of absence he had traveled over half the continent—was still fresh in his mind, and he greatly enjoyed the telling, as we the hearing, of what he had seen and thought and felt.
               At length, in a little lull in the conversation, he turned to Kenneth. "Mr. Armstrong, do you remember the great excitement in '51 with regard to the Marchdale forgeries?"
               "Perfectly," he replied; "and not only the forgeries, but the heavy embezzlements, the suicide of the cashier, and all the rest of it. It was a strange affair."
               "More than a nine-days' wonder," said the doctor. "Indeed, I believe it has lived to this day. Well, I have something to tell you about that matter which will interest you. That poor cashier, whose memory has been for nearly seven years a target for reproach and obloquy, is at last vindicated."
               "I am glad to hear it," was the answer. "'Let justice be done, though the heavens fall.' But what new revelations have been made? What has happened?"
               The doctor smiled as he took the tongs and heaped the glowing hickory brands upon the great brass andirons, sending a shower of sparks up the chimney, while we all settled ourselves for a story.
               "I came over in the Scotia, as you know," he began. "On the second day out, I noticed a tall, gentlemanly man, whose face seemed strangely familiar,—so familiar, indeed, that it really became an annoyance; for I was constantly endeavoring to give to it 'a local habitation and a name.' I ascertained that the man was a New Yorker, and at length arrived at the conclusion that his was one of the numberless faces I was in the habit of meeting on Broadway, and that in some way it had been singled out from the mass and daguerreotyped upon my memory. He occupied a large state-room on the upper deck, and apparently, notwithstanding the crowded condition of the boat, had it all to himself. At least, no other person was ever seen to issue from it, and he seemed to have no companion. But one warm, sunny day I was lying on a settee near the door of his state-room, when he came out, turned the key, and went downstairs.
               "Pretty soon I heard a noise in the state-room that I had supposed to be tenantless,—a tramp, tramp, tramp of tireless feet up and down the confined space. Once or twice there was a sound like the clanking of a chain; then I heard a smothered groan, and the words, 'My God! what will the end be?'
               "After perhaps half an hour my tall friend came back with a bowl of broth, went into the state-room again, and all was silent.
               "It all flashed upon me in a moment. The man was James Gibson,—a United States officer, not of the military, but of the civil service. I had seen him a hundred times, and recognized him from his connection, more or less important, with several prominent trials. He had some prisoner in charge whom the British government had kindly delivered over to the tender mercies of our own. Notwithstanding all my love of law and order, I own to a feeling of tender sympathy for the poor wretch who was locked up in that state-room. He was evidently handcuffed: the little clanking noise I had heard betrayed that. Doubtless he was a desperate character; and if I had been the officer having him in charge, I myself should probably have required him to wear those ugly bracelets, feeling that he would hardly have been a safe room-mate without them. Still, the fellow was a man and a brother; and it was not an agreeable thought that what was a pleasure-trip to most of us—something to be enjoyed and remembered—to him was only the passage of the Bridge of Sighs, fearful in itself, and more fearful in that to which it led.
               "Before the voyage ended, I became quite well acquainted with the officer. He was an intelligent, well-bred man, with a vast amount of practical common sense, and singularly acute perceptive faculties. We had many a pleasant chat together, pacing up and down the moonlighted deck, or leaning upon the taffrail to watch the wake of the ship as it stretched behind us,—a shining track through the limitless blue desert. But he never alluded to the mysterious occupant of his state-room, and I was silent as the Sphinx.
               "When the pilot came on board, two other men, whom I at once recognized as United States officers, came with him, and, as they sprang on deck, clapped Mr. Gibson on the shoulder with a congratulatory air.
               
               "'So you've got him, safe and sound, have you?' said one of them. 'And a good job it is, too. You've made your mark, Gibson.'
               "'Hush!' whispered that gentleman. 'Not a soul, except the captain and steward, knows that he is on board. I didn't want to stir up a commotion and be the observed of all observers; neither did I wish to be questioned. So I kept my own counsel.'
               "'It was best,' returned the other. And the three walked away together.
               "Of course my curiosity was a good deal excited; but I expected to know nothing more until the affair was duly chronicled in all the papers with startling headings, amazing capitals, and a shower of exclamation-points.
               "We got in in the night; and the next morning, knowing there was no one at home impatient to greet me, I remained quietly in my state-room until the rush was over and most of the passengers had left the steamer. Then I sallied forth, valise in hand.
               "But just in advance of me, as I reached the gangway, was a group that instantly riveted my attention,—my tall friend, the other two officers, and a fourth. The handcuffs at once pointed him out as their prisoner. They left the vessel quietly, and were just about entering a close carriage that was in waiting, when Mr. Gibson caught a glimpse of me, and sprang back to give me a grasp of the hand at parting.
               "'Good-by, doctor!' he said. 'We've had a very pleasant voyage, but I fancy we are all glad to be on terra firma again, unless it may be the poor devil in the carriage yonder. Drive on slowly, Bill; I'll overtake take you at the corner. Who do you think we've got there, doctor?'
               "'I don't know,' I answered. 'But I've known all along that you had some one cooped up in that state-room of yours.'
               "'And never so much as gave me a hint of it! Doctor, you're a close one. To pay you for it, I'll let you into the secret, although I only intended to set you a-guessing. We've been on his track for full two years, and at last we've got him.'
               "'But who is it?' I asked, glancing hastily at the carriage, which was nearing the corner.
               "'It is a man with a dozen aliases,' he said. 'Alexander Bliss is the name he goes by now. He was James Elliott at the time of the Marchdale forgeries.'
               "'What! the employé of the concern whose mysterious disappearance occasioned so much comment?' I asked.
               "'The very same. He's the man who did all the mischief. He forged the notes, stole the money, murdered the cashier, and so cunningly devised his fable that the world supposed the latter to be the felon, and thought he committed suicide through fear of detection. But he's got to the end of his rope at last, and is pretty sure to hang for it. Good-by, doctor! they're waiting for me.' And off he dashed."
               A chorus of exclamations greeted the close of the doctor's little story, and questions and answers followed each other in quick succession. Elsie and I had forgotten all about the affair, if, indeed, we had ever heard of it.
               
               "How did he look, Uncle Howard?" asked Elsie. "Such a bloodthirsty wretch as he must be! I would not have liked to be on the same ship with him. I should have thought the sailors would have been tempted to deal with him as their ancient brethren dealt with Jonah."
               "Perhaps they would, if they had been aware of his presence, for they are a superstitious set. How does he look? He's a regular Adonis; and as great an exquisite as you will find on Broadway. Villains do not always wear the mark of the beast on their foreheads, Elsie. The devil prepares all sorts of disguises for his own. He has given this child of his as fair a mask as one would see in a twelvemonth."
               Elsie shook her head. "I don't quite believe it, uncle. The mark must be there somewhere, if one's eyes were only keen enough to discern it."
               "Or one's spiritual insight clear enough," said the doctor. "But come, we have supped on horrors long enough. Give us a song, Elsie, to exorcise the foul fiends we have been conjuring up."
               What possessed the child, out of her repertoire of songs, to select that night the "Song of the Novice to Queen Guinevere"? It shivered and sobbed and wailed through the little room until it seemed as if the spirits the doctor had spoken of were nearer to us than ever. In the piteous cry, "Oh, let us in!" some lost, despairing soul seemed to force its way to the very gates of heaven, only to be met in stern response by that terrible "Too late!" and sent hurtling back into the abyss from whence it came.
               Kenneth rose with compressed lips, walked to the window, and gazed out into the night, thus hiding his face in the shadow of the curtains. Clyde crept nearer to Elsie, looking at her with great, startled eyes. The doctor glanced from one to the other with curious, troubled glances.
               "There!" he exclaimed, as the last note died upon the ear. "My patience, Elsie! I thought the day of judgment had come, surely. Now, for sweet pity's sake, give us something that is not quite so doleful."
               "A lump of sugar to take the bad taste out of your mouth!" she said, with a half-smile. "Will this do better?" And, sweeping the strings of her guitar, she broke into a sweet, joyous strain, with a refrain that was like the chiming of silver bells.
               "Yes, that is better," he said, as she paused. "Ugh! that other thing made me shiver."
               The next day Clyde dined at Cozytoft. Kenneth had gone to Bloomfield. The conversation turned again upon the forgery and the arrest.
               "It is one of the most remarkable cases I ever heard of," said the doctor. "The plot was worked up with most consummate skill. Now that one knows the whole story, it is really curious to look back and read the 'logic of events.'"
               "Was any one tried for the crime?" asked Clyde.
               "Yes; two different parties were arrested and tried. But the evidence, though strong, was not sufficient to convict them. At last the public mind settled down into the belief that the cashier was the real culprit, and that he had killed himself."
               "The reports of their trials would be curious reading now, examined by the light of these new revelations."
               "Would you like to see them?" asked the doctor. "Elsie, run up to my room, there's a good child, and bring me the roll of newspapers you will find on the bureau. I felt so much interested in the matter, after what Gibson had told me," he continued, "that I bought a file of the Thunderer for '51, in which paper I knew there were full accounts of all that was said and done relating to the matter. I have nearly run them through, and will leave them for you when I go, if you would like to look at them. A formidable array, you see," as he took them from Elsie's hand. "But, fortunately, one is not obliged to read the whole paper."
               Clyde expressed his gratification and his thanks; and the doctor renewed his promise of leaving them behind him when he left Altona,—which was to be on the morrow. Elsie had said that she hated leave-takings; but she could not avoid them. They came to her, as they come to us all, whether we will have them or not.
               Half the village knew the exact minute of her departure; tearful eyes looked out of lowly windows, and hands were mutely waved in token of farewell.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIX.
               THE house was very desolate after she had gone. I had intended to dismiss my little Mattie and go back to my old way of living. But after we had put in order the pretty white chamber with its maidenly appointments, closed the blinds, and left it to darkness and repose; after we had gone all over the house that seemed so empty, missing her sweet presence and her dainty possessions everywhere, I sat down in the deserted parlor to think about it. I found that I was spoiled for solitude. The quiet was too quiet; the silence was too intense, or would be if I sent Mattie away. It was pleasant to know that she was dashing about the kitchen, to hear her voice—albeit it was none too sweet—singing snatches of merry songs, and to be interrupted every half-hour by the opening of a door and the appearance of a good-natured face with the inquiry, "Miss Rossiter, would you do thus or so?" For Matty was very fond of asking advice. It broke up the monotony of her life as well as mine, I suppose, to discuss the important questions whether it was better to use yeast-cakes or "milk-emptins," or which most effectually removed the dust, a cloth or a feather duster. So Matty stayed.
               I saw nothing of Kenneth or Clyde for several days. Their absence would have hurt me a little if I had not fully understood the cause. Cozytoft had lost its charm for them as well as for me. But I knew they would come back to it ere long. For both of them it had been hallowed by "Love's young dream." One of them—or so it seemed—had awakened from that dream of his own free, strong will. He had shaken himself roughly, and said to his soul, "Awake, thou that sleepest." But, nevertheless, the memory of the dream was with him still, and it would be with him as long as life should last. The other dreamed on. The words he had spoken, and those that Elsie had spoken in reply, had stirred him somewhat; the pain they had occasioned had made him start and shiver; he had moaned in his sleep in feverish unrest. But he had not awakened from his dream: he had not resigned her. And it was because hope was not dead that he had been able to meet Elsie again with no outward disturbance, and to assume, apparently, their old friendly relations. Because she had told him that she would have loved him if she could, he took courage, after the sober second thought, and went on in the dream of winning her. He did not see that in the open, generous frankness of that admission lay the surest ground of his despair. If her being had answered to the call of his, there would be no need that she should try to love him. Her heart would have flowed out to him spontaneously,—of its own free will. But men have gone on blundering in this way, and failing to read the signs of the times, for six thousand years; and doubtless they will continue so to go on until the end of time. My poor Clyde was by no means alone in his folly.
               Meanwhile, the bundle of papers that the doctor had left for him lay on the bureau up-stairs in solitary state. When he wanted them badly he would come for them. Or, if at any time he seemed in desperate need of some new thing to interest and amuse him, I would send them over.
               But on Friday evening—Elsie went on Monday—they both made their appearance, Kenneth and Clyde. Of course we talked of Elsie and of the doctor, and of the strange story of the Marchdale forgeries.
               "Oh!" exclaimed Clyde, suddenly, "did Dr. Bellinger leave those papers for me, as he promised?"
               I nodded assent.
               "What papers?" asked Kenneth, carelessly, as he picked a yellow leaf from my rose-geranium.
               "A file of the Thunderer for 1851," answered Clyde, "containing all the reports of the trials. The doctor says they are curious reading in the light of our present knowledge; and he left them for us to look over. I will take them when we go home, if you please, aunty."
               One of the quick, startling changes I had so often observed, flashed over Kenneth's face at that instant; but after a little he said, quietly,—
               "Better leave them with Miss Rossiter for the waste-paper basket. You will never have patience to read them. Searching for what you particularly care to see will be too much like hunting for the needle in the haymow."
               "They will serve for a rainy day, if nothing more. Don't slander my proverbial patience, Kenneth. I haven't the slightest idea of skipping a single word. Where are they, aunty? Can I find them?"
               
               I sent Matty up-stairs for them. When she returned, Kenneth rose hurriedly, glancing at his watch.
               "Do not stop to examine your treasures now. It is time we were at home. Shoulder your bundle, and come on."
               The next morning Clyde rushed in just after breakfast.
               "Did I leave those papers here last night, aunty?" was his first salutation. "But I ask the question just for form's sake. I know I took them home with me!"
               "I know it, too," I answered. "What's the matter? Have you lost them?"
               "Can't find them high nor low," he said. "I have searched the house all over,—up-stairs and down. I thought common sense and duty required me to come here and see if by any possibility I had left them. But I knew better all the time. I distinctly remember placing the roll on a chair near the head of my bed."
               "It is very strange," I remarked. "Have you looked under the bed?"
               "Under it, and on it, and over it. It is not in my room, nor anywhere else. Patsy has not seen it, nor Dennis."
               "Nor Kenneth?"
               I spoke involuntarily,—and the next moment, remembering the expression of Kenneth's face when he first heard of the papers, I regretted the unguarded suggestion.
               "Kenneth? Of course he has not seen them. He went to bed before I did. It is too absurd to think of their being stolen,—just a bundle of old papers. But what can have become of them?"
               "Was your door open during the night?"
               "Yes,—that is, the door into Kenneth's room was open. I think the one into the hall was closed. Their disappearance is just unaccountable. They are not worth making all this fuss about," he added, laughing. "But there is something uncanny about the whole thing,—that they should be so spirited away from under my very nose." And off he dashed again.
               Now, something a little unusual had fallen under my observation during the previous night; and musing over it in my quiet fashion as I sat there in my solitary parlor, suddenly a ray of light seemed to fall upon the history of Clyde's papers.
               This was what had happened. About one o'clock I had awakened; and after tossing restlessly for half an hour or so in vain pursuit of sleep, I got up, threw a heavy shawl over my shoulders, and seated myself at the window. It was bright starlight, clear and still, and every shadow upon the untrodden snow was distinct and immovable as if outlined by the hand of an artist. Suddenly, as I looked over at Greyholt, from behind a rock in a secluded part of the grounds, and at a long distance from the house, a light flame shot upward. It blazed for a few moments while I watched it with startled eyes. Then, just as I had concluded that it was best for me to make some attempt to alarm my neighbors, it dropped suddenly into arkness. I pondered over the matter for awhile, but finally made up my mind that some late boy-truant from the village, going home "across lots," had paused to rest behind the rock and amused himself with a burning pine-knot.
               A different solution of the mystery now presented itself, however; and, laying aside my work, I donned cloak and hood and started forth. Not wishing to be seen from the windows at Greyholt, I crept along behind the hedge, scaled the wall, and stood at length in the shadow of the rock.
               It was as I had suspected. There was no trace of boy footsteps in the snow; no hint of resinous pine torches. But the snow was trampled down, and there was a footprint that I knew to be Kenneth's. There were heaps of black ashes here and there,—ashes so light and intangible that they were blown about by the mere fluttering of my garments. Two or three charred fragments of paper lay upon the unmelted snow,—bits no larger than my hand. But as I bent over them, holding my breath lest its faintest quiver should cause them to disappear, I read a date,—"June 23, 1851."
               I tossed a little snow over it with my foot. The night, the morning thus far, had been intensely still. But just then a light breeze rustled the tree-tops, and crept sighing through the hemlock-boughs. A moment more, and it caught the black, feathery flakes, whirling them hither and yon, sweeping the snow clean and bare, and leaving scarcely a vestige of the last night's work.
               Eighteen hundred and fifty-one! It was the year that brought the Armstrongs to Altona. I obliterated the one footprint that I knew to be Kenneth's, threw fresh snow upon whatever spots were darkened, and trampled it down. Then I went home, and sat deliberately down—to think.
               The clue to all that was dark and strange in the lives of these two brothers had probably been placed in my very fingers, and I had failed to grasp it. Those innocent papers that had lain up-stairs for a fortnight,—what dire secret did they hold, that for its sake they must become a holocaust? What was there in them that Clyde must not see? What mystery was there in the history of the Armstrongs, into whose dark labyrinths Kenneth had been admitted and Clyde had not?
               I wearied myself with conjectures; and meanwhile Clyde fumed and fretted over the loss of his papers, forming first one theory and then another as to their sudden disappearance. He and Dennis held many a discussion over the matter, the latter personage leaning strongly toward the supernatural, and overflowing with pious comments and suggestions.
               "Indade, Misther Clyde," he would say, "thim papers were not alive, it is ivident; and how, thin, could they walk off with themselves? They had help, sir,—they had help." And here the good gray head would wave ominously back and forth. "It is a solemn warnin'. These things are sint to us, Misther Clyde; they are sint to us to bring us to a sinse of our responsibility! God bless me poor sowl and body,—but I think I know me duty now!"
               What he meant by this last observation it would have puzzled a lawyer to tell. But probably his honest brain held the fancy that he was in some way accountable for the loss that so perplexed and annoyed his young master; and perhaps he intended to say that if, in order to defend him or his possessions, it was necessary to encounter witches or banshees, he was ready to do it. At all events, he went about his work for many days with head bowed down, murmuring to himself, "God bless me poor sowl and body,—but I think I know me duty now!"
               As for Kenneth, he ignored the whole matter, so far as he was able; and at last it became an old story, and was apparently forgotten.
               As the winter days wore on, Clyde grew more and more restless, moody, and irritable. Nothing was right; nothing pleased him save for brief intervals. Sometimes he would be sweeter than the sweetest flower that grows. A strange comparison, you say, when a man is in the case,—for flowers belong to womanhood. But, ah, my poor Clyde! You could not judge him as you judged other men,—you could not speak of him as of other men. So I repeat, sometimes he was sweeter than the sweetest flower that grows. Then, again, in an hour perhaps, such storms of passion would gather about him that they darkened the very air.
               The heart of the winter was broken,—to use one of Patsy's favorite expressions,—and she was beginning to think of spring house-cleaning as not so very far off. I had not seen much of the young gentlemen for a fortnight,—the surest of evidence that all was not well with them. But one evening, late in February, Kenneth came in alone.
               He threw himself down upon the lounge beside my little table, and laid his hand upon the pages of my book.
               "Shut it up, aunty," he said: "I want to talk to you. I have come to a place," he went on, pushing back his heavy brown locks as he spoke, "where I cannot see one inch of the way before me. I want you to help me to find it."
               "If I can," I answered. "What is it, Kenneth?"
               "Clyde is determined to go to New York," he said, hesitating a little,—"to see Elsie. Miss Rossiter, it must be prevented. He must not go."
               I mused in silence for a few moments. "But why?" I asked, at length. "I think it can do no good, so far as his suit to Elsie is concerned. But assuredly it will do no harm. Why do you object to his going?"
               "Because—it is not best. Because—our father begged me on his dying bed to keep Clyde away from New York. Because——"
               He came to a dead stop. Then, dashing his hand suddenly across his eyes, he went on, hurriedly:
               "I am conscious that all this must seem very absurd to you, Miss Rossiter; that it places us in a strange, unfavorable light. I am conscious——"
               I interrupted him. "There is one thing I want to say to you, Kenneth. The course you pursue with Clyde is strange,—it is peculiar. It is liable to misconstruction, and exposes you to harsh judgments. Do you not know it? Devoted as you are to him,—and for some inexplicable cause you are devoted to him, soul and body,—there are yet many weak points in your armor. You are vulnerable on all sides."
               
               "Know it?" he cried, passionately. "Oh, my God! do I not know it? Not a wind blows that does not tell me of it,—not a breath passes by that does not whisper of it. Idle tongues are busy with my name. They charge me with mercenary motives; they say that I take advantage of the fact that I am the elder, and in some way the stronger of the two; they say that I disregard Clyde's interests, and sacrifice them to my own; they say that I bend him to my will, and that he is but as a reed in my hands; they say that I would keep him from love and marriage, even, for the furtherance of my own selfish ends! You see I know it all!" he continued, smiling sadly. "I am not so blest as to be ignorant of these things."
               "But, my child," I said, "it seems to me that in some ways you might do differently. Your father, like other sick men, had his whims and fantasies. You are not bound by them. You have no right to sacrifice yourself and Clyde in loyal obedience to them. If Clyde were to lead a life more nearly like that of other young men. If——"
               He laid his hand upon my arm with a vice-like grasp.
               "He cannot lead such a life!" he cried. "He cannot! Let that suffice. I do not create destiny. I do not ordain circumstances. I only conform as best I may—and submit. Miss Rossiter, Clyde must not go to New York, if any effort of mine can prevent it."
               But it appeared that no effort could prevent it. The open rebellion that I had feared so long came at last. Clyde was as one distraught for several days. Then he declared positively that he would go; no power on earth should restrain him; he had been held in leading-strings too long already,—he was of age,—he was a man,—he had the same right to draw upon the income of the estate that Kenneth had; in short, he was going to New York. If his brother chose to go with him, well and good. If not, he was going alone.
               What would Kenneth do? Would he still resist, or, having exhausted all his powers of persuasion, would he yield gracefully? He answered these questions himself.
               "I have done the best I can, and all I can, to keep him at home," he said, "and further contention is worse than useless. Of course I cannot compel him to stay. Now I must go with him, and shield him from harm as best I may."
               Patsy was in a state of mingled elation and anxiety when the news of their speedy departure was announced. It was a great event in her life, that her young gentlemen were about to start upon a journey; and New York seemed farther off to her than Egypt and the Pyramids do to you. Such overlooking of shirts and handkerchiefs and stockings, such close inspection of buttons and button-holes, as went on at Greyholt during the next two days!
               They were to start at five o'clock the next morning, Dennis driving them over to Bloomfield in time for the early train. Toward night I ran across the road, with my thimble in my pocket, to do a little delicate bit of repairing that Patsy had feared was beyond her skill.
               The contrast between the two brothers that afternoon noon struck me more powerfully than ever before. Kenneth's preparations were all made. Everything in which he was personally concerned was arranged for as long an absence as might be necessary. He was in the library when I went in, and I caught a glimpse of him before he saw me. His face was somewhat paler than its wont, but quiet, steady, resolute; and out of his cool gray eyes there looked a soul that having warded off some imminent peril as long as it was able, was now girding itself up to meet and grapple with it. Yet there was nothing of sternness or dissatisfaction there. Having yielded the point and consented to go, he did it cordially, entering into all of Clyde's plans and projects, and sharing his eager enthusiasm so far as he might.
               And indeed it was contagious. Even I began to feel as if a visit to New York must be the acme of human desires,—the very highest good. Clyde was in a state of the wildest exhilaration, and at the same time in one of his sweetest moods. Why should he not be, having gained his end? He glowed and sparkled all over. Never had his marvelous beauty seemed so like an incarnation as that day.
               Yet there was something painful about it, after all. There was too much light and sparkle. The hot glow upon his cheek, the intense lustre of his eye, the warmth and splendor that haloed him, gave me a sense of dread, of subtle danger.
               "Come up here, aunty!" he shouted, from the top of the stairs. "Come up here; for I want you."
               That was enough. I went. Clyde's "I want you" was a most difficult thing to resist. Would Elsie find it so at last?
               He had insisted upon packing his own trunk, and the result was that confusion reigned supreme in every quarter of the room.
               "Just look, aunty!" he exclaimed, excitedly. "I am making a pretty mess of it! I never can get half these things into the trunk."
               "No; neither can any one. But there is no necessity for it, Clyde. Why in the world are you taking all your summer clothing with you? You will not need it." And I began to lay aside the thin garments for which he could find no possible use.
               "No, no," he cried, hastily; "I must take it! I shall stay—no one knows how long. Perhaps," he continued, looking cautiously around the room and lowering his voice to a confidential whisper,—"per-haps I shall never come back. To tell the truth, I do not like Altona. It doesn't suit me. I am going to New York. I am going to see the world. I am going to Elsie! Good-by to Altona!"
               He waved his hand with a theatrical flourish and snapped his fingers.
               "And to me, Clyde? Good-by to me also?"
               "Oh, you dear old aunty!" he exclaimed, catching me about the waist,—a liberty he was by no means in the habit of taking.—"Good-by to you? Not by any means. I'll tell you a secret," he whispered, while he held me fast, and his hot breath fanned my cheek. "When we are married, Elsie and I, we shall come to Altona to spend our honeymoon moon! But I shall never come till then,—never, never, never!"
               I was frightened, I confess. I tore myself away from him and turned toward the door, with the intention of calling Kenneth. He divined my purpose, and, springing forward, laid his hand upon the lock. His eyes were a flame of fire.
               "Pack that trunk!" he shouted, under his breath,—if one may use such an expression. His voice had all the force and power of a shout, while at the same time there was cunning in his incipient madness. "Pack that trunk! I am going to Elsie, I tell you! Pack that trunk! and don't you dare to call that brother of mine, or I will hurl this inkstand at your head!"
               He caught up a large glass inkstand that stood upon the table within reach, still keeping one hand upon the lock. Why he did not close the door and turn the key has always been a mystery; but he did not.
               I was in the power of a madman. If I could only keep him quiet till succor came!
               "Yes, yes," I said, soothingly. "Do not be impatient, Clyde. I will pack the trunk immediately."
               "Do it, then," he said, peremptorily, "and be quick about it. I am going to-night, to-night! Do you hear? Kenneth means to play me a trick. He means to carry me off somewhere,—where I shall never, never see Elsie. But I'll get the better of him! Oh, yes! I'll teach him a thing or two. I'm going to-night—to-night—and leave him in the lurch. He hates me, Miss Rossiter; and—do you hear?—I—hate—him!"
               The concentrated bitterness of those last words forced me to look up at him. I was kneeling by the trunk, crowding in one article after another. But in that one quick glance I saw that he had removed his hand from the knob, and the door had swung open a few inches.
               "Hand me that coat, please, Clyde," I said, quietly. "There's just room for it here."
               He turned toward the chair; and, springing to my feet, I flew into the hall, closing the door behind me. As I did so, there was a wild shriek, a groan, a heavy fall.
               I rushed down-stairs, screaming, "Kenneth! Kenneth!" He was by my side in an instant, gave one glance at my white, scared face, spoke not a word, but bounded up the stairs into the chamber I had left.
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               I FOLLOWED Kenneth. Clyde lay prone upon the carpet, face downward, and hands clenched in his tawny hair.
               We attempted to lift the poor, insensible body; but it was too much for my strength. I called Dennis,—mute now with bewilderment and sorrow,—and the two men raised Clyde from the floor and placed him upon the bed. Kenneth had not spoken one word. Now, as Dennis reverently lifted his hat and stood uncovered, he placed his hand upon his brother's forchead and gazed long and earnestly upon his pallid face. Then he stooped and kissed the fast-closed eyes.
               "Oh, Clyde! Clyde!" he said, under his breath.
               I stepped forward and touched his arm.
               "There is no time to lose, Kenneth. Ought he not to be undressed and made comfortable, as far as we can do it, before he revives from this swoon?" I feared that at a later moment he might prove utterly unmanageable.
               Kenneth looked at me with a strange, far-away look in his eyes, as if he scarcely comprehended my meaning. I repeated my words.
               "Call Patsy, please, Miss Rossiter," he said, finally. "Dennis, go for Dr. Mathews. Take the Brownie, and be quick. Then come back immediately."
               There was little said while we disrobed Clyde and applied wet cloths to his burning head. Patsy's tears flowed silently, but she did not open her lips, save to make some necessary suggestions. But when all was done that we could do, and we waited the coming of the doctor, Kenneth glanced at the open trunk and the various pieces of clothing that were scattered about the room.
               "Put them all away, Patsy," he said. "Put them all out of my sight. What is Dr. Bellinger's address, Miss Rossiter?"
               I gave it; and he wrote a hasty telegram, finishing it just as the sound of the Brownie's hoofs upon the beaten road told that Dennis had returned. He was at once dispatched to Bloomfield with it, and ordered to wait for an answer.
               Meanwhile Dr. Mathews came, examined Clyde carefully and gravely, and shook his head.
               "It is a bad case, Mr. Armstrong," he said, at last. "I will not try to conceal the danger from you. It is a violent affection of the brain, the immediate cause of which I should judge to be some strong mental excitement. I have had little experience in such diseases, and would rather some older physician should take the responsibility of this case. There is Dr. Hazleton, of Bloomfield?" he added, suggestively.
               "A thousand thanks for your frankness, doctor," said Kenneth, cordially; "but, anticipating serious trouble here, I have already telegraphed to Dr. Bellinger, of New York. In the interim, however, I would rather the case should remain in your hands."
               The doctor bowed. "Then I will do my best, sir." And he turned toward the bed again, where Clyde still lay in a state of coma.
               In four hours Dennis came back with the dispatch. Kenneth tore off the envelope.
               "Thank God!" he cried, with a deep sigh of relief. Dr. Bellinger would leave New York on the first through train; we might expect him to-morrow, at midday.
               There was no change in Clyde that night,—there was none the next morning. Occasionally he would groan and mutter incoherent words, seemingly of reproach or entreaty. But for the most part he lay as one dead,—pallid, silent, motionless. The hours were long until Dr. Bellinger came.
               
               But when he did come, he gave us little encouragement.
               "This does not seem quite like ordinary brain affections," he said, stroking his gray beard reflectively. "Has he ever been hurt? ever received any injury about the head?"
               "Yes," Kenneth answered, hesitating a little. "He was thrown from a horse several years ago, and injured severely. Here is the scar." And he parted the heavy hair.
               Dr. Bellinger examined the long, irregular cicatrix critically, asking many questions which Kenneth answered concisely. Then he rose, and paced the room for a quarter of an hour. Turning at last suddenly to Kenneth,—
               "Will you know what I mean if I talk about 'Bony Process'?" he asked. "I do not use medical terms and phrases, if I can avoid it, when speaking to the uninitiated. In your brother's case there has been a formation of bone, or a bony substance, inside the skull, and pressing upon the brain. It was occasioned, doubtless, by this accident or injury of which we have been talking. But even with this understanding of the matter, the case is by no means a plain one. Unless I am greatly mistaken, there are complications dating from some trouble still farther back."
               Kenneth made no reply to this, but sat with his hand over his eyes and his lips compressed.
               "There might be an operation, I suppose," the doctor went on, slowly, speaking more to himself than to his companion. "But it would be extremely hazardous; not one chance in a thousand of saving the life of the patient. And if I am right in my diagnosis, there are other troubles, that no surgical skill can reach. Still, even the one chance is, perhaps, worth trying. What do you say, my young friend?"
               Ever since Dr. Bellinger's arrival Kenneth had been so calm, so collected, so self-contained, that the good physician thought, doubtless, that he was not oversensitive, and could bear the plainest possible discourse without wincing. Now, however, the firm lips parted in a vain endeavor to speak; the hand that covered the eyes trembled violently; the broad breast heaved, and a sudden passion of dry, tearless sobs shook the young man's powerful frame, even as a sapling is shaken by the force of the tempest.
               "Do not ask me,—do not ask me, Dr. Bellinger!" he cried, seizing the hand that the doctor had extended in a spasm of self-reproach and pity. "Do not ask me to decide such a question as that. I leave it all in your hands. I do not know what is best."
               "Then," said the doctor, very gently, remembering at last the close relations that had always existed between these two brothers, and touched with tender pity for both,—"then I decide against an operation,—at least for the present. I doubt if your brother is able to endure it now. By-and-by, if we can bring about some favorable changes, and mitigate some of the immediately alarming symptoms, it may be well to reconsider the matter."
               That night violent fits of raving alternated with hours of death-like stupor. As in the beginning of the attack, the poor, oppressed brain dwelt constantly upon Elsie and Kenneth. Kenneth hated him,—Kenneth was striving to keep him from Elsie,—Kenneth had laid a plot—oh! a cunning, deep-laid plot—to entice him away to some far land where he could never so much as hear her name. Occasionally he would rave about the will and the safe, repeating over and over again, in every varied form, the cruel suspicions of which Tom Bradshaw had sown the seed. How Kenneth writhed under this torture God only knew! But Clyde's chief cry was for Elsie,—for Elsie. And at last the bewildered, shattered brain settled itself upon that one thought and knew nothing else. The poor, distorted lips cried out for Elsie continually.
               This lasted all that night and the next day. Then Dr. Bellinger said, calling Kenneth and me into the library,—
               "There are two things that must be done. With your permission I shall send for Elsie. Her presence may possibly quiet Clyde, and give us a little time. As it is, medicines have no effect upon him, and he will wear himself out in this struggle. Then we must obtain an experienced nurse,—one who is more accustomed to dealing with all the different phases of delirium than, thank God! any of you here can be."
               A quick, hot flush swept over Kenneth's face at the doctor's first proposition. But it faded in an instant.
               "Send for whom and what you please, doctor," he answered. "Under no circumstances could Miss Meredith's presence in Altona be unwelcome. As for the nurse, I am afraid you will have to send away for him or for her also. There are no nurses about here who can be compared with the two who have already placed themselves at your command,—Miss Rossiter and Patsy."
               "Yes, yes, I understand that," was the response. "But we need a professional nurse. Clyde's case demands trained skill. Besides, there is no knowing how long this may last; and you cannot endure the strain for many weeks. I know of an excellent nurse who has often assisted me in the care of delirious patients at St. Elizabeth's. We must have her at once."
               So again the telegraph was brought into requisition, and the doctor dispatched this message to Elsie:
               "Come up here by next train, and bring Sister Agnes."
               But it would be eighteen hours at the least—perhaps twenty-four—before we could reasonably expect them. How slowly those hours dragged on only those can know who have been in a like stress of anxiety and pain. It was morning at last, and possibly they might reach Altona at midday.
               "By the by," said Dr. Bellinger, as I poured for him a cup of strong coffee, "perhaps I ought to tell you that you will not find Sister Agnes a very talkative person."
               "All the better," I answered. "To tell the truth, I have been dreading her tongue ever since you sent for her. Whatever other virtues they may possess, I never yet knew a nurse who was blessed with the gift of silence."
               
               The doctor laughed softly as he stirred his coffee. "Then Sister Agnes will suit you to a T; and I may as well tell you the whole story without further circumlocution. The woman is a mute."
               I was struck dumb myself for a moment. "You do not mean that she is deaf and dumb?" I asked, in a sort of dismay. "What ever shall we do with her?"
               "No,—she is not deaf. But she cannot speak, owing to some difficulty of the throat which seems to have impaired the vocal organs. She would never allow me to examine her case; so I do not know much about it. But she is a capital nurse, and that is all we care for just now."
               I still thought this was likely to be an uncomfortable state of things,—worse, perhaps, than the talkativeness I had dreaded.
               "It must be awkward, nevertheless," I said. "How do you manage with her? Does she have any difficulty in making her wants known?"
               "Not the least," answered the doctor. "Do not give yourself any uneasiness on her account, Margaret. She will take care of herself. Her signs are wonderfully graphic and intelligible; and, besides, she writes with great ease and rapidity. The fact that she can hear simplifies matters, you see."
               I went out to explain the case to Patsy upon this; thinking it better that she should be prepared for all emergencies.
               "Well, she won't be a-gabbling and a-gossiping, that's one comfort," said she. "And I'd a great sight ruther not have her talk at all than to have her tongue a-running from morning till night. I s'pose she's one o' them furriners,—Catholic, most likely,—a sort of a nun, or something; and she won't eat meat on Fridays. I wonder how the fish-market is nowadays? But, see here, Miss Rossiter," she added, as I turned to go up-stairs. "What chamber shall I fix for Miss Elsie?"
               I hesitated a moment. "Not any. Matty will see to that. Miss Elsie will prefer to have her old room at my house, I am sure. But you had better put the one adjoining yours in order for this Sister Agnes."
               The carriage had gone to Bloomfield to meet the travelers; but neither Dr. Bellinger nor Kenneth had accompanied it. They could not be spared. Neither could I be spared long; but, catching up a shawl that lay upon the hall table, I ran across the road to give a few directions to Matty and to see for myself that Elsie's room was ready for her. For I felt sure she would stop at Cozytoft.
               The pretty guest-chamber had not been occupied since she left it; and it had the forlorn, desolate air so soon acquired by a room that is not in daily use. But a bright little fire upon the hearth soon altered all that, and it presently glowed with warmth and radiance, beaming a welcome from every corner. I wheeled the dimity-covered easy-chair in front of the fire, placed a little table beside it, with a new book or two, and a tiny glass vase wherein a crimson tea-rose blushed and smiled amid its emerald leaves. Then I went back; and as I slowly mounted the hill, under the naked maple-boughs, I heard Clyde's voice raised in strange, unnatural tension, crying,—
               "Elsie! Elsie!"
               Dr. Bellinger had gone to lie down, for he had been up a great part of the previous night, and Kenneth and I were in Clyde's chamber, when we heard the sound of wheels upon the graveled road. Even in that darkened room I saw Kenneth's color change, and noted a sudden and peculiar motion of the shoulders, which in him was always a sign of internal agitation. But he rose silently and went to the window.
               "They have come," he said, quietly. "At least, the carriage has come. I do not see Miss Meredith."
               I went down. Dennis, hat in hand, had just opened the carriage door, and a tall, dignified woman, with the air and bearing of a lady, was descending the steps. As I bade her welcome, she bowed, touched her lips with her finger, smiled faintly, and passed by me into the hall. Dennis had left Elsie at Cozytoft, as I had predicted. I waited to ask him a question or two, and then followed the stranger into the house.
               A strange embarrassment—a sort of panic, so to speak—seized me as I approached the silent, motionless figure that awaited my coming. A tall, dignified woman, as I have said, of about forty-five years, around whose face and figure the light of past beauty lingered, even as the sunset glow illumines a landscape after the sun has set,—with delicate, finely-cut features, a perfectly colorless complexion, large dark eyes, eyebrows somewhat heavy, but singularly arched and almost a jet-black, contrasting strangely with hair that was blanched to a snowy whiteness,—gray dress of some soft woolen fabric, gray cloak, gray hood which had fallen back upon her shoulders, revealing a quaint, nun-like cap with a band across the forehead like that of a lady abbess,—such was Sister Agnes. For a moment it seemed to me that some old medieval portrait had stepped down from its tarnished gilded frame, and was waiting for me to address it. What ever should I do with this stately, silent woman, whose dark, questioning eyes followed me so intently, but whose lips spake never a word?
               A happy thought struck me. "You will like to see Dr. Bellinger and learn something of the patient for whose sake you have come so far," I said. "Step into the library and be seated, if you please, and I will ask him to speak with you for a moment before you go to your chamber."
               I opened the library door, and then, hastening upstairs, tapped lightly at that of the doctor's room. He appeared presently.
               "Come right down, doctor," I said, "and see this Sister Agnes of yours. And I am going with you, to see how you manage to carry on a conversation with her."
               "Come along, then," he answered, as one but half awake. "Where's Elsie? But what's the matter? Have you seen a wraith, or what?"
               "Elsie is at my house," I answered. "No, I have not seen a wraith. But I believe I am afraid of that woman, doctor! Her silent stateliness is too much for me."
               "You don't say so!" he said, mockingly. "Margaret Rossiter, I have always thought you that rara avis, a sensible woman. Come straight down-stairs now, and retrieve your character before it is forever too late."
               It was absurd, this unaccountable tremor that had taken possession of me; and I followed the doctor down to the library in quite a chastened frame of mind.
               He entered the room while I was yet upon the stairs, and his first words were,—
               "Heigh-ho! What's this? Why, Sister Agnes, Sister Agnes, what is the trouble?"
               A faint, inarticulate murmur, half sigh and half moan, was the answer, as Sister Agnes, who was standing bolt upright in the middle of the room with both hands pressed upon her heart, turned toward him a white, convulsed face, staggered forward, and fell into his outstretched arms.
               "Here's a to-do!" said the doctor, half impatiently, as he laid her upon the sofa. "Don't be frightened, Margaret. Raise the window, and give me your sal-volatile. Is the world turning upside down? I thought this woman had nerves of steel, and here she is fainting away like a scared school-girl!"
               The cold, fresh air and the pungent salts soon revived her in a measure; and she sat up, looking about her in a vague, bewildered way. Then her eyes closed again, and I saw that only an effort of most persistent and determined will prevented her from falling back into another swoon. This was a pretty state of things, truly!
               "A glass of wine, Miss Rossiter," said the doctor. And I brought it. He held it to her lips, bidding her drain it to the very bottom. Presently a little faint color crept into the wan lips, and she raised her hands to her head with a motion of weariness and pain. Dr. Bellinger watched her silently. Then, turning to me, he said,—
               "She will be all right soon. Tired out before she started, probably. She had better go to her room for the present."
               At this Sister Agnes lifted her head, with a motion of dissent, and her hand strayed hither and thither, as if in search of something.
               "No," said the doctor. "You can't have your pencil yet. Lie still, if you won't go up-stairs."
               A slight smile just touched her lips for an instant; but again, as she unclosed her eyes and they wandered about the room, taking in, in one rapid glance, the books, the pictures, the portraits on the wall, a strong shudder shook her frame. Suddenly, as by a violent effort, she rose from the sofa and seated herself in a chair so placed that from it she could see nothing but the wide, far-reaching landscape without. In that position she remained for five minutes, while the doctor stood quietly by her side with his fingers upon her wrist. At length she drew a long breath, and looked up at him with an apologetic air, and yet with strangely-questioning glances.
               "All right now?" he said, cheerily. "They have been working you too hard down at St. Elizabeth's since I came away, haven't they, Sister Agnes? I never expected to have you on my hands, fainting away and all that. See here, you have frightened Miss Rossiter half out of her wits, I verily believe."
               We both bowed in response to this slight ceremony of introduction. Then in a rapid pantomime, which even I could partially understand, she told the doctor that she had not slept for several nights, having devoted herself to a delirious patient, who had died an hour before she left New York. Then, she said, calling her pencil into requisition, she had not been in the cars for many years, and perhaps the unaccustomed motion accounted for her dizziness.
               Perhaps the doctor believed this; but I did not. Even yet the look of terror and dismay I had noticed as she fell had not faded out of the woman's great, dark eyes; and the subtle instincts of my sex told me that in spite of the self-control and strength of will she now wore as armor of proof, her heart was throbbing painfully beneath it.
               I touched her hand. It was cold as ice. "Come to your room now and rest awhile, will you not?" I said. "You can talk with the doctor by-and-by."
               After a moment's hesitation, she rose and followed me, drawing her hood over her head, and glancing neither to the right nor the left as we went. But as we reached the door she paused, and said to the doctor, in her strange sign-language,—
               "I want to see you in half an hour. Where?"
               "Here," he answered.
               But she made a gesture of dissent so unmistakable that he said,—
               "No? Then I will come to your room in just thirty minutes. Will that do?"
               She nodded; and he went up-stairs to Clyde.
               I have been a long time in telling this. But probably it was not more than twenty minutes from the time she entered the house until I left her at her chamber door.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               CLYDE was worse that night,—so much worse that he engrossed my thoughts to the exclusion of all else. I have never been able to recall its events with any distinctness. I know that Elsie came to me, that I felt her clinging arms about my neck, her warm kisses upon my cheek. But where we met, in whose presence, or by whose agency, I could never remember. I know that Clyde was raving in wild delirium, now filling the house with shouts of maniacal laughter, now moaning pitifully like a grieved child, now crying out for Elsie, now calling upon his father's name, now invoking heaven's vengeance upon Kenneth, whom yet he did not recognize,—when suddenly a slight, graceful, black-robed figure, with hair that made a golden radiance in the darkened room, a firm, sweet mouth, and tearful yet resolute eyes, glided into the chamber, and laid its cool, soft hand upon his forehead, saying only,—
               
               "I am here, Clyde." And then, as once in days of old, "immediately there was a great calm."
               Clyde did not speak; he did not move. He would hardly have seemed alive had it not been for his eyes. They never left Elsie's face for an instant.
               Kenneth stood in a far corner, watching both. He had not seen Elsie until that moment, when she bent over Clyde like an angel, her very presence bringing temporary peace to the troubled soul. As I have said, I do not remember much about that night. Everything seems vague and dream-like. But I do remember how at last Kenneth stole softly across the room, and, taking the hand that dropped at Elsie's side, raised it to his lips with a whispered "God bless you." That was his only word of greeting.
               Presently he brought her a low chair and left the room. The magnetism of her presence, or the soft pressure of her hand upon Clyde's forehead, soothed and quieted him, and at length he dropped into a fitful slumber. But when she would have stolen away, he started wildly, caught her hand and drew her to her seat again, and again closed his eyes. She did not repeat the experiment, but sat there hour after hour, holding his wasted fingers in a firm, close clasp. Whether the harassed, struggling soul recognized her in a blind, uncertain way, God only knows.
               It was not until the gray dawn of the morning that I bethought me of Sister Agnes, and, in a sudden spasm of wonder and self-reproach, made inquiries of Dr. Bellinger.
               "She is in her room," he said. "I found her, at the expiration of the half-hour, in a state of extreme nervous excitement,—owing probably to overwork,—and in imperative need of rest and quiet. Indeed, she at first declared her determination to return to New York at once, saying that she could not, and would not, remain here even for a day. She insisted upon being taken back to Bloomfield in time for the midnight train; and when I told her that was impossible, as the horses could not be spared in this emergency, she said she would walk, then,—and actually put on her cloak with that intention. I began to wish the woman was in New York myself, for there was an expression about her eyes that made me almost doubtful of her own sanity."
               "I wish she was well out of the house," I said. "But how did you manage her? What have you done?"
               "I took off her cloak, and made her sit down and listen to reason, in the first place," he answered. "I told her that she was simply tired and overwrought, and that a good night's rest—which I should insist upon her having before she saw Clyde—would set her right. Then I appealed to her womanly sympathies, told her how strangely alone these two brothers were, having neither father, mother, nor sister, and being entirely dependent upon the good offices of such heathen as you and Patsy,—and how much the invalid needed just such a nurse as herself. Finally, I scolded her in my own behalf, telling her that she was treating me shabbily and placing me in a very awkward position. She grew more quiet as I poured out this torrent of words,—and at length began to cry. Such a passion of tears you never saw; and I knew that the victory was won. After awhile she became calmer, and began to question me about Clyde and Kenneth; and even about Mr. Armstrong's death, which was something I knew nothing about, and I told her so. But it does not matter, as there could have been no resemblance between his case and that of Clyde. I believe she even asked a question or two about you,—supposing you a member of the family,—and finally said that, God helping her, she would stay and do the best she could."
               "Quite melodramatic," I said, sarcastically. "Well, after you had sufficiently gratified her womanish curiosity, what next?"
               "Next, Miss Rossiter," bowing deeply, "I gave her a powerful sedative, and made her promise to go to bed; where I have a profound belief that she remains at this present moment."
               I remained silent. In my heart of hearts I felt that it would have been a decided relief to me if the good Sister had carried out her original intention and returned to her own Lares et Penates, wherever they might be. This strange, dumb woman, with her tremors, her faintings, and her tears, was not at all to my taste. Dr. Bellinger read my face and answered my unspoken thought.
               "Do not judge hastily or harshly, Margaret," he said, gravely. "I confess that I am disappointed myself. The weak, trembling woman, almost in hysterics, whom we saw yesterday, is by no means the Sister Agnes whom I have known for years, not merely as a ministering angel by the bedsides of the dying, but as a strong, resolute, practical person, to be relied on to the very last. But this only proves that she is human, like the rest of us, and that she cannot endure all things. I am confident that she will be herself again after a night of rest, and that you will have no reason to doubt my wisdom in seeking to retain her. Now, leave Clyde to Elsie and me, and go to bed yourself."
               I obeyed, for I was indeed thoroughly worn out. Four hours afterward, when I returned to the sick-room, I found Sister Agnes at her post, looking more like a picture than ever, with her beautiful dark eyes, her strong yet tender face, her abundant white hair, her quaint head-dress, her soft gray robe, and her calm, unhurried ways.
               Othello's occupation was gone. In other words, Margaret Rossiter found that the work that had so engrossed her for a fortnight was taken out of her hands completely. Dr. Bellinger's judgment was indeed amply vindicated. It was wonderful to see how quickly and how quietly the new nurse established her sway in the sick-chamber. Her control over Clyde grew to be something marvelous. In his wildest moments, when the poor, tortured soul seemed in deadly conflict with the demons of terror and unrest, her touch, her gentle, appealing eyes, and a certain low, soft, inarticulate murmur, like that of a mother crooning to the babe upon her breast, of which she appeared to be herself unconscious, would soothe him into comparative repose.
               This was generally the case, but not always. There were times when for Clyde the whole universe held only Elsie, and when no presence but hers could give him peace; times when he would look at none but her, listen to no other voice, receive no drop of cordial, no particle of nourishment, save from her hand. So it happened that they two seemed to hold for him the issues of life and death.
               Thus the time wore on for a week. Dr. Bellinger, after a long conference with Sister Agnes, had gone back to New York, promising to return in a few days. The house was very still; and it seemed to me that the shadow of death brooded over it. Kenneth was always at hand to render any necessary service; he seemed to drop down out of the skies, as it were, whenever he was needed. But for the most part he held himself aloof from the room where all our thoughts were centred. Perhaps he feared that his presence might be a disturbing element; perhaps he could not bear the sting of Clyde's wandering words; perhaps he felt that he could not be thrown into frequent association with Elsie without unendurable pain; perhaps it was merely a gentlemanly instinct that led him to avoid obtruding himself upon her at such a time. Yet, if such was the case, there was less danger than he imagined; for Elsie was seldom in Clyde's room, save when imperatively summoned by Sister Agnes. She shrank from Kenneth even more than he from her.
               One forenoon I was in the kitchen, helping Patsy in some household emergency.
               "How is that blue-eyed angel o' yourn this morning?" asked that lady, as she industriously worked her butter. "She hain't quite got her wings yet, I see. Seems to me it's about time they was a-sprouting."
               "Who?—Elsie? Oh, she is as well as usual. I left her doing something for Matty; I forget what."
               "I should think she had better be in bed," rejoined Patsy, giving the little golden pat another toss. "She'll wear herself out, Miss Rossiter, if you let her go on this way."
               "How? What do you mean?"
               "Why, being up so nights. This Agnes woman can stand it, I s'pose. She's used to it, and she don't seem to mind it one mite nor grain. But it's too much for a young thing like Elsie Meredith!"
               "What in the world are you talking about, Patsy?" I said, half impatiently. "Elsie has not been over here a single night this week."
               She dropped her butter-ladle, and wheeled round. "Do you mean to say that girl was not over here last night?"
               "Not later than ten o'clock."
               "Nor the night before?"
               "No."
               "Nor the night before that?"
               "No. She stayed here Saturday night. She has not been here since—in the night."
               "To your certain knowledge?"
               "To my certain knowledge," I replied.
               "Well, this beats me!" exclaimed Patsy, dropping into a chair.
               "I do not see that there is anything surprising in it," I said. "Sister Agnes prefers to take the entire charge of Clyde at night, whenever he is quiet enough to allow it. Elsie is never there, excepting when it can't be helped."
               "But see here," whispered Patsy, leaning forward. "Who was there, if she wasn't?"
               "Sister Agnes, of course. No one else."
               Patsy's chin sank into the palm of her hand, and she deliberated for the space of a minute.
               "Some one else was there," she said, decidedly. "You see, Miss Rossiter, I hain't slept in my own room for more'n a week back. It was kind o' lonesome there; and, besides, I wanted to be near Clyde. I sleep with one eye open, allus; and I wanted to be where I should know whether he was wuss or not, without asking. So I went into that little room that nobody ever uses, t'other side o' Clyde's. Well, every night I hear somebody a-talking, kind o' low and soft; and as Sister Agnes is as dumb as a fish, it stands to reason that it ain't her."
               "It is very probable that Kenneth comes down in the night, occasionally," I suggested. "In fact, I know he does."
               "'Taint his voice that I hear," she said, disdainfully. "I should know that if I should hear it in Joppy. This is a woman's voice,—a loving, petting, coaxing kind of a tone, not a bit like Kenneth's"
               "Oh, it is Sister Agnes herself," I answered. "She makes a low, crooning noise sometimes when she is at work over Clyde, that, in the next room, you might easily mistake for speech. That is it, you may depend."
               Patsy shook her head. "I sha'n't dispute ye, Miss Rossiter, nor gainsay your words. But if there hain't been somebody in that room for the last three nights besides Clyde and Sister Agnes, then my name ain't Patsy. Miss Rossiter, that's the very chamber Mr. Armstrong died in. Did you ever think on't?"
               "I know it is. But what of that? I hope you are not going to be superstitious and whimsical at your time of life, Patsy?"
               "I do' know whether I be or not," she said. "Folks do tell strange stories, and I've read stranger ones. I never thought I was called on to say things wa'n't thus and so just because I never 'd seen the like with my own eyes. I never see a sperit; but because I hain't, it don't follow that there ain't none. I never see a rhinoceros,—but I believe them that has."
               "Nonsense!" I cried. "But, Patsy, suppose we admit that Mr. Armstrong's spirit comes, or can come, to Clyde's bedside. The voice, you say, is a woman's voice; and I cannot imagine our old friend, whether in heaven or on earth, speaking in any other than his own strong, deep tones. Can you?"
               She was silent for a moment. Then she said,—
               "I never did believe in such things, that's a fact, Miss Rossiter. But there's Clyde's mother, whom it's a kind of sin to talk about in this house. Who knows? Well, I've nothing to say about it, and I don't calculate to mention it to anybody but you. But just as true as I'm alive, there's somebody in that room o' nights that talks,—and it ain't Clyde Armstrong, neither."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXII.
               THAT afternoon Clyde was in one of his most restless and excitable moods; not so noisy as he was sometimes, but keeping up an incessant muttering and murmuring. His utterances were incoherent for the most part; but, as I strained my ear and strove to catch the disjointed sentences and gather the meaning of the apparently senseless jargon, I discovered that Kenneth and Elsie were the burden of his thought. He paid no attention to anything that was going on about him as he lay with his face to the wall, picking at the blanket and talking rapidly in a fierce whisper. I made a point of keeping out of the way as much as possible, quiet being so essential; and my visits, when necessary, were very short. But now, as he noticed my presence no more than that of a fly, I stood for a few moments leaning against the bureau. The room was darkened, but as the subdued light from the hall door fell upon Sister Agnes's face, I noticed that she looked exceedingly worn. If her cheeks were colorless when she came to us, they were absolutely pallid now.
               "This is too much for you, Sister Agnes," I said, in a low voice, as I laid my hand upon hers, impulsively. "I shall insist upon taking care of Clyde to-night myself, for you must have rest."
               "No," she wrote. "I shall not leave him. Dr. Bellinger left him in my charge. It would do no good, either,—for I could not rest away from him."
               "But you are so pale," I said. "One would almost think Clyde was your brother, your friend, your child, you devote yourself to him so conscientiously. Let me at least share your watch."
               She smiled faintly, while at the same time a swift cloud of pain seemed to darken her face. But she shook her head.
               "I will go out into the grounds for a little while," she wrote, "if you will stay here. The fresh air is better than sleep for me." And she went.
               Just then I heard Elsie's step in the hall below. I glanced at Clyde. He was lying as before, with his face to the wall, still muttering. I stepped lightly to the head of the stairs and beckoned to her.
               She came up softly with her hands full of heliotropes and tea-roses, and laid them on Clyde's pillow. The rich perfume stole tenderly upon his senses; he ceased to whisper, his face softened, and a radiant smile broke over it.
               "The angels are here," he said, at length, in almost his natural voice. "I hear the rustling of their wings and breathe the airs of Paradise."
               Elsie placed one of the great creamy rosebuds in his hand.
               "It is one of your own roses, Clyde," she said. "See how beautiful and sweet it is."
               He looked at her dreamily for a full minute. "Are you the angel that brought it?" he then said. "But it is a lie. I never had a rose, never, never! If I had, Kenneth would have stolen it away from me. The roses are all his. Everything is his. He has taken everything away from me."
               
               Oh, the unutterable pathos of those last words! Then, with a sudden sweep of his arm, he tossed the flowers to the floor.
               "Take them away!" he cried. "They are Kenneth's! I won't have them here! Let him put them in the safe and keep them!"
               Elsie quietly moved them out of sight with her foot. Then, sitting down by the bedside, she took the restless hand in hers, and smoothed back the disordered hair with a soft, magnetic touch. For a moment or two he yielded to the spell, his eyelids drooped, and I thought he was going to sleep. But presently he started wildly, and catching both her hands in his, fixed his large, burning eyes upon her with a furious frown.
               "What do you bring me roses for?" he whispered. "I want Elsie! She is the one rose of the world,—the only flower that blows worth a man's care or thought! Elsie! Elsie!"
               For a moment Elsie struggled to release her hands from his clasp; and then, overcome by a feeling that may have had a touch of fear in it, by womanly sorrow, and by her great pity for him, she burst into a flood of passionate tears. He released her at once,—and lay back looking at her with a vague wonder.
               "What do you cry for?" he asked, slowly. "Angels do not cry. You are an angel, and bring me roses. But Elsie!—Elsie is a woman,—the sweetest woman on earth!"
               She had risen from her seat, and would have stolen away. But he caught her dress.
               "They don't want you up in heaven," he said. "Stay here! I want to ask you something." And he looked furtively around, as if to make sure there were no listeners within hearing. "Did you ever see Elsie up there? You would know her by the gold of her hair, and by her eyes that are bluer than violets." He was silent for a moment; then, with gentle violence, drew her ear close to his mouth. "You see," he went on, in a low, confidential tone, "I think she is dead. There is a spirit comes to me in the night, and says—but spirits will lie, you know—that she is not. It is a spirit that loves me, and speaks sweet, tender words to me. But spirits will lie, I tell you,—and this one says Elsie is not dead. I know better! Kenneth has killed her!"
               "Oh, no, no!" cried Elsie, involuntarily. "Kenneth——"
               "Hush! hush!" was the imperious command. "You do not know anything about it. Hush, I say! and don't you interrupt me, if you are an angel. Angels will lie,—and spirits! I'll explain it to you. Kenneth—that's my brother, you know—he hates me, and if you'll keep the secret I'll tell you why. Will you keep it, angel? Swear!"
               There was nothing to do but to humor him, and Elsie bowed her head.
               "Swear!" he cried, again seizing her hands.
               "I swear," she said, faintly.
               "Then I'll tell you the whole story," he said. "Kenneth hates me because I love Elsie. Between you and me, he loved her himself,—and that's all the trouble. They say so down in the village, and my heart tells me it is true. He loved her! and he has killed her to keep her away from me. I suspect he has thrown her into the ravine yonder, and I am going there to-night to find her,—to-night, when the moon rises! Angel, will you go with me? It will be dark and fearful down there, with my dead Elsie and Prince,—a horrible white heap,—and——"
               He stopped and shuddered.
               This could be borne no longer. I had kept quiet, thinking that his mood would change in a moment or two. But now I came forward.
               "Let the angel go, Clyde," I said, soothingly. "Let her go now, and she will come back to-morrow."
               He surveyed me coolly from head to foot, still retaining his hold upon her.
               "What have you to say about it?" he cried. "Who are you? I have not done with the angel yet. I have more to tell her. Kenneth loved Elsie," he went on, rapidly, "and he tried to make me give her up, that he might win her himself! Ah, but he's a snake in the grass! There's another thing,—wait till I tell you, angel, and then you may go. Wait! There's all this property, you see. It belongs to Kenneth and me. Joint heirs to millions and millions of dollars, and all the islands of the sea! He loved Elsie,—but he loved money better, better, better!" raising his voice to a shrill scream. "Loved money better, I say,—and so he killed her! Thinks I'm going to die and let him have it all? Ha, ha, ha! I'll thwart him yet! I shall live till I am as old as Methuselah! Die? I die? Humph! But go now, angel! Away! I've done with you!"
               He pushed her from him with sudden violence, and fell back upon the pillow, as helpless as a child.
               "Go, quick!" I whispered. "Get out of his sight, and send Sister Agnes in!" I had not dared to leave the room to call her myself.
               Elsie fled from the chamber,—to meet Kenneth in the doorway. How much had he heard? One glance at his face told her that he had heard all. His whole tortured soul looked out of the eyes that fastened upon hers in mute appeal.
               Elsie was not demonstrative. She was not a woman given to sudden gusts of emotion. Sweet and tender as she was, I had sometimes thought her a little too statue-like in her maidenly repose. I had sometimes thought she needed just another spark of the Promethean fire. But now, whether Clyde had "builded wiser than he knew," and through his wild assertions and accusations had revealed to her more than he himself dreamed of; or whether, by some subtle clairvoyance, she looked through the mask of circumstance and conventionality, and read for the first time the true story of Kenneth Armstrong's love, its self-abnegation and its anguish, I know not. This I do know.
               She met him, as I said, in the doorway. His lips moved in a vain attempt to speak. The soul of the man cried out for vindication, for justification, but his tongue was palsied.
               She drew him into the hall; she looked for one moment into his eyes. Then, as if borne away by an irresistible impulse, she threw her arms about his neck, and laid her wet cheek to his,—nay, more, she drew down his face till his lips touched hers.
               
               "Kenneth! Kenneth!" she whispered, "do not think I mind his dreadful words, or that I do not know how hard it is for you to bear them! But, oh! it is not Clyde's self that speaks. Forgive him, Kenneth!"
               It was the strongest possible proof of the innate nobleness and delicacy of Kenneth Armstrong's nature, that he did nothing to wound or alarm her then; nothing that should make her painfully conscious that she had given him a caress that he would not have dared to offer her. He did not clasp her to his heart, he did not frighten her by protestations or by explanations. An ineffable tenderness drove the anguish from his eyes; his set lips melted to a softer curve, and a sudden flush of color brightened his face.
               "I cannot forgive him," he said, softly, "for there is nothing to forgive in my poor Clyde. If you trust me, I can bear everything else."
               She had withdrawn her clinging arms, as unconsciously, in the deep feeling of the moment, as if she had really been the angel Clyde had called her. Kenneth raised her white hand reverently to his lips and kissed it.
               Then she glided down-stairs and out of the house.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               CLYDE'S wild words to Elsie that afternoon were the last that he spoke on earth. In the course of an hour he fell into a state of profound stupor, like that which marked the beginning of his illness. It continued through the night. He scarcely breathed: there was hardly a heart-beat perceptible. The morning, to our great relief, brought Dr. Bellinger.
               He looked at Clyde, touched his hands, his feet, and bent his ear to the pale, parted lips. Then he shook his head, and left the room, while Sister Agnes's great dark eyes watched him searchingly.
               I followed him.
               "Well, doctor?"
               "There is no hope for him, poor fellow!" he answered. "Indeed, there has hardly been any from the first. I saw that from the beginning of the attack. But the issues of life and death are not in our hands,—and I confess I have myself hoped against hope,—relying upon his youth and strong constitution. It is all over now, however. He will die."
               "Soon?" I asked. I had feared this,—yet with what a shock the certainty came at last!
               "Before another morning," he answered. "He may linger for a few hours, but he will never rally again."
               "Will he not have a lucid interval, doctor? Will he not be himself for one moment before——"
               I could say no more.
               
               "Before he goes to the arms of infinite love and pity, Margaret," said Dr. Bellinger, solemnly, yet tenderly. "It is not probable. Still, the cloud may be lifted for a moment. Where is Kenneth?"
               I have said that Kenneth had avoided Clyde's room during his illness, seldom remaining in it except at such times as he was imperatively needed. Now, however, when the doctor had told him that death was already in the chamber, he came quietly in, and took Sister Agnes's place at the head of the bed, close by Clyde's pillow. For a moment, to my great surprise, she seemed inclined to resist. Her breast heaved; her face flushed, then blanched to marble paleness; she stretched out her arms with a sudden motion that had in it a world of pain and yearning, and her swimming eyes went from Kenneth to Clyde in a silent appeal. But he gently put her to one side.
               "This is my place," he said. "He is more to me than to any one else on earth; and I will go down into the dark valley with him as far as I may. He must feel the clasp of my loving, human hand until death unclasps it. Let me pass, please, Sister Agnes."
               Her lips worked convulsively. It almost seemed as if she were about to speak. Then she moved silently away, leaving her place to Kenneth.
               The house was silent as the grave to which one of its young masters was hastening. Out-of-doors the warm spring sunshine was wakening the earth from its long sleep. The air was full of soft murmurs,—inarticulate, yet glad. In sheltered nooks the young green grass was springing. Clyde's garden was full of prophecies of the coming summer.
               But he,—our beautiful, wayward Clyde,—our impulsive, loving, headstrong, passionate Clyde,—whom we loved all the more deeply, perhaps, for the anxious hours he had caused us,—ah! whither was he drifting?
               Friends! I was not Clyde Armstrong's mother, nor his sister. I was not bound to him even by remoter ties of kindred; and my whole life has been so apart from all these close relationships that it may be I have no conception of the love that grows out of them. But even I could hardly have borne those hours of watching and waiting if Christ had not spoken out of the darkness,—if He had not stood with outstretched arms upon the shore of the unknown land whither Clyde was hastening, crying, "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest." This has not been a so-called "religious" story. Neither church nor priest have figured in its pages; and the deeper and holier experiences between the soul and its Creator have never been so much as touched upon. I have given you no mixture, palatable or otherwise, of religion and love-making; no pellet of theology, no globule of doctrine half buried in the sweets of romance. I have not thought it necessary to tell you every time we said our prayers or attended divine service. But I want to say here, once for all, that every one of us,—from Dr. Bellinger down to Dennis,—however widely our creeds might differ in minor matters, stood fast in the grand old faiths that have sustained and comforted countless generations; I want to say that we all believed, with Paul, in Christ and him crucified.
               
               The hours wore on until it was sunset,—a wondrous, golden sunset, such as one sees but twice or thrice in a lifetime. No fear of the garish daylight now. It will not torture the sensitive eyeballs, nor waken to keener pain the thrilling nerves. Dr. Bellinger stepped to the window and drew aside the curtain, letting the full glory of the dying day stream into every corner of the room.
               There was nothing to be done. There had been nothing to do for hours but to moisten Clyde's lips occasionally, and smooth back the tangled hair when it fell low upon his forehead. Sister Agnes sat at the foot of the bed, covering her eyes with her hand. Elsie crouched at my feet, with her face buried in my lap. Patsy leaned against the door-post, silent and almost stern in her sorrow. Dennis, in the hall, bowed his head upon his hands and whispered prayers for the parting soul.
               As for me, it seemed as if all the desires of my life were merged in one great longing,—a longing that in an intenser form I read in every lineament of Kenneth's face. For weeks Clyde had not once breathed his brother's name uncoupled with threats, reproaches, and the bitterest accusations. Would he go into the other world without giving one sign or token that his love was stronger than the hallucinations of disease and the creeping chill of death?
               The sun dropped lower and lower; its last red ray fell upon Clyde's clustering curls, lighting them up as with a glory.
               The figure that had lain motionless so long stirred feebly, the pale lips parted, the dim eyes opened, and with a low cry of loving recognition, the wasted arms were raised as by a mighty effort and clasped about the neck that Kenneth bowed to receive them. The lips of the brothers met,—and with one long sigh Clyde passed behind the veil.
               With all his faults, his weaknesses, his inconsistencies, the warm human love went with him to the very confines of the unknown. Did not the divine love meet him there, encompassing the poor soul in a still diviner tenderness?
               In my heart of hearts I thanked God that Kenneth had Clyde's last look, his last thought. I was glad it was not I, not Sister Agnes, not Elsie, even, who caught the last radiance of his love-lighted eyes. That belonged to Kenneth, and he alone received it.
               We were all silent and motionless for awhile. There was a little low sobbing from Elsie, a long, wavering sigh from Patsy. That was all. At last Kenneth laid Clyde back upon the pillow and softly closed the eyes that should answer his no more. Then he left the room, and I saw him no more that night.
               Sister Agnes's head had fallen forward upon the bed. When I rose and bent over her with one hand upon her shoulder to whisper a few words in her ear, I discovered that she had fainted. Dr. Bellinger looked at her for a moment in a sort of consternation.
               "We shall have no Sister Agnes at St. Elizabeth's much longer, if this state of things continues," he said. "She told me this morning that she should go back to New York to-morrow. But I shall forbid it, peremptorily. She ought to stay here and recruit for a month at least, before she takes up her work again."
               We took her to her room, and as soon as she showed signs of returning consciousness, left her to herself, feeling that entire repose was the medicine she needed. The doctor said he considered it doubtful if she left her bed in a week.
               But the next morning she was up as usual, wandering about the house and grounds in her strange, silent way. She quietly accepted Dr. Bellinger's decision as to her return to New York. Indeed, I fancied it was a kind of relief to feel that she was compelled to remain in this quiet retreat for a few days longer. Yet as she stood that forenoon upon the steps of the conservatory, with the bright sunlight falling upon her face and touching the silvery hair that gleamed beneath the folds of her nun-like cap, I could but notice how much older she looked than when she came to Greyholt a fortnight before.
               I do not think she spoke to any one—communicated with any one, I should rather say—that day, save to return the morning greetings, and to reply briefly to Dr. Bellinger's inquiries. She avoided Kenneth, she avoided Elsie, she avoided me. But some strange attraction seemed to draw her constantly to the silent, shadowy room where Clyde lay crowned with the royal majesty of death.
               It was no wonder. No king upon his throne was ever half so kingly as Clyde Armstrong upon his bier. The emaciation, the look of suffering and unrest, the pain and longing,—all had disappeared, and he lay there like a young god asleep. Sister Agnes had not seen him in life until after pain and weariness had robbed his young face of much of its uncommon beauty. It was not strange, I thought, that now she should awaken to a full sense of its power, and hover, in spite of herself, about the room its presence consecrated.
               Yet so fearful was she of intruding, or of witnessing the grief that should be sacred from the eyes of strangers, that when any of us who loved him entered the chamber, she glided swiftly away like a spirit, her unrustling gray robes and noiseless footsteps scarce breaking the silence.
               There was no studied arrangement of flowers about him as he lay in his coffin; not a wreath or a harp or a cross, beautiful and emblematic as they all are. Somehow they did not seem suited to Clyde. But Elsie brought all the rare, sweet flowers that he loved, not restricting herself to the conventional white, and laid them here and there in rich profusion, till the whole air was loaded with fragrance rarer than ever fell from Eastern censers. In his pale hands she placed only a cluster of white violets.
               I suppose all Altona came to that funeral. God forbid that I should say that a mere idle curiosity was the sole motive that impelled such throngs to travel over the hills and along the winding roads that day and to fill at last every inch of available space in and about Greyholt. But it cannot be denied that it had much to do with it. There was a mystery about the Armstrongs. There had been something not easy to comprehend in the relations of the two brothers; there had been hints and insinuations of unfair dealing on the part of Kenneth, and a large part of the town was agog to see how he would carry himself. Then a majority of the people had never yet had an opportunity to cross the threshold of that door,—and now was their time. There was a vague curiosity to see the house,—merely a gentleman's country residence, by no means grand or magnificent, but about which such fabulous stories had been told. Some came out of pure friendliness, out of hearty sympathy for the elder brother, and a neighborly desire to join in the last sad offices toward one who had for years brightened their hills and valleys with his presence. For Clyde, Altona had only pity and sincere regret. Nevertheless, many came to his funeral, eager simply, as were the Athenians of old, to see and to hear some new thing.
               Those who came to study Kenneth must have gone away no wiser than they came. All through the services, which were exquisitely simple and tender, he sat at the head of the coffin, leaning his brow upon his hand, and with his eyes fixed upon Clyde's face. I do not think he knew whether there were ten persons in the room, or ten hundred. He made no demonstration, no parade of his sorrow; but there were lines of grief upon his forehead and about his mouth that the most careless observer could not have failed to recognize.
               Yet—shall I say it?—I, who knew him so well, read something else there, underlying all the sorrow. There was a certain air of relief,—a restful look that I had not seen since Mr. Armstrong died.
               The day on which Clyde died had been warm and spring-like. That on which he was buried was raw and cold, with sudden dashes of rain, and wild, sweeping winds that belonged to November rather than to April. No one of us thought for a moment that Sister Agnes would care to go to the graveyard, far off on a bleak hillside; and no arrangements were made for her conveyance thither. She stood in the doorway when the procession moved off, with her gray hood drawn closely about her face, hiding everything but her large, mournful eyes,—eyes whose singularly strong resemblance to a pair that I had surely seen somewhere else, though where I could not tell, had haunted and perplexed me ever since she came to Altona. When we reached the last point in the road from which Greyholt was visible, I turned and looked back. The gray, silent figure was still watching us.
               It was all over at last, and Clyde lay in calmest slumber close beside the father who had so loved him. Then, slowly, sadly, silently, shivering in the fierce blasts that swept down from the mountains, we returned to the desolate house.
               Returned to find Sister Agnes kneeling, a huddled gray heap, in the very spot where Clyde's coffin had stood, and over which Mr. Armstrong's portrait looked down upon her with earnest, compelling eyes.
               She sprang to her feet as she heard our steps. "Oh, God!" she cried, throwing up her hands and clasping them above her head, "oh, my God! I can bear this burden no longer! I must speak! Clyde,—my son,—my son!"
               
               Had the grave opened and given up its dead,—had Clyde, bound hand and foot in his shroud, stood in bodily presence before us,—we could not have been more dismayed, more overwhelmed. We were dumb, even while the dumb spake. I looked at Kenneth. The blood had all left his face; and involuntarily I put out my hand and guided him to the seat for which he was blindly groping.
               As for Sister Agnes herself, her strength had expended itself in those few words; and she stood before us with her face buried in her hands, trembling as one in an ague-fit. Impostor and hypocrite as I believed her to be, I still pitied her as she withered beneath our searching glances.
               Patsy was the first to come to our relief. "Crazy as a loon!" she said, decidedly, advancing toward her with the tread of a grenadier. "Never mind her, Kenneth. Crazy as a loon! I have mistrusted it before, and now I know it for certain. Help me to get her up-stairs, doctor. She's out of her head, to be sure,—but she's found her voice mighty sudden, it seems to me." And she would have laid violent hands upon her, bearing her off, will she nill she.
               But Sister Agnes drew back with an air of indescribable sweetness and dignity, lifting her tear-drenched face, and looking round upon us, while she grasped the back of a chair for support.
               "I am not mad, Patsy," she said; "though it is not strange that you think so. I have feared myself, since I came into this house, that my wits would leave me,—so much have I dreaded, so much have I endured. But I am perfectly sane. You ought to know, doctor. Look in my eyes——"
               "Do not appeal to me," interrupted Dr. Bellinger. "If you are not crazy, you ought to be. Your tongue seems glib enough, woman. Why have you pretended to me for all these years that you could not speak?"
               "I have never told you that I could not speak," she answered. "I have simply refrained from speaking, and you and others took it for granted that I could not speak. Think for a moment, doctor. Is it not so?"
               He was silent for a second or two. "It amounts to the same thing," he said, "and brands you as an impostor. Your motive for this deceit is inconceivable."
               In the doctor's indignation at the fraud that he considered had been practiced upon himself, he quite forgot what she had said. That she should have spoken at all was her offense in his eyes.
               But now Kenneth rose and slowly approached her. "What do you mean?" he asked, in a voice I hardly recognized. "Who are you? or whom do you claim to be?"
               "So may God help me, and save my soul in its extremity," she cried, "I am Clyde Armstrong's mother! I was the lawful wife of him whose portrait hangs upon the wall yonder,—your father, John Armstrong!"
               Kenneth's eyes flashed fire, and he drew a step nearer to the woman, with his hand uplifted, as if he would have crushed her into silence.
               She faced him bravely, never flinching from his piercing gaze. Presently his arm dropped, and a half smile flitted about his mouth for an instant, as he turned to Dr. Bellinger and addressed his next words to him.
               "Patsy is right," he said. "She is insane. Clyde's mother, my father's second wife, died in the June of 1851. I was present at the funeral, and saw her remains placed in the family vault at Greenwood Cemetery. I have been there since, and seen the hermetically-sealed coffin, and read her name, 'Alice Armstrong,' upon the silver plate. This disposes of the whole question. Be gentle with the woman to-night, Patsy, and take good care of her, for humanity's sake, and because she did all she could for Clyde. To-morrow we will see what can be done for her." And he turned to leave the room.
               But Sister Agnes caught his arm and held him fast. "Listen to me, Kenneth Armstrong!" she cried. "Every word you have spoken is the truth, so far as you are concerned. But what if I should tell you that Alice Armstrong was a living, breathing woman at the time those grand obsequies were performed over her pretended remains? What if I should tell you she was not in the coffin that was borne to Greenwood with so much pomp and circumstance?"
               "'A living, breathing woman,'" said Kenneth, in a low, intense voice, "when I know that——"
               He stopped,—glanced from one to the other of us with a new, strange trouble in his eyes, trembled violently, and sank into the chair that Patsy pushed toward him, burying his face in his hands.
               What did all this mean? Was there, indeed, "method in this madness"? When we thought of all that had been dark and mysterious in the lives of these persons,—of the shadow that had overhung the memory of Clyde's mother,—and then remembered the long years during which this woman, whose claims seemed to be so preposterous, had kept some vow of perpetual silence, devoting herself to good deeds, and yet, in a measure, isolating herself from her kind,—was it any wonder that we looked in one another's faces only to read there a vague dread and bewilderment?
               At length Dr. Bellinger spoke, laying his hand upon Kenneth's shoulder. "Let this whole matter drop for to-day," he said, with an air of authority. "If there is any mystery to be unraveled here, it can be reached only by clear heads and measurably quiet hearts. The day has been full of grief and excitement. None of us are capable of grappling with new difficulties. Let this all rest for to-night."
               Kenneth rose and walked to the window, saying, simply, "Wait!" when our little group would have retired. He seemed to be gathering strength to say something that must be said. At length he turned.
               "My friends, Dr. Bellinger is right. I have no strength to combat this woman's claims to-night. But to-morrow I will tell you all I know about my poor Clyde's mother, though it will compel me to betray secrets that it has been the study of my life to keep, and which I thought were buried in his grave. It is due to you, now, that you should know all."
               He passed from the room, glancing neither to the right nor to the left. Elsie, who was sitting in a low chair near the door with tearful, troubled eyes, rose to meet him as he drew near, and placed in his hand the few faded violets that she had taken from Clyde's cold fingers.
               He raised them passionately to his lips, his face softened, the stern lines about his mouth relaxed, and a quick rush of tears relieved the tension of the overstrained nerves. More than one of us thanked God as we saw it.
               I took Sister Agnes home with me that night. It seemed to me that Kenneth's house was no place for her until this strange question was decided.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               IT is not probable that any of us slept much that night. Sister Agnes was quiet, grave, dignified yet with a deep humility of manner that impressed me strangely. But I think I should have been better pleased with her if she had been more demonstrative,—if she had wept and sighed and moaned. If she had been compelled by sheer stress of agony and mother-love to betray the secret she had kept so long, was it not strange that she should so soon have grown placid again, like the sea after a storm?
               I said as much to Elsie, who shared my room. "On the contrary," she answered, "it seems to me entirely in keeping with what we already know of her. A woman who has self-control enough to lead the life she has led for years, simulating dumbness in this unaccountable way, can do anything. Think what command over one's self one must have,—to be able to speak, yet for weary years to utter no syllable of love or hate, remorse or fear! Then—admitting for one moment that her story is true (which of course I do not)—it is only just to remember that the first cry of confession must have brought relief; it must have been the dropping of a burden which had grown to be beyond endurance."
               Morning came at last; and soon after breakfast, in obedience to a summons from Dr. Bellinger, we three women ascended the hill and entered the library at Greyholt.
               Elsie went straight up to Kenneth and said something in a low tone,—too low to reach other ears.
               "No," he answered. "You, of all others, must hear what I have to say. If you will remain, I shall be eternally grateful, whether——"
               He did not finish the sentence, but led Elsie to a seat, bowed gravely to Sister Agnes,—for, courteous gentleman that he was, he could not forget her womanhood, even while he believed her insane or an impostor,—and gave me a faint little smile of recognition.
               As for the charge of insanity, the last twenty-four hours had settled that point for me. Whatever else might be said about the woman, she was not crazy.
               "Will you call Patsy, Miss Rossiter?"
               I obeyed silently. When we were all together, Kenneth asked, turning to Sister Agnes,—
               
               "Am I to understand that this morning, in the full glare of daylight, you are prepared to maintain the claims you made yesterday?"
               She bowed her head in token of assent, while her lips, but not her voice, said, "I am."
               "Then," he went on, his cheek growing, if it were possible, yet a shade paler,—"then you compel me to declare that those claims are utterly preposterous,—too absurd to merit consideration. You compel me to say, in support of my assertion as to her death and burial, not only that Alice Armstrong, my father's second wife, is dead, but that in a fit of temporary insanity my poor brother Clyde killed her,—killed her instantly. She died without a word or a sign. Now tell me, can the dead rise again? Can this be she?"
               I shall not undertake to repeat the various exclamations of pity, of sorrow, even of horror, that rose from our little group. Sister Agnes alone betrayed no surprise. Neither did she attempt to reply to Kenneth. Apparently she was listening for what else he had to say.
               "I thank God," he continued, after awhile, "that the necessity for this revelation did not come during Clyde's lifetime. I thank Him to-day that my brother is dead; that he lies where no whisper of human sin or sorrow can disturb his sacred rest. But as for you, my friends, now that I have told you so much, I must tell you more. Miss Rossiter, Patsy, you both remember the night my father died?"
               "Even to its slightest incident," I answered; while Patsy silently assented.
               "Until that night," said Kenneth, "I was entirely ignorant of what I am about to tell you. I, as well as others, wondered at my father's choice of a home for his old age. Clyde's health, it seemed to me, did not require the rigorous seclusion in which he lived; nor could I see how it was to be benefited thereby. I was somewhat restive under the restraints placed upon myself. I was naturally social, and would have been glad to invite my college friends and boon companions to share the hospitalities of Greyholt. But my father always discountenanced any such proceeding, simply saying that it was not best. That memorable night explained all. Bear with me if I am tedious or prolix, while I repeat to you in my own words what he told me in that last hour of his life.
               "About a year after my own mother's death—which occurred soon after my birth—my father went to New Orleans on business, and there met Alice L'Amoreau, a young and beautiful woman, who fascinated him at once. It seems to have been, on his part at least, one of those sudden and passionate attachments with which the senses have more to do than the heart or the intellect. An ardent wooing, a hurried courtship, a speedy wedding, followed; and when my father returned to the North he brought her with him as his wife.
               "There was a year of rapture,—of wild, sweet, engrossing happiness,—and then my brother Clyde was born. You may perhaps imagine, but you certainly cannot overestimate, my father's distress and horror when he learned, soon after that event, that the curse of hereditary insanity fell upon the boy at his birth. Alice L'Amoreau's uncle, father, and grandfather had all died in insane-asylums, raving maniacs. This he might have ascertained before his marriage, if in his mad infatuation he had not refrained from asking a single question as to the family or antecedents of the woman he was about to make his wife. If he ever blamed her for the concealment she must have practiced, he did not say so to me. His reproaches were all for himself, in that his own blind folly had brought this curse upon his child."
               Here Kenneth paused for a moment, and Sister Agnes started forward with parted lips and a pallid face, down which the tears were streaming But Dr. Bellinger laid his hand upon her arm, saying, in his quiet, authoritative tones,—
               "Be silent, Agnes! Let Mr. Armstrong finish his story first. Then, if you have anything to say, we will listen to you as patiently as we can. Be quiet!"
               Kenneth went on:
               "My father had a great, even an unusual, horror of insanity; and it became the one thought of his life how to ward off this terrible danger that seemed lying in wait for his son. But it soon became evident from Clyde's peculiar mental and spiritual constitution, from his high temper, his passionate outbreaks, and his lack of self-control, that only the most patient, watchful, self-denying care would save him.
               "I inferred, although my father did not say so that night, that there was a wide difference of opinion between him and Clyde's mother as to the proper management of the child. He would have striven, even from the boy's infancy, to hold a firm yet gentle sway that should control him almost without his knowledge. He would have endeavored by every possible influence to counteract Clyde's natural tendencies; to strengthen him where he was weak; to teach him patience, submission, fortitude; in short, to supply the balance, the equipoise, that his nature needed. She, so far as I could judge from his cautious words,—I think he shrank from casting even the shadow of blame upon the dead,—would have indulged him in every whim. What my father forbade, she allowed; what he disapproved, she granted; where he would have controlled, she would have yielded unlimited license. All this was touched upon very lightly; and these are my own inferences rather than my father's assertions.
               "Time went on, until Clyde was fifteen. I, meanwhile, had been for years at boarding-school, and now had just entered college. Between us two brothers there had always been a very strong affection, although we knew comparatively little about each other. Indeed, I knew but little of the home-life of the family, so much of my childhood and youth had been spent elsewhere. One day there came to me a letter from my father, telling me that Clyde had been thrown from a horse and very severely injured. He bade me be in readiness to come home at a moment's warning, as he should send for me if ever the boy seemed to be in any immediate danger.
               "A week passed, and, as all the tidings that reached me were of a favorable character, I had almost ceased to be anxious, when the terrible summons came.
               
               "I hastened home, to find Clyde in extreme danger, and the whole household in a state of profound excitement. My stepmother had died suddenly the previous night. That was all that I knew at the time,—all that any one knew, excepting my father, the physician who attended Clyde, and the nurse. It is not necessary for me to linger here. She was buried. I saw the body, beautiful even in death, time and again, both before and after it was placed in the coffin. As I have said, I attended the funeral. Of the death and burial of Alice Armstrong there exists no doubt whatever."
               "I remember distinctly reading the Tribune's account of the funeral myself," I said.
               Sister Agnes looked at me for a moment with a strange expression. It almost seemed as if there was a little lurking humor in her sad eyes.
               "I read it also," she remarked, quietly.
               "Go on, Kenneth," said Dr. Bellinger.
               "For weeks after that, Clyde hovered between life and death. He had been most devotedly attached to his mother, and his physician at once forbade all allusions to her or her death in his presence. As he became convalescent,—slightly so,—everything that could remind him of her was carefully kept out of his sight.
               "We came to Altona. Of the life of my father and Clyde during the next five years, Miss Rossiter and Patsy know more than I do,—for I was here only during my vacations. But Clyde was never, after that injury, just what he was before. He seemed to have but a faint, undefined memory of his mother; and even that was painful. I never heard him speak of her after her burial.
               "That night—the memorable night of my father's death—he told me what had hitherto been sedulously concealed from me as from all others. Then, for the first time, I learned of the awful shadow that overhung my poor Clyde."
               He was silent for a few moments, shielding his eyes with his hand, while his lips were white and set.
               "But," said Dr. Bellinger, gently, "you told us yesterday that Clyde was implicated in his mother's death. How was that?"
               "I will tell you in a moment," he answered. "I am coming now to the hardest part of my story. Clyde, as I have said, was injured by being thrown from a horse. It was a handsome, high-spirited animal, but half broken; and my father had given especial orders that the boy should never mount him. I inferred, from his few reticent words, that my stepmother had yielded to Clyde's boyish entreaties, countermanded this order, and granted the permission that he had denied. You know the result.
               "I should, perhaps, have said, a month ago, that it was a part of the divine system of retribution when from that hour Clyde's passionate love for his mother was changed into unspeakable dread and horror. But the experiences of the last few weeks have taught me charity. I believe now that it was only the effect of disease, and that the result might have been the same even if she had been the wisest and most conscientious of mothers."
               Sister Agnes interrupted him with a low, tremulous cry. "You believe that Kenneth Armstrong? Tell me, in God's name, do you really believe that?"
               He looked at her curiously for a moment. "I do, most certainly," he answered.
               She fell back in her seat, covered her face with her hands, and I saw the tears trickle through her clasped fingers.
               "But, whatever may have been the cause, there was no doubt as to the fact. His mother's presence invariably threw Clyde into the wildest paroxysms of delirium. He would scream at the sight of her and exhibit an insane fury that was most appalling. Yet she persisted in entering the room. God forbid that I should do her injustice! Doubtless she was herself half wild with anxiety and pain, and 'knew not what she did.'"
               As for me, my attention was becoming so engrossed with Sister Agnes that I almost lost my interest in Kenneth's story. At these words her hands dropped from her face, and she threw upon the speaker a look of gratitude that was not to be mistaken. She must be an impostor, of course. But I thought her a remarkably good actress.
               "At last," continued Kenneth, "the physician peremptorily forbade her presence in Clyde's chamber, declaring that if she did not obey his orders he could not answer for the consequences. But that night, in defiance of all this, she stole into the room. Clyde was wide awake, but quiet. The nurse motioned her away, but she persisted in remaining. Suddenly Clyde turned and saw her. With a wild cry of fear and horror, he snatched a small bronze figure from a bracket over the bed, and hurled it at her with all the strength of madness.
               "It struck her just above the right temple, felling her to the floor; while, all his strength gone, Clyde cowered under the bedclothes like a frightened child, shivering and weeping. Just then my father and the physician entered the room. One glance told the whole story. They lifted her from the floor and bore her to her own chamber. But all efforts to restore her were utterly in vain. She must have died instantly; for there was not a beat of the pulse, a throb of the heart, after she fell; only one little gasp, one slight spasm of the lips.
               "After the first agony was over, my father's thoughts went back to Clyde; and from that moment to the hour of his own death, it seems to me, he had no thought but for him. He was, indeed, the 'ocean to the river of his thoughts, that terminated all.' The servants were asleep, the house was still. No one outside of that room knew of the tragedy the night had brought forth. What passed between my father, the physician, and the nurse I do not know; he was in the hour and article of death when he told me these things, and there was no time for many words. But in the morning the world knew that Mrs. John Armstrong had suddenly died, and it knew nothing more. Dr. ——, it was announced, had been in the house at the time, and everything had been done that could be done. There was the usual amount of awe and wonder; there were the usual exclamations of surprise and pity. Then she was buried, and the stream of life flowed on as before."
               
               "But," asked Dr. Bellinger, "was there no disfigurement, nothing to betray this secret to those who must have seen the body?"
               "There was a deep cut high up on the temple," was the answer; "but when the hair was drawn over it, after the fashion of the day, it was not perceptible. There was——"
               He stopped and started violently, leaning forward to gaze at Sister Agnes.
               "My God!" he cried. "Woman, who and what are you?"
               She had torn off her quaint cap with its concealing band, letting her long, beautiful white hair fall over her shoulders. As I turned to look at her, drawn by his exclamation, she rose with a faint smile, and pushed it back from her forehead.
               "I am your stepmother,—Alice Armstrong," she said. "There is the scar, Kenneth!"
               As with one impulse, we all sprang to our feet. But Dr. Bellinger, cool and self-possessed as ever, quietly motioned us to our seats again. Kenneth was trembling like a leaf; and at a sign from the doctor, Patsy brought him a glass of wine. After he had drained it, and his face had grown a little less ghastly, Dr. Bellinger said,—
               "I want to ask you a question or two, Kenneth, less for myself than for the satisfaction of these ladies. What induced this concealment as to the cause of Mrs. Armstrong's death?"
               Before he answered this question, Kenneth moved his seat to a position from which he could not see Sister Agnes; and I noticed that from this time until she began to speak for herself, he did not once look at her.
               "My father had a great deal of family pride," he said. "He shrank sensitively from the talk, the gossip, the scandal, that was sure to follow a revelation of the facts. He could not bear that he and his should become a nine days' wonder. This I feel instinctively. But there were still more powerful reasons. With this hereditary tendency to insanity, there would have been no hope for Clyde if this fearful story had once been revealed to him. Had he once known himself to have been even the innocent slayer of his mother, he would have gone mad at once."
               "But when convalescence came, had he no recollection of the events of that night?"
               "None whatever; and at first my father had no intention of leaving New York. But, as the days rolled on, it became evident to him and to Dr. —— that upon one point Clyde's mind was fatally unhinged. The slightest allusion to his mother—even the sight of objects remotely connected with her—seemed to bring on returns of the old dread and horror that had once culminated so fearfully. At last Dr. —— said that there was no safety for him save in an entire breaking up of all old associations, the beginning of an entirely new life, where nothing in nature, in places, or in the faces of those around him should recall his past. For this reason my father sacrificed his business, his friendships, his habits of life, his hopes, and his ambitions. He had so large an acquaintance, he was so widely known in business and political circles, that no half-way measures were possible. If he had remained in the world, every day would have brought danger to Clyde: so he dropped out of it, almost as a star drops from the sky. From that time his whole life was devoted to one object,—to save Clyde.
               "The night he died he told me this sad story, and placed in my hands the charge he dropped at the gates of the grave. God knows I have tried to keep it! You know now, Miss Rossiter, why we never left Altona; why we shunned society; why I so dreaded Clyde's going to New York; why——"
               "I understand all, Kenneth!" I interrupted. "Everything—from first to last. And I know why your father denied himself the solace of Clyde's presence when he was upon his death-bed."
               "Doubtless," he replied, "he feared lest, in his weakness, some unguarded word might escape him. Those newspapers—do you remember?—I destroyed them; for they were printed in '51, and I dreaded lest Clyde should find in them some allusion to his mother's death,—something to awaken memory."
               Elsie was weeping silently. I wondered whether much else that had been dark was not now made clear.
               Kenneth's pale face and the evident distress this over-raking of the ashes of the past was causing him, were quite too much for Patsy. She had been struggling with herself for half an hour, now wiping her eyes, with sorrowful yet indignant sniffs, now casting fierce glances at Sister Agnes. As Kenneth ceased to speak, she dashed across the room and caught his hand in hers, roughened and hardened by a life of labor.
               "This is too bad, my boy!" she cried, while tears rained down her cheeks. "If no one else speaks, I will. Tell that woman to go home! What right has she to come here, disturbing Kenneth's peace of mind, and poor Clyde not yet cold in his grave? Tell her to go home, Dr. Bellinger! Dead folks is dead folks; and after they have been buried wellnigh on to seven years they don't most generally come to life again. I don't fancy talking in this way before my betters, but I wouldn't mind telling that woman she was a humbug, myself!"
               "Hush, hush, Patsy, my good, faithful Patsy!" said Kenneth, pressing the hard hand in both his. "Sister Agnes must not go till she has told her story. I should have no peace if she did. We must hear what she has to say."
               "Yes," remarked Dr. Bellinger. "This matter must be sifted to the bottom now. Sister Agnes, we are ready to hear you; and I venture to say, in behalf of this entire company, that we will listen kindly and patiently."
               "Don't speak for me, doctor," was Patsy's protest, earnestly yet respectfully uttered. "That scar didn't make a mite of an impression on me. I've had one on my temple more'n twenty year. Look a-there!" And she pushed back her iron-gray locks defiantly.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXV.
               DR. BELLINGER laughed in spite of himself; and, notwithstanding the deep solemnity of the moment, the sound did us all a world of good. How could human nature bear the intenseness of life, if it were not that some touch of the ludicrous so often lessens the strain upon the overtaxed nerves? Even Kenneth's face relaxed for an instant, and we all settled ourselves more comfortably in our chairs. There was a moment's pause, and then Sister Agnes began, in low, tremulous tones.
               "It is not strange," she said, "that most of you—perhaps all of you—have prejudged my case, and regard me as an arrant impostor; and I thank you for the courtesy that grants me a hearing. Your story, Kenneth Armstrong, was entirely correct—so far as it went—until you reached the burial, the supposed burial, of Clyde's mother. But I cannot begin at that point. From first to last my story complements yours, and I must go back to the hour when your father first met Alice L'Amoreau. Of her I prefer to speak in the third person, instead of the first, until I shall have proved conclusively that she and the person who has been known for seven years as 'Sister Agnes' are one.
               "She was young, impulsive, of an ardent, ill-regulated temperament. Her family had been possessed of great wealth; but—owing, doubtless, in a great degree to the hereditary taint of which mention has been made—it had slowly slipped away from them; and at the time your father made her acquaintance she was living as a dependent in the family of one of her richer relatives. You say it was a sudden, irresistible fascination on his part. I beg you to believe that on hers it was a young girl's eager, enthusiastic love. He urged a hasty marriage, and she was but too glad to escape from hateful dependence, from cold charity, to the tender arms that were stretched wide to receive her.
               "A few days before their marriage, your father, in some chance conversation, happened to speak of his intense horror of insanity. He said that it seemed to him the most terrible curse that could be entailed upon a family, and that he doubted if any man had a right to marry, knowing that he carried in his own being seeds that might bear such bitter fruit. Then Alice should have spoken. If she had been thoroughly truthful, she could not have refrained from speaking. If she had loved unselfishly, she would have sacrificed her own heart, if need be, but she would have told John Armstrong the whole truth. But she kept silent, and allowed herself to drift on toward marriage, knowing that hate might take the place of love in her husband's heart, if he ever discovered the deception she had practiced. That he did not tell you of her sin, her weakness, only shows that he was worthy of a better fate than awaited him. Her only hope lay in the fact that her new home was to be among entire strangers, where perhaps her skeleton would never be unveiled.
               
               "But murder will out. Clyde was born; and soon after, some idle wind bore to Mr. Armstrong's ears the dreadful secret she had hidden so long. There was a change in their relations from that hour. He heaped no reproaches upon her. He simply asked her if these things were so; and, with his truth-compelling eyes reading her very soul, she could only answer 'yes'. She was his wife; and outwardly there was no alteration in his demeanor toward her. He was too good a man to be other than a faithful and, in a certain sense, a tender husband. But—she read her fate in his eyes. She felt that in spite of his will (or perhaps by reason of it) he recoiled from her.
               "And she grew hard and bitter. Her stormy, passionate, yet loving nature could not brook the doom she had brought upon herself. It struggled and rebelled; and in the struggle the sweetest flowers of her womanhood were trampled in the dust.
               "In her heart of hearts she knew that she was not fit to take the management of Clyde: they were too much alike. She should have left him to the control of his clear-headed, consistent, yet always tender father. But she would not. Pride and a wicked spirit of revenge confronted her like dragons. She had lost her husband. She would not give up her child also.
               "I need not linger longer upon this part of my story. You know how it all ended. She died, as was supposed,—killed by Clyde's hand,—and was placed in her coffin."
               Up to this moment we had scarcely breathed. Upon every one of us, I think, a conviction of the truth of this woman's words was growing; and we were listening, as those who hearken for their lives, to the clear, thrilling tones that filled the stillness of the room. But now her voice faltered and broke.
               "Rest a moment," said Dr. Bellinger, gently; and Patsy, without a word, brought her a glass of water. I could not see Kenneth's face. It was hidden by his hand.
               At length she went on:
               "She was placed in the coffin, which was, fortunately, left unclosed. Suddenly she felt a thrill, a tremor, a strange prickling sensation in her feet and hands. There was a ringing in her ears. She did not know whether she was in the body or out. She strove to move, but she could not. She tried to tell whether her heart was beating; but, if it was, its pulsations were so faint as to be imperceptible to her dull senses. Was she dead or alive?
               "But while she waited, bound hand and foot as it were, there was a great throb,—a rush of life-giving influence from the heart to the brain. Her eyes opened. She lived again.
               "For five minutes, perhaps, she was conscious of only this. Then slowly memory woke from its long trance. She recollected all that had happened; she fully realized her situation. And with remembrance, came such a flood of anguish and remorse that the only wonder is that she did not swoon again. For the first time her soul stood naked and ashamed before God, and she saw in its true colors the course she had been pursuing. It was comparatively easy for her to forgive herself for the first deceit,—the concealment cealment practiced by a girl who loved. But when she thought of her persistent efforts to thwart her husband in his endeavors to counteract the evil her own falsehood had entailed upon Clyde, her heart sank dead within her.
               "Her resolution was taken. What reparation could she make but to flee from their presence forever? Clyde's fear and horror of her seemed to indicate her duty. It was a judgment sent upon her by a righteous God. She was dead to them and to the world, and dead she would remain.
               "She was in her own chamber. A shaded lamp burned dimly. She crept silently from the coffin, fearing every moment the approach of the watchers. She glanced at the dress in which they had clothed her for the tomb. It was a plain black silk, entirely unnoticeable. There was a water-proof cloak in the wardrobe—with a hood to draw over the head—and a pair of slippers.
               "But her strength was failing her. It must last her until she had fled from that house, out into the night, God only knew whither. There was brandy in a cupboard, and a cracker. She ate and drank hastily,—fearing discovery every instant. Then she had presence of mind enough to unlock her own escritoire and take therefrom a purse. It would keep her from starvation until she could form her plans for the future.
               "The window, which was unclosed, opened out upon a balcony. From that, a grape-vine with a light trellis led to the ground. Silently as a dream she descended from bar to bar, the very leaves hanging motionless to aid her flight.
               "The streets were hushed. What time was it? She could not wander about in the darkness without danger of insult, or at least of being taken up by the police. She looked with straining gaze far off into the east. There was a faint streak of light touching the horizon.
               "She crept round the corner of the house into the next street, and there crouched in the shadow of a wall until the morning dawned. She had slipped the brandy-flask into her pocket, and by occasional swallows kept herself alive. Now she drained the last drop,—threw the flask on a heap of garbage, and began to move onward. She wandered along, up one street and down another, vaguely conscious that this must soon end, until suddenly she discovered herself in front of the gray towers of St. Elizabeth's Hospital. Then her strength left her, and she sank to the ground.
               "When she came to herself, she was in one of the wards, and gentle hands were removing her clothing. Only one article that she had about her person was marked, and that she managed to secrete.
               "She lay in a state of semi-consciousness for several days,—a great part of the time too weak for anything like connected thought. But one day life's forces rallied fully, and, for the first time, she attempted to speak. She wanted to see a newspaper, and discover, if she could, whether any notice had been taken of her flight.
               "To her amazement, she found that she could not utter a word. Her vocal organs seemed paralyzed. Her first impulse was to cry out, and give instant alarm. Her second was to be silent and reflect. In the brief intervals during which she had been able to think, she had determined to remain as a nurse at St. Elizabeth's. Nowhere could she be more effectually hidden than in the heart of a great city. No one would think of looking for her in the wards of a hospital; and it seemed fitting that she should devote the remainder of her days, be they few or many, to the care of God's suffering ones. Now, as a flash of lightning, came the thought that this dumbness would be the most effective of disguises, even while it protected her from careless or impertinent questioning.
               "In the course of time she regained her strength, and proved by her deeds that she was capable of nursing the sick. The very first patient to whom she devoted herself was a Romanist; and in his delirium he called her continually 'Sister Agnes.' It mattered little to her by what name she went, now that she was no longer Alice Armstrong, and she let it pass. By that name she has been known ever since."
               She ceased; and for a few moments the room was as silent as the grave from which, according to her story, Mrs. Armstrong had been rescued. This tale seemed plausible enough to me; but there was the stubborn fact of the funeral. There was no getting around that, and my heart hardened against her again. Kenneth sat as motionless as a statue. At length Dr. Bellinger spoke.
               "Admitting this improbable story to be true,—and here, as I shall put my questions directly to you, I beg you to waive your scruples and answer in the first person,—did you never make any further attempt to learn how your flight was received?"
               "I could make no inquiries," she answered, "without exciting suspicion. But one day I came across an old Tribune. Heaven must have sent it to prove to me, beyond a doubt, that my old life was dead and buried, and could have no resurrection. In it I read an account of my own funeral. It hardened my heart for awhile. But my husband was a good man and a just, and I long ago taught myself to feel that when we meet in the great hereafter we shall understand and forgive each other."
               Kenneth started up with a flushed face and quivering lip,—then sank back into his seat again, and again covered his eyes with his hand.
               "Do you mean to say that your mother-love never compelled you, irresistibly, to obtain some tidings of Clyde?" asked Dr. Bellinger. "Did you never learn what had become of the family?"
               "You forget that for months I could not speak," she replied, "and to have written on such a matter would have been too hazardous. But I was wild with longing. The suspense was hardly to be borne. One day, late in the autumn, I discovered that my voice had returned to me. I could speak. I kept my secret; but that evening, just at dusk, I shrouded myself in a heavy cloak and veil, and sped swiftly through the streets until I reached a point from which I could see my lost Eden,—the home where I had once loved and been loved. The gas was lighted in the drawing-room, and the curtains were not yet dropped. I crept nearer and looked in. There was a happy wife there, frolicking with the baby on her lap. There were merry children laughing in their glee. There was a husband and father smiling on his loved ones. But I saw no face I had ever seen before. I turned away, and a ragged little urchin—a street-beggar—stretched out his hand with the usual 'Gi' me a penny?' I dropped five times the amount in his open palm, and then asked, 'Is not this the Armstrong place?' 'Used to be,' he answered; 'but they've gone off somewheres. Don't live here no more.' I hesitated; then ventured one more question. 'You seem to know something about them,' I said. 'Did you ever hear whether the boy who was thrown from the horse last summer got well or not?' 'Guess he did,' was the answer, 'for I hang out round here mostly, and I never heard o' his dyin'. What yer want to know fur, mum? He wasn't nothin' to you, was he?' This random shot took effect, and I hurried away. By indirect means I did at last learn for a certainty that Clyde recovered, and that the family had left the city."
               "But why, in the name of common sense and reason, did you come here and throw yourself into Clyde's way?" was Dr. Bellinger's next question.
               "Do you suppose I knew where I was going when I left New York?" she asked, indignantly. "I obeyed your summons in all good faith. Miss Meredith merely told me that you needed my services. I had been under your orders for seven years, and it mattered little to me whether you required my presence in the hospital or out of it. No names were mentioned; and it was not until I entered this room and my husband's eyes frowned down upon me from yonder picture on the wall, striking cold terror to my soul,—it was not till then, I say, that I had the slightest suspicion under whose roof my patient lay. Then I would have fled, but my limbs failed me. You know what followed. You know how you entreated me to remain, telling me that Clyde's life hung in the balance. I learned from your words that Mr. Armstrong was dead. I had grown old and faded; my hair was white. It was not probable that Kenneth would recognize in the poor dumb nurse of St. Elizabeth's the woman who had once reigned as a queen in his father's house. And oh, doctor!" she cried, clasping her hands, as if in supplication, "oh, you!"—turning to us,—"you, who have tender women's hearts in your bosoms, my heart yearned over my child! I could not, when God seemed to have called me to his bedside, turn away without one look, one word, one caress. I meant to leave him as soon as he showed signs of convalescence. I had no intention of making myself known to him or to any one. He died. I determined to wait until my beautiful boy was buried, and then to depart as I had come. But when you all went with him to the place of sepulture, and I—the mother who bore him—was left behind as a careless stranger in this silent house, I could not bear it. I fell on the floor before my husband's portrait. His eyes transfixed me I thought I should go mad. My burden was too heavy,—too grievous to be borne. Then I heard your returning footsteps,—and with no premeditation, out of the stress of pain and agony, I spoke. Dr. Bellinger, you have known me long,— and I know I have earned the right to your confidence. I beg you to believe that I speak the truth!"
               "What if it is true, after all?" whispered Patsy, wiping her eyes with her apron. "Miss Rossiter, I'm e'en a'most beat out. I don't know what to make on't!"
               Kenneth had scarcely looked at Sister Agnes since she began her story. Now Dr. Bellinger spoke:
               "Look at her, Kenneth. If this woman is the person she professes to be, you surely ought to be able to detect some resemblance to your stepmother, as you remember her."
               Kenneth glanced at her for a second; then turned his eyes away. "It is not necessary for me to study her features one by one," he said. "There is a resemblance. I admit it frankly. I noticed it as soon as she removed her cap. But I maintain that it is only accidental, and is probably what suggested this plot. The fact that my father was a man of honor and integrity, and that with his consent and co-operation the coffin from which this woman says that she escaped, was placed in our family-vault, is a sufficient refutation of her story. If he had been a villain, he might have chosen that way to break a marriage-tie that had grown hateful. But his whole life, his whole character, gives the lie to such a supposition. This person labors under some strange hallucination. It would be treason to my father's memory for me to believe otherwise for one moment."
               "If Sister Agnes is Mrs. Armstrong, and wa'n't buried,—and it stands to reason she wa'n't,—who or what was? That's the question!" said Patsy, concisely.
               "A question that is easily answered," replied the doctor. "Kenneth, with your permission I will enter that vault and examine the coffin before another twenty-four hours have passed. For myself,—now that I have been drawn into this strange complication,—I must unravel the mystery to the very bottom. It is my duty. Will you tell me where to find the key? It is best, my boy," he added, gently, seeing that Kenneth winced at the unwelcome thought. "You will be haunted all your life long if you do not solve this riddle now."
               Kenneth rose with an impenetrable face. "The key to the vault is in the safe," was all he said.
               He went into the little room adjoining. We heard him open one door after another. There was a moment's silence, and then he came back with the key. In his hand there was also a paper,—folded and sealed. I recognized it in a moment, and my heart leaped to my throat.
               Kenneth's face was white and stern, as he turned the paper over and over in his hand. Finally he said, in a deep, hoarse voice, "The night my father died, he gave me this paper, sealed as you see it now. I was to open it under certain contingencies, which were so vaguely stated that I hardly understood them. I felt that in his weakness he failed to make his meaning clear; and I had determined never to break this seal, but to let it be burned unopened at my death,—the fate he had in that case decreed for it. I have not once thought of it since Clyde was taken sick; but I found it in the safe just now. Friends, ought I to open it?"
               
               "Most decidedly," answered Dr. Bellinger. "It seems to me you can do nothing less."
               You could have heard a pin drop as Kenneth broke the seal and the paper rustled in his fingers. He glanced rapidly down the page, caught a word here and there, turned it over and looked at the signature. Even from where I sat I could read in a large, bold hand the name "John Armstrong." Great beaded drops stood upon his forehead. The paper fell upon the table, and he pushed it toward the doctor.
               "Read it," he said, faintly. "I cannot."
               This is what he read:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "I, John Armstrong, being of sane mind and sound body, yet knowing that old age is approaching and that death cannot be far off, feel that I ought to put upon record facts that may some time be of importance. The coffin that was placed in my family-vault in Greenwood Cemetery, in the city of New York, on the twentieth day of June, A.D. 1851, did not contain, as was supposed, the body of my wife Alice L'Amoreau Armstrong. She died on the eighteenth of that month. The body was prepared for the grave in the usual manner, and on the evening of the nineteenth was placed in the coffin, ready for burial on the following day. It stood, unclosed, in the room adjoining mine. About midnight, worn out by days and nights of anxious watching and by a grief that cannot be told, I fell into a profound sleep. After two or three hours, I was suddenly awakened. I heard no noise, yet the impression was strong upon me that I had been aroused from my deep slumber by stealthy footsteps on the balcony. Yet, so deadened were all my faculties, that it was several minutes before I realized that this was anything deserving of attention. When I did, I arose immediately and went into the next room. It was in disorder: chairs had been moved; some towels and napkins lay upon the floor; the window, which I had left open a little way, was thrown wide. I looked in the coffin.
                           "It was empty.
                           "I sprang out on to the balcony. The garden lay beneath it, hushed in complete repose. There was not a human being in sight, except one woman in a water-proof who was just turning the corner. Why did I not make an immediate outcry? Why did I not shout for the police?
                           "Because there were circumstances connected with her death, and with the condition of my son Clyde, that rendered it impossible. My son Kenneth, to whom before I go hence I shall commit the secret of those terrible days, will understand why I kept silence; and if it is ever necessary, he will vindicate me. My duty was to the imperiled living, rather than to the dead who was beyond the reach of earthly harm or sorrow. To have placed the matter in the hands of the police, to have made any disturbance whatever, would have been sure to call attention to what must at all hazards be concealed.
                           "On my knees in the room so much more drear and desolate than before it was deserted by its ghastly occupant, with a wordless prayer in my heart, I determined what to do.
                           "The body had been stolen, without a shadow of doubt, by those ghouls who prey upon the dead and traffic in such horrible merchandise. The thought was terrible beyond all expression. But—Kenneth knows why—any effort to regain it would have been too hazardous. The mockery of a funeral must be gone through with, and this secret must clasp hands with the other.
                           "I found some bricks and a log of wood, which I placed in the coffin, making them firm and steady by paddings of cloth and paper. Then I put on the lid and screwed it down. When the undertaker came the next morning, I told him that I had found it necessary to close the coffin, and that it must not be opened again. He supposed he understood me, and went his way.
                           "The funeral took place; and I gave orders that it should be in all respects more showy and noticeable than accorded with my tastes. It was a part of my plan. I wanted the world to remember it.
                           "Whether this was right or wrong, I leave to the great Judger of hearts and motives rather than of deeds. And though the ashes of Alice Armstrong do not lie in her husband's tomb, may God watch over them, and may his angels protect them; and may her soul and mine, purified at last through sorrow and anguish and much tribulation, meet in glad recognition beyond the veil!
                           "This statement is true, so help me God! And hereunto I set my hand and seal.
                           
                              "JOHN ARMSTRONG."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               I do not know whether we wept or not. I rather think our emotions were growing too highly wrought for tears. Kenneth was the first to speak,—very quietly, as one who held his whole being in leash.
               "Patsy, in a small closet in the darkest corner of the garret there is a portrait of Clyde's mother. I wish you would bring it to us; here is the key."
               She gave me one quick glance and a little nod, and then departed on her errand.
               "There is but one step more to be taken," said Kenneth, when she returned. "Just one. Is this" (uncovering it) "the portrait of the woman you have known as Sister Agnes? Friends, I leave the decision to you."
               "Allow me one word first," said Dr. Bellinger, rising and taking his stand behind Sister Agnes's chair. "According to the paper we have just read, it was in the night of the 19th and 20th of June that the body of Alice Armstrong was taken from the coffin. It was on the morning of the 20th that this woman"—and he placed his hand on her shoulder—"was found lying insensible near St. Elizabeth's, and was admitted as a patient. I happen to have the date in my note-book. Take that for what it is worth. Now for the portrait."
               Ah, how lovely it was! We glanced curiously from that pictured face to the one that, now flushing, now paling, made young again by the powerful excitement of the moment, looked half timidly, half defiantly at us from beneath Sister Agnes's crown of silvery hair. Suddenly there leaped to her dark eyes a look I had seen in Clyde's a thousand times. I could restrain myself no longer.
               
               "Kenneth! Kenneth!" I cried, "this is surely Clyde's mother! Look at her eyes!"
               She stretched out her arms, echoing my cry of "Kenneth!"—and in another moment, the long conflict over, he lay upon her breast, sobbing like a child.
               There were no congratulations. We only crowded round the two who had been so long and so strangely separated, with hearts too full for utterance. After awhile Dr. Bellinger said, under his breath,—
               "The eyes seem to have settled it,—but the portrait tells the same story." And he turned it with its face to the wall.
               Mrs. Armstrong lifted her head at last, and drew from her bosom a heavy gold ring, attached to a silken cord. "It is my wedding-ring, Kenneth," she said. "Here are your father's initials and mine, and the date of our marriage."
               He held it for a moment, while his features worked powerfully. Then he placed it on her finger.
               "'With this ring I thee wed,'" he said, reverently.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               PATSY, "on hospitable thoughts intent," wiped her eyes, and started for the door. Dinner must be seen to, come what may. Mrs. Armstrong stopped her.
               "Wait one moment," she said. "Before any one leaves this room, I must receive a pledge of secrecy from all of you. What has been made known here to-day belongs solely to us. It must go no further."
               Kenneth looked at her as one aghast; and a little murmur of astonishment ran round the room. Patsy sat down again.
               "You did not think," continued Mrs. Armstrong, turning her eyes from one to the other with soft, appealing glances,—"you did not think I meant, or would consent, that the world should ever hear this sad story?"
               "But it must hear it," said Kenneth. "How else can you resume your rightful place,—the station due to you as my father's widow?"
               She shook her head with grave dignity. "I shall never resume it, Kenneth. Alice Armstrong is dead and buried. For her there is no resurrection. Nay, nay,—hear me!" she cried, as he would have interrupted her with eager entreaties and expostulations. "Think but for one moment! I left my husband and child and home, because I felt it was the only reparation I could make for the evils I had brought upon them. The only atonement, the only expiation, I could make for the fatal error of my youth and the mad perverseness of my later years, was to remove myself from them as far as the east is from the west. I died to them and to the world, that night, as truly, as entirely, as if I had indeed been in the coffin that was carried in stately pomp to Greenwood. I gave your father at the last a chance to save Clyde. He had never had it before."
               "But Clyde, our poor Clyde, is gone," said Kenneth. "Nothing we do can help or harm him now. Let the dead past bury its dead. Your expiation——"
               "Is not ended," she said, solemnly, as he hesitated. "It is not ended. Look me in the face, Kenneth, and tell me if you think it would be right for me to betray the secret your father guarded so sacredly, and in the keeping of which he sacrificed the best years of his life. You say yourself that he shrank sensitively from being made, or from having Clyde made, the subject of public talk and scandal. Do you believe that death has changed him so entirely that if he could stand here in bodily presence to-day, he would not still shrink from the exposure of his family skeleton? I tell you that John Armstrong is John Armstrong still,—in the other world as in this."
               "This may be all true," Kenneth answered. "But you have your rights also. I must not let my loyalty to my father's memory, to his last expressed wishes, even, make me unjust to you."
               "Rights? I have none, save the right to continue the expiation I began so long ago. All my other rights were buried with Alice Armstrong. My friends," she continued, looking round upon us, "to you I am the widow of Clyde's father. An humbled, sorrowing, repentant woman, who would fain make such atonement as she may for the mistakes, the sins, of a lifetime. To the world—the small world that will know of me—I am still, and must remain, Sister Agnes of St. Elizabeth's. My vows were taken, not for months or years, but for life."
               We were all silent for a moment,—half from astonishment, half from an emotion strangely compounded of relief and sorrow. Probably each of us had done Mrs. Armstrong the injustice of doubting whether some alloy of earthly greed or selfishness had not joined with the anguish of mother-love in leading to this revelation.
               Kenneth looked at her for a moment with all his heart in his eyes; then he threw himself at her feet, and clasped her hand in both of his.
               "But you will at least receive a son's love from me, mother!" he exclaimed. "If this is really your wish, it shall be respected as sacredly as if it were the wish of one of God's angels. But surely John Armstrong's son—Clyde Armstrong's brother—cannot plead with you in vain. They speak to you through me!"
               We stole away and left them.
               In the rush and tumult of feeling consequent upon the exciting events of the morning, our hearts rebelled against Mrs. Armstrong's decision. Yet we knew, every one of us, that it was right and best. She was wise in her judgment. Let the ashes of the past rest undisturbed by the profane clamor and noisy babbling that would surely have followed a disclosure of the truth.
               One thing, however, we all insisted upon,—that she should no longer wear the mask of dumbness. She was safe now from impertinent questioning, and the disguise was no longer needed.
               "It is easily managed," said Dr. Bellinger. "You are to stay here for awhile and recruit, under my express orders. You are going to submit to treatment—severe medical treatment, madam—before I leave for New York, which will be on the morrow. I shall tell all our friends at St. Elizabeth's that there is a fair chance of your recovering your speech. And you will recover it. A plain case, you perceive; easy as a—b—c."
               Which programme was faithfully carried out.
               A peace and quiet whose blessedness I cannot describe to you, seemed to settle down upon us after Dr. Bellinger left. Sister Agnes—for by that name she desired us all to call her, saying that detection would be sure to follow our use of her real title—was never weary of asking questions about her husband, about Clyde, their habits, their devotion to each other, and all the little, trifling details of daily living. She and I sat together in the clear mornings, in the still noontides, in the soft twilights, talking—sometimes sadly, but for the most part brightly and tenderly—of the two whose graves were growing green in the glad spring sunshine.
               One day we sat in my little parlor, sewing and chatting, as women will. She was growing so fair, so young, in this enforced quiet, with the burden of an unshared secret weighing her down no longer, and her heart's hungry cravings in a measure satisfied. She still wore her quaint caps, and we were all glad of it. They were a part of the picture we could not afford to lose.
               Elsie and Kenneth were out in the porch, saying little, but quietly content. No word of love had passed between them; but gradually, I could see, they were coming to know each other's hearts. Slowly but surely the barrier that had grown up between them was melting away. Suddenly through the stillness Elsie's voice stole soft and low, singing, as on the evening that seemed so long ago,—though it was not yet a year,—the Song of Elaine, the Lily Maid of Astolat.
               Sister Agnes held her breath to listen.
               "Tell me," she whispered, as the last note died away. "Do they two love each other? Is Kenneth caught in the meshes of her golden hair, even as my poor Clyde was?"
               I told her the whole story,—how Kenneth had loved her first,—how like a thunderbolt out of the clear heavens had come the knowledge of Clyde's passion,—how Kenneth had withdrawn from the lists himself, while at the same time he had striven to build up walls of adamant between his brother and Elsie. It was all so clear now!
               Pretty soon the children, as we elderly women delighted to call them, strayed off up the hill to the conservatory,—coming back in half an hour with a basket full of the flowers Clyde had so loved and tended. They sat upon the steps a few moments, enjoying their delicious perfume. Then Elsie brought her hat and shawl, and they disappeared down the winding road. We knew, well enough, where they were going.
               "Clyde's memory will be another tie between them some day," said Sister Agnes, gazing after them with brimming eyes.
               A little bird told me what happened that afternoon in May, dear reader, and I will tell it to you.
               Leaving the main road, they wandered on, up the grassy slopes, through the meadows white with strawberry-blossoms, and along the curving river-banks, until they reached the graveyard on the far hillside. Their talk had been in commonplaces at first,—of the sunshine, and the birds, and the soft, warm airs that rustled the tree-tops. But gradually it had taken a deeper tone, and drifted on into those regions where the mask of conventionalism drops off and soul speaks to soul. They talked of life, of its glorious possibilities, its aspirations, and its mighty endeavors. They spoke of God, of heaven, and of eternity. And they spoke lovingly and tenderly of Clyde.
               Above them was the far blue sky, around them the wide sweep of the everlasting hills, at their feet a grave,—two graves,—flower-strewn, wherein "the weary were at rest." Elsie's eyes were bent upon them, but her thoughts had winged their flight far beyond moon and star, and she saw the Great White Throne, and Him that sitteth on it.
               Kenneth saw her, and her only. "Elsie," he said, at last, "do you remember what you said to me, one October afternoon, when we had been reading 'The Lotus-Eaters'?"
               Her face crimsoned, tears sprang to her blue eyes, and she reached out her two hands impulsively. "Remember it? Kenneth, Kenneth, I was so cruel, so unjust!" she cried. "But I did not know,—I did not understand. It was all such a mystery——"
               "Hush, hush!" he whispered, softly, lifting a white rosebud from Clyde's grave and laying it against her lips. "No such words are needed. You were true and sincere and womanly,—that was all." He was silent for a moment,—then went on in low, eager, passionate tones, while his steadfast eyes sought hers and held them. "I loved you then," he said, "with a love strong as death, and just as hopeless. I love you now with a love that dares to claim you, even beside this grave. On my bended knees I prayed then that you might not care for me. But to-day—Elsie! my sibyl, my inspirer, sole love of my boyhood, sole hope of my manhood, teach me how to win you!"
               The little bird refused to tell me another word. But by the light that illumined their faces when they came down from the hill,—"the light that never was on sea or land,"—we knew that she was won.
               Little more remains to be told.
               Once again the two—Elsie and Kenneth—tried to persuade Sister Agnes to give up her work at St. Elizabeth's, and live with them,—if not as an acknowledged mother, yet as their most cherished friend and counselor. But it was of no avail. The most they could win from her was a promise that when she could work no longer she would rest in the warm shelter of their love and care. With that they were forced to be content.
               Three years afterward there was a wedding in my small parlor. It was the wish of both to be married in Altona. So, one summer morning, with no pomp or parade, no bustle of bridesmaids and groomsmen, no rustling of satins or fluttering of laces, the two were made one. But the bride! Ah, I wish you could all have seen how fair and sweet and lovely she was!
               They went away immediately, for Kenneth's place now was elsewhere. There were no more days of æsthetic idleness for him; for out in the busy world of men he had already taken rank with those who labor and achieve. Elsie's "hero" would one day win the lofty height she had craved for him.
               But they could not give up Greyholt. It was hallowed by too many memories. So, at their request, I left my own little brown cottage, and Patsy and I, with Dennis for our faithful servitor, keep the old place fresh and bright. Every summer they come to us, and for days and weeks the sound of light footsteps, happy, love-tuned voices, and ringing laughter echoes from hall and chamber. Sometimes Dr. Bellinger joins us; and Sister Agnes always,—still in her gray dress and nun-like cap. But dearest of all—most welcome of all—is the little Clyde, whose rosy face softens in the twilight when Sister Agnes takes him on her knee and tells him stories of that other Clyde who lies at rest upon the hillside.
               As for her, with her placid face, her saintly ways, she has learned the blessedness of renunciation, the peace that clasps hands with patience. We who know her best—who know of her voluntary, life-long expiation of the errors of her youth—think that no saint among them all was more worthy of canonization than our Sister Agnes of St. Elizabeth's.
            
            THE END.
