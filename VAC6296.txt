The book is a series of sketches, by a lady who is evidently familiar with the usages of fashionable life, and who can lay claim to the possession of very considerable literary ability. The descriptions are lively and truthful, with a dash of espieglerie and sly sarcasm, that clearly betoken a more than ordinary amount of cleverness and observation on the part of the writer. The dialogue is a faithful reproduction of the light, gossipy conversation of people of ton, and is natural and free."—Evening Express, Nov. 12.

                     —BRYANT.
                  
               
               ONE bright morning in August—it is not important, gentle reader, that you should know how many years ago—a little girl stood at the door of a small brown house in one of those beautiful valleys that nestle so lovingly in the very embrace of the Green Mountains. Shading her eyes from the glaring sunshine with one hand, while with the other she kept firm hold of the heavy iron doorlatch, she leaned forward and looked eagerly down the winding road.
               But it was not to dwell upon the loveliness of the scene before her, although you might have gone far in search of the sublime and beautiful before you would have found them more harmoniously blended than in that quiet valley. She would have opened her eyes wonderingly, perhaps, if you had told her so. The tiny lake—indeed it was scarcely more than a pond—sparkled and flashed beneath the morning sun; the skies that bent over her were very blue; the mountains were surpassingly beautiful, as they lifted their proud heads calmly and majestically, and strove to throw off the light veil of mist that still clung caressingly about them; the fields of waving corn were a deep rich green, and the brown patches of cleared land upon the hill-side formed a charming contrast to the dark and sombre hue of the stately pines; yet these things had been familiar to her from her very babyhood, and she had never even stopped to think that they were beautiful.
               She was gazing upon a little red house, destitute of ornament, and with not even a single tree from which it might borrow grace and beauty; not a vine clung round the uncurtained windows; scarcely a blade of grass dared to spring up before the door, for it was the district school-house, and the constant tread of busy little feet frightened the intruders away before they had time to gain strength and vigor. Yet never did poet-pilgrim to the storied shrines of old, pause before fane or temple, castle or hall, rich in those memories and associations that can hallow even the humblest thing, with a gaze more rapt, or a more earnest eye, than that with which the child looked upon that unpretending little building. A group of children, with their dinner-baskets upon their arms, were slowly sauntering towards the door, and as she saw them her eyes filled with tears, and her lip trembled.
               "Oh, if I could only go to school!" she murmured.
               But just then a low, tremulous voice from within the house called "Mary! Mary!" and hastily dashing away her tears, she sprang to her mother's bedside.
               "Tommy makes so much noise, my child. Can't you contrive to keep him quiet? My head aches badly this morning."
               "I will try, mother," was the reply, as Mary turned towards a noisy little fellow who was playing on the floor. "But shan't I bring you something to take first?"
               "No, dear, I only want to sleep."
               "Come then, Tommy, let's go out of doors, and see if we can't find some flowers."
               But no. Tommy didn't want flowers; he didn't like them at all; but down by the bridge there were such pretty, shining stones, just as smooth as the marbles Willy Gibson gave him, and he should like very much to go there and get some.
               "But, Tommy, it is so warm! We can't go now. Wait till the sun has gone down."
               "No, no! Go now," said Master Tommy.
               "Oh, Tommy, you don't know how hot it is! See, here, stoop down and put your hand on the door-step. There! it almost burned you, and the sand in the road is just as hot as it can be!"
               "But it won't burn my shoes, and I want to go now."
               "Do wait, Tommy. What do you want of the stones?"
               "Want them to play with," replied the child; and Mary, finding that she could not dissuade him without troubling her mother, threw on her sun-bonnet and started for the bridge.
               It was intensely hot. The sun had by this time climbed far up towards the zenith, and the trees that at rare intervals threw their shadows across the road, seemed to afford no shelter from his fervid beams. The panting cattle stood knee-deep in the water, lazily brushing away with their long tails the flies that annoyed them; and not a breath rippled the surface of the lake, or stirred the dusty leaves.
               Before they reached the bridge, Tommy began to wish himself in the house again, and to grow cross and fretful; and when they were fairly there, nothing was right; the stones were not half as pretty as they were the other day; there was no nice place to sit down; and there was not a single fish to be seen.
               "Here is a shady place, Tommy," said his sister; "come, sit down and rest yourself before we go home."
               He obeyed, and Mary, bidding him lay his burning face in her lap, pushed the damp curls from his forehead, and fanned him with the hat he had thrown aside. Soon, to her utter dismay, she found that he was fast asleep.
               What was to be done now? They were at least a quarter of a mile from the house, and Mary knew from past experience that if Tommy was roused before he had had his nap out, the prettiest pebbles in the world would not make him good-natured.
               She grew uneasy and troubled. Her sick mother had been alone an hour, and she feared she was needed by her bedside. So, after waiting a little while longer, she placed her hand on Tommy's shoulder and shook him gently.
               "Come, Tommy, wake up; we must go home and see mother. It's almost time for the doctor to come."
               But the boy only moved his head uneasily for a moment, and then composed himself to sleep again.
               "Tommy, Tommy! come, we must go."
               Still he slept on quietly, and at last Mary rose from her seat and lifted him on his feet. The sleepy little fellow rubbed his eyes and stared vacantly about him, while Mary bathed his face in the water at their feet, and tied on his hat. But now a new difficulty presented itself. Tommy wouldn't walk. He was willing to go home, but he was tired, and the hot sand burned his feet, and he could not go unless Mary would carry him.
               "But you are so heavy, Tommy!"
               "But it's so hot, Mary!" and the little fellow began to cry most piteously.
               "Well, I told you it would be hot, but you wouldn't believe me."
               There was no help for it, and taking the child in her arms, Mary bore him homeward as rapidly as her strength would allow. But he was very heavy, the sun beat down upon her head, and her poor tired arms trembled beneath their unusual burden. Her cheeks became painfully flushed, and the perspiration in large drops rolled down her face and neck. Just then they passed the school-house, and from the open windows came the low hum of voices, the earnest question and the quick response; and she could see the forms of two or three young girls of her own age as they bent over their books.
               Our Mary was no heroine; she was a good, affectionate daughter and sister, and during the two years that her mother had been an invalid, she had, as the kind neighbors who occasionally came in to assist her, said, "done wonders." Nearly all the first year Mrs. Lester, although confined to the house, was able to go from room to room, and to take charge of her domestic affairs. But Tommy was just old enough to be in mischief, and the cow was always getting into the garden, and the hens were all the time straying off and laying their eggs in the most out of the way places imaginable, and so Mary must needs leave school, and be ready to attend to out-door matters, as well as to wait on mother.
               It was a great trial to the ambitious child; for in addition to an inborn thirst for knowledge—a thirst which neither unskilful teachers nor books ill adapted to her age or tastes had been able to check—she had been urged on by one hope, that, young as she was, had been for months "her thought by day, her dream by night." It was the hope of being one day able to teach school herself, and with the money she so earned she could buy a new merino dress and a nice shawl for her mother—hers was old and sadly faded—a coat for Tommy, and some books for herself. But she knew that her mother could not get along without her, even a part of the day, and she submitted so cheerfully that no one suspected the extent of her sorrow. For the last few months Mrs. Lester had been confined to her room, and much of the time to her bed, and Mary had had no time to indulge in vain regrets or repining thoughts.
               On the morning on which our story commences, however, some chance word or allusion had reawakened the old thoughts and feelings; and now, as she passed the school-house, hot and tired as she was, with Tommy in her arms, her tears fell thick and fast. But as she turned the corner and caught a glimpse of their own house, she saw the doctor's one-horse chaise standing before the gate.
               Hastily placing Tommy on the grass for a moment, she wiped her eyes, arranged her disordered tresses as smoothly as she could, and stole quietly in at the back door, hoping that she should be able to lay the boy on the bed in her own room unobserved.
               She succeeded in doing so, and in a very few moments Tommy had forgotten his troubles, and was sleeping as sweetly as if there were no such things as hot sand and pebble-stones in the world.
               Mary had bathed her face, brushed her hair, and was just going into the other room, when her steps were arrested by her mother's voice, which reached her through the half-open door.
               "I wish you would tell me frankly, doctor. You are an old friend, and you were with me in my deepest sorrow, when Mark died," and the widow's voice trembled. "Don't be afraid to tell me plainly. It is a fortnight since you saw me, and it seems to me that I have failed very much in that time."
               "You have, Mrs. Lester; you are much more feeble."
               "More feeble than you expected to find me, doctor? Tell me the whole truth."
               Dr. Williams hesitated for a moment, but he knew his patient well, and at length replied in a low voice—
               "Yes, on the whole I think you are."
               Mrs. Lester extended her thin, trembling hand, and placed it on Dr. Williams' arm ere she went on.
               "I knew long before you told me, doctor, that there was no hope of my recovery; I have felt it here, here," she said, laying her other hand upon her heart, "for a long time. Now I want you to tell me how long I can probably live. I ask for the sake of my children, and I want you to tell me the truth. You know I am not afraid to die, doctor," she continued more earnestly, seeing that her companion turned his head away and did not answer; "I know in whom I have believed, and I know that His grace will not fail me now."
               "You are right, my dear Mrs. Lester. I, too, know that it will not fail you. You may live two months, probably not longer."
               Mrs. Lester bowed her head, and her pale lips moved as if in prayer.
               But there was a trembling listener in the next room who could scarcely suppress the scream of agony that struggled for utterance, as those terrible words fell upon her ear. Mary, child that she was, had never dreamed that her mother would die. She had failed so slowly, so imperceptibly, that the child had scarcely thought of danger; and Mrs. Lester, thinking that "sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof," had shrunk from inflicting unnecessary suffering upon her daughter.
               Now the blow had fallen with awful suddenness, and softly closing the door, Mary threw herself upon the bed by the side of Tommy and wept silently, but oh, so bitterly! For a long time she heard a feeble voice mingling with that of the doctor in the adjoining room; but at length all was silent, and she knew that her mother was alone and needed refreshment. Mary had early been taught that it would not always do to yield to the dictates of feeling, even when purest and holiest; so, with a powerful effort, she rose from the bed, put back the hair that had fallen over her face, and tried to keep back the tears that still flowed as fast as ever. It was some little time before she succeeded, but at length she opened the door, and stole softly to her mother's side.
               "Why, are you there, my daughter? I did not know that you had come in."
               "Oh yes! mother. I came in some time ago, and Tommy is asleep. What will you have for your dinner?"
               "Nothing but a cup of tea and a bit of toast, dear. I have no appetite to-day. Dr. Williams said his wife would send me some broth this evening. How kind the neighbors all are!"
               Mary's tears were just ready to flow again, but she shut the flood-gates in time, and after tenderly kissing her mother's forehead and arranging the pillows more comfortably, she went into the little back kitchen or woodshed, where the stove stood during the hot summer months, and busied herself in preparing her mother's dinner.
               Presently she returned with a small tray in her hand, on which, in addition to the toast and tea, was a glass dish containing jelly of a pale amber hue. Mrs. Lester smiled faintly.
               "You have been very quick, Mary. Ah! where did this nice jelly come from?"
               "Mrs. Wilson sent it, mother; she made it on purpose for you, and thought you would relish it—so she said."
               "She is very kind."
               But Mary soon perceived that her mother praised the jelly instead of eating it, and that when she settled back upon her pillow, completely exhausted, the quantity of toast was barely diminished. With a heavy heart—so heavy that she could not think of food herself—she took away the dishes, washed them, restored them to their accustomed places, and then took her usual seat by her mother's bed.
               Mrs. Lester looked at her earnestly for a moment, and then gently drawing away the curtains so that the light might fall upon Mary's face, she said anxiously,
               "What is the matter, Mary? You look as if you had been crying."
               It was too much. Mary laid her head on the pillow, and wept violently.
               "Mary! Mary! what has happened, my child? Don't alarm me so!"
               "Oh, nothing—nothing, mother! I mean—I mean—don't ask me, for I can't tell you!" was the incoherent reply.
               A sudden light broke upon Mrs. Lester's mind, and a sharp pang shot through her heart. Lifting her eyes heavenward for a few moments, as if to implore strength from on high, she drew her child to her bosom, and passed her hand caressingly over her soft hair.
               "Tell me, Mary, did you hear any thing that Dr. Williams said when he was here to-day?"
               "Yes, ma'am, I did. Oh, mother! mother!"
               Despite her child's distress, and her own sorrow at the sight of suffering she could not soothe, it was almost with a feeling of relief, that Mrs. Lester realized that her child knew the worst.
               "Mary, my darling, you have been very sorry when you have seen me suffer, as I have since I have lain here. You will not grieve when I am at rest, will you?" and the mother tried hard to speak calmly and courageously.
               "Not for you, not for you, mother! I know you will be better off. But oh! what will become of Tommy and me?"
               A shiver passed over Mrs. Lester's frame, and it was a long time before she answered. When she did speak, her voice was husky and unnatural.
               "God will take care of you both, my child."
               She knew it, but did she feel it—that poor widowed mother? Ah! the faith that can "remove mountains" is but a drop in the bucket, when compared with that which must nerve the mother's heart, ere she can place her fatherless little ones meekly at the foot of the cross, and say "They are thine, Father; do with them as seemeth good in thy sight."
               "Mary, my dear child, try to compose yourself now, for my sake. I have much to say to you yet, and I must save my strength," she said in a faint voice, after Mary had wept upon her breast for a long time.
               Mary raised herself immediately, but as she met her mother's eye, her tears burst forth anew.
               "Oh, mother—mother! it was only this morning that I was almost crying because I could not go to school; and when I came past the school-house with Tommy, I thought it was so hard that I could not be with the other girls, but now—now—"
               "I know all you would say, my child; I know you were feeling badly this morning, and I do not think it at all strange. You have been a good, patient little girl, and a very great comfort and blessing to your mother these many years, Mary. But I must not talk any more now, and I think Tommy is waking."
               And with a fond kiss, she closed her weary eyes, and tried to forget the excitement of the day.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Faith and hope
                           Will teach me how to bear my lot!
                           To think Almighty wisdom best;
                           To bow my head, and murmur not.
                        
                     
                     —ELIZA COOK.
                  
               
               SEVERAL days passed before Mrs. Lester again alluded to the subject which was, nevertheless, uppermost in her mind as well as in that of Mary; and at last the latter began to feel as if she had only been dreaming. As day after day rolled away, and there was no apparent change for the worse, her spirits rebounded from the shock they had received, and she could not realize that the fiat had gone forth, and that before the first snowflakes settled on the lofty crests of the pine-trees, she would be an orphan.
               But Mrs. Lester was not so deceived. She knew that she was dying, and one thought was in her mind continually: "What will become of the children when I am gone?"
               One day Dr. Williams came earlier than usual, and stayed longer. Mary and Tommy went to the bridge again; for the former knew from the expression of her mother's face that she wished to see the doctor alone. This time the air was pure and clear, the pebbles as smooth and shining as possible; a host of tiny fishes glided swiftly through the sparkling waters, and Tommy was in the highest spirits, laughing and shouting until the woods and hills rang with his boisterous mirth, and the playful echoes answered him.
               On the whole, they had a very pleasant walk, and when they returned home the doctor had gone. Mrs. Lester lay quietly on her pillow, with her eyes closed and traces of tears upon her cheek, which was even paler than usual.
               Writing implements lay upon the table by her side, somewhat to Mary's surprise; but as her mother said nothing, and merely welcomed them with a faint smile, she put them away, and then busied herself with some household affairs that needed her attention. Indeed, Mary had become quite a notable little housewife, and some older people that we wot of might have profited by her example.
               
               "Mary," said Mrs. Lester one afternoon, some two or three weeks afterwards; "Mary, do you think you could walk as far as the village this afternoon?"
               "Oh, yes, mother, I should like it of all things! Do you want me to go to the store?"
               "No, dear, not to the store, but to the post-office."
               "To the post-office, mother?"
               "Yes, and inquire if there is a letter for me."
               "Why, mother! who in the world will write to you? I don't remember that you ever had but one letter, and that was when—when—"
               "When your uncle James died, dear. I remember it well. But perhaps there may be a letter for me now; at all events you can go and see."
               "And, mother, while I am in the village, hadn't I better go to the store and get some blue check for Tommy's aprons? Do see how those he has on are patched! They are double nearly all over!"
               Mrs. Lester shook her head sadly. "He does need new aprons, but I am afraid we can't afford to get them. Hand me my old pocket-book. It's in the big chest—in the till."
               "Oh, mother, you forget that I have had charge of the pocket-book this good while; and I can tell you just how much money there is in it, too," said Mary, laughing, as she placed the well-worn article in her mother's hand. "There's a two-dollar bill, and a silver half dollar, and two ninepences, and one dime, and three cents."
               "Your memory is very good, my child, but Tommy must wait a while for his aprons. You can patch the old ones neatly, and they will answer a little longer. I dare not use this money, for where shall we get more when it is gone?"
               But Mary could not give up the aprons.
               "Yes, mother, but I have patched the patches themselves already. Just see how the sleeves look! Oh, I have it now!" she continued eagerly, jumping up and down as a bright idea flashed through her busy little head. "There are the eggs, mother! I never thought of them, and there must be six or seven dozen. Fanny Gibson says Mr. Jones gives ninepence a dozen for eggs, if you take your pay out of the store; and four yards of check will make two aprons. Mayn't I get them, mother?"
               "Yes, if you think you can carry the eggs; and perhaps they will come to enough to get a quarter of a pound of tea, and a little sugar, besides the check. You can put the papers in the egg-basket."
               "Yes, ma'am; but I had better put the letter in my pocket, for I might lose it, you know. Must I pay the postage?"
               "Certainly; I had forgotten that. Take these two ninepences; that makes a quarter of a dollar, and will be more than enough. I don't know just how much you will need."
               Mary ran into her little bed-room, and soon returned with a clean calico dress on, and a white linen apron of Mrs. Lester's own spinning and weaving.
               "Now I will count the eggs, and pack them in the basket. Two, four, six, eight," and she went on counting for a few minutes. "There, mother, there are seven dozen and a half. Shall I take the half-dozen?"
               "No, dear, we may need them. But you must hurry, for it will be late before you get home."
               "Yes, mother, and I will stop for Fanny Gibson to go with me. She will like to help me carry the eggs. Good-by, Tommy. Be a good boy, and sister will bring you some sugarplums when she comes home. If you want any thing, mother, or feel worse, can't you send Tommy up to Mrs. Gibson's? I hate to go and leave you so," she added, while the brightness fled from her face.
               "I'll take care of myself, dear; but run along, you've no time to spare."
               Fanny Gibson was very glad to go to the village with Mary; and the two girls trudged on rapidly with the basket between them, while their tongues moved as nimbly as their feet.
               "What are you going to get with your eggs, Mary?" asked Fanny.
               "Oh! I'm going to get aprons for Tommy, and sugar and tea, and I don't know what all. I wish I could get two or three oranges for mother. We'll see. May be Mr. Jones will let me have them."
               But here Mary, in her impatience to obtain the oranges, quickened her pace, and nearly drew the basket from Fanny's hand.
               "Look out, Mary! if you break the eggs, you will be like the girl in the spelling-book, who counted her chickens before they were hatched."
               
               "Why so I should! Well, we must walk slower, then. When will the summer school be out?"
               "Some time next week, I guess. And oh, Mary! don't you think Ellen Lawson and Sarah Smith are going to write compositions for the last day of school! I do believe Miss Strong is partial. She thinks every thing they do is just right."
               "Oh! don't talk so, Fanny! Mother says it is wrong for scholars to say their teachers are partial. She says they can't help loving those scholars best who study hardest, and try to please them. Do you suppose they can?"
               "Well, I don't know; I never thought of that. I guess Miss Strong don't like me very well, then; for I don't love to study, that's a fact!"
               "Oh, Fanny! that's so strange! If I could only go to school—" but here memory, that had slept during the excitement of her walk, suddenly awoke, and she did not finish the sentence. They walked on in silence a little while, and then Fanny exclaimed,
               "Oh, good! There's the village, I see the meeting-house steeple; how high it is!"
               "Yes; I suppose it is," said Mary dreamily, for she was thinking of her eggs and her letter, instead of the steeple. "We shall be there in a few minutes."
               "Are you going to the store first, or to the post-office?"
               "Why, don't you know the post-office is in Mr. Jones' store? so we've only one place to go to."
               "No, it isn't," said Fanny, "it's been moved. Don't you see? There's the sign now, right across the road."
               "So it is. Well, let's go there first."
               Accordingly they crossed the street, and leaving the basket of eggs at the door in Fanny's charge, Mary stepped timidly in. It was all strange ground to her there.
               "If you please, sir," said Mary, addressing a tall man with immense whiskers, who stood behind the counter, "mother wanted me to get her letter."
               "Her letter?" replied the man, with a half smile. "Who is your mother?"
               "Mrs. Lester." Mary colored, for her quick wits told her she had made a blunder.
               "Mrs. Lester—hem! John, just see if there's a letter for Widow Lester."
               Presently John answered, "No, sir," and she turned away with a disappointed air.
               "Who in the world does the widow expect a letter from, I wonder!" muttered the man, as he returned to his business again. "She ha'n't had a single one sence I've been postmaster. They say she can't live a great while, poor thing!"
               "I haven't got any letter," said Mary, as she rejoined Fanny at the door. "Now let's go to the store as quick as ever we can, for it is almost sundown." And on they went.
               "Well, my little girls," said Mr. Jones, "what can I show you to-day?"
               Mary was more at home here, and, in true Yankee fashion, she replied to his question by asking another.
               "What will you give me for these eggs, Mr. Jones? They are all fresh."
               "Ninepence a dozen," was the prompt reply, "if you take store pay."
               "There are seven dozen; they will come to eighty-seven and a half cents, won't they, sir?"
               "Exactly. You didn't cipher for nothing, did you, Miss Mary? Now, what shall I show you?"
               "Apron check, if you please, sir."
               "Here's a nice strong piece for twelve and a half cents a yard; and here is one that is not quite so good for ten. Which will you have?"
               Mary hesitated.
               "You'd better take the best piece," whispered Fanny, "mother says it's cheapest in the end. The other piece is sleezy."
               "Well, I will have four yards off this piece, sir;" and while Mr. Jones measured it off, Mary held a council of war with Fanny.
               "Now, Fanny, there are three ninepences, that's thirty-seven and a half cents, coming to me yet. The last tea I got here was a dollar a pound, and that would be twenty-five cents for a quarter-pound; and then I could get just two pounds of sixpenny sugar. But I do so want to get some oranges for mother; I heard the doctor say they were good for her."
               "Haven't you got the postage money?"
               "Sure enough, I didn't think of that. But perhaps the letter will come to-morrow, and then we would have the postage to pay all the same. No, I don't believe mother would think it was best," and with a heavy sigh, she turned to the counter again.
               But Mr. Jones had overheard the little aside that was carried on by the two girls: and after he had put up the tea and sugar, he took down four large oranges from their station in the window, and laid them in the basket.
               "Did you say the doctor said oranges were good for your mother?"
               "Yes, sir, but—but—I haven't any more money, sir, except this penny to get some peppermint-drops for Tommy."
               "Oh, never mind—never mind. Tell your mother I sent them to her."
               "Oh, thank you—thank you, sir. I'm sure I'm very much obliged to you," said Mary, while her eyes filled with tears. "Mother will be so glad. They are good for the fever, sir," and, dropping the paper of peppermint-drops into the basket by the side of the oranges, she curtsied to Mr. Jones, and bade him good evening.
               The girls had gone but a few steps when they heard the merchant calling after them.
               "Look here, girls. Just stop at the house as you go along, and ask Mrs. Jones to put a couple of bunches of those early grapes I brought home yesterday, into your basket."
               Mary's gratitude and astonishment were quite too deep for words; but, with a glad bow and smile, she hurried on.
               "She's a dear, good child," said Mr. Jones to himself, as he turned from the door; "but I'm sure I don't know what's going to become of her and that little shaver. The widow's place will have to be sold on that mortgage. Oh, well, I suppose they'll get along somehow or other. The Lord will provide, and it don't do any good to worry."
               Very comfortable, agreeable doctrine that, isn't it, Mr. Jones?
               "Now, if we only had the letter we should be all right," said Mary, as they closed Mr. Jones' gate, after seeing the grapes, carefully wrapped in cotton, deposited in the basket. "But, perhaps, it will come to-morrow."
               A few sunbeams yet lingered on the tops of the mountains, but the valley itself lay in the deepest shadow. The dew was beginning to fall, and the moon's pale, ghost-like crescent hung just over the brow of Mount Hoar. The children felt that they had no time to lose, and half walking, half running, they reached Mr. Gibson's gate before it was quite dark.
               "Now you have a little way to go alone. It's too bad," said Fanny, dolefully. "I'll get brother Sam to go with you."
               "Oh, no; I'm not afraid," was the reply. "I won't be three minutes running home. Good-by, Fanny."
               "Good-by. Hurry now, and I'll stand here at the gate and watch you."
               "Well, my daughter, so you're safe home again," said Mrs. Lester, as Mary, panting and out of breath, burst open the cottage-door.
               "Yes, mother, but I did not get the letter."
               Mrs. Lester had raised herself on one elbow, and was leaning eagerly forward; but at these words she fell back with a sigh of disappointment.
               "Have you been alone all this afternoon, mother?"
               "No, dear: the doctor has been here; and Mrs. Gibson came in and gave me my tea. I suppose she knew you were away."
               "Seems to me the folks all try to see who can be the kindest to us, mother. Oh! I forgot—I've got something to show you," and, running into the buttery with the basket, she soon presented herself, with the grapes and oranges nicely arranged on a large plate.
               "There, now, ain't they nice?"
               The invalid's eye sparkled,—for the cooling, juicy fruit was just what she had been longing for,—but, with her characteristic prudence, she replied,
               "Yes, they are beautiful; but, Mary, we can't afford such things, even when we are sick."
               "Yes, mother, dear, we can afford these. Mr. Jones sent them to you for a present. Do taste these grapes; they're splendid. Shall I peel one of the oranges?"
               "Not to-night. I will eat a few of the grapes. Mr. Jones is very kind."
               "Oh! where's Tommy?" exclaimed Mary, peering round in the dark corners of the room. "I declare I hadn't thought of him."
               "Mrs. Gibson undressed him, and put him to bed."
               "Then I won't wake him. I'll just put this paper of sugarplums under his pillow, and he'll find them in the morning."
               So saying, Mary put away her things, lit a candle, drew the curtains, and then donning her sun-bonnet again, started for the back-door.
               "Why, where are you going, child?" asked Mrs. Lester.
               "I'm going to milk. I guess old Whiteface wonders what's become of me by this time."
               "But it's so late and dark, Mary. Oh, dear!" murmured the poor mother, as she glanced at the curtained window; "and you must be so tired."
               "Never mind, mother. Don't worry. The cow is right by the door, and the lightning-bugs are just as thick as spatter. I guess they'll give light enough, and I ain't much tired."
               Mary was not gone long, and as she was straining the milk, Mrs. Lester called to her.
               "Mary, let the milk-pail and strainer go till morning. You look as if you were just ready to drop, and I don't believe there's a bit of hot water in the kettle."
               "No, ma'am, I had rather wash them to-night than in the morning; and if there isn't any hot water, I must make cold answer for once. They had a good scalding this forenoon. Oh! I mean to have some baked apples and milk for my supper; that'll be nice!"
               Mary soon eat her supper, and sat down looking tired enough. Mrs. Lester looked at her sadly and thoughtfully for a moment; and then drawing her to her bosom, kissed her fondly.
               "Mary, my child, you don't know how I feel about having you work so hard; and you have so much care for such a little girl. If I could only help it!" and her eyes filled.
               "Mother, it don't hurt me one bit!" exclaimed Mary; "and now don't feel bad about it. There won't be so much to do in the winter, and I've been thinking that, perhaps, we could get Sam Gibson to milk; and may be you'll be better then. Seems to me you are better. You don't seem worse, anyhow."
               "Don't flatter yourself, Mary. My poor lamb, I must leave you; and I want you to learn to think and speak of it calmly. I grow weaker every day; but you are with me all the time, and don't realize it."
               Mary did not answer, but she held her mother's hand with a firmer clasp, while the tears streamed over her little tired face. Mrs. Lester did not try to soothe her by words, but she laid her cheek to hers, and softly smoothed the hair upon her forehead, until at length the child's tears were fairly spent, and she lay quietly upon her mother's pillow, sobbing at long intervals.
               "I want to talk to you, my dear child, about you and little Tommy; and, perhaps, I shall not have a better time. I was so disappointed about that letter."
               "What is it, mother? What's the letter about?" asked Mary, raising her head, and looking anxiously in Mrs. Lester's face.
               "I wrote to your aunt Betsy Graham, Mary, two or three weeks ago,—or I got Dr. Williams to write for me,—and I asked her if she would take care of you and Tommy after—after—after—I am gone," she added, in a lower tone.
               "Oh, mother, why can't we stay here? I'd a great deal rather."
               "What, all alone?—two children like you? That would never do, darling; and, besides, this place does not belong to me now."
               "I thought it did. Father bought it, didn't he?"
               "Yes, my child, he bought it the year before he died; but he was able to pay only a small part of the money for it, and he had to give a mortgage on the place. You don't understand that now, but you will when you grow older. Well, he was sick a great many months, and, instead of making any thing, we were running behindhand all the time; and then, when he died, it took all we had raised that year to pay the doctor's bill and the funeral expenses. Dr. Williams was very kind, too, and offered to take old Bob towards the debt, although he wa'n't good for much, and I knew the doctor did not need him; but he allowed me a good price for him, and that helped me a great deal.
               "After that I tried to get along, and pay the debt; and the neighbors helped me in the spring and fall about ploughing and sowing, and we did very well; but now for two years I have been sick, you know, and it has been all we could do to live; so the old place has got to go."
               "I don't know any thing about aunt Betsy, mother. You have not spoken of her very often," said Mary, after a long pause. "I have forgotten where she lives."
               "She lives in Farmingdale, about forty miles from here."
               "In Vermont?"
               "Yes, over the mountain; twelve or fourteen miles from the lake."
               
               "She's the only sister you ever had. It's queer she never came to see you."
               "Her husband owns a large farm, and I suppose she has a great deal to see to."
               Mrs. Lester would not tell her sensitive child that since her own marriage they had never met. For two or three years previous to that event, she had lived with Mrs. Graham; and when she chose to accept the hand of Mark Lester—a poor, but intelligent and industrious young man—in preference to that of a wealthy rival, her sister was deeply offended, and harsh words, recrimination on one side, and earnest, if not angry self-defence on the other, passed between them.
               Their homes lay on opposite sides of the Green Mountains, and a journey, even of forty miles, was, in those days, something of an undertaking. Mrs. Lester was too poor to indulge very frequently in the then expensive luxury of correspondence; and the few letters that were exchanged during the first years of separation, were cold and formal; so, finally, they ceased to write at all; and for a long time had only heard of one another through the medium of some teamster who happened to tarry for the night at their respective homes.
               It was a hard task for Mrs. Lester to throw aside the veil that pride and wounded feeling had for so long a time been wearing, and ask her sister to receive her orphan children under her roof. But it was all she could do. She had no other relative to whom she could turn; she knew of no other spot where her babes might find a home. Yes. There was the poor-house; but to that she would not give even a second thought.
               The letter that Dr. Williams wrote according to her dictation was very touching in its earnest, unpretending simplicity. She told her sister of her struggles since her husband's death, of her efforts to pay for their little place, so that, when she too was called away, her children might not be left homeless and entirely destitute. But it had been all in vain; and she implored her, by the memory of their own childhood, to be a mother to her orphans.
               "While Mark was alive, Betsy," she wrote, "I wanted for nothing. A better man, or a kinder husband, never lived. We were very happy together; and even since he died, I have got along very well until now. But now I must leave my children, and what will become of them? I have many friends here, and kind ones too; but they are not rich, and I feel that it would be wrong for me to ask them to take up an additional burden. Besides, I could die with a stronger heart if I knew that my little ones were with my own flesh and blood. If I could only see you, sister, before I die! But that I do not expect. As I lie here all the old love comes back to my heart again. Forgive all I have said in anger; and as you hope for mercy and peace in your own dying hour, write me that my children may come to you when I am no more."
               "Mother," said Mary, after another long pause, "mother, is it time for an answer to your letter?"
               "Yes, love; it is more than time. I thought you would surely find one to-day. Mary! Mary!" continued Mrs. Lester earnestly, while a round red spot burned upon either cheek, "promise me that you will take care of little Tommy, and watch over him. You are the oldest. You must be more than a sister, you must be a mother to him!"
               "I will try! I will try! but, oh! what shall I do for a mother!" was poor Mary's answer, while another burst of tears nearly choked her utterance. "Mother! mother! take us with you to heaven. Don't leave us here alone."
               "My child! my child! we must wait God's own good time. It will not be long; and we must not murmur nor repine, for it is his will that we should be parted for a while. If you are good children, and try to serve God faithfully, and to obey him in all things, we shall surely meet again."
               "But when you are gone, mother, there will be no one to talk to me of heaven and Jesus, and I shall forget all you have taught me, I'm afraid, and then how can I be good?"
               "You will have your Bible, my child! and you will have your heavenly Father still; and perhaps you can go to Sunday-school, and your teachers will talk to you of Him who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life."
               "Mother," asked Mary, raising her head suddenly, "is aunt Betsy a christian?"
               Mrs. Lester hesitated a moment, and the words "Judge not, lest ye be judged," sprang to her lips. Then she replied evasively, "I believe your aunt has never made a profession of religion; that is, she has never united with any church."
               Mary did not speak for several minutes, but lay as if in deep thought by her mother's side. At last she broke the silence again.
               "Mother, do you think aunt Betsy would love Tommy and me?"
               "I hope so, I believe so, my dear child. Why do you ask?"
               "Because I should not like to live with any one who did not love me."
               "But, my dear Mary, you must not expect to find any one who will love you as your mother does. I love you, faults and all; but if you go to your aunt, you must try to be so good, and pleasant, and useful that she can't help loving you. Do you understand?"
               "Yes, mother. Has aunt Betsy any children?"
               "She has one son, older than you. I believe she has no daughter. But I am too weak to talk any longer to-night. Kiss me, my child." Then laying her hand on Mary's bowed head, she continued solemnly, "May the blessing of Him who is the 'Father of the fatherless' be upon my darling now and evermore. Now go, dear, and sleep soundly after your long walk." And with another kiss Mary obeyed her.

                           And loving neighbors smoothed her careful shroud,

                     THOMAS BUCHANAN READ.
                  
               
               DAY after day passed, and no letter arrived. It was now the 1st of October, and Mrs. Lester was failing rapidly. She could speak only in whispers, and but a word or two at a time, and lay nearly all the while in a sort of stupor, insensible to care or pain.
               The good, kind neighbors would not suffer Mary to be alone with her mother now, but took turns in "watching" with the invalid, by day as well as by night.
               At last, one evening about sunset, when Dr. Williams came, he shook his head sadly, and beckoned Mrs. Gibson (who was preparing some little delicacy by the fire, while Mary fanned her mother) into the next room.
               "She will go before morning," he said. "Can you stay here to-night?"
               "Yes; but we must send for some one else," was the reply.
               "I shall stay myself," continued the doctor; "but I suppose some other woman will be needed. Stay. I have it. Your son is just coming down the road. Let him get into my chaise, and go after my wife. She can come as well as not."
               The arrangement was made, and they returned to Mrs. Lester's room. She was breathing with difficulty, and Mary turned an awe-struck face towards them as they entered.
               "Doctor! doctor!" she whispered in a low, frightened voice, "what is the matter?"
               He did not answer her directly, but took the fan from her hand, and, after a few moments' reflection, said,
               "Mary, Tommy is out in the yard yet, and its pretty cool for him. Hadn't you better give him his supper, and put him to bed?"
               Mary complied, but with an aching heart, for she understood the doctor's kind subterfuge. Perhaps it was well for her that she was obliged to act, instead of being able to sit listlessly down in the indulgence of her grief; and although her tears fell like rain, she gave Tommy his bread and milk, washed and undressed him as carefully as usual, and then sat down by his side, and laid her head on the pillow beside him. The little fellow was thunderstruck at the sight of her tears.
               "What's the matter, Mary?" he asked, stroking her face with his little hand. "What makes you cry? Big girls don't cry!"
               "Oh, Tommy! Tommy!" was all Mary could say, but she turned her head away so that he could not see her eyes, and in a very little while he was asleep. Then she stole quietly away, and glided to her station by her mother's bed.
               It was very still there in that dimly lighted room, so still that Mary thought she could hear the beating of her own heart. Her mother, with her head resting on Mrs. Williams' shoulder, was quietly breathing her life away; while good Mrs. Gibson sat by the foot of the bed, silently wiping away the tears that rolled down her cheeks. The dying woman's face, ghastly though it was in the faint light, was calm and placid as that of an infant. She opened her eyes slowly as Mary entered, and a slight smile hovered about her lips; but it was only for a moment.
               The doctor drew the weeping child to his side, and passed his arm tenderly about her trembling frame. Her grief was not violent. There was something so holy, so awfully sublime in the hushed stillness of that death-chamber, that to have broken its repose by sobs, or by noisy demonstrations of grief, would have seemed like sacrilege. She stood quietly by her kind friend for a moment, and then lifting her eyes to his face, whispered earnestly:
               "Mayn't I go and kiss mother just once, doctor? May be she would know it was me."
               Dr. Williams was an old man, and his profession had rendered him familiar with scenes of suffering and death; but there was a strange moisture in his own eyes, and his voice faltered as he answered,
               "Go, my child. Speak to your mother, if you want to."
               Mary did not speak, but she placed her little hand within the cold white fingers that lay upon the counterpane, and pressed her lips reverently upon her mother's forehead.
               Just then the sound of a horse's hoof startled the watchers, and a moment after a loud knock echoed through the silent house.
               "Oh, hush! hush!" murmured Mary, with a shiver.
               Mrs. Gibson went to the door, and a strange voice asked:
               "Does the Widow Lester live here?"
               "Yes, but she is very low, dying, we suppose—hush! Don't make a noise," she continued, as the young man, or boy—he was not apparently over sixteen years of age—struck his whip violently on the floor, uttering an exclamation that might have been one of astonishment, or of terror either. "Hush! She's in this next room."
               "Dying! you don't say so! Why she's my aunt; I'm her sister Betsy Graham's son. Didn't you never hear her say any thing about our folks?"
               "Mrs. Lester told me that she wrote to your mother more than a month ago. It was about the children, I believe."
               "Well, you see, she never got that letter till last week. I suppose 'twas to the post-office all the time, but we didn't none of us happen to go there. I should have thought Jim Reynolds might ha' sent it up. 'Twould ha' been kind o' neighborly.
               Did your mother send any word or letter to Mrs. Lester?"
               "Well, no. She said she didn't know what to write. You see she never was very handy with her pen, and late years, she and aunt Lester ha'n't agreed very well. I was a-going down to Bennington with some sheep, and she said I'd better leave 'em back here a piece, while I rode over to see how things was."
               "You had better walk in," said Mrs. Gibson, for the young man still stood in the door, twirling his whip uneasily. "Wouldn't you like to see your aunt?"
               "My gracious! I wouldn't go in there for all this world!" he exclaimed, with a terrified glance at the door. "I guess I'd better be a-going."
               "Not to-night? If you don't like to stay here, my house is right over yonder, where you see that big elm, and I can give you a good bed."
               "Oh, I guess I'd better be a-going," was the reply; "I've a long piece to go to-morrow, and them sheep are so plaguey contrary: they—"
               "But," said Mrs. Gibson, interrupting him, "when will you be back from Bennington? and what does your mother say about the children?"
               "Oh dear! I don't know, she didn't say much of any thing. She didn't s'pose aunt Lester was a-going to die so quick; thought likely she was sort o' frightened about herself."
               "But you can guess something about it, can't you? Poor little things! my heart bleeds for 'em!" and the good woman wiped her eyes as she spoke.
               "They feel awful bad, don't they?" was the response. Mrs Gibson's patience was almost exhausted.
               "What is your name?" she asked abruptly.
               "Why, it's John Graham."
               "Well, then, John Graham, are your folks going to take these poor, forlorn orphans—your own flesh and blood, too—and take care of 'em, or are they going to let 'em be sent to the poor-house? But poor as I be," she added in a lower tone, "I'll work my fingers' ends off before I'll see them go there. 'Twould be a shame and a disgrace to all—"
               "Oh, I expect mother calculated to take 'em," interrupted John. "But you see she didn't know how 'twas now, and she didn't want to come so fur for nothing."
               
               "But when will she be here? Something has got to be done about it right away; they can't stay here alone."
               John stood, apparently turning the matter over in his own mind for a minute or two, before he answered.
               "Well, I'll tell you what. I'm a horseback now, but I've got to bring home a wagon from Bennington next Thursday; see—this is Monday. And you just have their things packed and ready, and I'll take 'em along home with me Friday. That'll save a journey a purpose, and mother would just as lief they'd come one time as another. So that's settled;" and with an air of relief he turned from the door.
               "Very well. You'll find 'em at my house," said Mrs. Gibson. Then closing the door carefully, she re-entered the sickroom.
               No one noticed her. Mary knelt by the bedside holding one of her mother's hands, but with her face buried in the folds of the counterpane. Dr. Williams stood with his watch in one hand, and the fingers of the other upon his patient's wrist, while his wife was tenderly wiping the cold sweat from her brow.
               Mrs. Gibson drew near silently, and leaned upon the footboard. Feebler and feebler grew the pulse, fainter and fainter the breath. At last the doctor laid her hand gently down.
               "She's gone," he whispered, and lifting Mary in his arms he bore her into the outer room.
               And for more than an hour the kind old man sat there, folding her to his broad breast with all a woman's tenderness, wiping away her tears, and talking to her of the "better land," where there shall be no more sin, nor pain, nor death.
               Mrs. Williams and Mrs. Gibson passed through the room two or three times, but they were busied with the dead: arraying the wasted form in the pure white shroud that Mrs. Lester had herself prepared, months before her death, and parting the brown hair which time had not yet silvered, upon the calm, still forehead.
               Their work was done, and they stood gazing upon the pale clay.
               "How young she looks!" whispered Mrs. Williams, as she placed a little bunch of snowberries and geranium-leaves within the folded hands. "Poor woman, how much she has suffered!"
               "Oh, don't call her poor!" exclaimed Mrs. Gibson, amid her tears. "If you had been with her half as much as I have, you would call her rich."
               "I know it—I know it; I didn't mean that: I know she has an 'inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away.' But let us go and put that dear child to bed. Poor little Tommy! he has slept through it all."
               Mary did not think again of the knock that had so startled her on the evening of her mother's death, and her kind friends thought it was not best to tell her of her cousin's visit until after the funeral. That was appointed for Wednesday; and immediately after it was over, Mrs. Gibson took the children to her own home.
               Tommy had cried when he had been lifted up to look at his mother as she lay in the coffin. He had laid his little chubby hand upon her brow; its unnatural coldness had frightened him, and, with a shrill scream, he had clung to Mrs. Gibson, and buried his face in her bosom. He had looked wonderingly at the pall—the bier—at his own black dress, and at Mary's tears; but long before the sun went down, he was playing with Willy Gibson, utterly unconscious that he had any cause for grief.
               "Don't cry, Mary," said Fanny Gibson, as they were gathered round the fire that evening. "Now, don't cry, don't! You shall live with us, and sleep with me, and my mother will be your mother—won't you, ma?"
               "I know you would love dearly to have Mary stay here, Fanny," replied Mrs. Gibson, drawing both the girls to her side, "but she is going to have a better home than this; she is going to live with her aunt Betsy, in Farmingdale."
               Mary looked up quickly.
               "Why! has that letter come?"
               "No, my dear, but your cousin John has been here, and he is coming after you to-morrow."
               "What! to-morrow?" exclaimed Mary; and "to-morrow!" echoed Fanny.
               "That is, he is coming here to-morrow. You are not going till Friday."
               Mary's eyes were bent thoughtfully upon the floor for some minutes. She could not determine whether she ought to be glad or sorry; and Fanny played disconsolately with the corner of her apron.
               "Do you know what was the reason aunt Betsy did not write to mother, Mrs. Gibson?"
               
               "She didn't get the letter till last week, dear; but I didn't have but a minute to talk to your cousin. It was the evening that—it was Monday evening, and he was in a hurry. Come, girls, you'd better go to bed. Mary will have a good deal to do to-morrow, and you must help her, Fanny."
               They arose. Mary's lip was quivering, but she was making a violent effort at self-control. As she passed Mrs. Gibson, however, and attempted to say good-night, her strength failed her, and she threw herself into her friend's arms, sobbing wildly.
               "Oh! Mrs. Gibson, Mrs. Gibson! if I could only stay with you! I would a great deal rather."
               "Dear child! dear child! if I could only have you! But, Mary, your aunt is able to do a great deal better for you and Tommy than I could. She is rich, and you can go to school, and have nice books, and time to study all you want to. And we shan't forget you, dear, and perhaps your aunt will let you come and see us sometimes."
               But Mary only shook her head sorrowfully, and Mrs. Gibson went up stairs with the girls, helped them undress, and then kneeling with them, she clasped a hand of each, while she poured forth a simple, childlike prayer, imploring God's care and protection for the orphans, and his blessing upon all their ways.
               There was so much faith and holy confidence in every word she uttered, that Mary's troubled heart grew still; and when she gave her kind friend a good-night kiss, she whispered,
               "Thank you, dear Mrs. Gibson. God will take care of Tommy and me; mother said He would."
               Tommy slept with Willy, in the trundle-bed, in Mrs. Gibson's own room that night.
               The next day passed very rapidly. There was a great deal to be done. The neighbors were determined that Mrs. Lester's children should not go from their midst without decent mourning. So Mr. Jones sold materials for a black suit for each of them, "dirt cheap," to use Mrs. Gibson's expression, and they all clubbed together to foot the bill.
               Mrs. Williams had a black straw of her own dressed over, lined, and trimmed, so that it looked as "good as new." Mrs. Wilson gave a shawl for Mary, and somebody else a cap for Tommy.
               It was found, upon investigation, that the sale of the widow's place, and her scanty supply of household goods, would barely suffice to pay the debts. But her wearing apparel Mrs. Gibson carefully packed by itself, saying that Mary should have so much that was her mother's, at all events. They were articles of little value, save as relics, but in after years they were invaluable to the children, as mementoes of the "loved and lost."
               John Graham arrived just at dusk, and early the next morning the wagon was at the door. The children had already partaken of an excellent breakfast, but good Mrs. Gibson saw that every mouthful Mary attempted to swallow nearly choked her; and the basket she placed in Tommy's hand, telling him he would want some luncheon to eat on the road, was well supplied with every thing that could tempt a child's appetite.
               As for Tommy, he was in high glee. A ride was a rare treat, and if Mary was with him, what cared he for other friends? He had climbed into the wagon, and established himself snugly on the back seat, with his basket on his lap, long before his sister had tied her bonnet, and drawn on her gloves.
               "Wrap your shawl round you, and pin it well, Mary," said Mrs. Gibson. "Do you think you'll be warm enough? The air is cold this morning."
               "Oh, yes!" but before she could say more, her cousin shouted,
               "Come, Mary! It'll be pitch dark before we get over the mountain. The mud's up to the hubs in some spots."
               Mary dared not trust herself to speak; but, with a hurried kiss to each of her old friends, she drew her veil down, and Mr. Gibson lifted her into the wagon.
               "Tommy, hadn't you better let Mary take the basket? I'm afraid you'll drop it."
               "No, sir; I can hold it my own self," said Master Tommy.
               They finally compromised matters, however, by placing it at his feet, where it would still be in his own particular care.
               A moment more, and they were off; but, until they were quite out of hearing distance, Fanny and Willy stood by the gate shouting, "Good-by, good-by!"
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IV.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           The mountains that infold,
                           In their wide sweep, the colored landscape round.
                           Seem groups of giant kings, in purple and gold,
                           That guard the enchanted ground.
                        
                     
                     —BRYANT.
                  
               
               THE clear, pure, bracing air, the cheerful sights and sounds that greeted them as they passed farmhouse after farmhouse, the novelty of their position, and above all, Tommy's unrestrained delight, to which he gave free expression, all contributed to drive from Mary's mind the remembrance of past as well as of present sorrow, and to enable her to look with comparative cheerfulness to the future. She had kept her green veil over her face and wept silently until long after she had passed every familiar thing, and she did not, trust herself to look back at the little brown house—humble, but how dear! where her whole life had been spent, or to glance over the hills to the graveyard where the bier still covered a newly-made mound.
               But at length there was nothing to stir the deep fountain of memory, for all was new and strange. The very trees seemed to wear a different look as they approached the mountains, and the wild and picturesque scenery of the mountain-passes charmed her inexpressibly. The autumnal frosts had already been at work upon the forest trees. The brilliant flame-color of the maple, the deep red and orange of the oak, varied by a thousand different shades of crimson, purple, pale yellow, and brown, contrasted with the dark green of the feathery hemlock, and the softer tint of the fragrant cedar; while far above them towered in solitary grandeur the monarch of them all, the stately pine of the Green Mountains.
               And, ever and anon, as they wound along, a bright, dancing rivulet would trip fearlessly by their side; or a sudden turn in the road would bring them to a tiny lake sleeping in the embrace of the everlasting hills; or looking far above their heads, they would see a rapid, dashing streamlet leaping from rock to rock, now falling in innumerable little cascades, now dissolving in a cloud of spray, now foaming and raging as if in anger, and now gliding along as calmly and demurely as if it 'had quite forgotten the wild freedom of its earlier life.
               Mary's spirits rose with every breath she drew. The clear, transparent sky looked lovingly down upon them; and as she gazed far up into its fathomless depths, she thought of her mother, not as she had previously, as lying upon the bleak hillside, shut out from the light and air, with the cold, stifling clay heaped upon breast and brow; but as a glorified spirit floating at will among the fleecy clouds, the gorgeous, snowy piles that contrasted so beautifully with the deep blue of the heavens.
               It was a childish fancy, but it brought her lost mother nearer to her lonely little heart, and who could chide it?
               The day wore away: John meant to be kind, he tried to be kind; but the truth was, he did not know how. The finer feelings of his nature—he was by no means destitute of them—had never been called forth, never trained or cultivated; and to his infinite amazement and chagrin, his attempts at condolence and sympathy almost invariably brought fresh tears to Mary's eyes. Instead of applying healing balm to the still bleeding wound, he tore it open by his ill-timed questions and remarks. At length finding that his little cousin withstood all attempts to draw her into conversation, he turned his attention to his own amusement, and commenced dexterously cutting off the heads of the daisies and mouse-ears that grew by the side of the road, at a single snap of the whip.
               They stopped for dinner at a wayside inn. John was no stranger there, and the attention of the landlady was soon drawn to the black dresses of the little travellers.
               "Whose children be them, John?" she asked in a loud whisper, pointing to them as she spoke.
               John replied in a voice that was inaudible to all save his companion, who presently exclaimed,
               "My sakes alive! You don't say them are Jane Lester's children?"
               "Yes, they be."
               "Well, I used to know her when we was both young, but I ha'n't seen her sence she was married, nor hardly heerd of her. Be they nice children?"
               "I don't know: the biggest one is the shyest thing. I can't get any thing out of her."
               
               "Oh, I'll make her talk, I'll warrant. Be they going to live to your house, John?"
               "I s'pose so."
               "Well, taint every day that orphans fall into such a good home; but it'll be a dreadful care for your mother," and going into the next room, where the children were, she commenced a string of questions that fairly took away poor Mary's breath.
               She tried to answer civilly, and in as few words as possible; but it grew more and more difficult as the woman, with a hard blunt voice and manner, began to talk of Mrs. Lester's death, and with a pitiless hand attempted to draw aside the veil from before Mary's own heart.
               "I should think you'd feel dreadfully! Didn't it e'en a'most kill you to go to the funeral?"
               It was too much, and covering her face with both hands, Mary tacitly refused to speak another word; and she was glad enough when summoned to take her seat in the wagon again.
               It was nearly dark when John, turning towards the back seat, but pointing ahead with his whip, said:
               "There's our house. We're almost home."
               Tommy was asleep, with his head resting on his sister's lap, but Mary leaned eagerly forward. In the dusky twilight she could just discern a large, cream-colored house, with a wing for the kitchen and woodshed. A white picket fence surrounded the house on all sides, and there were plenty of sheds and barns, all in good repair. Two enormous black cherry-trees, resembling each other so closely that they might have passed for twins, stood nearly opposite the kitchen door, and their wide-spreading branches shaded half the yard. There were a few straggling rose and lilac bushes scattered about, but they were evidently dying for want of culture.
               Mary did not notice these things that night. Her attention was fixed upon the house, and her thoughts were of her aunt and her mother. How her heart beat as John wheeled his horses into the yard, passed the front door, and drew up before the entrance to the kitchen.
               "Whoa, whoa! Stand still, Charley, can't ye? Hillo! mother!"
               Presently the door opened, and a tall, spare woman, apparently fifty or fifty-five years old, looked out.
               "Is that you, John? Seems to me you are late. But bless my stars! who've you got here?" she continued, descending the steps and drawing close to the horses—so close that Mary was really alarmed lest they should kick her; "who've you got here?"
               John replied in a low voice, too low to reach the back part of the wagon; but Mrs. Graham started back with an exclamation of astonishment.
               "Not really dead!" she whispered. Mary's quick ears caught every word.
               "Yes, really dead; died last Monday; and I thought I might as well bring 'em right along, and save going on purpose. There aint anybody on earth to take care of 'em but just us. I s'pose its all right, ain't it?"
               But Mrs. Graham did not reply. She was shocked at the sudden news of her sister's death; and perhaps, too, at that moment conscience spoke more loudly than its wont. At all events her voice was unusually gentle, as she turned towards the children.
               "Let me take the little boy, Mary—that's your name, aint it?—and then John will help you out. Come right into the kitchen;" and lifting the sleeping child from his sister's arms, she carried him into the house.
               There was a large, bright fire blazing in the immense, fireplace, completely eclipsing the feeble light of a single tallow candle that stood on a long, red table in one corner of the room. Mary was fairly dazzled by the change from the darkness without, and she stood by the door bewildered, and conscious of but one desire—an eager longing to throw herself upon some fond breast, and weep, weep, weep.
               A not unpleasant-looking girl stood at the "sink," in a far corner of the room, washing and polishing the tea dishes; and in a chair by the fire sat a man, who, as Mary at once and rightly concluded, was her uncle Graham, her aunt's husband.
               "Mercy on us!" he exclaimed, as his wife approached the fire-place with Tommy in her arms, "whose young one have you got there?"
               "Hush!" she answered, with a hasty glance towards Mary. "They're Jane's children. She's dead."
               "Dead! But how did they get here?"
               "John brought 'em. I had no idea Jane was so near her end. Mary, come up to the fire and warm yourself, child. This is your uncle Graham."
               
               Mr. Graham extended his hand stiffly.
               "How d'ye do?" said he. "You must be pretty tired."
               Mary sank on the edge of a chair, while Mrs. Graham was untying Tommy's cap, and taking off his little overcoat. Still he slept on. Indeed, he was completely worn out by his long ride and the excitement of the day.
               "Let's see. This little shaver's name is Tommy, aint it? Why, take off your things, child; lay 'em on that table there. Have you had your supper?"
               "No, ma'am; but I don't feel hungry," said Mary, with a trembling voice.
               "Well, John'll want some, I suppose. Delia, you just set out the table again, and make some tea. I guess there's water enough in the kettle now. What shall I do with this boy?" she added, looking round for a place where she might lay him.
               "Oh, give him to me, ma'am. I can hold him just as well as not," exclaimed Mary, extending her arms. Tired as she was, she longed to feel that little heart beating against her own. It was throbbing violently, and it seemed to her that the weight of Tommy's curly head would calm and quiet it. Her aunt placed him on her lap, and while she bustled about from the buttery to the table, and from the table to the cellar, Mary sat with her face resting on her brother's curls, and a tear once in a while rolling down her cheek, and falling in her lap. She did not like to wipe them away for fear she would be observed.
               Pretty soon John came in, and Mrs. Graham again approached Mary.
               "There now, I'll take Tommy, and you and John sit right down and eat. Delia, you pour the tea."
               "Ha'n't you got no sort o' cold meat?" asked John, as he glanced over the table with a dissatisfied air.
               "Yes, lots of it. We had corned beef for dinner. Delia, you just go down cellar, and bring up that big blue-edged platter."
               Delia descended into the lower regions, and soon returned bearing a huge platter loaded with cold beef, potatoes, turnips, and cabbage.
               "That's glorious!" said John. "Now, just bring me the pepper and salt, and some vinegar, and I'm fixed."
               Mary drank a cup of tea, and tasted of her bread and butter; but she was really too tired to eat, and her aunt proposed that she should go to bed.
               She rose with alacrity.
               "I should be very glad to go, aunt Betsy."
               Then, looking round for a moment, she turned timidly to John.
               "Did you bring in my trunks, cousin John?"
               "No, I declare. I forgot it. Del, you ask Bill to bring in them trunks out of the hind end of the wagon. They ain't heavy, neither on 'em."
               After a few minutes' waiting, they heard Bill's heavy boots stalking through the back-kitchen. Delia opened the door.
               "Where shall I put this 'ere trunk, Mrs. Graham?"
               "Set it right down, Bill, and bring the other, quick!"
               "You just open it down here, and take out what you need for the night, Mary," she continued.
               "I only want Tommy's night-gown and mine now," said Mary, as she kneeled by the trunk.
               "You'll want another frock to put on in the morning. Better take it out now. There, Delia, now you bring the light."
               "Where be they going to sleep?"
               "In the spare chamber to-night. I can't see about fixing them for good until to-morrow."
               Mary hurriedly helped to undress Tommy, for she was afraid he would wake up and cry. Then Mrs. Graham turned to go down stairs.
               "Be careful of the light, Mary. Good-night!"
               Mary drew near her aunt, and as she said "Good-night, aunt Betsy," reached up her little face for a kiss.
               Mrs. Graham looked surprised, but bent down and kissed her. That kiss made Mary's heart heavier than ever. There was no life, no warmth in it, and the child felt it. She had longed to have her aunt put her arms round her, and fold her, if but for a moment, close to her breast, as her mother used to do; but she did not, and Mary hastily threw on her nightgown, and crept into bed. Taking Tommy in her arms, she thought long and sadly of the past, the present, and the future before sleep closed her weary eyes. She could hardly have told why, but she felt grieved and disappointed. She was not satisfied with the welcome she had received.
               Mrs. Graham returned to the kitchen, and sat for a long time by the fire without speaking, while her husband was questioning John about the condition of the roads, the price of sheep, &c.
               "So poor Jane is really dead!" she exclaimed, after a while. "It don't seem possible. Did you go to the funeral, John?"
               John told his mother what we already know of his operations, and the story does not need repetition. Soon he rose, and took the candle.
               "I guess I'll go to bed. I'm dreadful tired. And I want another coverlet on the bed, too, mother."
               "There's some right there in that closet in your room. Don't set any thing a-fire, now."
               "No danger o' that," said John, and off he went.
               Neither Mr. or Mrs. Graham spoke for some minutes. At last the former broke the silence.
               "What's the matter, wife? You look as if you was in a quandary!"
               "Well, I am, about these children. I feel bad about Jane's dying so, and I wish I'd gone and seen her, and I'm willing enough to do for the young ones. But when I know that if she'd only had her wits about her, and done as her friends wanted her to, she might have owned the Sherwood farm, and left her children well provided for, I declare it goes against the grain to think that we've got 'em to support. I'm willing to do it, though," she added, for at such a moment she could not acknowledge, even to her own heart, that she felt the care of the children to be a burden.
               "They look like bright children," said Mr. Graham.
               "Yes, I guess they are; and if the girl's smart to work, she'll soon pay her way. But she don't look to me as if she had ever been made to do much."
               "They seem to be pretty well clothed up," remarked Mr. Graham.
               "Yes," was the reply. "John says the folks where they lived did that. They all joined together, and got 'em span new suits. I guess they thought considerable of Jane over there, if she was poor."
               "Well, I tell you what 'tis, wife," said Mr. Graham, as he pulled off his boots, "Mark Lester was a pretty smart, likely sort of a man, and I always thought you was too hard on Jane."
               "Well, well, you've kept mighty whist about it. Why didn't you say so before? I mean to do what's right by the children."
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               
                  
                     
                        A new home. Who'll follow?
                     
                     —MARY CLAVERS.
                  
               
               WHEN Mary awoke the next morning, she found Tommy sitting up in the bed, and looking about the room with an air of utter bewilderment. Where he was, or what he was there for, were problems he was vainly endeavoring to solve. The blinds were closed, and the curtains drawn, so that not the least bit of sunshine stole in to enliven the large apartment, which wore that cold, forlorn, cheerless aspect, peculiar to rooms that are seldom occupied.
               The little fellow "spake never a word," but stared in blank astonishment at the high-post bedstead that nearly reached the ceiling, at the great easy-chair covered with white dimity, at the large bureau, and the oval mirror that hung over it, quaintly ornamented with carved work, and a huge bunch of gilded flowers that nodded over the top of the frame.
               Soon his lips began to quiver, and his breast to heave; and Mary said, softly,
               "Why, Tommy, where do you suppose you are?" just in season to prevent a flood of tears. He threw his arms about her neck with a glad cry, and, after caressing him for a few moments, Mary bounded out of bed.
               "Now, Tommy, lie still till sis gets dressed, and then she'll dress you. We are at aunt Betsy's now; did you know it?"
               "How long are we going to stay here?" asked Tommy.
               "Oh, I don't know; always, may be."
               Then seeing that Tommy's attention was again engrossed by the strange room, and its equally strange furniture, she hurriedly proceeded with her own dressing, and was soon in readiness to lift him from the bed. While fastening his clothes, she talked to him of his new friends.
               
               "Now, Tommy, when you go down stairs, you'll see Aunt Betsy and uncle Graham, and cousin John, who brought us here yesterday, and Delia, and Bill."
               "Who's Delia?"
               "Oh, I guess she's the girl that works here."
               "Is she a queer girl?"
               "Queer? no: why?"
               "She's got a queer name."
               "That's only because you ain't used to it. You never heard it before. There! now you're dressed. But, Tommy, you didn't say your prayers last night, because you were so sleepy. Kneel down by me now."
               He obeyed; and, putting his little hands together, began,
               "Now I lay me down to sleep—"
               "No, Tommy, you must not say that, because you ain't going to sleep. Say 'Our Father,'—"
               When he had repeated the familiar words, he rose from his knees.
               "Come, sis, now let's go," and, catching hold of her dress, he began to pull her towards the door.
               "Don't pull my dress so, Tommy; you'll tear it. Now, you must remember to be very good and quiet, and behave like a little man. D'y'e hear?"
               "I ain't a man. I'm nothing but a little bit of a boy," said Tommy, sturdily.
               "I know that; but you can try to be good, anyhow—won't you? Mother said you must."
               "Where is mother?" asked the child, looking earnestly in Mary's face. "What made the men carry her off? and why didn't she take us with her when she went up to heaven? She always used to, when she went anywhere."
               "You mustn't talk so, Tommy," was the answer, and the large tears gathered in Mary's eyes. "God took mother to heaven, and she can't come to us any more. If we are good children, we shall go to her when we die."
               Tommy said nothing more as they descended the stairs, but he was thinking of the grave upon the hillside, and wondering if that was heaven.
               Mary was a little afraid of not being able to find the way to the kitchen, but she met with no difficulties of that sort; and when she opened the door, she could not help thinking to herself that it was really a very pleasant kitchen. The morning sun shone full and strong upon the eastern windows, which were as bright and clean as soap and water and a willing arm could make them; and from those on the opposite side, she looked out on the orchard and a fine expanse of woodland and meadow. The long red table stood in the middle of the floor, covered with a clean, homespun tablecloth; and upon it were arranged, or rather tossed—there was but little appearance of arrangement—divers plates, knives and forks, and cups, to say nothing of a goodly supply of eatables. Her aunt was hurrying about, her cap untied, and the strings streaming behind her at such a rate that Mary wondered it did not fly off, like John Gilpin's wig. She nodded to the children as they came in, but was quite too busy to speak; and they seated themselves shyly in the furthest corner of the room.
               Delia was not to be seen, but Mary heard the sound of the churn-dasher in the milkroom, and was housekeeper enough to guess her whereabouts. But who were going to surround that long table? And where would her aunt find mouths enough to dispose of the immense piece of cold boiled pork that held the post of honor in the centre?
               These questions were speedily answered, for Mrs. Graham, after looking in the pot and ascertaining that the potatoes were nearly done, took down a long tin horn that hung upon the wall, and, stepping to the door, blew a blast so shrill and clear that the dog that lay asleep upon the doorstep, started up, howling and whining most piteously; the geese stretched their long necks and hissed, the hens cackled, and the two-year old colt, in the little three-cornered meadow, peered curiously over the fence, and neighed.
               Pretty soon, Mary heard voices and heavy footsteps in the back kitchen, and, just as Mrs. Graham had placed the dish of mealy, laughing potatoes, and the coffee-pot on the table, Mr. Graham, John, and half a dozen workmen came in.
               "Come, boys," said Mr. Graham, "draw up your chairs; we've no time to lose."
               Mrs. Graham beckoned to the children, and the meal proceeded rapidly, and almost in silence. There was a clatter of knives and forks, and a jingling of plates, to be sure; but scarcely a word was said, save an occasional remark from Mr. Graham to one and another, with regard to their respective duties.
               
               Mary thought of their quiet breakfasts at home. Their table had not boasted of as great a variety, it is true, and coffee had been a rare luxury; but a little tea for mother, and a mug of cold water from the spring for Tommy and herself, had relished equally well; and kind looks and words and smiles had atoned for all other deficiencies.
               The very minute they had done eating, Mr. Graham rose from the table, and the men followed him.
               "Now, be sure you come right in to your dinners just as soon as ever I blow the horn," exclaimed Mrs. Graham, as they were closing the door. "I've got too much to do to be kept waiting."
               "Delia," she continued, raising her voice, "hasn't that butter come yet?"
               "Yes, 'em," responded Delia from the milkroom; "I've just got it gathered."
               "Well, then, do come and eat. I wouldn't have had you begun it before breakfast, if I hadn't thought 'twould ha' come quicker. I want to get the table out of the middle of the floor. Tommy, have you had breakfast enough?"
               Tommy hung his head sheepishly, but did not answer.
               "Come, speak quick! I can't wait all day."
               "He's eaten all he wants, ma'am," interposed Mary. "He's bashful before strangers," and she laid her hand fondly on his little curly head.
               "Humph! he'll get over that fast enough, I'll warrant. Come, put on your bonnet, and the boy's cap, and run out o' doors. It'll do you good to stir."
               The children did not feel the need of "stirring" a great deal. Their limbs were still stiff and sore from their long ride the previous day. Yet they were not unwilling to comply with their aunt's request, for they felt—Mary, at least—a good deal of curiosity respecting their new home, and were desirous to become familiar with its environs.
               "May we go out of the yard, aunt Betsy?"
               "Yes, go just where you have a mind to. I s'pose you'll know enough to find your way back again. Delia, you take up that butter now, and salt it just as quick as ever you can. It's Saturday, and there's every thing to be done."
               Mary and Tommy went out into the yard, and looked about them. Between the back-kitchen and a large building that appeared peared as if it was designed for a carriage-house, was the woodshed; and a little further to the south, facing the front gate, stood the horse-stables, handsomely painted, and in perfect order. East of the stables lay the garden, but it did not seem very inviting at that season of the year, and the children did not go in.
               "Let's go through that big gate," said Tommy, pointing to one just below the cherry-trees. "Oh, there's a bridge! there's a bridge!" he exclaimed, clapping his hands as he peeped through the fence. "Mary, Mary, come quick!" and he shook the heavy gate impatiently.
               "This gate is fastened, Tommy. I can't open it," said Mary, after examining it for a moment. "We must go round by the front gate."
               As they passed the kitchen, they looked in. Mrs. Graham was kneeding bread in a great wooden bowl or tray, and Delia was scouring tin-pans, that were already fairly dazzling, as she turned them about, and the sunbeams fell on them.
               Tommy's delight at finding a "bridge" was almost equal to that of Bruce when he thought he had discovered the sources of the Nile. And, in truth, it was a pleasant spot; and other little forms than Tommy's have leaned over that low railing to watch the "minnies" as they gathered around some large stone, or were swept under the bridge by the strong current. The long, pendent branches of the willows that bordered the creek, drooped quite into the water; and in the spring, the soft, shining tassels—"pussies," the children called them—floated down the stream until they lodged among the twisted roots, or lay trembling in the little quiet pools.
               There was a broad smooth stone or rock, that sloped down to the water's edge, almost underneath the bridge, and there the children seated themselves, watching the fish, the floating leaves, the little flecks of foam, and the tiny whirlpools and eddies formed by some under-current.
               They were calmly and quietly happy. Mary hardly knew that she was so, but her eye was brighter and her smile more serene than it had been for days.
               Tommy wanted to go over the bridge, and see what he could find beyond it.
               "Oh no, Tommy! let's stay here, it's so pleasant; besides, I am tired, and I guess you are too."
               
               So they sat with their arms around each other, until the sound of the dinner-horn made them both spring to their feet.
               "Why, it's dinner-time. We've been here all this forenoon. I did not think it was half so long," said Mary, as she helped Tommy up the bank. "Hurry, Tommy, aunt Betsy won't want to wait for us."
               But aunt Betsy did not have to wait, for they reached the gate some time before the men did.
               Dinner was the counterpart of breakfast, save that a huge pitcher of cider took the place of the coffee-pot, and a boiled indian pudding smoked upon one end of the table.
               After it was cleared away, Mrs. Graham sat down with a basket of stockings that required mending. Delia was washing the dishes, Tommy wandering about under the cherry-trees, and Mary did not know what to do with herself. After a little while she went up to the sink.
               "Delia, may I wipe the dishes for you?" she said, in a half whisper.
               Delia looked dubiously from Mrs. Graham to Mary, and then from Mary back to Mrs. Graham again.
               "It's just as Mis' Graham says," she said at last. But "Mis' Graham" had not heard the question, and it was necessary to repeat it.
               "May I wipe the dishes for Delia, aunt Betsy?"
               "Yes, wipe away, only mind you wipe 'em dry."
               The dishes were soon washed and put away in the large buttery, which was close by the sink, and Mary set down by the window. She was tired and did not feel like going out of doors, but still the time hung heavy on her hands. She looked out at Tommy and thought she would call him in, but he was making chip houses and fences, and it seemed a pity to disturb him. Delia was at work in some other part of the house, and her aunt, intent upon her mending, did not even look up.
               At length a bright thought visited her.
               "Aunt Betsy," she said hesitatingly, "if I knew where I was going to sleep, I could unpack my trunk, and be putting away my things."
               "Well, your trunk's up in Delia's room, and there's a closet right there where you can hang your clothes. What's in the other trunk? I see you've got two."
               "Mother's things are in the biggest one. I don't want to open that now," said Mary, with a trembling voice.
               "Get Delia to help you carry it up garret, then, and set it up close somewhere, so it'll be out of the way. Go right up those stairs yonder, and just at the head of 'em there are two steps to the right; then there's a door, and that goes into Delia's room. You are going to sleep with her."
               Mary hesitated.
               "What are you waiting for, child? Are you afraid you can't find the way?"
               "Oh no, ma'am, not that. I was thinking about Tommy. I'm afraid Delia won't like to sleep with him. He kicks sometimes."
               "Oh, he isn't going to sleep with you and Delia. There's a half bed in the boy's room, where I'm going to put him."
               Sleep in the boy's room, in a bed by himself! Mary thought she must be dreaming.
               "Why, aunt Betsy, he never slept alone a night in his life, and if he wakes up in the dark he'll be frightened to death," said she, half crying.
               Mrs. Graham hardly knew what to do. She did not like to be harsh with the children so quickly, and yet she had an idea that if she yielded this point, it would only establish a bad precedent in the next case where her wishes interfered with their's.
               "No," she thought to herself, "I can't have them sleeping together and mussing up another room, just to suit their whims. They'll be just as well off if they sleep where I want 'em to, and I may as well be decided now as ever, and have 'em understand that things must be as I say."
               So turning to Mary, she said:
               "I'll risk him. If he never's slept alone, it's high time he had. Why, my John slept alone long before he was as old as Tommy."
               "Well, but aunt Betsy, our house was such a small one! and Tommy slept with me in a little room that opened right out of mother's, and we couldn't teach him to sleep alone; and now in this great big house, where there are so many strangers, I know he'll be afraid."
               "Don't you put it into his head," said Mrs. Graham. "Now mind what I say. If you don't go to pitying him, and making him think it is a dreadful thing, I don't believe he'll mind it one bit nor grain. Come, now go and unpack your trunk. Delia's up there somewhere; and don't look so downhearted about it, neither. You'll have worse trials than this to bear, if you live long, and Tommy too."
               Mary went slowly up stairs, and sat down on the steps that led into Delia's room, weeping bitterly.
               Presently the door behind her opened, and Delia sprang back, half frightened.
               "Why, you 'most scared me!" she exclaimed, as soon as she saw who it was. "What in the world are you doing here, all curled up in a heap—crying?"
               Mary did not answer, nor even look up, but her frame shook with suppressed emotion, and Delia, who was really a good-natured girl, stooped down and took one of her hands away from her face.
               "What's the matter, Mary—are you homesick?"
               "No, but I want to sleep with Tommy, and aunt Betsy says I can't."
               "Why not? where are you going to sleep?" asked Delia.
               "Aunt Betsy says I'm to sleep with you, and Tommy in the boy's room. Where is the boy's room?"
               "There," said Delia, pointing to a door directly opposite the steps where they were sitting. "John and Bill sleep there. The rest of the men only eat here; they sleep at their own homes."
               "I'm afraid the boys won't like to have Tommy in there."
               "Humph!" replied Delia, shrugging her shoulders, "I guess 'twon't trouble them much. They sleep like logs, and Bill snores loud enough to take the roof of the house off."
               That was poor consolation.
               "Oh, I know Tommy'll be afraid!" said Mary, with a fresh burst of tears.
               "Well, I wouldn't worry about it," said Delia, kindly. "May be it'll turn out better than you think. Don't you want to unpack your trunks?"
               "Yes, that's what I came up for; and aunt Betsy said I must ask you to help me take this one up garret."
               "You needn't help, I can carry it alone," and taking it up in her strong arms, as if it had been a mere child's toy, she carried it up the stairs.
               Mary unpacked the other trunk, hung up her dresses, and arranged some of her clothes on the shelves in the closets, and then went down to look after Tommy.
               He was still playing in the yard, but he looked tired and somewhat forlorn, and Mary called him in.
               "How your head looks, Tommy! Come out in the back kitchen and let me wash your face, and then I'll comb your hair."
               The face was washed, and then Mary ran up stairs and took a comb and brush from her trunk. Dampening the soft brown hair, she rolled it over her finger, and it hung in a profusion of ringlets that would have made many a mother's heart proud.
               Mary gazed upon the little, rosy, smiling face with sisterly pride, and kissed it—I had almost said—with motherly love. She had taken so much care of him for the past year, that the child clung to her even more fondly than he had to his mother. Then she led him into the other room.
               Mrs. Graham still sat by her basket of stockings, and it is just possible that she felt a little sorry she had said Tommy must sleep alone, for she pushed her spectacles up on to her forehead, and drawing him to her as he came in, gave him a kiss on either cheek.
               "Where did you get these curls, Tommy?" she said.
               "I do'no," he answered; "I guess Mary bought 'em somewhere."
               But, sorry or not, Mrs. Graham did not retract her words. Soon after supper, Tommy began to rub his eyes.
               "Mary, you'd better take Tommy up stairs, and put him to bed. You know where the boy's room is, don't you?" said she.
               "Yes, ma'am," but the voice trembled and the eyelids drooped.
               Mrs. Graham looked keenly at her for a moment, before she continued—
               "Well, then, take him right along; and mind what I said to you this afternoon. Don't you begin a fuss with him yourself."
               Poor Mary! There was no danger of her forgetting. She was all in a tremor already, for fear the little fellow would "make a fuss," and it was not likely she would commence it. She hardly knew whether it was best to tell him that she was not going to sleep with him; but finally concluded she would be guided by circumstances. If he asked any questions, she would tell him the truth, but she would not volunteer any information on the subject.
               The stairs led into a large, low room, designed for a sleeping ing apartment for the men, but now unfurnished and unoccupied. From the north side of this room two steps led up to Delia's chamber, and a door in the southern partition opened into the "boys' room." Crossing the chamber, Mary pushed open this door, and looked in. An ordinary-sized bedstead stood in one corner, and in the one opposite a single or half bed. A chair or two stood against the wall, but there was no other furniture.
               "Oh, what a funny little bed!" said Tommy.
               "Yes, it's a nice little bed."
               Tommy examined the bed curiously; apparently he was studying its dimensions.
               "We'll have to lie pretty close together," he said. "Who's going to sleep there?" and he pointed to the other bed.
               Mary was not much of a lawyer, and she did not know how to avoid answering the question. But while she was hesitating, Tommy seemed to forget he had asked it, and began to talk of something else. After he had said his prayers, Mary helped him into bed, covered him nicely, tucked him up, and then sat down by his side, and began telling him stories.
               But as his bright, restless eyes wandered about the room, he caught sight of the other bed, and his curiosity was again aroused.
               "Who's going to sleep there?" he asked.
               "Cousin John and Bill, I believe."
               "John and Bill!" he exclaimed; then a sudden thought seeming to strike him, he seized his sister's hand. "Where are you going to sleep, Mary?"
               "With Delia. Come, Tommy, turn over, and I'll tell you that story about the dear little lamb."
               But Tommy was not to be so easily diverted. Springing up in the bed, he threw his arms around Mary's neck.
               "No, no, Mary! You must sleep with me."
               "I can't, dear. I can't sleep in this room. Lie down, Tommy, and I'll stay with you a good long while; and then I'll come in early in the morning and dress you. That'll be nice, won't it?"
               "Oh, I can't sleep all alone, Mary; I can't! I can't!"
               "You won't be all alone, Tommy. Cousin John and Bill will be here;" and Mary tried to unclasp the little arms that clung so closely to her neck.
               But she had only made "bad matters worse" by her last suggestion. The small fingers were knit still more firmly together, and the child's breast heaved still more convulsively.
               "I 'fraid of John and Bill," he sobbed. "Bill has got big eyes, and he makes faces at me;" and the tears streamed down his face.
               Mary struggled with her own, and kept them back for his sake. Seating herself on the side of the bed, she took him in her arms, and rocked back and forth, mingling caresses and promises, and all the fond words and pet names that her vocabulary afforded.
               Then she talked to him of Willy Gibson, and she wondered where old Whiteface was, and who milked her nowadays, until at length his eyelids began to droop slowly, and the long lashes met each other lovingly, and Tommy was far away from that strange room, where the dusky shadows were fast gathering—far away in the land of dreams.
               Gently, very gently did Mary bend over, and let his head rest upon the pillow; very slowly did she draw her arm from beneath it, while her voice still kept the same low monotone that had lulled him to sleep. Once he started, and clasped her neck more tightly, but after several attempts she succeeded in disengaging herself. Very quietly she smoothed the disarranged covering, and then stood looking at him through her own blinding tears. Every once in a while a long, low, struggling sob would come from his parted lips, and she could hardly bear it.
               She thought of her old home, of her fond and tender mother, of the kind neighbors, of good Mrs. Gibson, and of the sad changes that had placed her and Tommy alone among strangers; and then she thought of Him whose hand had chastened, and of his protecting care. Kneeling by the little bed, she poured forth her full heart in prayer. Her words were very simple, but there was no irreverence in them, even though she asked her heavenly Father to take care of little Tommy, and keep him from being afraid in the dark night.
               And then she rose, gave one parting look at the sleeping child, and went down stairs; her face was calm, and her voice steady, although a close observer might have noticed that there was a flush about her eyes.
               "Well, Mary," said Mrs. Graham, "you don't seem to have had such a dreadful sight of trouble after all. I knew you was more scared than hurt all the time."
               Mary did not answer, but she went to the window and looked thoughtfully out.
               Mrs. Graham sat by the fire knitting; Delia was peeling apples; Mr. Graham sat opposite his wife dozing; and John was in his usual place, with his chair on two legs, and tipped back against the wall, yawning, and doing nothing.
               It was rather tiresome business. The monotonous click of Mrs. Graham's needles, and the slow dropping of Delia's apples in the large wooden bowl, were the only sounds that broke the stillness.
               At last John jumped up, and brought his chair on four legs with a slam.
               "Oh dear, how dull it is!" he exclaimed impatiently. "There's no use in setting up any longer. Where's Bill?" he asked, turning towards Delia.
               "I don't know. Guess he's gone to Mr. Piper's."
               "Well, I shan't wait for him;" and taking a candle, he went towards the stairs.
               Mary started up. Her usual timidity brought the color to her face, and she half sat down again; but summoning all her courage, she went up to her cousin, and laid her hand on his arm.
               "Please be as still as you can, cousin John, for fear you'll wake Tommy."
               John looked at his mother inquiringly.
               "Tommy's asleep in that half-bed," she said.
               John turned to Mary again.
               "Why, what hurt'll it do if the little chap does wake up?" he asked.
               "I'm afraid he would be scared," was the reply; but Mary's eyes were moist, and her cheek burned.
               Her cousin was softened, and he did not tease her, as he had intended. He only said, "Well, I'll be careful," and went softly up stairs.
               Pretty soon Mary and Delia followed his example, but it was a long time before the former fell asleep. She heard Bill come in, and felt the house fairly shake beneath his tread, as he strode up the stairs and across the outer room in his stocking-feet. She held her breath, and listened intently, expecting to hear Tommy cry (she had persuaded Delia to leave the door of their room slightly ajar); but after a while all was still, and she grew too sleepy to listen any longer.
               When she awoke from her first nap, she thought it was daybreak, for she could see every object in the room distinctly. Soon, however, she discovered it was only the moonbeams pouring in at the two large windows at the foot of the bed, and composed herself to sleep again.
               But just as she had begun to grow drowsy, she heard a low sound in the direction of the boys' room, and springing to her feet, for she was now wide awake enough, she ran to the door and hearkened. It was as she thought. Tommy was awake and crying.
               What could she do? Her heart beat violently. Cold as the room was, the perspiration started all over her frame, and she trembled like a leaf.
               For a moment the sound ceased, and she hoped he had gone to sleep again, but soon it re-commenced—the low, suppressed sound of a child sobbing, yet afraid of being heard. It seemed to Mary that she should go crazy. She looked at Delia. She was fast asleep; and stealing softly out into the empty room, Mary stood there, shivering and listening. Finally she crept across the chamber, and stood by the boys' door.
               Still she heard that little pitiful, stifled sound—it was more a moan than a sob—and her tears kept time to its sad music.
               The door did not fit closely, and through the large crack she could hear John and Bill breathing heavily. So she knew they were fast asleep, and she thought,
               "May be I can open the door, and speak to Tommy, and quiet him so."
               Laying her hand on the latch, she slowly raised it. The door creaked on its hinges, but it did no harm, for it did not waken the men, and yet it attracted Tommy's attention, and his sobs ceased.
               "Tommy!" she whispered; "Tommy!"
               He did not hear her, and in a moment she heard his little voice again.
               "I want my Mary! I want my Mary!" he said, as if to himself.
               Mary could bear it no longer. Pushing the door open a little farther, she called again.
               
               "Tommy! Tommy!"
               "What?"
               "Go to sleep, darling. Mary's right here."
               He did not answer, and she thought he had turned over; but presently she heard his little bare, pattering feet. He had crept out of bed, and was coming to her.
               "Oh, Tommy! Tommy! this won't do. You must go right back to bed. You'll catch your death-cold," said Mary, while the child clung to her as if he would never let her go. "Do go back, Tommy."
               Tommy did not speak one word, but, as she lifted him in her arms, kissing him over and over again, and wiping the tears from his wet cheeks, he nestled his head on her shoulder, as if he was happy enough.
               Mary did not know what to do. She dared not take him in bed with herself and Delia, and she could not make him go back to his own. She looked round for something to sit upon, but she could find nothing but a half-bushel measure, in which the boys had had butternuts, and which they had put out there, and forgotten to carry down.
               Turning it softly over, she sat down upon it, and took Tommy in her lap. He was shivering with cold, and she drew his bare feet up, and wrapped her night-gown around them as well as she could. He soon grew warm and sleepy, and finally went to sleep in her arms.
               Mary could see the little bed from where she sat, and could still hear the regular breathing of the boys from the opposite corner.
               There was only one thing to be done, but it was a difficult matter for a timid, sensitive child like Mary to resolve to do it. She must go and put Tommy in his bed again. She knew that it would be daylight in two or three hours, and she had no fear of his waking again before that time.
               Trembling so that she could scarcely stand, she stole into the room, laid Tommy down, and drew the bed-clothes over him. Just as she had got as far as the door again, she heard John lift his head from the pillow, saying,
               "Who's there?"
               She stood perfectly still, scarce daring to breathe; and soon John laid down again. Like a frightened bird, she then sought her own nest, and lay undisturbed till morning.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               
                  
                     
                        His study! with what authors is it stored?
                     
                     —POPE.
                  
               
               THE next day was Sunday. It was later than usual when John and Bill got up, and Mary was terribly afraid that Tommy would wake before they had gone down, but he did not; and when he at last opened his eyes, his sister was watching beside him. He said nothing of the events of the previous night, and Mary hoped he had forgotten them.
               After breakfast Mary took Tommy out in the orchard, and sat down with him under one of the trees. She was very sad and lonely. Only the last Sabbath she had sat by her mother's side, and heard her dear voice; now that mother lay under the sod, and she was far away in a new home. Home! It was a place where she and Tommy might eat and drink and sleep, but it was not a home in the sense in which that little brown house had been home. Would it ever be?
               Tommy had forgotten the troubles of the night; still he did not look quite as bright as usual, and Mary's eyes filled as she watched him.
               Poor child! she was early learning—what, indeed, is ever one of woman's earliest lessons—care and anxiety for those she loves.
               Presently a loud shrill whistle startled her, and looking round suddenly, she saw John sauntering towards them, with his fish-pole on his shoulder. An emotion nearly akin to pity, if it was not exactly that, stirred his heart as he saw the two little pale faces that looked up at him from under the tree; and it was really with a strong desire to make the children happier, and more contented, that he paused to speak to them. Mary did not know it, but his voice and manner were much less rough than usual.
               "What, you and Tommy moping here all alone? Come with me, come! I'm a-going a-fishing. There's a grand place down under the hill."
               Tommy started up, eager to go, but Mary shook her head.
               
               "Why not?" asked John. "Come, I'd just as lief you would as not. What do you want to sit here in the dumps for, eh?"
               "I'd rather not go, cousin John; I'm going in the house pretty soon."
               "Oh, it's duller than all creation there," said John. "Father's reading the newspaper, mother's asleep, and so's Dēl, and Bill's gone off somewhere. I snapped my fingers at old Trip, and he wouldn't do any thing but wink. Come, let's go down to the creek."
               "No, not to-day," said Mary. "Come here, Tommy."
               Tommy was edging off towards his cousin, looking with curious eyes at the fish-pole and basket.
               "Let him go 'long, if you won't go yourself. It'll do him good; he looks kind o' pimping to-day. Let him go 'long."
               "I don't want him to go to-day, cousin John."
               "Why not?"
               "Because it's Sunday."
               "Oh! you think you're dreadful pious, I s'pose."
               "No, not that," said Mary, coloring; "but I know it isn't right to go a-fishing Sunday."
               "Wonderful!" said John, angrily. "Where did you learn so much?"
               "I've heard mother say so, and the Bible says so, too."
               "Pshaw! the Bible don't say one word about going a-fishing Sunday, not as I ever heerd on. And I tell you what, Mary Lester, you needn't go to setting yourself up for being better than other folks, nor begin any o' your preachin' here. I meant to ha' been friendly with you, but I shan't stand that, now I tell ye!" and John, the fish-pole, and the basket, moved off towards the creek.
               Tommy cried and fretted because he could not go with his cousin, evidently thinking that he had a very hardhearted sister; and Mary lay down on the grass, and wept long and bitterly. How she longed for her mother! how she needed her sympathy and encouragement! How she pined for her looks and words of love and tenderness! She could see nothing but darkness in the future, and thought that even Tommy was turning against her. John had meant to be kind to her; that she really believed; but she had vexed him, and perhaps made him her enemy. She was very unhappy.
               When they went into the house, the kitchen was deserted, and Mary sat down on the doorstep, while Tommy trudged about the yard. After a time, seeing that he was amusing himself, she went up stairs.
               Delia was there, and was dressing herself in a bright pink gingham, and ornamenting her hair with sundry blue ribands.
               "Why, where have you been all the morning, child?" she asked, at the same time fastening a string of gold beads—her grandmother's—about her neck.
               "Oh, only out in the orchard, with Tommy. Delia, ain't there any books anywhere about this house?"
               "Mercy, yes! lots of 'em."
               "Oh, where are they? where are they?" asked Mary, eagerly. "Do tell me, Delia, where are they?"
               "My! how bright you look! They're in a cupboard in the sitting-room. You went through there the first night you came."
               "Will aunt Betsy let me take them?"
               "I guess so. I should think she'd be glad to have somebody use 'em, to keep 'em from getting mouldy. There don't none of Mis' Graham's folks open a book once in a dog's age."
               Mary flew down stairs to the cupboard. It was not locked, but the little knob was gone, and the door so swollen that it was only after repeated efforts that she succeeded in opening it.
               What a disappointment! Delia's "lots of 'em" had led her to expect quite a little library, nearly a cupboard full at all events; but instead of that she found only about a dozen musty old books, and torn and dirty at that.
               There was a copy of Fox's Book of Martyrs, a life of Lafayette and another of Bonaparte, an old English Reader, two or three odd numbers of the Spectator, and some bound volumes of the Casket; that was all.
               Mary turned them over and over. They were not very inviting. The Book of Martyrs made her shudder, and she put it back on the shelf, before she had glanced at many of its pages. The rest were not much better, and she was about closing the door in despair, when she chanced to spy a few small volumes, with red morocco backs, on a higher shelf. Bringing a chair, she mounted it, and succeeded in reaching them.
               What a treasure! She had found the Tales of a Grandfather, and her delight was unbounded. She remembered that once, a long time ago, when her mother had sent her of an errand rand to Mr. Jones's house, she had seen them lying on the centre-table, and now they seemed like old friends. Taking the first volume, she placed the others exactly as she found them, and closed the door very carefully. Then wondering where Tommy was, she went to look for him.
               He was playing with Trip very contentedly, and Mary seated herself on the door-step again. The sun shone brightly, so that it was warm and pleasant there, and she was soon absorbed in the fascinating pages of her book.
               It was not long before her aunt came out of her bed-room, where she had been shut up more than half the day, and approached the door.
               Shading her eyes with her hand she examined the appearance of the sky, where some large masses of clouds were now gathering, the distant mountains and the direction of the wind.
               "I declare, I hope 'tain't going to rain to-morrow," she said, "but I don't like the looks of them clouds. If there's any thing in this world that I hate, it's a rainy washing-day. What are you doing, child?" she continued, glancing at Mary, who sat at her feet.
               "Reading, ma'am."
               "Reading? where did you get your book?"
               "In the cupboard in the other room, ma'am. Delia said I might, or she said she thought you would be willing I should."
               "Well, don't you go poking round in the cupboards without asking me. Delia don't know any thing about it. Keep the book now, if you want it, child," she added, as Mary rose with tears in her eyes to put it back, "only next time don't go rummaging about the house without my leave. Come, Delia, hurry now and get supper."
               Mary went on with her reading, and in a little while heard the gate swing together, and John's step as he came whistling towards the house. His pole was on his shoulder, but he had no fish, and looked tired and out of humor.
               Mary raised her eyes and smiled pleasantly as she made room for him to pass her. She knew she had vexed him in the morning, and was willing to make the first advances towards a reconciliation.
               "Have you had a pleasant walk, cousin John?" she asked.
               "No," he answered shortly; and going through the back kitchen into the woodshed, he laid up his fish-pole. Soon he came back, and sat down a little ways from the door.
               He was angry with Mary, but he wanted some one to talk to. Bill was gone, Delia was busy, and as for his father and mother, he had never, in his whole life, thought of them as companions and friends. They rarely exchanged words with him except with reference to the farm-work, or "chores."
               "What are you doing," he asked; "moping over that book? Can't you speak?"
               "Oh, yes!" and Mary closed the book pleasantly. "I ain't moping. I like it."
               "Like it! what's it about. Let's see it," and he took it from her hand.
               "I don't hardly know yet," said Mary; "I haven't had it but a little while. It's the History of Scotland."
               John was turning over the leaves with a kind of triumphant smile curling his lip, for which Mary could not account. At last he spoke.
               "Well, if you're so dreadful pious that you can't go a-fishing, I shouldn't think you'd read such stuff as this on Sunday. It's all about fighting and cheating and bloody murder."
               Mary colored.
               "I don't know as it is a good book for Sunday, cousin John; I hadn't thought of it. If you think it isn't, I'll put it up."
               "Pshaw! I don't know nothing about it. I don't think much o' reading, anyway," said John, as he threw the book in her lap again. "I'd rather break up new ground with my four-year-olds any time."
               "And I guess you'll find it a good deal more profitable, too," remarked Mrs. Graham, who had entered the room just in time to hear this last speech. "I've a mighty poor opinion of these folks that always want to be a reading. What good does it do? You can't eat books, nor drink 'em, nor wear 'em, and there ain't much use in spending a body's time over 'em, according to my way o' thinking."
               "Mother did not think so," said Mary, modestly, and looking timidly at her aunt as she spoke. "She thought people ought to read whenever they had time—young people, I mean. She said—"
               Here Mary paused, for her aunt frowned, and dropped the tablecloth she was unfolding.
               
               "Well! go on. What did she say?" asked Mrs. Graham.
               Mary still hesitated, but the question was repeated, and she went on with a faltering voice.
               "She said God gave us our minds as well as our bodies, and that we ought to take care of both; and that our minds needed food just as much as our bodies did."
               "There! if that don't sound just like her, I'll give up beat!" exclaimed Mrs. Graham, with an extra flourish of the tablecloth. "She was forever talking just so, when she wasn't knee-high to a grasshopper. She always wanted to be a reading—reading—reading. I hope to gracious she ha'n't brought you up to be a bookworm. If she has—"; but what terrible thing was going to happen "if she had," Mary never knew, for her aunt did not finish the sentence.
               "Where's your father, John?" demanded that lady, a moment after.
               "I don't know. May be he's gone after the cows."
               "No he hasn't either. The sun's an hour and a half high yet. You go right off and find him. I'm going to poach the eggs this very minute," and, knocking them on the edge of the pan, she broke them one after the other.
               "Mayn't I beat the eggs for you, aunt Betsy?" asked Mary.
               "Beat 'em! We don't beat eggs when we poach 'em. You go and hunt up Tommy."
               Tommy was easily found, and so was Mr. Graham; but Mary called the former into the back kitchen, and the tea was nearly poured when they took their seats at the table.
               "What makes you so late, child? I do hate to have folks come stringing along, one after the other, at meal-time," said Mrs. Graham.
               "I didn't mean to be, aunt Betsy, but Tommy's hair was in such a muss, that it took me longer to comb it than I thought it would."
               "Seems to me that boy's curls are considerable trouble. Delia, this butter's too salt; don't you put so much in next time, and a little more working wouldn't hurt it. I do wish I could do every thing myself," she muttered.
               Mr. Graham looked at her rather quizzically.
               "I think you do quite enough as 'tis, wife."
               "What do you mean by that, I should like to know?"
               But Mr. Graham finished his supper in silence.
               By the time supper was cleared away, and the dishes washed, it was nearly dark. Mary dreaded putting Tommy to bed, for she expected even more trouble than the previous night; but there was no help for it. Mrs. Graham said,
               "Come, Mary, it's time Tommy was a-bed. He's run near-about enough for one day;" and accordingly they went up stairs.
               "Have I got to sleep here another night?" said the little fellow, as Mary led him towards the boy's room. "Mayn't I sleep with you just this time?"
               Mary took him in her arms, and kissed him many times before she could speak. It was nearly as great a trial to her own heart as to his, and sorely did she miss the little form that had for years nestled so closely to her side. She knew that it would do harm rather than good, if she yielded to her feelings then; but it was difficult to drive back her tears as still he pleaded.
               "Don't put me to bed here, Mary. I don't sleep good all alone; and I'm afraid. Bill breathes so loud. Do let me sleep with you, Mary!"
               A sudden thought struck her, and, setting Tommy on the side of the bed, she told him to stay there, and she would be back in a minute. She thought that perhaps if her aunt only knew how badly Tommy felt about sleeping there, and how he cried the night before, she would not insist upon it.
               So she flew down stairs, and told her story, very simply, but earnestly, and begged her aunt to let him sleep with her.
               "No," she answered; "he's going to sleep right there, and nowhere else; and don't you let me hear another word of fuss about it. The land knows we have enough to do without keeping extra beds just to accommodate such a little shaver as he is."
               But Mary had still another proposition to make.
               "Aunt Betsy, couldn't Delia and I move that small bed into our room? It isn't very heavy, and she says she'd just as lief have it there."
               "No, I tell you. The bed ain't going to be moved one inch. You are making a real baby of Tommy—that anybody can see—and he shall be away from you nights, anyhow. Now go and put him to bed, and don't say another word about it."
               Mary obeyed, but with an aching heart. She coaxed and soothed and comforted Tommy as well as she could, but he still grieved.
               
               "Don't cry, Tommy," she said. "It won't do any good, for aunt Betsy says you must sleep here; and if you wake in the night, you must not cry, for you will disturb John and Bill, and they won't like it. There, dear, go to sleep, and Mary will stay with you a long time;" and she sang and talked to him until at last he went to sleep.
               It was several weeks before Tommy became accustomed to sleeping alone; and he mourned and grieved over it, until Mary's heart was almost broken.
               Going to bed became a perfect bugbear to both of them.

                           Why in such haste? Thine eyes
                           Are not as clear as wont, and smile compell'd.
                        
                     
                     —FROM THE GERMAN.
                  
               
               THE next week—with the exception of the sleeping business—passed quite pleasantly. Mrs. Graham's fears of a rainy washing-day were happily without foundation, and every thing within doors moved on with its accustomed regularity and dispatch.
               The air was remarkably warm and summerlike for the time of year, and Mrs. Graham cared little what the children did, provided they kept out of her way. So they lived out of doors that week. Behind the garden there was a beautiful little knoll, sloping down to the water's edge on one side, while on the other lay a wide expanse of cultivated fields and rolling meadows. It was a quiet, sunny spot, and soon became one of their favorite haunts.
               Mary delighted to repair thither with her book; and while Tommy amused himself in a thousand different ways,—now chasing some bright-winged loiterer of a butterfly; now gathering large bunches of the many-colored autumn leaves; now throwing stones in the creek, laughing to see them fall with a splash and a clatter; now launching carefully some piece of shingle that he had elevated to the dignity of a boat, and loaded with bits of moss and withered grass—she would sit hour after hour poring over its pages. With a beating heart and a glowing cheek, she read of Wallace the bold and brave, of Bruce and the Red Comyn, of Douglas and Hotspur, of the blue lakes and the brown heather, the wild ravines, and silent, shadowy glens, the foaming torrents, the frowning rocks and the dark mountain passes, until she almost expected, when she raised her head, to see some snooded maid or plaided Highlander stealthily creeping to her side.
               But Tommy was not always content to play alone; and then he would playfully snatch the book from her hand, and run off with it; or he would steal softly behind her, and put his own little hand over her eyes, or lay both palms over the page, so as to prevent her seeing a letter. Then Mary would say,
               "Oh don't, please don't, Tommy! Do let me just finish this chapter."
               But pleading seldom did any good, and, first laying her precious book carefully aside, Mary would run races with him, until he rolled laughing and breathless upon the brown grass. And they took long walks, becoming familiar, not only with every nook and corner of the farm, but with the whole neighborhood.
               But this pleasant state of things did not last long. Dark, cold, rainy days came on, when it was impossible to be out of doors, and when nothing went right within.
               Mrs. Graham had had but one child, and it was now so long since it was little, that if it had ever been troublesome or mischievous, or needed care and attention, she had entirely forgotten it. She had no patience with Tommy, and that was wounding Mary in the tenderest point.
               "For mercy's sake, Tom," said she one morning, as he came in with a basket of cobs, "what are you going to do?"
               "Make cob-houses," replied the child, as he seated himself leisurely on the floor in one corner, and commenced arranging them. "I love to make cob-houses, aunt Betsy."
               "I'll warrant you do, or to do any thing else that makes a muss!" said Mrs. Graham, and she sailed through the room with her cap border blown back, and the strings streaming behind her.
               Tommy raised his edifice to what he considered an enormous height, and having admired it to his heart's content, he took hold of the two cobs that lay at the bottom, and lifted them a trifle from the floor. Instantly, with a crash, and amid a little cloud of dust and chaff, the pile toppled over. Tommy found more pleasure in building his house than in its possession after it was completed; but perhaps he was not very silly after all. If he was, many a "child of larger growth" must plead guilty to the same charge.
               Just at this unfortunate moment, while the cobs were rolling about the floor, and the chaff was still flying, Mrs. Graham returned. It was quite too much for her good housewifery, and she held up her hands aghast at the sight.
               "Well, I do declare!" she exclaimed. "Did anybody ever see the beat of that? Now, Tom Lester, do you just pick up every single one of them cobs, and go put 'em right straight back in the corn-house, where you got 'em. As for having such a muss and a litter about the house, I won't! Do but just look at this floor! I shouldn't think it had been swept in a fortnight. Take 'em along, quick!" and seizing a broom, she began sweeping at a furious rate.
               Tommy gathered the cobs into the basket, and went to the corn-house with them. He thought he would make one meeting-house, with a high steeple, out there; but his fingers were cold and stiff, and the floor was not quite level. The cobs would tumble over, and at last he gave it up in despair.
               An hour afterwards Mrs. Graham, who had been down cellar attending to various matters, came into the kitchen again.
               Tommy had all the chairs in the middle of the floor, tied together with strings of all lengths and colors, and he himself, perched upon the back of the tallest one, was flourishing his whip—so he called a stick with a piece of twine attached to one end—very scientifically
               "My patience! what is that boy up to now?" said Mrs. Graham. "Tom, what have you got those chairs all strung about here for?"
               "Oh, I'm playing go to mill," was the answer. "Willy Gibson does. Get up, Charley! go 'long, Bob!" and he snapped his whip furiously.
               "Well, I ain't going to have such doings here, that I tell you. Get right down off them chairs, and take off all that tackling you've got hitched on to 'em. Then put 'em up in their places, every one of 'em. Such works! This room looks like a hurrah's nest the whole during time!"
               Tommy obeyed her, but his face had a very forlorn expression. Mary sat in one corner hemming some coarse towels; and after he had set the chairs all snugly up against the wall, and rolled up the strings and put them in his pocket, he went to her and laid his head on her lap. She bent over and kissed him, fondly smoothing his bright curls as she did so.
               "Go get that little stool, Tommy, and come sit by me. There, lay your head down on my knee, so. Ain't you sleepy? Don't you want to take a nap?"
               "No, I ain't sleepy," said Tommy, but he laid his head down, and looked thoughtfully in the fire.
               "Oh dear!" he sighed, after a while, "I wish I could ride on a stick, and play that was my horse, as I used to when we lived in our home!"
               The tears sprang to Mary's eyes.
               "Shall we ever have such a home as that again?" she thought. But the next moment she spoke cheerfully to her little charge.
               "Never mind, Tommy. By and by it will be warm and pleasant, and then you can go out of doors and play."
               "Oh, but winter's coming now; John says so, and there'll be a great deal of snow on the ground, and it'll be very cold."
               "Well, you can go out doors some, if it is cold. You can make snowballs when the snow comes. Did you ever make snowballs, Tommy?"
               "No. What are they?"
               Intensely interested was little Tommy while listening to Mary's account of a snowball frolic, and his eyes sparkled as she told him he could slide down hill, and perhaps have some sleigh-rides.
               "But what shall I slide down hill on?"
               "You must have a little sled. Perhaps cousin John will make you one."
               Tommy remained silent for some time. At last he looked up suddenly—
               "Mary, what will the poor little birdies do when the snow comes?"
               "Ah, they won't have any trouble. Some of them have gone away already—way off to the south, where it is warm always. But the little snow-birds like the snow. They will stay all winter, and you can feed them sometimes."
               
               Tommy sat still a few moments longer, but it was dull business.
               "O, I wish I could do something!" he exclaimed, half crying. "Aunt Betsy won't let me do any thing."
               "Hush! hush! Tommy! Don't talk so," said Mary, with a look of alarm at the buttery door, on the other side of which Mrs. Graham was engaged in some of the never-ending duties of householddom. "Shan't I tell you a story?"
               "Yes. Tell me about the 'House that Jack built.'"
               Mary had scarcely commenced when Mrs. Graham came out of the buttery, and sat down in the corner with a pan of apples she was preparing for pies. She lowered her voice, but went on with the story, while Tommy listened eagerly.
               "Mary, for pity's sake do stop that rigmarole," said Mrs. Graham, before it was half told. "I shall go crazy! You and Tommy keep up such an everlasting clatter, that I can't hear myself think."
               "Tommy hasn't got any thing to do, aunt Betsy," said Mary, with a trembling voice, "and he gets so tired sitting still."
               "Nothing to do! For my part, I think he keeps pretty busy. He's in some mischief or other every minute of the time. Go out in the back-kitchen, and tell Delia its time to put on the potatoes for dinner."
               This forenoon was a fair specimen of all. Mrs. Graham could not endure the sight of a straw or a block upon the floor, or of a chair out of place; and the noise of story-telling, or of Tommy's prattle, annoyed her equally. Mary fell into the habit of taking the sewing or knitting with which her aunt kept her well supplied, and stealing off up stairs with her little brother. There she would make him put on his cap and comforter, and the pair of warm mittens good Mrs. Gibson gave him, and keep him there for hours together. Her own fingers would become numb and stiff, so that she could hardly hold her needle; but she would wrap herself in an old shawl, and curling her feet under her, try to keep as comfortable as she could.
               But Mrs. Graham soon put a stop to that. Much as she disliked noise, she disliked nursing still more; and happening to pass through the room one day, when Mary was bundled up in her shawl and an old hood, and Tommy was riding about in his cap and comforter, she stopped in great astonishment—
               "Well, if this ain't a fine operation! Now, just take off your duds, and go down stairs by the fire. You're as blue as pigeons, both of you. You want to be sick, don't ye? so that I shall have you to wait on and take care of!" and she untied Tommy's cap with a jerk, and hurried him down stairs with but little ceremony.
               One evening about the last of November, Mr. Graham and his wife sat by the fire, after the rest of the family had all gone to bed, talking of various matters.
               "Delia's time will be out next week," said the latter.
               "Well, have you made a bargain with her for the winter?" was the reply.
               "No."
               "Seems to me you can't do better," said Mr. Graham; "she is a pretty smart, handy girl; better than most you can get."
               "I know that—she's well enough; but I ain't going to keep any help this winter."
               "You won't make a great deal by doing without a girl, wife, for you'll be down with the rheumatiz just as sure as fates, and the doctor's bill will come to a sight more than Delia's wages."
               "No, I shan't be down with the rheumatiz, either. You see I ha'n't had a twinge of it these six months. The fact is, I'm determined I'll get something out of Mary. There ain't work enough for her and Delia both, besides what I do; and she just mopes round wasting half her time. If I don't keep a girl, there'll be something for her to do."
               "Why don't you have 'em both go to school, her and Tommy? There's a fellow from Carrolton, one of the students, going to teach; they say he's dreadful smart."
               "Tommy can't walk so fur in the winter, and he's pretty small to go any way, and I ain't agoing to be bothered with taking care of him here, and have Mary chasing off to school. Besides, she's just like her mother, fairly bewitched about books and schooling already. She don't mind thunder nor lightning when she gets down with them 'Tales of something or other'—I'm sure I don't know what—that she's a reading; and the more she goes to school, the worse it'll be. I don't mean to send her but precious little, anyhow."
               "If you don't send 'em to school, the neighbors will make a pretty fuss."
               
               "Oh, Tom shall go next summer, and I shall send Mary enough to save the speech of people. But she's got to take hold and work this winter. I ain't a going to have her dawdling about doing nothing."
               "How do you calculate to get your apples cut and dried? She'll make slow work of it," said Mr. Graham.
               "Don't you worry! I shall have dried apples enough, see if I don't! and I'm going to get that rag-carpet under way, too. When I was a girl, girls had to learn to do every thing, and I mean Mary shall—that is, if I can make her."
               "That's well put in, wife. Girls are stubborn things," and Mr. Graham carefully raked up the fire, and laid some dry wood in the chimney-corner, ready for kindling in the morning.
               The next morning, at the breakfast-table, Mrs. Graham asked her husband if anybody could go to the village that day.
               "Why, no, not very well," was the reply. "Sam and Bill are drawing out stone for that wall round the west meadow, and John has to be with 'em, because the young steers are hitched on ahead of the old cattle, and the other boys can't manage 'em; and I've got to go on the mountain to see about that timber. What's wanting?"
               "Why, we ha'n't got a single drawing of tea in the house. When you went to the store Saturday, I didn't send, because I thought I should go myself before this time; and you ain't much of a judge of tea."
               "Borrow some, can't you?"
               "Oh, I hate to borrow; 'tain't my way."
               "I know 'tisn't; but it won't hurt your character just this once; and I can't go to the village, nor send John, before day after to-morrow, any way you can fix it."
               "Well, I suppose I shall have to send to Mr. Thompson's and borrow some, then. But I do hate to, for if I send there once, I s'pose they'll be running here after something or other the whole time."
               After the breakfast dishes were out of the way, Mrs. Graham turned to Mary.
               "Mary, do you know where Mr. Thompson lives?"
               "Yes, ma'am, I believe I do."
               "Where is it?"
               "Why, you go right straight up past the three-cornered lot, and then turn to the right, and follow the creek. It's the first red house you come to."
               "Yes, that's the place. Put on your bonnet and shawl, and run up there, and ask Mrs. Thompson if she will let me have a teacup of tea. Tell her I'll pay it back Saturday night."
               "May I take Tommy?" asked Mary, who saw that the little fellow was donning a very disconsolate face.
               "Yes, take him along, but don't be gone all day."
               Tommy brightened up immediately, and stood very still while Mary washed him and brushed his hair. She was really very expeditious, and they were soon shawled and hooded, capped and tippeted, ready for their walk.
               Not quite soon enough to suit Mrs. Graham, however, who was fretting as they left the door about "the time it took to attend to that child's hair."
               It was a clear, bright morning. The air was keen and frosty, but the creek bounded along with as merry a song as in the summer-time. Close to the bank, it is true, there was an irregular, wavy edging of ice; but in the middle of the stream the water was as blue, and flowed as rapidly, as ever. The children enjoyed their walk extremely, and, by the time they reached Mr. Thompson's gate, their cheeks were glowing, and their eyes sparkling.
               A neat little red house was Mr. Thompson's, all freshly painted, bright and new. The grass in the small door-yard had been swept until not a withered leaf, or a dried stick, was left to disfigure it; and the narrow gravel-walk looked, as Mary said, "too nice to be stepped on."
               The children ventured to do so, however, and Mary's timid knock was answered by a little girl about her own age. The door opened into a small hall or entry, and from that a second door led into the kitchen.
               "Mrs. Graham wants to know if Mrs. Thompson will let her have a teacupful of tea? She will send it back Saturday," said Mary.
               "Walk in," said the little girl, "and I'll ask mother."
               But the children hesitated, and the little door-opener went to consult "mother."
               Presently a pleasant-looking woman came into the entry.
               "Come into the kitchen, and warm yourselves, children," said she. "I will get the tea in a few minutes. You are Mrs Graham's little niece, I suppose?"
               "Yes, ma'am."
               "And this is your brother? What a sweet little fellow he is!"
               "Yes, ma'am," again answered Mary, with a smile, assenting in her heart to both propositions.
               "Amy, take the little girl's hood and shawl. Oh, you'd better take them off while you are resting yourselves, or you won't feel them when you go out," added Mrs. Thompson, as Mary drew back. "Now, Amy, run down cellar and get some apples, and a plate of those nut-cakes I made yesterday. This little boy must be hungry after his long walk."
               "His name is Tommy, ma'am," said Mary.
               "And yours?"
               "Mine is Mary, ma'am—Mary Lester."
               "So I was thinking. I used to know your mother, Mary, when she was no older than you. We were nearly of an age, and I loved her dearly."
               Mary's eyes sparkled, but it was through tears, and Mrs. Thompson saw it would not do to pursue the subject.
               Just then Amy brought the cakes and the apples, and her mother, bidding her take good care of her little visitors, left the children to themselves while eating them.
               The girls were a little shy at first, but the restraint soon wore off, and their tongues flew.
               "I'm real glad you've come to live here," said Amy. "I saw you the very first night you came."
               "You did!" exclaimed Mary; "where?"
               "Oh, in the wagon with John Graham, when you rode past here. But I didn't see Tommy."
               "He was asleep in my lap, that must have been the reason. Don't you ever come to aunt Betsy's?"
               "Sometimes. But you know there never has been any little girls there, and so I never could have had anybody to play with. Don't you love to play?"
               "Yes, but I haven't played much lately."
               "Haven't! why not?"
               "My mother was very sick, and I couldn't."
               "Oh!"—and Amy thinking she had asked a very heedless question, changed the subject as fast as possible.
               By the time Tommy had disposed of his second cake, and had scraped acquaintance with a pretty little kitten that lay curled up on the hearth, Mrs. Thompson came in with the tea.
               Mary rose immediately, and tied on her hood.
               "Don't go yet," whispered Amy.
               "I must," was the reply. "Aunt Betsy said I mustn't be gone long."
               "Well, it's too bad. Oh, mother! mayn't I go part of the way with Mary and Tommy?"
               "Yes, you may go as far as the turn."
               Childhood's friendship is a plant of rapid growth—a mushroom, when compared with the slowly matured attachments of later years. Long before they reached the turn, they had formed a thousand plans for future intimacy.
               "But oh, Mary! why haven't I told you before! Our school begins next Monday, and won't we have nice times! I'll stop for you every morning as I go past Mr. Graham's."
               "Perhaps I shan't go," said Mary, her countenance falling; "aunt Betsy hasn't said one word about it."
               "Oh, of course you'll go; all the girls do. May be Mrs. Graham don't know it begins so soon. You tell her just as soon as you get home. Father says we're going to have a real good teacher."
               "Well, I'll ask her. I do hope I can go. It's two years since I've been to school, and I love to study so—don't you?"
               "Yes, some, not dreadfully," and the laughing eyes of the animated little speaker seemed to say that she liked play quite as well.
               "There, we've got to the turn, and I must go back again. Now, Mary, you tease your aunt Betsy till she lets you go; and you'll sit next me, won't you? Mary Grey wanted to, but I'd rather have you," and so Amy chattered away, walking backwards all the while, until her voice became inaudible, and Mary shook her head playfully. Then she turned and ran towards home, and Mary and Tommy hurried along with their tea.
               "Seems to me you've been gone long enough," said Mrs. Graham, as they entered the house. "Have you got the tea?"
               "Yes, ma'am; Mrs. Thompson said you need not put yourself out, to send it back Saturday."
               "Well, I guess I shall. I don't want to be beholden to anybody. Go put the tea in the cannister, so it won't get scattered."
               
               Mary did so, and then went up stairs with her hood and shawl.
               When she came down Mrs. Graham was folding the clothes ready for ironing, and she thought it would be a good time to speak about going to school.
               "Aunt Betsy, Amy Thompson says school is going to begin next Monday."
               "What school?" was the unpromising response.
               "Why, our school—the district school."
               Mrs. Graham sprinkled another sheet, and, folding it smoothly, laid it in the clothes-basket.
               "Mary, take that basket, and go bring in some chips."
               The chips were brought, and again Mary returned to the all-engrossing topic.
               "Amy says they are going to have a first-rate teacher."
               Still the folding of the clothes proceeded without intermission, and Mary concluded she should not ascertain her aunt's views in relation to the school matters, unless she asked the question plainly.
               "Aunt Betsy, do you think I can go to school this winter?"
               "No, I don't think you can," was the reply.
               Mary's heart grew very heavy, but she thought "perhaps aunt Betsy don't suppose I care much about going."
               So she said, "I do wish I could go, aunt Betsy; couldn't you let me?"
               "When I say a thing I mean it, and you'll never get any thing out of me by teasing, so you needn't begin. You ain't going, and that's the end on't."
               "Where's Mary?" asked John, as the family gathered around the dinner-table, an hour after.
               "I don't know," replied his mother; "I ha'n't seen her this good while. Where is she, Tommy?"
               "Up stairs in Delia's room. She don't want any dinner."
               Mrs. Graham tossed her head, but John's curiosity was yet unsatisfied.
               "What's the reason, Tommy? Is she sick?"
               "I don't know. She said she didn't want to come down stairs."
               "Do eat your dinner, John, and mind your own business," said Mrs. Graham testily. "If she ain't a mind to come to her dinner when its ready, she may go without it."
               John said nothing more, but he shot an angry glance at his mother from beneath his heavy eyebrows.
               The afternoon was half spent before Mary came down stairs, and then her eyes were red and swollen.
               "Well, Miss Lester," was Mrs. Graham's first salutation, "if you think you've sulked and pouted long enough in the cold, you'd better take your sewing, and see if you can't do something. Not a stitch have you set to-day. You won't make much by your contrary airs—now I give you notice."
               "I ain't contrary," said Mary, with a fresh burst of tears, "but I couldn't help crying. I tried to."
               "Tried to! I'd be a baby, and done with it, if I was you. What are you in such dying distress to go to school for? Can you tell?"
               "To be sure I can, aunt Betsy. I want to learn."
               "Learn what?"
               "Every thing."
               "Well, I guess I'll be your teacher this winter. There are a good many things you can learn at home."
               "Yes, ma'am," answered Mary dubiously, "if I only had books. I haven't got many."
               "You won't need many. We shall be able to get along with what you have, I reckon."
               Mary had not ventured to look at her aunt, for her own face was so swollen with weeping, that she did not care to expose it to curious eyes; so she did not see the strange expression that hovered about her lips—half smile, and half sneer.
               She clasped her hands impulsively—
               "Oh, aunt Betsy, I'm so glad! I had no idea you would be willing I should study at home. When shall I begin my lessons?"
               "Next week, if you want to," said Mrs. Graham, as she turned away.
               Mary took up her sewing, and her needle moved nimbly. She chided herself for the tears she had shed, and for the unkind feelings towards her aunt, in which she had been indulging, and resolved to make amends by increased diligence. The pillowcase she was making was completed before dark, and with a bright smile on her face she was tripping from the buttery to the table and back again, when the men came in from work.
               
               In the course of the evening she happened to be in the kitchen with John. She was knitting by the fire, and her face still shone with that same happy expression, one somewhat at variance with that which it usually wore. Her cousin watched her for a few moments in silence, but at length said,
               "Why didn't you come to dinner to-day, Mary?"
               "Oh! I didn't want any. I wasn't hungry;" but her cheek grew a deeper crimson as she spoke.
               "Of course. But what was the reason? Something was the matter, I know."
               "Oh, I was feeling a little bad because I wanted to go to school; that's all. But I don't care much now."
               "You've got over it in a prodigious hurry, seems to me. I ha'n't seen you look so bright since you've been here. Girls are queer things," said John, contemplatively.
               "Well, but the reason I have got over it so quick is because aunt Betsy says I may study at home. She's going to teach me herself."
               "Teach you herself!" exclaimed John, with a loud laugh; "teach you herself! Well, that is great. What are you going to study?"
               "Oh, every thing. Arithmetic and geography, I suppose, and history. I've got a little history—Peter Parley's—and I mean to study that; and I must have a writing-book."
               "Yes, I guess you'll want one," said John, evidently greatly amused. "When are you going to begin?"
               "Next week. Aunt Betsy said so. And, cousin John, if you go to the village Saturday, could you get me a few sheets of paper and some quills?"
               "Yes, I'll get the paper, but you can find some quills out in the yard, where the geese run. Your teacher'll make 'em for you. Oh dear, this is great!" and John laughed until the tears rolled down his cheeks.
               "Look here, Mary," he said, when he was sufficiently sobered to command his voice, "hadn't I better get you some French books—a dictionary, or something? You'll need 'em, and may be one of them big books that have such queer pictures in them, and A B C's stuck round in all the corners. What is't they call 'em? One winter, when the school teacher boarded here, he kept it agoing all the time. 'As A is to B, so C is to D;' just like that. A great deal of sense there was to it. I thought a grown-man might ha' been in bigger business, and I told him so; but he only laughed, and said he was studying——dear! what is the name o' that book?"
               "Geometry?" suggested Mary.
               "The very thing! How in the world did you know?"
               "Oh, our teacher had one once, too."
               "Well, hadn't I better get you one? You'll need it, I ha'n't a doubt of it."
               Mary looked at John earnestly for a moment.
               "You're just making fun of me, John. You know I can't study French nor geometry now. But I mean to some time, and Latin too."
               "Hadn't you better go through college? They ain't overrun with students down to Carrolton now, so I've heard say, and may be they'd be glad to get you."
               "Oh, if I was a man, I would go!" said Mary, enthusiastically. "I'd go if I had to work nights to get money to go with. Why don't you go, John?"
               "Oh, I ain't cut out for that. It would kill me to sit down and study as them student chaps have to. I'd rather see the corn grow and the wheat ripen. But I have sometimes wished lately that I liked to read as well as you do. Little as you be, you know a sight more about books than I do."
               "Mother used to say that the more anybody read, the better they liked it—that is, generally—and I suppose its just so about studying."
               John mused a while in silence.
               "You never went to school much, Mary. What makes you like it, then?"
               "Oh, I don't know; I always did. When I went to school, mother used to make me bring my books home every night, and she explained the lessons, and talked to me about them; and she used to like to have me read to her, and used to tell me about different countries and people."
               "Your mother and mine wa'n't much alike, I guess, if they were sisters," said John, with a sigh. "What did you read in? You couldn't afford to buy many books."
               "No; but I used to get Sunday-school books, and Dr. Williams would lend me any I wanted out of his library. Then Mr. Gibson's folks took the 'Youth's Companion' for their children. Oh, I liked that so much! It came every week."
               "What was it? A newspaper?"
               "Yes; a little newspaper on purpose for children. It cost a dollar a year; and Sam Gibson used to say he would rather go without his supper every single night than to have his father stop the paper."
               Just then Mr. Graham came in with a bushel-basket of corn.
               "Come, take hold, John, and help shell this corn. It must go to mill Saturday. Delia!" he called, raising his voice, "here's work for you, too. Anybody that can eat samp and milk can afford to help shell the corn."
               "I can eat it," said Mary, laughing, as she approached the basket. "May I help, uncle?"
               "You may try; but that ain't saying much. Here, take two ears—so," and suiting the action to the word, a shower of golden kernels fell into the basket.
               John scarcely spoke during the remainder of the evening. Indeed, he seldom said much in the presence of either his father or his mother.
               Mr. Graham was neither an unkind nor a harsh man, but he had never had any time to bestow upon his son, except just so much as was required in teaching him to work. That he had done very successfully. But in his eager pursuit of wealth—in his anxiety to add acre to acre, and farm to farm—toiling day after day through the frost and snows of many a winter, and the burning heat of many a summer noon—he had had no time to become acquainted with his child—no time to enter into the little joys and sorrows that made up the sum of his existence—no time to study his character, to arouse and strengthen its dormant energies, to cherish the good, or to subdue the evil.
               And with his mother, John Graham had even less in common. To do more work than any other woman in the neighborhood, to hire the least "help," to have the largest dairy, and to sell the most butter and cheese, to accomplish the most spinning and weaving—these were the sole objects of her ambition; all well enough in their place, but she carried them out of their place, and allowed them to become the whole of life—to engross every thought and every energy of her nature. No matter whether home was made happy, if the work was only done; no matter how much of family ease and comfort was sacrificed, provided a few shillings could be saved; no matter what hard feelings were engendered and what unkind words were spoken, no matter how many spirits were crushed and broken, how many tempers were soured or hopes destroyed, provided a penny could be made. She too had had no time to bestow upon her son. She had had no time, even in his babyhood, to lavish upon him those fond caresses, those genial, motherly smiles, that seem almost essential to the well-being of the little ones. As he grew older she had no time to play with or amuse him; he must just get out of her way and take care of himself; and when he was old enough to be sent to school, it was a great relief to be rid of his noise; but she had no time to inquire of him about his studies, to interest herself in his pursuits, to assist in the cultivation of his tastes, or the expansion of his intellect.
               So he had grown up alone, destitute of all sympathy or companionship at home; with nothing save the gentle, yet ever active influences of nature to soften and refine his heart. He was generally selfish, obstinate where he dared to be, and somewhat sullen. But the evident helplessness and loneliness of his little cousins, their strong attachment to each other, so different in its manifestations from any thing he had ever before seen, and the pleading gentleness of Mary's manner, had awakened a world of new thoughts and emotions in his breast. He had never been as gentle, as thoughtful, as kind in his whole life, as he was to these children; and his mother, to use her own expression, "wondered what had come over him."
               As he sat there shelling corn that evening, he thought of what Mary had said to him. What to make of it he did not know, but he was very sure that his mother did not intend what Mary supposed she did.
               "When mother spends time hearing a little girl's lessons," thought he, smiling at the bare idea, "or lets her have much time to study, either, I guess we shall all know it. But I don't believe she could teach Mary a great deal, if she tried. I guess the boot would be on the other leg."
               Mary dreamed that night that she had been through college, and had become so well versed in Greek and Latin, that she did not condescend to speak English at all.
               "Pshaw! what a foolish dream!" she exclaimed, as she sprang from the bed at the dawn of day. "But I'm very glad aunt Betsy is going to let me study at home."
               Saturday forenoon Mr. Graham and John went to the village, and after dinner Mary and Tommy went to Mr. Thompson's, to return the tea they had borrowed.
               Amy was delighted to see them, but her delight suddenly abated when Mary told her she was not going to school.
               "But oh, Amy!" said she, "aunt Betsy is going to teach me. I am going to study at home, and may be I'll beat you school-girls yet. Who knows? I shall study like every thing."
               After the children were gone, Amy repeated to her mother what Mary had said of her plans for the winter. Mrs. Thompson shook her head.
               "May be it'll all be as Mary thinks," said she. "I hope it will; but Mrs. Graham is a real schemer, and she ain't going to keep any help this winter. I guess Mary likes her book as well as her poor mother did."
               That evening, in his mother's presence, John handed Mary a roll of something in brown paper, tied with a bit of twine.
               "What's that?" asked Mrs. Graham.
               "Mary's paper," said John.
               "Mary's what?"
               "Why some paper for Mary. If she's going to study at home, she'll want a writing-book, of course."
               John spoke very gravely, but his eyes twinkled, and his face—which his mother did not see, however—was a picture of fun.
               "Pshaw! you needn't trouble yourself again. I've got all the paper she'll want this winter, in my bureau drawer. And next time you want any thing, Mary, you mind and come to me instead of going to John," and the knitting-needles clicked faster than ever.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           I trust we shall,
                           If not fill up the measure of her will,
                           Yet in some measure satisfy her so
                           That we shall stop her exclamation.
                        
                     
                     —SHAKSPEARE.
                  
               
               DELIA'S "time was out," as Mrs. Graham said; in other words the number of months during which she had agreed to "help" that lady in the discharge of her household duties, on condition of receiving one dollar per week for her services, expired on Saturday night; but as an especial favor, and in consideration of sundry privileges that had been granted her, she consented to remain until Monday, and assist in getting the washing out of the way.
               The whole family rose bright and early Monday morning; breakfast was eaten and the table cleared by six o'clock, and while Mrs. Graham and Delia were busy with pails, tubs, boilers, and baskets, in the back kitchen, Mary washed the dishes, wiped the pantry shelves and put them nicely in order, swept the kitchen, and dusted the shining chairs and tables. Just as she had put away her duster, Mrs. Graham called her.
               "Mary, Mary! Run out to the line, and help Delia hang out this basket of clothes—quick! I'll have this tubful rinsed and ready for you, by the time you are through with those."
               She was as good as her word. It was a keen, frosty morning, and the girls' fingers tingled finely when they came in to exchange their empty basket for the other; but no time was to be lost.
               "There, you've warmed long enough. Hurry now, and hang them out, just as quick as you can. Mrs. Kinney has got a line full out a'ready, and I s'pose she thinks she's done something great. She'd crow for a fortnight, if she should get through washing before we do; but if she gets her colored clothes out before I do mine, it'll be something she never did yet."
               These last remarks were probably intended for the edification of the washtub over which Mrs. Graham was leaning, for the girls were halfway to the clothesyard by this time.
               
               The "colored clothes" were out before Mrs. Kinney's, and by eleven o'clock the tubs and boiler were put away, the floor was wiped up, and John had the horse and wagon at the door, ready to carry Delia home.
               Mary and Tommy stood at the window to see them drive off.
               "Get your cap, Tommy, and you shall have a ride," said John. "Never mind his overcoat, Mary. We sha'n't be gone more'n half an hour, and I'll keep him under the buffalo. Here, climb up, Tommy. There, now we're off."
               Tommy was delighted, of course, and Mary was pleased because he was. She stood watching them with a very bright face for a moment, and then thought it would be a good time to go up stairs and bring down her books. She had concluded she would keep them on the little table between the west windows, for it was always light and pleasant there. But before she had reached the door, her aunt spoke—
               "Mary, go down cellar and get some potatoes out of the further bin, and some turnips too, and peel 'em for dinner. Put on the water to cook 'em in first, and then it'll be boiling by the time you get 'em peeled."
               The vegetables were brought, and were ready for boiling in a very short time.
               "Now run up and make the boys' bed, and brush up the room before it's time to set the table. It ought to ha' been done before, but I did want to get that washing out of the way first of any thing."
               Mary flew up stairs with the broom and dust-pan, and just as she had finished her task, John drove into the yard. She took off Tommy's cap and comforter, and rubbed his little cold hands in her own to warm them, and by that time the table needed to be set. So she gave up bringing the books until after dinner.
               Mary did not need to be told that the dishwashing was her work, and that not the least thing must be neglected or overlooked, from the coffee-pot down to a tea-spoon. She had already learned that; and never was a task accomplished more speedily, and yet more thoroughly, than hers that afternoon.
               The last dishcloth and towel were rinsed and hung up, and the sink was as clean as soap and water could make it. Mary brushed her hair, took off her checked apron, and had just started for the stairs, when Mrs. Graham came in with a large pan of beans in her hand.
               "Here, Mary, I want you to sit down and pick over these beans. We must have 'em for dinner to-morrow, and there'll be no time in the morning. Pick over the whole on 'em, for the boys' like 'em cold."
               Mary turned from the door with a very disconsolate air, and taking a few of the beans in her hand, let them drop through her fingers in a way that said as plainly as words, that she wished they were all in the fire.
               "What's the matter? What are you putting on such a long face for, eh?" asked Mrs. Graham.
               "Mayn't I leave these till evening, aunt Betsy, and pick 'em over then?"
               "No; there'll be enough to do this evening. Do 'em right away."
               Mary sat down with her back to her aunt, so that she could not see her face, and tears rolled slowly down her cheeks. It was a grievous disappointment. She had worked hard all the forenoon, thinking that in the afternoon she would have such a nice time to study; and now that great pan of beans would keep her busy until sundown, hurry as she might.
               It was a long, tedious job. The beans were very small, and though she moved her fingers as expeditiously as possible, the sun was just hiding himself behind the mountains, when she threw the last handful into the pan, and leaned back in her chair with a sigh of relief.
               It was teatime, and then Tommy was sleepy, and wanted to go to bed.
               But here a pleasure awaited her, that nearly made amends for the disappointments of the day. When they had gone halfway up stairs, Mrs. Graham called to them.
               "See here, Mary, now Delia's gone, you can take Tommy to sleep with you, if you want to. It'll save washing, too," she continued, as she turned to her work again; "and even one sheet a week is something, such weather as this."
               Tommy had never heard any music that seemed half as sweet to his ears, as his aunt's harsh voice when she uttered these words; and even Mary began to think that there was seldom a night so dark and cloudy, that it had not, at least, "one solitary star to cheer it."
               
               "Oh, Mary, ain't you glad!" exclaimed the little fellow, dancing about in the exuberance of his delight. "Oh, ain't you glad! Now I haven't got to sleep in that little bed alone any more; and I shan't be afraid when I wake up in the dark; and you shall put your arm over me, and kiss me, and tell me stories just as you used to when we didn't live here—Why, what are you crying for, Mary?"
               It would have been a difficult matter for Mary to have explained the source of the tears that were raining from her eyes. Her little brother's artless words had carried her back to their own dear home,—to the little, quiet room where she had slept for so many years; to the tender mother, whose love had brightened and hallowed that humble roof! and then, with a sudden burst of passionate grief, she thought that that love had gone from her forever.
               "Oh, there's nobody in this whole world who loves me now, but just little Tommy," she thought. "Nobody in this world! Aunt Betsy don't love me, I know, and I don't believe she likes to have us here. Oh, mother, mother!" she whispered, and at the sound of that dear name there awoke such a wild yearning to feel the clasp of those fond arms once more; to lay her head upon that mother's breast; to hear her voice, and look to her for protection and sheltering care, that it seemed to her she must die if it were not gratified. But then came calmer thoughts of God and of heaven, of death and of eternity, of a home beyond the skies, and a reunion there, and the little trembling heart grew still again.
               "Oh! I will try to be good, and to please aunt Betsy, and make her love me if I can," she thought, as she rose from the bedside, where she had knelt with Tommy. "But I wonder if mother ever thinks of Tommy and me, and if she knows how much I miss her!"
               Her tears flowed again at the thought, but, before Tommy was asleep, she had checked them, and was ready to go down.
               The kitchen was bright and warm, as it usually was in the evening. Mary sometimes thought it looked more pleasant then than at any other time. The ruddy blaze flickered and danced upon the white walls, the window-panes sparkled, and the very shadows looked warm and cozy.
               Mary had given up all thoughts of studying any that day; and it was well she had, for a large basket of apples stood upon the hearth. Very beautiful were they, too, as they lay basking in the firelight,—some yellow, some green, some red, some striped, and some plain, sedate-looking russets. As she approached the fire, Mrs. Graham looked up from her mending:
               "Bring that big wooden-bowl out of the pantry, Mary, and a sharp knife and a pan. I want you to pare as many of those apples as you can to-night, for some on 'em are beginning to speck."
               Mary brought the required articles, and had peeled, perhaps, a dozen apples, when John came in from doing the "chores."
               "It looks like snow," he said, rubbing his hands; "but it is most too cold for it to-night. What are you doing, Mary?"
               She looked up with a faint smile.
               "Paring apples, or trying to. I don't make much headway."
               "My gracious! I shouldn't think you did. Which had you rather do—pare, or quarter and core?"
               "Quarter and core—a great deal rather."
               "Well, then, jump up and get another knife and a pan, and I'll pare for you a little while. Pshaw! this knife's as dull as a hoe. Mother, where's the whetstone?"
               "In the buttery," was the short response.
               "I'll bring it when I come," said Mary, from the pantry, and presently they heard her rattling the tin-pans and knives, as she felt along the shelves.
               "Do come and get a light," said Mrs. Graham. "Don't try to go by the sense of feeling. You'll break every dish in the buttery."
               But even while she was speaking, Mary appeared with her whetstone, and John soon put both knives in condition to do good service.
               "There, now, hurrah! We'll have this basket of apples out of the way in less than no time," and, running his sharp knife rapidly round one of the fairest and smoothest, he held up the paring in a long, unbroken curl.
               "There, if anybody can beat that, I should like to see 'em do it," said John, tossing it up in the air, and catching it on the point of his knife as it came down.
               "Well, I guess you won't see it done to-night," said Mary, laughing, "for there's nobody but me to try. My! how fast you do pare them!" she added, admiringly, and entirely forgetful that her own knife was still.
               
               "You'd better attend to your own work, instead of watching John's," remarked her aunt. "He'll keep up his end o' the wheel, if you do yourn, I'll warrant."
               It was nearly nine when the apples were all peeled and cored, and the big wooden-bowl set away in the buttery.
               "I'm very much obliged to you for helping me, cousin John," said Mary, as they stood by the fire, while Mrs. Graham was stirring up the buckwheat-cakes for the next morning's breakfast. "It seemed to me that I shouldn't ever get through."
               "No more you wouldn't; you wouldn't have got 'em half done. Oh, Mary," he continued, with a comical look, "how much have you studied to-day?"
               "Not one bit. But you know it's been washing-day, and then there was the fuss of Delia's going away, and all. I guess I shall begin to-morrow."
               John said nothing more, but took his candle and went to bed.
               Mary was very tired, and did not wait for a second bidding, when told to go and do likewise.
               She still kept up pretty good courage with regard to studying at home, and resolved to get up early, and gain as much time as possible. Mary's spirits were easily depressed, but they were elastic also, and, unless the pressure was very steady and long-continued, quickly rebounded from the shock. John's kindness had soothed and cheered her, and she went to bed with a heart much lighter than the one she had carried a few hours before.
               It was just light enough to see to dress when Mary rose the next morning. Tommy was still asleep; the room was very cold, and, pressing one kiss on his forehead, as she covered him up warmly, she hurried down stairs. The fire was burning, and the teakettle on; and Mary set the table, strained the milk when it was brought in, and skimmed the pans that needed it.
               "I'm going to dress Tommy now, aunt Betsy," she said, when breakfast was nearly ready. "May I bring him down, and dress him by the stove in the back kitchen? It's so cold up stairs."
               "Yes, bring him down if you want to; but be spry, so as to bake the buckwheat-cakes before we get ready to sit down."
               Mary hurried with all her might, but when she was combing Tommy's hair, her aunt called her.
               "Come, Mary, do bake them cakes."
               "Yes, ma'am, in just half a minute. There, Tommy, run quick!"
               The cakes were ready before the eaters were.
               After breakfast was over, and the morning's work done, the apples that were peeled the evening before, were to be strung. But as Mary had anticipated that, it was no very great trial. Coaxing Tommy to sit down on his little stool by her side, she told him stories; and, on the whole, they were having a very nice time, when Mrs. Graham came down stairs with a pair of large shears in her hand.
               "Come here, Tommy," she said, seating herself not far from the fireplace.
               Tommy looked bewildered. It was a very unusual thing for his aunt to call him to her; and he did not stir an inch.
               "Come here, I say; I want you."
               But still the child sat, looking first at Mrs. Graham, and then at Mary. The latter was half-frightened herself, and did not know what to say.
               "Tom Lester, do you come here to me," continued Mrs. Graham, and, jumping up, she seized him by one arm, and half-pushed, half-carried him across the floor.
               "There—now stand still," and she took up the shears.
               By this time Mary had found her voice, but it was low and trembling.
               "What are you going to do, aunt Betsy?"
               "I'm just going to cut this young one's hair."
               "Oh, don't, aunt Betsy—please don't!" cried Mary; "please don't! his curls are so pretty. You ain't in earnest, aunt Betsy. You won't cut them off," and she laid her hand on her aunt's arm, pleadingly. Tommy, meanwhile, frightened half out of his wits, was crying as if his heart would break.
               "Fiddlesticks! anybody would think I was going to cut off the child's arm, by the fuss you make. Come, behave yourself," and she roughly shook off Mary's hand.
               "But don't cut it, aunt Betsy! I'd rather you'd do 'most any thing else. Mother always liked to see his hair curled, and she has rolled those long ones over her fingers so many times—oh, you mustn't cut them off!" said Mary, bursting into tears. "You won't, will you, aunt Betsy?"
               "Well, I wouldn't make a perfect fool of myself! The last thing I should think of crying about, would be a young one's curls. I tell you I'm going to cut 'em off. It takes you near about one quarter of your time to brush 'em and fix 'em, and for my part, I'm tired of it. I s'pose your mother hadn't any thing to do but read and curl that great boy's hair, she was so well off, and was such a lady; but I have, and so has anybody that lives in my house."
               Mary said no more; but she watched the shears as they wound their way among the soft shining curls, and shivered as one after the other fell into Mrs. Graham's lap.
               At last they were all gone. Not one little ringlet was left, and Mrs. Graham took them up to throw them in the fire.
               "Mayn't I keep the longest ones, aunt Betsey?" asked Mary, timidly.
               "I don't care what you do with 'em, if you only keep 'em out of my sight," said Mrs. Graham. "Go into my bed-room and bring me the camphor bottle."
               As a precaution against his taking cold, Mrs. Graham rubbed his head well with camphor; and then Mary tried to brush his hair in some way that would make him look as he used to. But she could not succeed, and dropping the brush she caught him to her heart, and shed such bitter tears over him! His little shorn head, and the bare face that had always before been shaded by his soft brown curls, seemed so very pitiful a sight. She thought it was a very cruel deed—and she thought right.
               Tommy was very angry, perhaps more angry than grieved, and he grew none the less so, when the men came in to dinner.
               "What under the sun and moon have you been doing to that boy, Mary?" asked John, as he looked curiously at him. "How queer he does look!"
               "Ha! ha! ha ha!" laughed Bill, "he looks like a plucked goose!"
               "Or a drowned rat!" suggested a third.
               "Or a sick chicken!" said a fourth.
               Tommy ran to Mary and hid his crimson face in her lap. "Take me away, Mary, take me away!" he sobbed; "they all laugh at me!"
               Mary could not keep back her own tears, as she raised the sobbing child in her arms, and carried him into the other room.
               The men were touched.
               "Well now, I wouldn't ha' said a word to the little chap, if I'd thought 'twould ha' plagued him so," said Bill. "I hadn't any idea on't."
               "Nor I!" "Nor I!" echoed the others.
               "Well, it's a precious piece of business, any how!" said John. "Proper precious, I do declare!"
               Mrs. Graham looked any thing but good-natured, as she listened to this little colloquy, but she said nothing.
               Tommy would not come to the table until after the men had gone, and then his aunt was strongly tempted to say that he should not have any thing to eat, or Mary either; but for once she bridled her tongue, and the children were allowed to partake of a cold dinner in peace and quietness.
               The clothes were not yet ready to be ironed, the work was all done up, and Mary thought it would be a fine time to begin her lessons. So she went up stairs and brought down her slate and pencil, an arithmetic, a geography, and a spelling-book, and laid them on the little table. Mrs. Graham was intent upon some work she was doing near the fire, and did not notice her proceedings.
               "Aunt Betsy," said Mary, "had I better cipher this afternoon, or learn a geography lesson?"
               "Better what?" asked Mrs. Graham, without turning her head.
               "Had I better cipher this afternoon, or study geography?"
               "My conscience! are you driving at that yet? I did suppose you had a little bit o' sense. Do you think there's nothing to be done in such a family as this, but to sit down dawdling over them books? I declare you're enough to wear out the patience of Job himself," and whirling her chair round, so that she faced Mary, she poured forth such a torrent of reproach and sarcasm, that the child was half stunned, and for a time could not find breath to answer her.
               "You said I might study at home, aunt Betsey," said she at last, without raising her eyes.
               "Study at home! If you was dunce enough to suppose that I was going to turn schoolma'am this winter, and that there wouldn't be any thing for you to do but to sit at your ease, learning your lessons, it ain't my fault. There are two more mouths to feed, and two more backs to cover—to say nothing of all the muss and litter you make—than there were before you come, and who's a-going to do it? Did you ever think of that? You don't earn the salt to your porridge now, and I should think you was big enough to be ashamed to be a-teasing about your 'studies' all the time, as if you'd been born with a silver spoon in your mouth," and coming up to the table, Mrs. Graham gathered up the books and laid her broad hand on them.
               "I shouldn't have thought of studying at home if you hadn't said I might," said Mary, sobbing. "I might have known better than to believe it!"
               The color flashed to Mrs. Graham's face, and she raised her hand as if to strike; but as Mary shrank back from the threatened blow she changed her mind, and seizing her by the arm, shook her violently.
               "Do you mean to say I lie? Stop your noise, you little fool!" she continued, turning to Tommy, who commenced screaming at the top of his voice. "Stop your noise, quick, or I'll make you! Do you mean to say that I lie?"
               "No, ma'am," was the answer. Mary's cheek was now very white, and she could scarcely control her voice. "I did not mean to say that. But I thought you meant that I should study at home, and that you would teach me; and you knew that I thought so!"
               Tommy had stopped screaming, but he shrank away into one corner, trembling and hiding his face.
               "Well, I'll show you what I meant, if you can't find out by your wits. But first just take this lot o' books, and go put 'em in the cupboard; and then lock the door and bring me the key. And mind you do just as you are bid, or it'll be the worse for you."
               Mary ventured only one glance at that frowning face. It might have softened a heart of stone, but not that of Mrs. Graham.
               "Go 'long with 'em, straight, and then come back to me."
               She was obeyed without a word. Mary would not have dared to speak, even if her tears would have allowed it. Soon she returned and gave the key to her aunt, who instantly buried it in the deepest recesses of her pocket.
               "Now go up garret," said she, "and bring down that large covered basket that stands in the northeast corner."
               After much effort, for the basket was both heavy and unwieldy, Mary succeeded in getting down the two flights of stairs with it. Tommy still stood in the corner, occasionally peeping out from behind his apron.
               "I meant," said Mrs. Graham, lifting the cover of the basket, and displaying by the means various bundles of woollen cloth, of all sorts and colors—"I meant to have let you had this week for a kind of a playspell; but seeing you've got so much spare time, and it seems to hang heavy on your hands, I guess I'd better get some more work round. Hand me the big shears."
               Tommy, who, curious to see the inside of the basket, had crept a little way from the corner, shrank back again as his aunt took the shears. But his head was safe this time.
               "Did you ever sew carpet-rags?"
               "No, ma'am," answered Mary.
               "Well, it's time you had, then. Take this bundle of cloth, and cut the pieces all into narrow strips—so—about so wide, and then lay them so, and tack them together. There's a hank of black linen thread in my stand drawer, and you want a big needle. Now go ahead, and see if you can't do something."
               So saying, Mrs. Graham went back to her own work again.
               And this was the end of all Mary's fine plans for the winter, the awakening from all her dreams of improvement! The irritation, the anger that she had at first felt, was all gone; but in its place was a cruel sense of wrong and injustice, a feeling that—whether wilfully or not she could not tell—her actions and motives were alike misinterpreted, that she was regarded as a burden—as an intruder.
               All that afternoon she sat bending over the basket of carpet-rags; plying the heavy shears until her fingers ached, and deep indentations showed where the steel bows had left their impress. But she scarcely felt the pain, or knew that she was tired. And it was not that her darling projects were all broken up, or that she began to realize that her life must henceforth be one of toil, physical toil, with scarcely any opportunity for mental culture. As the tears rolled slowly down her cheeks, and fell upon the fragments of black cloth, sparkling like drops of morning dew, she scarcely thought of that. There was a dull, heavy weight on her heart, that after a time seemed to deaden all consciousness, and she sat as in a kind of maze, scarce heeding even Tommy's prattle or caresses, until her aunt called her to set the supper-table.
               "I don't like aunt Betsy, Mary. I don't like her one bit," said Tommy, as Mary was putting him to bed that night.
               "You mustn't talk so, Tommy, it isn't right. Aunt Betsy takes care of us, and lets us live here, and sleep in this nice bed. We shouldn't have any place to sleep, if she didn't, Tommy."
               "But she cut off my curls, and she shook you, Mary, and spoke so loud that she made you cry. I don't like her; she ain't a good woman!" and the little fellow stamped his foot violently on the floor. "Let's go back to our house. This ain't a nice place to live, and we'll go and leave her!"
               Mary smiled sadly.
               "I don't know but she'd be glad to have us go. But we haven't got any house to go back to, Tommy. Somebody else lives there now. We've got to stay here, dear, and we must be good and patient, and try to love aunt Betsy as well as we can. Mother would want to have us, because she was her sister. You mustn't forget mother, Tommy. Do you remember how she looked?"
               "Yes, but I can't tell—aunt Betsey don't look so."
               "Don't look how?"
               "As mother did; and she don't speak so, neither."
               "How did mother speak, Tommy?"
               The child hesitated.
               "Mother used to say, 'Come, Tommy, come see mother,'" and his voice was very soft and low; then changing to a loud, harsh tone, he continued: "Aunt Betsy says, 'Tom Lester, come here to me!'"
               Mary smiled through her tears. "I can't bear to have you forget mother, Tommy. She loved you so!"
               "And you too."
               "Yes, and me too. She had brown hair like yours, Tommy. Do you remember?"
               "I do'no'—she looked pleasant at me, and laughed always."
               The little fellow had forgotten the color of his mother's hair, and he could not have described her eyes; but he still remembered the beaming smile, the look of love, and the pleasant, sweet-toned voice. What a lesson for mothers!
               As on the previous night, a basket of apples stood on the hearth when Mary went down, and the evening was spent as the last had been.
               Day after day passed, one but the counterpart of the other. Every evening Mary worked at the apples, while Mrs. Graham sewed. When John was in the house, he generally helped her, but much of the time he was himself busy at the barn, or the workshop, until the evening was nearly spent. It had been a long and most wearisome piece of business, and Mary began to think she should never want to eat another apple.
               Snow had fallen as John prophesied, and the sleighs were flying in all directions. One evening as Mary sat by the apple-basket, she heard the tinkling of bells in the yard.
               Presently John came in, whip in hand.
               "Come, Mary," said he, "get your hood. I've got to go up to Mr. Ormsby's—five or six miles it is—and I want you to go 'long and take a ride."
               The color mounted to Mary's brow, and her eyes sparkled, but she did not move.
               "Don't you want to go?" asked John.
               "Oh, yes, I should be very glad to go; but—" and she glanced towards Mrs. Graham, who sat with her lips firmly compressed, as much as to say, "you ain't going to get a word out of me, that's certain."
               "But what?—the apples?"
               "Yes."
               "Confound the apples! mother, why on earth don't you make a bee and have 'em done, some time or 'nother? Mary never'll get through alone. She can't cut more'n a half bushel in an evening, if she tries her best."
               "You just 'tend to your own business, and I'll 'tend to mine. I sha'n't make a bee for anybody, now I tell you. It costs a great deal more'n it comes to; and if it didn't, the apples wouldn't be pared nor cored as they'd ought to be. I've seen enough of apple-bees."
               "How many more do you calculate to dry?"
               "All that are in the further cellar."
               John took the candle, and went down to reconnoitre.
               "There ain't more'n five or six bushels there," he said when he came back. "Come, Mary, put on your hood and wrap up well. It's cold as blazes!"
               "I don't see how she can go," said Mrs. Graham, "those apples must all be done this week—they're rotting like everything."
               Mary's eyes filled.
               "I'll see that they're every one pared and cored and strung and hung up, before Saturday night. I'm sick of the very sight of 'em. Come, mother, can't Mary go?"
               "What in this world do you want to tote her off on to the mountain for? and she must be a goose to want to go, in the cold. But if she must, I s'pose she must."
               Mary sprang up eagerly, in spite of the ungracious permission, and in a very few minutes was equipped for the ride. Once in the nice little red cutter, half buried in the warm buffaloes and flying over the smoothly trodden snow, she quickly forgot all disagreeables, and apples and carpet-rags disturbed her not.
               The moon was at the full, and it was almost as light as day. The shadow of every little spray and twig was clearly defined, and whenever a light breeze stirred the boughs, they danced and wavered upon the smooth sparkling crust, until Mary thought them quite as beautiful as in the summer-time. Occasionally the long dark shadow of a pine or hemlock would stretch across the road, or a patch of woodland would darken their way entirely; but their good pony bounded along, heeding neither the darkness nor the light.
               The sky was a clear, deep blue, but the stars shone palely. Mary could scarcely trace Orion or the Great Bear, so overpowered were their feeble rays by the strong moonlight.
               For some time they proceeded in silence, but at last John seemed to think it was time something was said.
               "I declare I believe we've made a mistake, and are taking a ride in the day-time after all, it's so light. What makes you so still, Mary? I thought you'd have a real good time, but you are just as sober as death," and he looked earnestly in her face.
               A bright smile rewarded him.
               "Sober, am I? That's strange, for I am having a real good time, and I hadn't thought of looking sober. I was thinking, that's all."
               "Thinking? what about?"
               'Oh, I don't know, a little of every thing. One thing I thought was, that you are very kind to me, to give me this ride."
               John was exceedingly gratified, and felt like investigating the subject a little farther.
               "Well, what else?"
               "I thought about the snow, and how pure and beautiful it is, and how it covers up the tender plants, so that the frost can't touch them."
               "Yes," interrupted John, "snow is first rate for the winter grain."
               "And then I thought how cold it is, and that one wouldn't think it could do any thing any good; but we know it does: and I thought that perhaps—that may be—" she hesitated, stammered, and finally came to a dead stop.
               "Thought what?" said John, very much interested.
               "I don't hardly know how to tell you what I mean, cousin John. I thought that perhaps a great many things that trouble us in this world, and that seem hard, might in reality be good for us, and make us stronger and better afterwards, just as the cold snow is good for the young grain."
               "Well, you do beat me! I never should ha' thought o' that in all this world. Seems to me you think a great deal for a little girl; what makes you?"
               "I don't know as I think any more than other girls; but mother used to talk to me about these kind of things. Oh, do look at that tree, cousin John—there—that hemlock! Isn't it beautiful? Just see what a host of little icicles, and how they sparkle!"
               "Why yes, it is pretty; but I wish I had your eyes. You'd see something pretty a'most anywhere. Here we are," he continued, as he reined his horse up to Mr. Ormsby's gate.
               "Are we going to stop?" asked Mary, somewhat dismayed at the idea of meeting—she did not know whom.
               "Only a few minutes. I've got to see Mr. Ormsby about some ox-yokes, and 'twon't do you any hurt to get out and warm yourself, either. It'll be colder going back with the wind in our faces."
               The ride home was delightful. The air was keen, but Mary drew her veil over her face, and John tucked the buffalo robe snugly about her. The road descended all the way, and Charley needed no other encouragement than the prospect of a warm stable and a measure full of oats. He almost flew.
               John never knew how much good that ride did Mary. He had asked her to go with him partly because he wanted company himself, and partly because the little pale face he had seen bending over the pan of apples the evening before, had haunted him all day. She had exercise enough, it is true, more than enough sometimes—but it was not in the open air; and now this unexpected act of thoughtfulness on the part of her cousin, had left a glow of pleasure at her heart—the clear air and the rapid drive had sent the blood tingling to the very ends of her fingers—her cheeks were crimson, and her animated face presented sented a striking contrast to the listless, spiritless look it had worn at tea-time.
               The next night John made his appearance as soon as the "chores" were done, with a paring-machine.
               "Where did you get that thingumbob? and what're you going to do with it?" demanded his mother.
               "Oh, I came across it, and I'm going to pare every one of them apples before I go to bed. It beats all natur' that I ha'n't thought of it before. And, mother, if you've got any pumpkin pie and cheese, you'd better set some out, for Bill's going to help, and the Kinney boys too."
               "I shan't do any such a thing. If you've been and invited company, you may just wait on 'em, for all me."
               "That I'm willing to do," said John, with a sly glance under his mother's cap, only I thought maybe you'd rather do it yourself. But I know where the cheese is, and I guess I can find the pie. Put down your pan, Mary: we can get along without your help to-night, I guess."
               Mrs. Graham's face looked very unpromising; but as John expected, a plentiful supply of pies, cake, and cheese was on the table by nine o'clock. His mother was by far too much afraid of her credit, to refuse to provide refreshment for the apple-parers.
               The next day the apples were strung, and Mary could have danced for joy when she saw the last festoon depending from the wall.
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           The gloomiest day hath gleams of light,
                           The darkest wave hath white foam near it;
                           And twinkles through the cloudiest night,
                           Some solitary star to cheer it
                        
                     
                     —HEMANS.
                  
               
               THE winter passed slowly away, varied only by an occasional sleigh-ride, or a run up to Mr. Thompson's when Mrs. Graham happened to be in unusually good humor. Two or three times they all went to the village to church, but then Mary heard little of the sermon. Her thoughts flew back to her mother, and to all the old friends, and to the Sunday-school, and she did little more than to give the reins to memory, and wipe away her tears as they fell. As a general thing, Sunday was a very tedious day, both to herself and to Tommy. She had nothing to read excepting her Bible; it was too cold to be out much, and she had no one to talk with unless John happened to be in a conversable mood. She would try to amuse Tommy by telling him little stories, but after a while he would grow tired of that, and become restless and impatient. She was almost always glad when it was bed-time.
               Sometimes of a Saturday afternoon Amy Thompson would come to make Mary a visit; and then if the work was "done up," and Mrs. Graham could be persuaded to let the rag-basket stand quietly in the corner, the girls would betake themselves to the back kitchen, or out of doors when the weather would admit of it, and have rare times. Our Mary was no moper. When she worked, she worked; when she studied, she studied; and when she played, she played; and she enjoyed a wild romping game, a frolic, or a hearty laugh, as well as even Amy herself.
               And as Mrs. Graham found that Mary had given up all idea of studying, and had become apparently resigned to her fate, settling down quietly to the dishwashing and the carpet-rags, she relaxed something of her vigilance. Mary's history was happily up stairs, and so were the Tales of a Grandfather, and whenever she had a little leisure—she never had much—it was her chief delight to steal up stairs, and read a page or two. One day she ventured to bring her book down to the kitchen. Her aunt looked at her very sharply, but said nothing; and from that time she continued to do so.
               On the whole, both Tommy and herself got along very comfortably until the "winter was over and gone," and it was time for the summer school to commence.
               Mary wondered very much whether she was going, and held many long consultations with Amy.
               "I hope I am going, Amy," she said one warm pleasant evening near the last of April, as they were sitting on the large flat stone under the bridge. "I hope I'm going, and Tommy too, but aunt Betsy hasn't said one word about it."
               "What makes you think she'll let you go then? I declare she was real hateful last winter! There! I oughtn't to have said that, Mary, and I didn't mean to; but I don't see how you can love her much."
               "I should be glad to love her if she would let me, but I don't believe she wants me to. Why, Amy, she has never kissed me but just once since I lived here, and then she didn't put her arm around me!"
               "Well, I shouldn't want her to, if it was my case. I should run if she offered to kiss me."
               "Yes, but you have a father and a mother to love you and pet you, and I haven't; and if I thought aunt Betsy loved me the least bit, I should feel more at home here. Besides, she's the only sister mother had, and she ought to love me."
               "Where do your father's folks live?" asked Amy. "Haven't you got any relations but just Mrs. Graham and John?"
               "My father came from Connecticut, but I don't think mother ever saw any of his friends. He never went back there after he first came to Vermont. Aunt Betsy and John are all the relations I know any thing about."
               "John is good to you, ain't he?"
               "Yes, almost always; but—but—"
               "What?" asked Amy, after she had got tired of waiting for Mary to finish the sentence.
               "I don't know as I ought to say what I was going to."
               "Oh, do say it," cried Amy, "I do hate to have folks begin to say any thing, and then leave off in the middle of a sentence. I never'll say a word about it, if you don't want me to."
               "Oh, it isn't a secret; 'tisn't much of any thing at all. I was only going to say that I didn't believe aunt Betsy liked to have John good to me."
               "Why, Mary Lester!" and Amy's black eyes opened to their widest extent; "what makes you think so?"
               "I can't tell, if I try. Little things. It's queer, isn't it?"
               "I should think it was, and ridiculous too. But you did not tell me what was the reason you thought you was going to school this summer."
               "Oh! I forgot. Why, you see, I've got two new calico frocks, and Tommy's got new aprons. And I know aunt Betsy's going to have a hired girl this summer, because I heard her tell uncle she had hired Sally Davis. She said there was going to be so much housework that she could not get along without help."
               "That's good. I guess you'll go; but if you don't, you won't have to work as hard as you do now, and that will be a comfort. Mary, isn't your uncle kind to you? He always seems pleasant."
               "Yes—he's pleasant enough, but he doesn't often speak to me. He don't say much in the house. I sometimes wonder if he ever used to talk to John when he was a little boy, or play with him, as other fathers do with their children. It don't seem to me that he ever did. Did you say school was going to begin next Monday?"
               "Yes; oh, I do hope you'll go! But how shall I find out about it? Shall I stop Monday morning, as I go by?"
               "No," said Mary, after deliberating a little. "If aunt Betsy don't mean to let me go, she will mistrust what you called for, and be vexed enough. Oh, I know! Can't you see our garret-window from your house?"
               "To be sure we can."
               "Then I'll tell you what I'll do. Just as soon as I can, I will find out about it; and, if I am going, I'll hang a white cloth out of the garret-window."
               "That's the very thing; and if I see the cloth, I'll stop for you. I shall keep close watch," and with these words Amy sprang up, and said it was time for her to go home.
               Friday and Saturday came and went, but the word "school" never passed Mrs. Graham's lips. Mary began to grow very uneasy, and her tasks became unusually irksome. Her thoughts were elsewhere; and it is quite probable that her work was not done as well, or as expeditiously, as it generally was. At all events, her aunt found many causes for complaint; and a few crumbs upon the buttery-shelf, and an unwashed plate that she happened to spy on Sunday night, called forth such a storm of reproaches, that Mary went to bed in a passion of tears.
               Amy had watched the garret-window with anxious eyes; and when she rose Monday morning, her first glance was directed thitherward. But no white, fluttering messenger greeted her sight; and it was really with a sad heart that she dressed herself and went down to her breakfast. She was sorry for Mary's disappointment, and almost equally sorry for herself; for volatile and thoughtless though she often seemed, she loved Mary dearly.
               She went past Mr. Graham's, with her dinner-basket and her satchel of books, very slowly, and looked earnestly at all the windows, hoping to catch a glimpse of her friend; but in vain. She was not to be seen. To tell the truth, Mary was at that very moment bending over a washtub in the back-kitchen, "sudzing and rinsing" the clothes her aunt had just taken from the boiler.
               That evening, after sundown, Mrs. Graham sent Mary out to the barn to look for eggs. She hunted for some time without finding more than two or three, and then thought she would climb upon the haymow, where she knew there were several nests.
               Just as she was about to do so, she heard John's voice calling her; and turning, she saw that he had come into the barnyard, and was milking.
               "Hillo, Mary! what are you doing?—hunting eggs?"
               "Yes," was the answer.
               "Well, don't climb up there. You'll break your neck. Some of the boards are loose."
               "But I can't find any anywhere else, and aunt Betsy wants them to-night."
               "Come here, then, till I get through with this cow, and I'll find you some. There's a seat for you. Soh, bossy—soh," he continued, soothingly, as the gentle animal began to step about and frisk her tail, in evident disapprobation of the new-comer. "Soh—there. She's a pretty creature, isn't she, Mary? The best cow in the yard, according to my way o' thinking, and she gives a swimming pail of milk."
               Mary assented, but in as few words as possible. She had been struggling with her tears all day, and now she could scarcely trust herself to speak. John looked at her inquiringly.
               "What's the matter, Mary? You look as if you felt bad."
               Mary set down her egg-basket carefully, but quickly, and covered her face with her hands. Her cousin was both embarrassed and distressed. He did not know what to say.
               But at length, as Mary's low sobs continued, he found his voice, and ventured to use it.
               "Don't cry so, Mary, don't. I can't bear to have you."
               "Oh, I can't help it, cousin John, I can't help it! I have been trying to keep from crying all day," said Mary, without raising her head.
               "But tell me what is the trouble, and maybe I can help you. What is it? any thing about Tommy?"
               "No, not exactly about him. It's only that I wanted——that I hoped—it's only that school began to-day."
               "Sure enough! I hadn't thought of it once. Ha'n't mother said any thing about your going?"
               "Not a word."
               "She's going to have a hired girl."
               "Yes," replied Mary. "Sally Davis is coming."
               John shook his head. "There's no earthly reason, nor unearthly either, that I know of, why you shouldn't go; and you ought to go; but if mother has made up her mind to have you stay to home, it'll be more than mortal man can do to change it. However, I'll do all I can. Cheer up, Mary, don't look so down-hearted about it. Have you got through with them carpet-rags yet?"
               "No; they ain't half done. And the last time aunt Betsy went to Mr. Huntington's, she brought home another great basketful: she's going to pay Mrs. Huntington by and by, when she makes a carpet. Your mother says she's going to make a real large piece while she is about it, and it will take 'most all next winter to finish it."
               John, meanwhile, had done milking, and was upon the haymow. Presently he came down with a well-filled basket.
               "There, Mary, there's your eggs. Run in with 'em, quick, for I've got to go down to the creek, and you mustn't stay in the barnyard alone. If them steers should get one of their tantrums, they'd knock you over in a jiffy."
               Mary went in somewhat comforted. Still, she could not help saying to herself,
               "If aunt Betsy means we should go to school, why don't she tell me so?"
               What John said to his mother, Mary never knew. But be that as it may, its effect was to lengthen rather than to shorten the period of suspense; and it was not until the next Sunday night that Mrs. Graham said any thing to Mary upon the school question. As she was going up to bed, her aunt called her back.
               "Don't you sit up there a reading. Now mind what I tell you. If you do, you shan't set your foot into that schoolhouse this summer. I wish it was in Joppa, or somewhere else."
               
               Mary's heart leaped to her throat.
               "Do you mean I should go, aunt Betsy?" she asked, timidly.
               "Yes, if you act as you'd ought to. I should ha' let you gone last Monday, if you had behaved yourself, and not been in such a stew. Oh, you needn't deny it," she continued, as Mary opened her lips to speak; "I know all about it. And then you went to John with a string of complaints; and that didn't do you any good, either. If it hadn't been for that, I should ha' told you four or five days ago, that I was calculating to let you go at the beginning of the week. So you see just how much you made by it."
               Mary felt as if treading on air, as she bounded up stairs; but, as she saw Tommy's little face lying on the pillow, she bounded down again.
               "Aunt Betsy, may Tommy go too?"
               "Yes: now do go 'long to bed."
               We doubt whether there were many people in Farmingdale who were up earlier than Mary and Tommy the next morning. Tommy was delighted, because Mary was; and besides that, he had so often heard her wish that she could go to school, that he had a kind of an idea that school and paradise were one and the same place.
               How carefully Mary washed and dressed him! Never were clothes more carefully adjusted, or more neatly fastened; and his new checked apron, which she had herself ironed, was as smooth as apron could be. Then she tried to see what she could do with his hair. It had grown a good deal; and although it did not fall in curls as it did before it was cut, it clustered in little soft, shining rings, above his white forehead and on his neck. Mary thought them wonderfully pretty.
               After Tommy was ready, she put on one of her own new frocks, and a clean apron, and went down stairs with a very smiling face.
               "Now, won't you just walk right back, and put on your old frock, Miss Mary?" were the first words that greeted her when she reached the kitchen. "You've got something to do if you are going to school; and I calculate you'll do up the morning work before you stir an inch."
               Slowly, Mary remounted the stairs; but it would have taken a good many harsh words to have made her very unhappy happy that morning; and when she came down again with her old dress on, her face was nearly as bright as before.
               "Tommy," she whispered, as she passed the chair where he was sitting very demurely, "Tommy, keep very still, for fear aunt Betsy will think you are going to get your clothes dirty. I don't believe I shall have time to dress you so nicely again;" and Tommy obeyed her to the very letter, scarcely moving hand or foot, until he was called to breakfast.
               Just as Mary had put away the last dish, and rinsed her towels, she saw Amy coming down the road. She ran for Tommy's hat, and tied it on hastily.
               "There, Tommy, run out to the gate, and don't let Amy go past. Tell her to wait for me; I'll be ready in a minute," and she ran up stairs to change her dress again.
               Very soon she came down, tying her sun-bonnet.
               "But, oh!" she exclaimed, "aunt Betsy has got my arithmetic and geography—yes, and my spelling-book." Away she went to find her.
               Mrs. Graham was down cellar, stirring the newly made soap, and did not turn her head as Mary approached.
               "Aunt Betsy, may I have the key to the cupboard, to get my books?"
               "I ha'n't got it in my pocket. When I go up, I'll get it."
               For five minutes—that seemed to Mary an hour, at least—Mrs. Graham remained by the soap-barrel, stirring its contents, and trying if the long stick would stand upright in the centre—sure proof that the soap was "thick" enough; and then for five minutes more she stood by the potato-bin, measuring it with her eye, and considering whether there were enough to last until "potatoes came again." At last she went up stairs, found the key, and placed it in Mary's hand. It was but a moment's work to open the door, seize her books, spring down the front steps, and reach the gate, panting and out of breath, but very happy.
               Amy and Tommy were waiting for her.
               "Oh, Amy! I thought I never should get here," exclaimed Mary.
               And, "Oh, Mary, how glad I am!" responded Amy; and with light steps and lighter hearts they wended their way to the school-house.
               
               Mary was very much afraid Tommy would do himself some discredit that first day at school.
               "I'm so afraid he won't sit still, or that he'll laugh or speak loud, or something. Oh dear me, Amy! what shall I do if he does?" and she cast upon the little fellow who was trudging along very proudly by her side a look in which love, anxiety, and a pretty firm belief that he couldn't do any thing very bad, after all, were singularly blended.
               "Mercy! I shouldn't mind it one bit if he did," said Amy, laughing. "Why, all the little boys do when they first come to school; they don't know any better."
               "Is the teacher very strict?" asked Mary, for the first time trembling, not for herself, but for Tommy.
               "No, not very. We all like her; but she makes us mind, and learn our lessons well, too."
               "Well, that's just what I want to do. Oh! is there any class in history?"
               "No; but Miss Stowe will let you study it, if you want to, I guess. There! we ain't late; the girls are all outside the door; and see, there's Miss Stowe coming now—the one with the green parasol. She isn't any taller than a good many of the girls. I guess she's going to board at Mr. Huntington's this week."
               Very warm was the welcome Mary received from her schoolmates, as well as from her teacher, although very few of the former were acquainted with her. But they had all heard her extolled by Amy—who was never niggardly in her praises of those she loved—until they were well prepared to consider her an acquisition to their society. Two or three of the girls, to be sure, did not think she was "any thing remarkable," and "couldn't imagine what Amy found in her that was so very wonderful;" but, on the whole, they were very well pleased on both sides.
               Tommy behaved remarkably well, and was caressed, and admired, and praised, until even his sister was perfectly satisfied.
               That was a very pleasant summer for Mary. She was obliged to work hard, it is true. Morning, noon, and night she was busy, but the exercise did her no harm, and the six hours that she spent in the school-house amply compensated, in her opinion, for any amount of fatigue and labor. Study was with her not merely a delight; it was a passion. Her teacher found it necessary to hold her back rather than to urge her on; to repress her ardor rather than to encourage it.
               "How you do study!" said Amy one day, as the two girls were returning from school, and Tommy ran on before them. "To-day, when you were getting your history lesson, I sat and watched you. You didn't move nor raise your eyes once while the class in geography were reciting, and Miss Stowe asked you twice for your writing-book before you heard her. What does make you?"
               "Because I love it, I suppose. Besides, Amy, I know very well that I shall not be sent to school a great deal, and I want to learn all I can while I have a chance."
               "Well, you've learned more this summer—and school ain't near out yet—than the rest of us girls do in two years. Tommy learns fast too. Miss Stowe told mother she never saw such a bright little fellow, and she thought, if he lived, he would make a figure in the world. I suppose she meant by that that he would grow up a real smart man."
               Mary's heart throbbed as she looked at the child who was playing by the road-side, in happy unconsciousness of the fact that his future prospects were under discussion; and from that time her opinion that Miss Stowe was one of the most intelligent and discerning women in the world was very much strengthened.
               "I mean Tommy shall go to college if he lives, Amy," said she, looking cautiously around as she spoke; "but don't you tell anybody."
               "I won't. But go to college? oh, Mary, it costs a great deal to go to college. I heard father say so. I don't believe your aunt Betsy would let him go."
               "Nor I either, if she had to pay his bills. She never would do it in the world."
               "But how can he go, then?"
               "I don't know yet, but I'll manage it some way. He shall have a good education, if we both live—that I'm determined."
               Amy shook her head incredulously.
               "You won't get any help out of Mrs. Graham. Why, John never went to school after he was big enough to work."
               "I know that; but he says he wishes he had. Where are you going, Amy?"
               "Oh, I'm only going to sit down here under the poplar-trees for a few minutes. Come, here's a place for you. I believe these four trees grew here on purpose for the children to rest under when going to and coming from school. How high they are!" she added, looking upward. "When I was a little bit of a girl, I used to think that if I could only climb to the top of this tallest one, I could touch the sky."
               "You could have done one thing just as easily as the other, I guess," was the laughing response, "but I don't like poplar-trees."
               "Don't you? Why not? Just see how the leaves tremble all the time, and they are so smooth and shining. Don't you think they are pretty?"
               "Yes, the leaves are pretty enough, but the tree itself is so stiff and straight, and looks so prim. I don't like it at all. I like elms and maples a great deal better."
               "There's a beautiful maple between here and the village," said Amy.
               "So there is. John showed it to me; but he says it used to be a great deal handsomer than it is now. They call it the 'sugar-loaf.'"
               "Yes, and the 'Lover's tree,' too."
               "Mother told me something very queer about the poplar-tree once," said Mary, and her eyes grew moist, and her voice low and reverential as she went on: "she said that in some countries it is called the aspen-tree, and that the people have a superstition about it. They say that one of them grew on Mount Calvary, near the cross, and that a drop of Christ's blood fell on the leaves, and that that is the reason they always shiver and tremble so."
               Amy said nothing for a few minutes, but raised an awestruck face to the quivering leaves above her. At length she spoke.
               "It is a very strange story, Mary. Do you believe it?"
               "No, not at all. Mother said it wasn't true; but I like to hear such things. I have liked the poplar-tree a great deal better since she told me that than I ever did before."
               "How that graveyard does look!" said Amy, broaching a new subject. "I wish I was a man!"
               "Why? What would you do?"
               "I'd go and cut down all those brambles and elder-bushes. It's too bad! There oughtn't to be any thing but rose-bushes and flowers and green grass in a graveyard, and that is all filled up with thistles and nettles."
               "Are any of your friends buried there?" asked Mary, letting her eyes rest upon the small inclosure near them, where all sorts of weeds and noxious plants were rioting.
               "No. When my little brother died, he was carried to Somersville to be buried. I'm glad he isn't there," she continued, with a shudder. "Come, let's go home."
               The greatest trial Mary had to bear that summer was being late at school. Very often, let her try her best, she could not finish the work her aunt required of her until long past the hour when she should have been at her desk; and very frequently—whenever, indeed, there was any extra work to be done—she would be compelled to stay at home all day. That was a very great annoyance, for she not only lost her place in her classes, but she lost time, to her a much more serious consideration.
               But there was an unexpected blessing too. One night, when she came home from school, her aunt said,
               "Mary, you may carry that basket of carpet-rags up garret again. You won't have time to do much to 'em this summer, and they're only in the way. I'm tired of seeing 'em round."
               It was a great relief. Other work there was to do, and plenty of it, but Mary was glad of a respite from that task.

                     —SHAKSPEARE.
                  
               
               IT was a bright morning in October, just twelve months after Mary and Tommy came to Farmingdale.
               Nearly the same group were gathered round the breakfast-table. Sally Davis was in Delia's place, and one or two of the "hired men" had been supplanted by others, but essentially it was the same.
               Mr. Graham and his wife, John, Mary, and Tommy, occupied the same positions at the board; the piece of cold boiled pork that ornamented the centre of the table, looked like the identical piece that had stood there then; and but for some changes in two or three of the group, you would hardly have believed that a year had passed.
               Mrs. Graham's face was as hard and as forbidding as ever; her husband was apparently as much engrossed in his own pursuits; but the three youngest had altered. Mary was not now the child that we first saw leaning from the door of the little brown cottage. She had grown taller and more womanly; the light in her eye was more subdued and deeper. Grief for the loss of her mother, and her love and care for Tommy, had each touched harp-strings that had never vibrated before; and there was something in her face that made you think she was ever listening to their music. She had always loved Tommy, always cared for him; but, after the boy became motherless, that love grew a very different thing from the light, careless love of childhood; it partook largely of the holiness, the depth, the fervor, the self-abnegation that characterizes that of a mother for her child. The responsibility that she felt rested upon her—for she always considered herself as the guardian of Tommy, and never thought of depending upon any one else for the fulfilment of her plans with regard to him—gave to her whole bearing an air of quiet dignity, that, while it never banished the simplicity and artlessness of early girlhood, yet made one almost inclined to regard her as a woman.
               Tommy had grown, but that was all. Mary's affection had been, in a great measure, as a shield between him and trouble; and when she could not prevent its approaches, she had taken so much the largest share to herself, that his part of the burden had been comparatively light. He looked as roguish and mischievous as ever.
               John had changed the most of the three; and yet it was a change to be felt, rather than seen. Mary's influence over him, too, had been very great, although, if he was aware of it, he might have been unwilling to have acknowledged the fact; yet her gentleness, her thirst for knowledge, the perfect purity of thought and deed that were manifest in her every movement, the refinement and shrinking delicacy that prevented her from ever intruding even upon his notice, and her conscientious discharge of all the duties devolving upon her, had, at first, awakened a feeling of wonder, and then one of curious admiration, which had, in its turn, been lost in one of affectionate regard.
               And that very affection, in which there was a mingling of pity, of tenderness, of pride—the pride of the protector—and of reverence,—that very affection had already had an elevating and refining influence upon his own heart. Already he was beginning to long to become better and nobler than he was; already emotions and aspirations, of whose existence he had hitherto been utterly unconscious, were awakening within his breast. He was beginning to feel that he was the possessor of powers and energies of which he had never once dreamed; and that feeling imparted to his whole manner an air of self-respect that commanded the respect of others.
               But we have wandered far from the breakfast-table. Mr. Graham had finished his own repast, and, after shoving his plate and coffee-cup one side, sat waiting for the men to complete theirs.
               "Wife," said he, bringing his hand down upon the table with an energy that made the dishes rattle dangerously, "Wife—I forgot to tell you—the old Sherwood place is sold at last."
               "You don't say so! Who to?" asked Mrs. Graham, setting down the cup she had carried half-way to her lips.
               "To a man by the name of Vaun, they say."
               "But where is he from?"
               "Somewhere down south. Massachusetts, I believe."
               "How did he happen to find his way up here?"
               "I don't know; followed his nose, I suppose."
               "Well, but how did he know any thing about the place, or that it was to be sold?"
               "Takes the newspapers, probably. It's been advertised for a year."
               "Wonder if he pays cash down?" said one of the men. "Do you know what he gave an acre?"
               "The heirs asked sixty-five dollars. I don't know what he gave."
               "When is Mr.——what did you say his name was?—Vaun?—going to move his folks and things?" asked Mrs. Graham.
               
               "Not before spring. They are going to fix the house up some first."
               "Oh! I s'pose they're wonderful nice folks! I should think that house, where good old Mrs. Sherwood spent her days, might be good enough for these new-comers. What are they going to do to't?"
               "Not a great deal; paper and paint it, I believe. And I heard Charles Sherwood say Mr. Vaun was going to have the little sitting-room fixed up for a study, or a library, or something; going to have shelves on one side let into the wall."
               "Oh, my!" again exclaimed Mrs. Graham; "and has he got books enough to fill 'em?"
               "I guess so; for Charles said Mr. Vaun thought that the north side of that room was the only place in the house suitable for bookshelves, but was afraid there wouldn't be room enough."
               Mrs. Graham pushed her chair back furiously.
               "Well, I've heard enough about 'em. You needn't say another word. The old place will go to rack and ruin in less than no time. Farmers are getting so many notions now-a-days," she continued, springing to her feet, and beginning to gather up the cups and saucers at a terrible rate, "that it's enough to make a body sick. Library! I wonder if she's thought of her milkroom (we take the liberty of presuming that the she, in this sentence, refers to Mrs. Vaun), or her cellars, or her buttery? I'll be bound they don't, any of 'em, know whether there's a place for a spinning-wheel or a loom. Library!"
               Mary had paid but little attention to this conversation, until her ear was caught by the words "books" and "library." Then she listened intently, and with a cheek that betrayed the interest she felt. She had ventured but one glance at John, but that had satisfied her that he was somewhat interested also.
               As Mrs. Graham went about her work with even a quicker step than usual, she could not forget the conversation of the morning. Every now and then Mary would hear her muttering to herself something about "libraries," "gentlemen farmers," "folks being too nice to work," and all that, until at last the storm burst forth anew.
               "I declare, I'm out of all manner of patience when I think of it! If it was any other place, I could stand it better; but to see that go to destruction, is a little too much. And to think it might have been all in the family just as well as not! If your mother hadn't been such a goose, or so contrary, I don't know which," she continued, turning to Mary, as if she held her accountable, "that Sherwood place would ha' been your'n and Tommy's now. I never shall forget it of her—never—never."
               Mary looked up in astonishment.
               "Mine, aunt Betsy, and Tommy's?"
               "Yes, your'n and Tommy's. You needn't stare so. I ain't a lying. She might ha' married Jake Sherwood if she'd been a mind to, but she wouldn't."
               "Who is Jake Sherwood?"
               "He's dead now. He was uncle to these boys, Charles and Peter. Yes, he wanted your mother, but she wouldn't have him. I believe she was bewitched! And then it wasn't six months before she up and married your father; and he wasn't worth a red cent."
               "But he was a good man, aunt Betsy, and he loved mother, I know he did; and I don't believe she was ever sorry she married him."
               "Humph! I guess likely. I reckon it would have been a kind of a comfort to her, when she was on her death-bed, if she'd know'd she had a right good farm to leave to her children. But she never had a bit o' common sense."
               Mary burst into tears.
               "Oh! don't talk so, aunt Betsy. Mother never did about you!"
               "Never did about me! Good reason why—she never had a chance. I never spent my time a fussing and reading; and when I got married I calculated to better myself; and I did."
               "Oh, I didn't mean that, aunt Betsy, I didn't mean that; I only meant that when mother said any thing about you, she always spoke kindly; and I can't bear to hear you find fault with her."
               "Well, well; it's all past, and there's no use in crying about spilled milk. But I'm always mad when I think about it."
               That afternoon John came in from his work earlier than usual.
               
               "I've got to go out to Lake Winmere, this afternoon. Don't you want to go along, Mary?"
               "I should like to go very much," was the reply, "for I've never been out there. But I've got this ironing to do—Sally's busy."
               "Let the ironing go. Can't you do it this evening? Where's mother?"
               "She's gone to Mrs. Huntington's to see about that wool."
               "Well, put on your bonnet and come along. I'm all ready. If you finish the ironing this evening, it'll be all the same."
               Mary thought there might possibly be some difference of opinion about that; but the temptation was very great. It was a delightful afternoon. She had not taken a ride in a long time; and her arms ached, for she had been ironing several hours. She really needed rest.
               John came up to the table and looked in the clothes-basket.
               "Pshaw!" he exclaimed; "there ain't but a handful of 'em, any way. You can do 'em this evening, just as easy. Come! I shall be back before dark."
               Mary hastily folded her ironing-blanket, and ran up stairs. By the time she was ready the horse was at the door.
               "In just one minute, John," she said, as she flew past him. "I must ask Sally to see to Tommy when he comes in. He's gone to the woods with one of the men."
               "How you do look out for Tommy!" remarked John, as he helped her into the wagon. "You never seem to forget him one minute."
               "Who would look out for him if I didn't?" said Mary, shaking her head, with a smile, that seemed partly sad and partly glad. "I don't know, I'm sure."
               A few minutes brought them to the Sherwood place, and this carried their thoughts back to the breakfast-table.
               "So we're to have some new neighbors in the spring," said John.
               "Yes; so it seems."
               "I expect you'll like 'em first rate, Mary."
               "Me?" asked Mary, turning round in surprise. "What makes you think so?"
               "Why, they seem to be reading folks, and all that. You know what father said about their books?"
               "Yes; but I sha'n't like them just on account of their books."
               "But I suppose they're scholars. 'Taint likely they'd have the books, if they didn't want to use 'em."
               "Well, their being scholars won't make me like them, either," said Mary, with a bright smile.
               "What will, then?" asked John, with a puzzled look. "I thought you always liked people that were."
               "Oh, no, cousin John, not always. Mother used to say that, after all, folk's hearts were of more consequence than their heads. I shouldn't like a man if he knew ever so much, unless he made good use of his knowledge."
               "What is making good use of it?"
               "How you do catechise me, cousin John! You know just as well as I do."
               "Maybe so—but tell me. I want to know what you mean by making a good use of knowledge?"
               "We don't make good use of it unless we grow better as we grow wiser. Knowing what we ought to do won't do us any good, unless we try to do it. Do you think it will?"
               John made no reply, and for some time they rode along in silence. The air was as soft and balmy as that of June, the sky was a clear, deep blue, and the stray clouds that occasionally floated across its surface, and that were piled up in the west, so dazzlingly white, so purely beautiful, were no messengers of evil. A soft golden haze hung over the mountains, and bathed their steep sides as in a flood of glory; and a light breeze just stirred the tree-tops, calling forth from the trembling leaves a strain of low, faint melody.
               Mary's eye drank in the full beauty of the scene, and her spirit was revelling in realms of light and loveliness, when John's voice called her to earth again.
               "Mary!"
               She started from her reverie.
               "What, cousin John?"
               "Mary, I've a great notion to go to school," and John snapped his whip softly, and looked very earnestly in the direction of the mountains.
               "To school? oh, that's good!" exclaimed Mary, clapping her hands; "but where'll you go? not down here to the school-house?"
               
               "No, that's the very question. I ha'n't been to school now since I was a little boy. I guess I was about twelve years old when I quit; and I can't begin again there. If I go to school, it must be somewhere else, though I think it's likely our teacher, here to home, could teach me just as much as anybody."
               "Yes, perhaps he could; but you mustn't go here, you would not learn any thing. Why don't you go to Carrolton, to the Academy?"
               "That's just what I've been thinking of, but I wanted to see what you thought about it. Do you suppose I could get along there?"
               "Get along! To be sure you could. What do you want to study?"
               "I don't much care. I want to learn how to study, most of any thing. You see, Mary, I've been thinking this long time that I didn't want to live along in this way all my life, and never know any more than I do now. I never thought much about it until you came here, and I shouldn't have cared if I had; but somehow or other you've managed to put some new ideas into my head. I've never forgotten what you said that first Sunday night after you came here, about our minds needing food as well as our bodies. I want to read, and study, and improve myself; but the trouble is, I don't know how to begin. I took up your history one day, and read some; but it went right in at one ear, and out at the other."
               John paused, quite out of breath, with this unusually long speech.
               "Well?" said Mary, inquiringly, after a little pause.
               "Well, I've been thinking that if I should go to school this winter, off to Carrolton, or somewhere, where I wouldn't have to be bothering about the chores two-thirds of the time, maybe I should get started in the right track, and then I could keep going ahead. What do you think, Mary?"
               "I think it's a famous plan," said Mary, enthusiastically. "The best in the world! Have you said any thing to your father?"
               "Not a word. I don't know how he'll like it, and I expect mother'll be raving crazy;" and John sighed very slightly.
               Mary smiled in spite of herself, and looked a little anxious, too, for she felt very sure that there would be a breeze, and a pretty stiff one.
               "Cousin John," said she, presently, "couldn't you persuade uncle Graham to take some more newspapers? There ain't any thing in the 'Farmingdale Whig' that's worth reading; not often, at least."
               "I'll try," was the answer; "they take two or three papers at Mr. Thompson's, and he don't begin to be worth as much as father. But the difficulty is, Mary, mother thinks these things are all nonsense, and that it's just throwing away money. You know how she talks—and father don't care much about 'em himself, and so he does just as she says. But look there," he continued, pointing with his whip, "there's Lake Winmere."
               "Oh, John, do stop a minute, just here, and let me look!" exclaimed Mary, as she leaned eagerly forward, and the color on her cheek deepened to the hue of the crimson rose. "Do stop—I never saw any thing so beautiful!"
               John did as he was requested.
               "So a young man who was up from New York two or three years ago—a painter—said. He was round about here all summer, 'sketching,' I believe he called it. And one day last spring when I was at the village, I heard 'Squire Stevens telling about going to his rooms the last time he was in New York; and what do you think he saw? A picture of this very Lake Winmere, and the mountains, and the island, and all, just as natural as life."
               And the artist might indeed have "gone farther" in search of a subject worthy of his pencil, and "fared worse." The lake, only four or five miles in length, mirrored in its pure surface the mountains that on one side rose almost from its margin,—some partially cleared, but for the most part covered to the top by a thick growth of pine and hemlock, while jutting rocks, sharp angles, and frowning precipices, gave additional wildness to the scene. The waters themselves were "deeply, darkly, beautifully blue," in some places glowing and sparkling as the last red light of sunset fell upon them, and in others sleeping quietly in deepest, densest shadow. Numberless little spots, by courtesy called islands, dotted its surface; but the island par excellence lay near the middle of the lake, and was about half a mile in circumference. It looked like an emerald in a silver setting.
               
               Mary drew a long breath of delight, as she settled back in her seat again.
               "It is so beautiful! Oh, see that little boat—who uses it?"
               "People from the village are out here very often—have picnic parties—I believe that's what they call 'em, and they 'most always bring their dinners with them, and go across to the island in that little boat."
               "And what is that long, low, wooden building on this side?"
               "That's the Glass-Factory. Some time I'll come here with you earlier, and take you in to see them blow the glass. It's a real sight, but we haven't time now."
               John's business was speedily accomplished; and then, as it was after sundown, he drove home as fast as possible, talking eagerly all the way about the academy and the newspapers.
               Mary had spent a very pleasant afternoon, and it was well she had; for otherwise it would hardly have made amends for the harsh words and angry looks that greeted her on her return home.
               Mrs. Graham came back from Mr. Huntington's in the very worst of humors, for she had not succeeded in accomplishing the business on which she went; and when she found a few pieces yet in the ironing-basket, and Mary away, her temper was not at all improved.
               The flat-irons were still at the fire, and hastily spreading out the ironing-blanket, she arranged a tablecloth upon it, and commenced operations. To tell the truth, she was very much afraid Mary would return before she had emptied the basket.
               "There they come," said Sally, just as she was folding the last towel. But before John had driven into the yard, the irons were put away, and nothing was to be seen of basket, holder, or sheet. Mrs. Graham sat by the hearth, plying her knitting-needles diligently. She did not lift her eyes, or speak when Mary came in; and at length the latter said pleasantly, for the silence seemed to be growing ominous,
               "We had a very pleasant ride, aunt Betsy."
               Aunt Betsy did not vouchsafe any reply, and Mary went in search of Tommy.
               She replaced the irons before she sat down to tea, and her aunt watched her, with a sarcastic smile on her face, as she arranged the blanket, took up a hot "flat," and then went to the basket in search of the clothes that she supposed were yet to be ironed. It was empty, and with a look of astonishment, she turned towards Mrs. Graham.
               "What was you calculating to do?" demanded that lady.
               "I was going to finish the ironing," she answered; "it wasn't quite done when I went away."
               "No, I shouldn't think it was, quite; but it is now. I don't intend to have my clothes scorched nor half-ironed either, by candlelight; so I finished 'em myself, tired as I was. And, for my part," she continued, raising her voice, "I believe that's just what you expected. You meant to shirk the ironing off on to somebody else."
               "I didn't mean any such thing, aunt Betsy. There wern't but a few pieces, and I thought I could do them this evening."
               "Don't talk to me. I know better, and I'm very glad I've found you out. You ain't fit to be trusted half a minute. Next time I shall—"
               "Look here, mother," said John, who had just entered, "why can't you let me have a share of the fun? It's too much for Mary, and, besides, 'tain't her fault. She wouldn't have gone, if I hadn't teased her."
               "That don't mend the matter. She needn't have gone because you was a-mind to ask her. She knew how the work was; but you men folks never understand any thing about women's business."
               A few days afterwards, John, having already obtained his father's consent, announced his intention of going to the Academy that winter. Mrs. Graham's chagrin, anger, and mortification, at first knew no bounds; but as she saw her opposition would do no good, now that her husband had given him permission to go, she finally concluded it would be as well to yield the point graciously.
               Inquiries were made, and it was found that the winter term would begin in about two weeks. Very busy weeks they were. There were shirts to be made, stocking heels to be run, pocket-handkerchiefs and cravats to be hemmed, besides having a tailoress in the house, to make an entire suit of new clothes. After Mrs. Graham found he was determined to go, she had too much pride to allow him to go unprepared.
               Mary thought it would be very lonely after John was gone, and she was much pleased when she found he would come home every Saturday, and stay until Monday morning.
               
               "Yes, I shall be home every Saturday, and after the snow comes, I can give you and Tommy a sleigh-ride once in a while," he said, the evening before he started. "There! I promised to make that boy a sled, and I haven't. But I shall have time yet, before he'll need it."
               But in spite of that, and in spite of being rejoiced from the bottom of her heart, at the cause of his departure, Mary missed him greatly.
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               
                  
                     
                        A dram of sweet is worth a pound of sour.
                     
                     —SPENSER.
                  
               
               VERY soon after John's departure, Sally Davis received an intimation that her services were no longer needed by Mrs. Graham; and in the course of a week or two, Mary was again installed "maid of all work." Again the rag-basket made its appearance, and her fingers renewed their familiar acquaintance with the heavy shears, and the coarse needle. Again the cutting and drying of apples went on evening after evening; in short, Mary was living the preceding winter over again, with some added discomforts and privations. Mrs. Graham was even more sullen and morose than usual. In her "heart of hearts" she believed that John's newly awakened thirst for knowledge was solely owing to Mary's influence. She would not, for the world, have paid her niece the compliment of acknowledging so much, but her ill-humor vented itself in a thousand petty annoyances. The work was so arranged—purposely, Mary thought—that she had not a single hour that she might claim as her own. Her tasks commenced at daybreak, and ended only when she sought her pillow. They were not always difficult or even disagreeable, but they were unceasing. Books were rarely opened, and a visit to Amy, or a rapid walk in the open air, were pleasures seldom even anticipated.
               Mrs. Graham had at first insisted that Tommy should attend the winter school; not because she was anxious for his improvement, but because she wanted him out of the way. Mary was very unwilling to have him take such a long, cold walk alone, but her faintly uttered objections were of no avail. Go he must, and go he did; until one stinging cold night about the first of December, he returned from school with the tears half frozen on his little purple cheeks, and his feet so benumbed by the frost and snow, that he could hardly use them. For a week he was unable to leave the house, and by that time Mrs. Graham had concluded that the experiment might possibly cost more than it would come to, and yielded a reluctant consent to his remaining at home.
               As he grew stronger, however, his noisy, and, it must be admitted, at times even boisterous play, again became an excessive annoyance to his aunt, and she resolved to endure it no longer.
               "Tommy is big enough to be doing something," she said to Mary one day. "He might a'most earn his living; and he can learn to sew those carpet-rags together just as well as anybody. I'm going to set him at it."
               She accordingly did so; and for a few days Tommy thought it was very funny indeed. But he soon grew tired of his monotonous employment—continued as it was for two hours in the forenoon and two in the afternoon—and his little, sad, spiritless face, his weary, uneasy motions, and his long-drawn sighs, as he awkwardly handled his needle, became very sore sights to Mary.
               One afternoon of the week before Christmas, Tommy surprised Mary, as they sat alone by the kitchen fire, by raising his eyes suddenly from his work, and asking,
               "Mary, who is Santa-Claus?"
               "Santa-Claus! Who told you any thing about Santa-Claus?"
               "Oh! I heard the boys at school talk about him. He comes down the chimney the night before Christmas, and puts things in little boys' stockings."
               "What things?"
               "Balls, and whips, and tops, and candy, and every thing! He brought Frank Huntington a picture-book last year. Who is he, Mary?"
               "Oh, I can't tell you, Tommy. I don't know much about him myself."
               
               "But why don't he bring me any thing? He never did."
               "Maybe he forgot it," said Mary, evasively.
               "Oh, it's just because I never hung up my stocking! that's the reason!" said Tommy, clapping his hands eagerly. "I'll hang up my stocking next time, and then he won't forget me.'
               Mary made a faint attempt to dissuade him, for she greatly feared that Santa-Claus might "pass by on the other side," even if he did place his stocking by the fireplace, in exactly the right position; but the enthusiastic child was so elated by the throng of bright hopes and fancies that were paying him an unwonted visit, that her words were entirely unheeded. For the next three days, whenever the children were alone, Tommy's tongue ran incessantly upon one theme—Christmas and Santa-Claus. Mary could not bear to think of the disappointment that she well knew awaited him, unless she could devise ways and means of filling his stocking, and she lay awake more than one night pondering the question. Every article that she possessed passed in review before her. The procession was not a very long one, and contained absolutely nothing that would answer her purpose. She had no trinkets or toys—nothing that would please the fancy of a child—nothing, in fact, that Tommy had not seen and handled a hundred times, and that he would not recognize immediately.
               There were some bits of bright scarlet cloth among the carpet-rags, and Mary thought that if she only had an old stocking-leg to ravel, she might manufacture a very pretty ball—one that the little fellow would consider quite a treasure. Accordingly, one night after Tommy had gone to bed, she ventured to broach the subject to her aunt.
               "Aunt Betsy, do you know of any old stocking-leg that I can have?"
               "Any old stocking-leg? What do you want it for?"
               "To make a ball for Tommy, if you will please let me take some of those scarlet pieces to cover it."
               Mrs. Graham did not answer, and presently Mary repeated her question.
               "No—I don't know of any that you can have," was the reply.
               "There used to be some stockings in a basket up garret," said Mary, hesitating. "Mayn't I look there, and see if I can find just one pair, aunt Betsy?"
               "No you mayn't. You ain't going to make balls for Tommy out of old stockings, nor any thing else. You haven't any time to spare, in the first place; and then he'd break every window and looking-glass in the house before spring, if he had a ball."
               "But, aunt Betsy, if you'll let me make one, I'll wind it loosely, so that it won't be hard at all; and I'll teach him that he must not throw it towards the windows or the looking-glass. Do please let me make one!"
               "There's no use teasing about it," said Mrs. Graham, with a very determined shake of the head; "I ain't going to have a single ball about the premises."
               That plan had failed, and now Mary had but one resource left. In a little purse that had been her mother's, she had found, some time after she came to Farmingdale, some small bits of silver, amounting in all to not more than three shillings. Her tears had fallen over them, thick and fast, as recollections of the dear hand that had placed them there crowded upon her memory, and she had thought she would never part with them,—that while life and reason lasted, she would treasure them as relics of the mother she so fondly loved. When she went to her room that night, she opened her trunk, and took from it what seemed to be merely a roll of white linen. It was in reality the purse; and after removing the envelopes in which she had carefully folded it, she reverently unfastened the clasp, and let the shining bits of silver drop, one by one, into her hand. For a long time she sat there gazing on them from beneath eyelids that were heavy with unshed tears. Soulless, insensible though they were, for her an almost human interest clung around them, and the idea of committing them to the keeping of strangers, of exchanging them for the trifles of a toy-shop, seemed almost sacrilege.
               "Oh, I cannot do it," she murmured; "I cannot do it. Tommy will have to be satisfied with an apple; and maybe aunt Betsy will let me pop some corn for him;—he likes that."
               But apples and popped corn he could have almost any day. He would expect a very different gift from Santa-Claus, and she knew he would not be satisfied. She glanced uneasily from the money to the little curly head that rested on the pillow, and then back to the money again. Just then Tommy tossed his arms restlessly about, and with a half smile on his parted lips murmured an incoherent sentence, of which "Mother" and "Willy Gibson" were almost the only intelligible words.
               With a sudden gush of tears, Mary dropped the silver in her pocket, and after pressing the worn and faded purse passionately to her lips, she replaced the wrappers carefully, and again deposited it in the trunk.
               The next day was Saturday, and, as usual, John came home long before sundown. Mary had never been more glad to see him, and, apparently, the pleasure was mutual. But that evening, and all the next day, it seemed to her that the fates were at work to prevent her having any opportunity to speak to her cousin alone. If she sought him in the kitchen, either her aunt or Mr. Graham was sure to be there. She followed him to the barnyard when he went out to milk—for though he was a sort of visitor on these occasions, he neglected none of his accustomed duties; but when there, she found one or two of the hired men loitering about; and when the last cow was milked, they all went into the house together. John proposed a ride in the evening, but his father said the cutter was broken and the horse needed shoeing. So that had to be given up. Mary thought it was very provoking.
               But on Sunday night they happened to be left alone for a moment, and John came quickly to her side.
               "What do you want to say to me, Mary?" he said; "something, I know. Speak quick, for it is too terribly cold for you to stay long where there is no fire, and we must go back to the kitchen in a minute."
               Mary drew the money from her pocket.
               "I only wanted to ask you if you would not take this money and buy me something for Tommy. He says he is going to hang up his stocking Christmas-eve," she added, in reply to his inquiring glance, "and I want something to put in it."
               "And something you shall have," was the hearty response. "But what shall it be, Mary? A top, or a toy-horse, or a dog, or what?"
               "I don't care much what it is. But I couldn't bear to have the little fellow wake up in the morning and be so disappointed. He has set his heart on a visit from Santa-Claus."
               "What funny notions children do have! But Tommy shall find a stocking-full. I'll bring him some nuts and candy."
               "Oh, that's good! And you'll be sure to be home in season, won't you, John?"
               "Yes. There will not be any school Christmas-day, and I'll be here early in the evening before. Oh! Mary, I must tell you, Mr. Harvey says I am getting along finely; and I have more merit marks than any other scholar in school. But it's hard work. I have to study—no mistake."
               But he thought Mary's pleased glance, and beaming smile, well repaid him for his labor.
               Christmas-eve arrived, and very soon after tea Tommy made his appearance in the kitchen, holding one hand behind him, sidling shyly and awkwardly towards the fire. At last he stole round to the corner where Mary sat with her knitting; and placing himself within the shadow of her chair, exhibited an old stocking, with an immense hole in the toe.
               "Do you think this will be big enough, Mary?" he softly whispered.
               "Yes; I guess it will hold all Santa-Claus will bring you to-night," said Mary, laughing involuntarily, but speaking in the same low tone. "But, mercy, Tommy! what made you get this ragged old thing? Santa-Claus won't even look at it."
               Tommy turned the stocking over and over disconsolately. "I didn't see any better one in my basket. Don't you suppose Santa-Claus will put any thing in this?" and his lip began to quiver.
               "Never mind, Tommy; don't cry. I'll get you one of the new ones I finished last week," and going to the clothes-bars at the other end of the room, she took down a pair of nice gray stockings, and placed one of them in Tommy's hand. "Now hang it on that hook by the side of the mantel-piece."
               "What are you doing there, Tommy?" asked Mrs. Graham, whose attention had been drawn to the child's maneuvers.
               "I'm hanging up my stocking."
               "So I see—but what for?"
               "For Santa-Claus. He's going round to-night to put things in little boys' stockings."
               "Humph!" muttered Mrs. Graham, with a sarcastic smile, "I guess he won't stop here. He never did yet."
               "Why, aunt Betsy! Didn't he use to stop when cousin John was a little boy like me?"
               
               "No, he never did. Folks didn't have time in them days to stuff children's heads with such nonsense. I s'pose this is what you wanted to make the ball for?" she continued, turning towards Mary as she spoke.
               "Oh, hush, hush, aunt Betsy!" whispered Mary. "Please don't say a word about it. He don't know," and taking a candle she hurried Tommy up-stairs to bed. He went very willingly; but his last words ere she left him were, that he was sure he should wake up when he heard Santa-Claus coming down the chimney.
               "I've half a mind to make you take that young one's stocking down," said Mrs. Graham, when Mary returned to the kitchen. "A pretty fuss there'll be in the morning! Who on earth do you suppose is going to fill his stockings for him? I sha'n't, that's certain."
               "I didn't expect you would, aunt Betsy," said Mary; but her eyes filled, nevertheless.
               "But what possessed you to put the notion in his head? Just as if there was nothing to be done with money but to buy Christmas presents for that boy."
               "I didn't put the notion in his head. He heard the little boys at school talk about hanging up their stockings, and so he wanted to hang up his. I couldn't help it."
               A moody silence had reigned for a quarter of an hour, broken only by the crackling and snapping of the wood fire, when a loud clear whistling was heard in the yard, and presently John appeared, well muffled in overcoat and comforter.
               "Hurrah!" he exclaimed, as he burst open the door. "A merry Christmas to all of you! It's a little before the time, but no matter."
               "How are ye, John?" said Mr. Graham. Mrs. Graham merely nodded her head, without extending her hand—it was too much trouble to lay down her knitting; but Mary rose to take his cap and mittens, and would have relieved him of his overcoat also, but he laughingly pushed her one side.
               "No, no, Mary; I guess I can wait on myself, if I am going to the ' 'Cademy,' as Jim Wheeler calls it. He 's'poses John Graham feels mighty grand, now he goes to the 'Cademy!'" and John laughed that genuine, hearty laugh, that speaks so plainly of an honest heart and a clear conscience.
               "Jim Wheeler must be a fine judge of what it takes to make a body feel 'mighty grand,' I think," said Mary. "I don't believe studying ever had that effect yet."
               "Nor I, either. But, Mary, I begin to be frightened about myself. I'm afraid I'm in a dangerous state."
               "Afraid! What are you afraid of?"
               "Why, in our parsing lesson, this morning, this line came to me—'A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.' Now, I certainly haven't much knowledge. If I have any, it's just enough to be dangerous! What shall we do about it?"
               "I am not much scared about you," said Mary, laughing. "The last time you were home I was looking at that very line. What is the next one? Do you remember?"
               "No."
               "Well, I do—it is this: 'Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring.' That applies to your case precisely. Aren't your fears quieted now?"
               "They ought to be. I guess I'll try to drink deeper."
               "What are you talking about, children?" asked Mrs. Graham, impatiently. "I'm sure I can't make out. If you must talk, do, for mercy's sake, say something that has some sense and reason to it."
               "But, mother, we can't be too reasonable Christmas-eve. If you'd seen how the sleighs were flying about in Carrolton, you'd have thought the folks had all lost their senses. Oh! there's Tommy's stocking. Here, Mary," he continued, tossing two brown paper parcels into her lap, "here's something Santa-Claus sent you to put in it. He could not call himself to-night, owing to press of business."
               "We'll excuse him for this once," was the gay response. But Mary did not open the parcels. What they contained she cared very little about knowing, as she sat there with a happy smile on her lip, thinking that, after all, Tommy would not be disappointed, and enjoying in anticipation his eager delight on finding a well-filled stocking.
               "Come, Mary," said John, after a rather long pause, "open these papers, and let's stuff that stocking just as full as it can hold. I'll go down cellar, and find a smooth, handsome apple to put in first. That'll fill up the toe."
               Meanwhile Mary untied the strings, and examined her parcels. In one she found several sorts of nuts and candies. In the other, a top, and a little book with pictures most glowingly colored.
               
               Presently John came with his apple, and the stocking soon looked—like any thing but a stocking. With its queer protuberances and deep indentations, its mate itself would not have recognized it.
               John and Mary stood looking at it with great satisfaction. Mrs. Graham had not opened her lips, but her knitting-needles moved rapidly. At last John started, and put his hand in his pocket—
               "Oh, I've got something else! I almost forgot it," and he drew forth a very pretty—ball.
               "I did not see this, until after I had bought the other things, and then I thought I must have it. When I was a little fellow like Tommy, nothing pleased me so much as a ball."
               Mary's color rose, and she turned a half-frightened glance towards her aunt, as John placed the ball securely on the top of the stocking. But Mrs. Graham did not appear to notice it; and in a few moments the family separated for the night.
               Tommy was awake the next morning, long before chanticleer sounded his first alarum. But Mary contrived to keep him in bed until she saw some faint glimmerings of light in the east, and knew that the fire was kindled. Then she hurriedly dressed both him and herself, and went down stairs. John was already there, and was peering curiously beneath chairs and tables, and moving every thing within reach.
               With a scream of delight, Tommy sprang forward when he saw the increased dimensions of his stocking; and then, blushing and trembling, half laughing and half crying, stood stock still, without making the slightest effort to obtain possession of his treasure.
               "What's the matter, Tommy? Why don't you take down your stocking?" asked John—then in an aside to Mary, he whispered; "don't say a word about that ball. I'am afraid it rolled off, and is lost. Eh! Tommy, what's the matter?" he continued, as the boy reached his hand timidly forth, and after having barely touched the object of his curiosity, drew it back again.
               "I don't know," said Tommy. "I don't know what's in it, maybe it's something that'll bite me!"
               What a merry peal of laughter rang through the old kitchen!
               "Ha, ha! You're a courageous young man, that's a fact," said John; "here, Tommy, I'll take it down for you. Now see if Santa-Claus brought you any thing worth having," and leaving him to his explorations, John and Mary withdrew to the window.
               "Did you say the ball was lost?" whispered the latter.
               "I'm afraid so," was the reply. "I put it right on the top of the stocking, you know, and when I came down this morning it was missing. It must have rolled off."
               "Then it would be somewhere in the room."
               "No, it isn't. I've looked in every corner and crevice. It isn't anywhere here. I'm afraid it rolled into the fire-place."
               "Then it must be in the ash-pail, taken up with the ashes. Have you looked there?"
               "No; but I'll go now."
               The quest was a vain one. No trace or vestige of that ball ever appeared. To John it was a great mystery; but Mary had some strong, though unuttered, suspicions that it did not disappear without the aid of hands.
               Tommy could hardly spend time to eat his breakfast, he was so taken up with his top and picture-book; and his face assumed a most woe-begone expression when, immediately after the meal was over, his aunt drew out the carpet-rag-basket as usual, and told him to get his needle and thimble. The hot tears sprang to Mary's eyes also, but she dared not interfere in the matter, and the little fellow's Christmas would have passed dolefully enough, if John had not insisted, playfully but peremptorily, that it was a holiday, and that no work should be done in the house, save that which was absolutely indispensable.
               "No sewing of carpet-rags to-day, mother—'twont do at all. I'm going to get up the double sleigh (father says he ain't going to use the horses), and have a ride on the creek. The ice is as firm as the solid land. Mary and Tommy must go, and we'll call for Amy Thompson too, if you would like to have her go with us," he added, turning towards his cousin.
               "Oh! I should like it of all things," said Mary; and she looked a world of thanks, if she did not speak them. "What time are you going? this forenoon?"
               "No; not until after dinner, I guess. It will be warmer then."
               Mary had gone into the back-kitchen with a handful of plates, and John followed her.
               "Here's something Santa-Claus sent you, Mary," he said; "but as you didn't hang up your stocking, I had no opportunity to dispose of the article last night," and he placed a small, tastefully bound volume in her hand.
               "Sent me, cousin John!" she exclaimed, while the blood rushed to her cheeks, "sent me?" Then, as she met his roguish, yet half-bashful glance, she added, "You are my Santa-Claus, I know, John. Thank you, thank you! It is a beautiful book."
               Turning to the title-page she read aloud, "'Lights and Shadows of Scottish Life.' Oh, I've heard Miss Stowe speak of this book. I'm so glad! How did you happen to find it, cousin John?"
               "Why, I went into a bookstore at Carrolton to get something for you, and I saw this lying on the counter. I knew you always liked the 'Tales of a Grandfather,' and I thought maybe this was something of the same sort."
               "Not the same sort exactly, I imagine," said Mary, who was busily turning over the leaves; "but it's about Scotland. Oh, I know I shall like it very much; it looks good. How kind you always are to me, cousin John!"
               John smiled a queer little smile; but without speaking again he drew on his mittens, and went to the barn.
               Taking advantage of the promise John had coaxed from his mother, that this should be in every sense of the word a holiday, Mary, after the morning's work was done, seated herself in the chimney-corner to examine her new book. Mrs. Graham had gone on an errand to one of the neighbor's; the large, cheerful kitchen, with its shining windows, was in perfect order; the fire burned with a clear, steady blaze; Tommy was sitting on the floor playing with his top, while his picture-book, nuts, and candy, lay temptingly beside him: in short, it was as quiet and pleasant a scene as one need wish to see on a Christmas morning, and Mary felt its influence deeply. An unwonted sense of ease, comfort, and happiness, pervaded the farthest corner of her heart, and thrilled through every fibre of her frame. Ah! how large a part of the happiness of life lies in its veriest trifles!
               Mary was a very rapid reader—necessity had made her such, for she had never had any time to spare; and as she turned page after page with such an eager hand, you would have perhaps thought that she was only skimming the leaves. But in truth she did not lose a line nor an idea. She did not linger long over the "Lily of Liddesdale." Full of strange wild beauty though she felt the sketch to be, it was yet too highly wrought and romantic to please her quiet, simple tastes. But how she wept over the homely pathos of Moss-side; how she shuddered with sweet Hannah Lee in the fierce snow-storm; how the calm and holy sublimity of the Elder's Death-bed sank into her very heart; how her tears fell upon the low monument of the Twins, in the little Kirk-yard of Auchindown! It was the first fiction that Mary had ever read; and as she bent absorbed over the thrilling pages, she thought she could never be sufficiently grateful to her cousin for the pleasure his gift had even so soon afforded her.
               In the afternoon, Amy was only too happy to join them in a long, delightful drive, and Mrs. Thompson insisted upon their all returning there to tea. So the nicest of all nice little suppers was prepared for them, of which they partook after the ride with appetites sharpened by exercise and the keen air. Then they drove home in season to allow Tommy to go to sleep at his usual hour, and the evening was devoted to "Lights and Shadows" and to merry chat.
               If Mary had ever read the "Faery Queen," she would surely have said, when she sought her pillow that night, that 
                     "A dram of sweet is worth a pound of sour."
                  
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           No one marvels at her beauty:
                           Blended with a perfect whole,
                           Beauty seems the just expression
                           Of her soul.
                        
                     
                     —EDITH MAY.
                  
               
               JOHN never regretted his winter at Carrolton. The mental training of those few months was of immense service to him. Not so much on account of the knowledge actually acquired—although that was far from being small or despicable—as because he had, in some slight degree at least, learned how to study. He had become more familiar with the workings of his own mind; a world of new thoughts, ideas, and feelings lay open before him; his hitherto dormant powers were aroused to life and action; and desires for improvement, for advancement in all that can give dignity and elevation to the human character, or strength and scope to the human intellect, awoke from the long lethargy that had been forced upon them by the circumstances and associations in the midst of which he had grown to boyhood. He had formed, too, a new class of friends and associates. His teachers had been men of refinement and culture; and, insensibly, he had acquired from them much besides mere book-knowledge. His personal appearance also was greatly improved; his very face was altered. The dull, sluggish, soulless look that it had worn when Mary first knew him, had given place to one of more than ordinary intelligence; in short, he was not the same mentally, morally, or physically that he had been two years before.
               Early in the spring the clinking hammers of the carpenters at work upon Mr. Vaun's house, or the "Sherwood Place," as she still persisted in calling it, annoyed Mrs. Graham's ears from morning till night; and in May it was in readiness to receive its new occupants. Mr. Vaun had been in Farmingdale himself for several weeks, overseeing the repairs, and attending to the spring work upon the farm; but his family—consisting of his wife, and three young children—did not arrive until the house was in order, or rather until it was ready to be put in order.
               In the city, where one's next-door neighbor may make the tour of Europe, and return, without having been so much as missed, the arrival of strangers is an event of but little consequence; and their comings and goings, their style of living and their appearance, unless unusually outre, will attract but little attention. But in Farmingdale the case was very different. The advent of a new-comer was there really an event. Everybody in the neighborhood knew that the old Sherwood place was sold; everybody wondered whether the new family would make good the loss of the old—everybody felt a kind of personal interest in the matter.
               John had become somewhat acquainted with Mr. Vaun; indeed, quite an impromptu friendship had sprung up between them, during the few weeks that intervened between the arrival val of the latter and that of his family. One evening near the last of May, as Mary was out in the yard, giving a brood of young chickens their last meal for the night, her cousin approached her, with an unusually quick step.
               "Mary," said he, taking off his broad-brimmed straw hat, and pushing back the damp hair from his forehead as he spoke, "Mary, I saw Mr. Vaun a little while ago, and he wanted me to bring you over to see his wife. Can't you go to-night?"
               "I don't know but I can. The work is almost done, but I've got to set the sponge for to-morrow's baking. Will it be too late then?"
               "No, I guess not. There is no dew this evening, and we can go across lots, and that shortens the distance considerably. How soon will you be ready?"
               "Oh, in half an hour, I should think, provided I don't find more to do than I know of now. Have you seen Mrs. Vaun yet?"
               "No; but you can't think how pretty the place looks. Every thing about the premises is as neat as wax. Mary, I do wish we could coax mother to call there; but she has taken such a strong prejudice against them all, that I don't believe we can."
               "It will do no harm to try. Why don't you ask her to go with us to-night?"
               "I'll go right in and ask her now. Perhaps she will," and John turned towards the house, while Mary went in pursuit of a stray chicken.
               He found his mother in the pantry, skimming milk, but he saw she was nearly through—there was only one more pan to skim.
               "Mother," said he, "are you very busy to-night?"
               Mrs. Graham replied, without turning her head,
               "What do you ask that for? You know I always am."
               "Yes, mother; but are you so busy that you can't take a walk with me?"
               "Take a walk! I walk enough without going a purpose. I'm on my feet from morning till night. I'm tired to death a'ready."
               "Why don't you have a girl, then? There's no need of your working so hard, mother. You have more to do than you ought, and Mary too. Why don't you have a girl?"
               
               "There, I expected it would end on Mary! I tell you she don't work a bit too hard. No danger of her hurting herself. Every minute she can get she's a reading that book you was fool enough to give her last winter. I've a great mind to throw it in the fire."
               John began to see that he was on dangerous ground.
               "Well, well, mother, we won't talk about that now. What do you suppose I came in for?"
               "I don't know. Some mischief afoot, I'll warrant."
               "Not much. I only wanted to ask you if you wouldn't like to go and call on our new neighbors. They've got settled now, and it's only a little ways, if we go across lots."
               "No, I sha'n't stir an inch. They're altogether too stylish for me, and I ain't a going to trouble 'em much. There's no need of my going there, either, for I can hear that thing that Mrs. Vaun drums on—her pianer, I believe they call it—any time o' day, without stirring away from my work. When I was young, farmers' wives played on the spinning-wheel and the loom, and thought they made music enough; but now they must have their pianers, and what not. I don't believe Mrs. Vaun knows what a loom is!"
               "I guess she does, mother. They've got one, at any rate, for I saw it. But won't you go with us? Do, now," he continued, coaxingly. "The work is done for to-night; Mary said so."
               "There's sponge to be set yet."
               "Well, Mary is setting it. I hear her stirring the batter now. Won't you go, mother? It will be nothing more than common politeness."
               "You've grown wonderfully polite and genteel since you went to Carrolton. No, I ain't a going. Go by yourself, if you want to. You ain't afraid, be you?"
               "No, ma'am," replied John, laughing; "but I am not going alone. I shall take Mary with me. Mary!" he called, raising his voice, "it's time we were off. Get your bonnet."
               Mrs. Graham would have been very glad to keep Mary at home. But the work was really done. Tommy had been asleep for some time, and she could invent no reasonable excuse. Besides, to tell the plain truth, she had some little curiosity herself, and was not sorry to have an opportunity to gratify it, by listening to a recital of those minor details of family arrangements, that she could only learn through Mary.
               A few minutes' walk across the meadows brought them to Mr. Vaun's gate. The house was delightfully situated upon rising ground, but it had hitherto been unpainted, and for years the fence that had originally surrounded the yards had been going to decay, until at the time when Mr. Vaun made his purchase, there was hardly a vestige of it remaining. Two or three lofty and wide-spreading elms overshadowed the building; indeed, in one instance, the drooping branches rested upon the low roof of the cottage; and now, with the addition of new window-blinds, a veranda, and a fence simply yet tastefully constructed, and neatly painted, it was as cozy a little bird's nest as one need ask for.
               Mr. Vaun was standing in the hall as they approached the house, and hearing their footsteps, he advanced to meet them. He was apparently about thirty-five, a fine, intelligent-looking man, with an unmistakable air of cultivation and refinement.
               "Good-evening, John, good-evening," he said, with a cordial grasp of the hand. "You have brought your cousin, I perceive, according to promise. Good-evening, Miss Mary. My wife will be most happy to see you. Walk in, walk in," and he led the way into the house.
               The room into which he ushered them was the one that, in the days of old Mrs. Sherwood, had always been known as the "little sitting-room;" but Mary thought she would hardly have recognized it, had it not been from its position with regard to the hall. It was a small parallelogram, and the wall at the lower end was lined with books, while a round table in the centre of the apartment was strewn with magazines, papers, reviews, and a few choice engravings. A picture or two hung upon the walls; an open piano, a lounge, and a few chairs, composed the remainder of the furniture. The carpet was very unpretending, and the curtains were of simple white muslin.
               Mary had time to make these observations while Mr. Vaun had gone in search of his wife. Presently he returned, bringing with him a bright-eyed, dark-haired little girl, of some six or eight summers.
               "My wife is engaged just at this moment, but she will be at liberty before long. Meanwhile, Miss Mary, this young lady will do her best to entertain you;" and little Alice Vaun came forward and placed her hand quietly in that of Mary's.
               Mr. Vaun and John were soon engaged in earnest conversation, but the former did not fail to perceive that the girls found but little to say to each other. Mary was too little accustomed to the society of strangers to feel perfectly at her ease, and Alice was too young to take the lead. Occasionally, however, he himself addressed a question or a remark to Mary; and although the color would mount to her brow, and her eyelids droop, her replies were always apt, and clothed in fitting garb. Very soon Mr. Vaun noticed that her eyes were fixed upon the piano.
               "Are you fond of music, Miss Mary?" he asked.
               "Yes, sir, I am very fond of it."
               "Then Alice must play for you. Come, my daughter, mother will be in presently, but meanwhile you must give us a little music. Alice is only a beginner, of course," he continued, turning to John and Mary as the child approached the instrument, "but, as she seemed to have a decided taste for music, we thought that the sooner she commenced practising the better,—provided it was not allowed to interfere with more important branches of education. So her mother has been giving her lessons for the last year."
               Alice was rather small and delicate, although not sickly in appearance; and as her little fingers glided, seemingly without effort, over the keys, Mary looked at her with a species of wonder, not unmixed with reverence. The child really had an extraordinary talent for the art, and played, considering her years, remarkably well. But to Mary it seemed like magic, like enchantment, and she sat as in a kind of maze, until Mrs. Vaun entered the room.
               Rather above the average height of women, exquisitely graceful in every movement of her slight, yet not too etherial figure,—with a smooth, white brow, upon which rich bands of chestnut hair were simply parted—a clear hazel eye, within whose liquid depths you could read naught but a tale of truth and goodness—a face beaming with genuine heart sunshine, and a low, sweet voice,—such was Mrs. Vaun. And as she came lightly forward, with a babe of less than a year upon her arm, and seated herself on the sofa by Mary's side, with a few words of cordial greeting, the latter thought her the most lovable being she had ever beheld.
               "I have been trying to persuade this young gentleman to go to sleep for the last half hour," said Mrs. Vaun, playfully, "but he was perfectly incorrigible, although it is long past his bedtime. So I was obliged either to bring him with me, or to deprive myself of the pleasure of seeing you to-night."
               "Where is the young lady whom you installed 'maid of all work' in your department, a few days since? Can't she take him?" asked Mr. Vaun.
               "Oh! she's busy; and if she wasn't, it would make no difference. Ralph is not partial to strangers."
               "Let me take him," said Mary, timidly; "I think he will come to me."
               Mrs. Vaun shook her head.
               "It is very doubtful. He is quite inclined to be chary of his favors. But you can try."
               The little fellow had been examining Mary with a very curious eye, ever since his mother had been sitting by her side; and when she extended her hands, saying,
               "Come, Ralph, come to me," he laughed and crowed, and finally nestled his little head upon her shoulder, as confidingly as if it had never known any other resting-place.
               "Really, Miss Mary," said Mr. Vaun, laughing gayly, "you have achieved a wonderful conquest, and I can hardly account for it without supposing poor Ralph to be the victim of sorcery. Is your cousin familiar with spells and incantations?" he continued, turning to John. "Does she carry any thing about her in the form of charms or amulets? We ought to be informed on these points, so that we may be on our guard, if necessary."
               "Ah, Mr. Vaun! how very ungallant!" exclaimed his wife, shaking her finger at him as she spoke. "You know young ladies are never guilty of any thing of the kind. Charms and amulets, forsooth! They don't need them."
               "Perhaps not; but I am by no means satisfied that they do not use them, and I maintain that there is no want of gallantry in the assertion. That they are not always dangerous, I am willing to admit. But you have not answered my question, John. Has Miss Mary any dealings with sprites or fairies? Is there any thing weird about her?"
               
               "Yes," replied John, very gravely; "I'm inclined to think there is. I imagine she has thrown her spells around master Ralph, at least; for, see! his eyes are slowly closing;" and, sure enough, the child was far on the road to the land of dreams. Mrs. Vaun took him from Mary's arms, and carried him away, thanking her for her efficacious nursing.
               The remainder of the evening passed pleasantly, by the aid of music, books, and conversation.
               Mrs. Graham had gone to bed when Mary and John got home, but before breakfast the next morning she began catechising the former with regard to their call.
               "Well, I s'pose you saw Mrs. Vaun?"
               "Yes, ma'am; we saw all the family, except little Ellen—the youngest girl—she was asleep."
               "What kind of a looking woman is she?"
               "Oh, aunt Betsy, she is so pretty! No, that isn't the right word either; she is a great deal more than pretty."
               "Fudge! I hav'n't much of a fancy for doll-faces. I'll warrant she don't know much."
               "She hasn't a bit of a doll-face, aunt Betsy," said Mary, indignantly. "She looks as if she knew as much as most people."
               "What did she have on? All rigged out in silks and satins, most likely."
               "No, ma'am. She wore a dark gingham dress, and a plain linen collar, fastened with a knot of blue riband. And she had—yes, I believe she had on a gingham apron."
               "What was she a-doing when you got there?"
               "Trying to get her baby to sleep."
               "Humph! how much help does she keep?"
               "Only one girl—so I thought from something Mr. Vaun said. I didn't ask her."
               "I heard the pianer a-going. When the wind's this way, the sound on't comes right into my bedroom-window, jist as plain."
               "One of the little girls plays, too. She isn't bigger than Tommy, and she plays very sweetly. So it isn't always Mrs. Vaun's playing that you hear."
               Mrs. Graham fairly groaned over the degeneracy of the age.
               "My patience! what on earth will the child ever be good for? A pretty way to bring up girls! To think they must be primmed up at the pianer, with their best bib and tucker on all the whole during time! I don't know what the world's a-coming to, I'm sure! Where did you sit down—in the kitchen?"
               "No, ma'am. In what used to be called the little sitting-room."
               "What do they call it?"
               "I didn't hear them call it any thing; but their books are in there, and a table with newspapers and magazines on it; and there's where the piano stands, too. You don't know how pretty and pleasant it looks up there, aunt Betsy. Mrs. Vaun said she hoped you would come and see her."
               "Maybe I shall; and then, again, maybe I shan't. It'll depend upon how they behave themselves. I shan't run after them, anyhow, nor bow and scrape to them neither. I s'pose Mr. Vaun don't never go into the field to work himself. Great farming!"
               "Yes, I guess he does, aunt Betsy; for I heard him tell John he had been with the men planting corn all day, and that they were just through."
               "He's a first-rate farmer, mother, now I tell you," said John, who had come in with two swimming pails of milk in time to hear the last sentence; "and if he don't make more off that land than was ever made before, I miss my guess. If he don't do quite as much work with his hands, as some of the farmers about—and I can't say but he does—he does more with his head than all the others put together. And every thing about the place looks so nice and snug—"
               "Oh, well, 'a new broom always sweeps clean!' But I'll tell you what, John Graham, 'fine feathers don't always make fine birds,' and maybe you'll find it out sometime;" and with a very prophetical toss of the head, Mrs. Graham set herself about straining the milk.
               Mrs. Vaun—sensible woman that she was—was really desirous to be upon friendly terms with her neighbors; and before she had been many months in Farmingdale, she was universally esteemed, and, in more than one instance, beloved. Mary had become deeply attached to her. She was, indeed, a great favorite with all the young people in the region; but between Mary and herself an especial intimacy had grown up.
               But Mrs. Graham bravely withstood all her overtures, as well as the entreaties of John and Mary. Faithful to her prejudices, she disputed, inch by inch, the claims of Mr. and Mrs. Vaun to popular favor.
               "Time and the tide wait for no man," and during that summer the Gray-beard certainly waited for neither man nor woman in Farmingdale. Tommy went to school all summer, and, to his sister's great delight, gave token of abilities that would, without doubt, if properly cultivated, lead to success and distinction in life. Mary was obliged to work harder than ever, for her aunt, finding that it would be possible to do without a hired girl, was resolved not to employ one. She grew thin and pale; but no one in the house noticed it except John, and he could do nothing to help her. Mr. Vaun had kindly given her permission to consider herself perfectly at home in his library, and to take from it whatever books she wished. But, save that a look or word of kindness never failed to brighten her eye and bring more color to her cheek and lip, it availed little. She had literally no time to read, until she retired to her own room at night; and then the body was stronger than the will, and the weary head would droop upon the pillow, and the tired limbs seek repose in spite of herself.
               It would, perhaps, be painting the picture rather too darkly if we were to say that Mary was at this time positively unhappy. She possessed none of that sickly, morbid sentimentalism that is forever looking upon the worst side of life and its realities, and that is more than half inclined to justify a neglect of known duties, if they do not happen to coincide with one's own peculiar tastes and feelings. She did not like the details of "house-work;" she could have found employment far more in accordance with her wishes and her mental needs, than washing dishes or skimming milk, churning, ironing, or any other portion of the never-ending routine of housewifery; but she did not regard that fact as an excuse for shrinking from the performance of her daily tasks. And she tried to look, as far as she might, cheerfully upon the present, and hopefully into the future.
               Yet she was beginning to think, with an interest not un-mingled with solicitude, of Tommy's future career, and of her own as connected with it. She knew very well that as soon as he was old enough to be of service on the farm, his school-days would be over. It had been so with John. A paltry seven months was all the time that had been allowed him for his studies since he was twelve years old. She saw that even now, anxious as he was to be daily and hourly adding to his mental resources, it was almost impossible for him to make any progress. From the earliest dawn of day until long after nightfall it was work, work—dig, dig, unceasingly.
               And she knew, also, that even if he had had occasional leisure, there were still other obstacles to be encountered and overcome. She knew that for every penny that passed through his hands, he was required to give an exact account. She knew that there was not an article of trade or barter on the farm that he could call his own, and the proceeds of which he was at liberty to appropriate to his own use; and she knew, furthermore, that Mr. Graham's ideas of the value of money were altogether too exalted, to admit the hope that he would ever foolishly squander any in the purchase of books. She sometimes sighed heavily as she thought of these things, and then glanced at the little face that ever turned so confidingly to meet her smile and kiss; but still she never desponded.
               One afternoon in the fall, after having been closely confined to her domestic duties for several weeks, she obtained leave of her aunt to run across the meadow to Mr. Vaun's. She had borrowed a book from his library long before, and wished to return it, although still unread. She was ashamed to keep it any longer.
               When she approached the house, she found the family all in the yard. Mr. Vaun was busily engaged transplanting various kinds of shrubbery, while his wife was vainly endeavoring to make a vine-rose twine around one of the columns that supported the veranda. Little Ralph was rolling about upon the grass, resisting, with merry peals of laughter, the attempts of his sister Ellen—a blue-eyed fairy of about four summers—to fasten a string of mock-corals, alias, sweetbrier-berries, about his neck; and Alice, in one of her quiet moods, held the ball of twine and scissors for her mother.
               Begging them to go on with their several employments, Mary replaced the book upon the library shelf, and then seated herself on the door-step, and watched the happy group, with a feeling that was not envy, only because her heart was too pure and gentle to harbor such a guest. But how she longed for such a home of her own!
               
               "I can't make this rose cling to the pillar, even with any amount of twine to help it. What shall I do with it, Edward?" said Mrs. Vaun. "It is as obstinate as possible."
               "You can't do any thing with it in that way," was the reply. "It needs lattice-work to support it, and I'll find time to fix it for you in the course of the week. But where shall I set this fringe-tree?"
               "Just where you are standing now. It's the best place in the whole yard for it. Don't you think so?"
               "Come and hold it for me, then; it's the last tree left. If they all live, the yard will look very prettily next year. What are you going to do with those honey-suckles? They need more training, badly."
               "Oh, I can manage them, and the ivy too. There, now we'll go in," she continued, drawing off her gardening gloves, and approaching the piazza where Mary was sitting. Looking at her earnestly for a moment, she stooped and kissed her forehead.
               "You are looking pale, Mary dear. Are you not well?"
               "I'm not sick," said Mary, fondly returning her kiss. "I'm only tired."
               "Only tired! Well, that's quite enough, if it makes you look as you do now. But come in, and we will have tea in a few minutes, and perhaps it will brighten you up a little."
               "No, no, Mrs. Vaun, I can't stay," was the answer. "I only ran over to see you for a minute or two. I can't stay."
               But her bonnet was forcibly taken off, and she herself seated in a comfortable rocking-chair.
               "Now, you must just sit there while I go and get tea. Will you mind?"
               Mary laughingly promised, and Mrs. Vaun left her to the guardianship of the children.
               She could not have escaped, if she would; for Alice captured one hand and Ellen the other, while Ralph clung to her knee.
               "How old are you, Alice?" asked Mary, passing her hand lightly over the child's dark hair; "I don't know exactly."
               "I'm eight years old—nearly nine," said Alice. "People don't think me so old, because, you know, I'm so little. I don't believe I shall ever be as tall as mother. Isn't it too bad?"
               "That's a hard question to answer," replied Mary, with a smile. "Do you like tall ladies?"
               "Not always. I like tall ladies who look like mother!"
               "Do you practise much now, Alice?" asked Mary, glancing at the piano.
               "One hour every day."
               "Don't you get tired sometimes?"
               "Oh! I don't sit at the piano an hour at once. I practise four times a day, fifteen minutes at a time, and then have a good romp with Ralph and Ellen afterwards. You don't know how Ralph can run! I can hardly catch him, he goes so fast."
               "What else do you do, Alice?"
               "Oh, I have a lesson in geography, and spelling, and I read to father every day; but I don't like to do that."
               "Why not?"
               "Because I read so fast, and he always makes me stop and begin again, and read the sentence over slowly and distinctly. And then sometimes I don't pronounce the words right, and have to spell them, and that makes me get out of patience. I do hate to stop and spell the words when I am reading!"
               "But you will never learn to read well, Alice, unless you do. Your mother is a beautiful reader. Don't you do any thing else?"
               "Yes, I sew a little, not a great deal; and sometimes I wipe the cups and saucers, and tea-spoons; and when mother sweeps the parlor and library, I dust the chairs for her. I like such work. It is as good as play. And oh! we've got the nicest play-house out in the back-yard! It's just as pretty as it can be! only the roof leaks, and I'm afraid to leave my play-things there nights, for fear they'll get wet. But father is going to fix it for us one of these days. Come, Mary, come and see it, won't you?"
               But, before they had reached the door, Mrs. Vaun called them to tea; and as soon as they rose from the table, Mary said that she must return home—her aunt would be expecting her.
               While she was tying on her bonnet, talking, meanwhile, with Mrs. Vaun, little Alice stood looking out of the window.
               "Oh! there's your cousin John, Mary, just coming across the meadow. No—he isn't coming to the house; he's going up on the hill where father is. I'll run out and tell him you are here;" and away she flew.
               Very soon John was seen approaching the house, leading Alice by the hand.
               "Alice said you were just going home, Mary," he said, as he entered; "and I thought I would come round this way, and go with you. How you are improving this place, Mrs. Vaun!" he continued, letting his eye wander slowly about the yard. "If it were not for the elm-trees, one would hardly recognize it."
               "We have made some improvements," replied Mrs. Vaun, "but we hope to make many more. They will come slowly, however, for Mr. Vaun has not much leisure, and much of the work needed requires stronger hands than mine. But do come and see some evergreens that he has been setting out on the north side of the house. We think they are beautiful, and they seem perfectly vigorous and healthy."
               "What beauties they are!" exclaimed Mary, as they turned the corner of the house, and came in sight of a cluster of young trees—pine, hemlock, spruce, and cedar; "and they don't look at all as if they had been transplanted."
               "Where did Mr. Vaun find them?" asked John.
               "In our own woods; and besides being ornaments to the place, they will furnish a dense shade in the summer, and in the winter will most effectually protect the house from the north wind. In the course of time, I mean," she added, with a smile. "They will hardly do all that this year."
               "What is this prickly shrub?" said John, laying his hand upon one near him.
               "That is the rose acacia—and a beautiful thing it is. It blossoms quite early. These are snow-berries, Mary. Are they not pretty? And this young mountain-ash I admire very much."
               "They came off the mountain, did they not?" inquired Mary.
               "Yes; Mr. Vaun got them last spring. Their bright scarlet berries contrast beautifully with the dark green of their leaves. It is hardly necessary to go abroad in search of foreign shade-trees, John, when we can find such a charming variety in our own woods, and climbing the sides of our own mountains."
               "John, just look at the sun!" exclaimed Mary. "It is almost out of sight. Mrs. Vaun, don't show us any more pretty things to-night, for if you do we shall never get home;" and, linking her arm within that of her cousin, she half drew him towards the gate.
               "Good-by!" said Mrs. Vaun. "Come and see the rest another time. "Come as often as you can. I wish she could come every day of her life—dear child that she is!" she added, mentally, as she turned to re-enter the house. "It would do her good. She looks better, even now, than she did an hour ago."
               For a little while they walked on in silence. John seemed to be in a deep study, and Mary did not like to interrupt him, although she wondered what he could be thinking of. At last he spoke.
               "How very differently people do think and feel with regard to the same thing! Now, father would think it was the sheerest nonsense for him to be spending his time setting out shade-trees, or trying to improve the appearance of the yard."
               "But you don't think so, John?" asked Mary, anxiously.
               "Think it would be nonsense? No, indeed, I don't. I have been wishing this long time that we could make things look a little better about the premises. Walk slower, Mary, I want to talk to you. If it wasn't for the two cherry-trees, there wouldn't be any thing pretty about the yard, for there isn't much grass, and those half-dead rose-bushes are worse than nothing."
               "Don't you suppose your father would let you set out some trees? They wouldn't cost any thing, for you can do as Mr. Vaun did—get them out of the woods."
               "I know it, and it's just what I want to do. There's a beautiful young maple just in the edge of the south woods, and some other kinds, too, that I should like. The timber would be all the better for being thinned out."
               "Mrs. Vaun told me last summer that she would give me a white climbing rose, and a red one, also, this fall; but I haven't said any thing about it. I was afraid aunt Betsy wouldn't like it."
               "Well, Mary, I'll tell you what we'll do. You get your roses, and I'll set them out for you; and the very next rainy day I will go to the woods and get those trees. If they are only transplanted without making father any trouble, I don't believe he'll care."
               "Hadn't you better speak to him about it first?"
               "If I do, he'll say 'No,' the very first thing. But I don't think he'll mind it at all, if it is only done before he know it."
               The very first time that Mary, by extra exertion, gained leisure to run over to Mrs. Vaun's, she went for her rose-bushes. John, as he had promised, set them out for her that same evening; and as they were very small, and took up but little room, it was several days before any one noticed them. But one night, as she was watering them, her aunt saw her, and immediately came out to ascertain what was going on.
               "Where did these things come from, and who put 'em here?" she asked, hitting one of them, not very gently, with her foot, as she spoke.
               "Mrs. Vaun gave them to me, and John set them out."
               "Well, I'd thank her to mind her own business, and keep her trash to home. I don't want it here."
               "She gave it to me because she thought I would like to have some flowers, aunt Betsy. Hers were so beautiful when they were in blossom last summer!"
               "There ain't no beauty about these things that I can see. They don't look half so well as a good healthy bean-vine does."
               "That's because they are so small, and have just been transplanted. Next year they will look finely."
               "Well, I won't have 'em here anyway. Next thing you'll want to be tying 'em up on to the portico, to breed worms and flies, and catch all the dust and nastiness. I won't have 'em here at all."
               Mary burst into tears. Don't blame her, gentle reader; don't call her foolish or babyish. It was not so much for the loss of the roses, as because her aunt's words seemed to her a prophecy for the future, an omen sent to warn her that she must not hope to have her tastes gratified, or her wishes consulted, even in trifles.
               A contemptuous "pshaw" caused her to wipe her eyes quickly, and she turned away with a deep flush upon her cheek, a flush that sprang from wounded pride and wounded feeling, in perhaps equal proportions.
               Presently Mrs. Graham called after her,
               "Here, Mary, if you've a mind to take these things up, and set 'em out down to the barn, or some place where they'll be out o' my sight, and where they won't be making a litter all the time, you may. I don't care what becomes of 'em, if they ain't in my way."
               "Set 'em out down by the barn!" Mary smiled in spite of herself, when she thought how strangely out of place their delicate blossoms and bright green leaves would be, amid the rude sights and sounds of the barnyard. Her first impulse was to take them up and throw them in the fire, but that she did not like to do; and finally remembering that there was a small blasted tree standing at the foot of the green knoll back of the garden, she carried them there, and planted them by its side. They lived and flourished, and in a few years the withered tree was covered with a mass of fresh green foliage; and during the first months of summer flaunted gayly in its robes of crimson and white.
               John was not disheartened by the ill success that attended Mary's first effort at home-adorning.
               "I'm not going to give it up so, Mary," he said. "We'll have some trees yet, and roses too, maybe. There are plenty more in the world, and I do believe mother will come round yet. It looks like having rain to-morrow, and if we do we can't plough, and I'll try my luck. I do want to see that maple standing just in the corner, where that miserable dwarf of a lilac-bush is."
               It did rain on the morrow; but getting to the woods proved rather more of an undertaking than John had imagined it would be.
               "The oxen want shoeing, every single one of 'em, and the old mare too, John," said Mr. Graham, at the breakfast-table; "and I don't know when there'll be a better time to have it done. You take one of the boys with you, and go to the blacksmith's shop, right away after breakfast; and tell Mr. Peabody that if he don't do the business up in better style than he did the last time, I shall try the other shop. Leave the cattle there, and go on to the sawmill, and see about that lumber. I want it sawed right off; and you must look at the logs again, and see that the mark is all right. Then when you come through the village, stop at 'Squire Stevens' office, and tell him I want to know when that suit is coming on; and get the papers pers I left there. He'll know what I mean. Do you understand?"
               "Yes, sir, perfectly."
               "Then on your way home you can stop for the oxen. And, John, you'd better take along that clevis, and have it fixed too."
               "Very well, sir."
               "Look here, John," said his mother, as he left the table; "I want you to go in to Simmons' store and get me a quarter of a yard more of this blue calico, and a spool of coarse thread, and a ball of tape."
               "Yes, ma'am. Any thing else?" he asked, with a comical look at Mary.
               "Why, yes. I don't care if you go to Johnson's, and get some tea and sugar. Their groceries at Simmons' ain't worth a-buying. Come, Mary, pick up the dishes; and, Tommy, you fill up that wood-box in the back kitchen."
               It was quite late in the afternoon before John finished his business and got home with his cattle. But taking a spade and crowbar on his shoulder, he started immediately for the woods in search of his trees.
               He had taken up the maple, and was selecting a young tree from a thrifty clump of hemlocks, when his father came along.
               "Hillo, John!" he shouted, as he caught sight of him. "Have you seen a stray cow about here anywhere? The red heifer is missing. Why, what on earth are you about?" he continued, as his eye rested on the fallen tree.
               "I thought I would set out some trees in the yard, father. It will make the place look so much better; and the house will be so much cooler in summer with shade-trees around it. That's a nice tree, isn't it? I thought of taking this one next."
               Mr. Graham's face wore an unusually severe expression.
               "Indeed! You did, eh? Well, first, master John, I'll trouble you to set this maple back, right where you found it; and when I want any more trees taken up, I'll let you know. I've lived without 'shade-trees' all my life, and have got along pretty comfortably, and I ain't a-going to begin with any such tomfoolery now. And just remember, for the future, that you've no business to be taking up trees without my leave."
               John's sunburnt cheek flushed painfully, but he answered respectfully, nevertheless,
               "Are you going to have these trees sawed into lumber?"
               "No."
               "Well, father, there's plenty of wood besides. You won't need to cut these in a great many years—not in your whole life, perhaps. It won't make any difference with you, whether two or three of them stand in the yard or here; and you shall have no trouble with them. I do wish you would let me transplant this maple, and two or three of the others."
               "I tell you I don't want the yard lumbered up with trees, and such things. I don't want to live in the woods, when I'm at home. Do you just put that tree back in the very spot you took it from."
               It was very hard for John to give the matter up; and after pondering a moment, he spoke again.
               "I know you think it's all nonsense, father, but others do not; and if you would only let me please myself this once. I would as soon see a handsome tree as a field of corn; and I sometimes think it would do me almost as much good."
               "Fiddlesticks! I believe the boy is crazy! I would as soon see a tree as a field of corn, provided the tree would sell for just as much as the corn—not otherwise. Come, hurry yourself, or you won't get that maple back in its place before milking-time;" and Mr. Graham went on in pursuit of his cow.
               Slowly, and with any thing but the "willing hand," that makes "light work," John replaced the tree, and pressed the earth firmly about the roots. Then picking up his spade and crowbar, he wended his way homeward.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           A youth rode forth from his childhood's home,
                           Through the crowded paths of the world to roam,
                           And the green leaves whisper'd as he pass'd,
                           "Wherefore, thou dreamer! away so fast?"
                        
                     
                     —HEMANS.
                  
               
               MARY knew as soon as John came into the house, that something had gone wrong with him. He looked at once sad, dispirited, and angry; and throwing himself on a chair by the fire, he leaned his head against the mantel-piece, and sighed audibly. Mary was gliding about, with her usual light step, arranging the table for tea, and as she passed near him, on her way to the pantry, she laid her hand gently on his shoulder.
               "Why, John, you must not sit here in this wet coat. I could wring the water from it this minute. Take it off—do—and I'll bring you a dry one. Have you been out in all this rain?"
               "No, not in all of it; enough to get wet, though. Never mind, Mary. I don't want the trouble of changing it, and it will soon dry by this hot fire."
               Mary demurred strongly, but it did no good. John would not change his coat, and sat silent and motionless in the chimney-corner, with a shadow on his face that the glowing firelight could not brighten. Mary saw that he was not inclined to talk, and wisely held her peace, trusting that the cloud would speedily pass over. She did not know that he had been in the woods; if she had been aware of it, her quick wits would have helped her to a solution of the mystery.
               After tea Mr. Graham went to the door and examined the appearance of the clouds.
               "I guess the rain is over for this time, and it isn't going to be a very dark evening. John, you go out and harness up old Charley."
               John obeyed.
               "Where are you a-going?" asked his wife.
               "Out towards the factory. I've got a little business with a man who lives near there, and I may as well attend to it to-night."
               "Well, if it ain't going to rain, I guess I'll ride along. Old Mrs. Humphreys has got the rheumatiz; and she sent word, a good while ago, that she wanted me to come and see her. She thinks the doctor-stuff she's taking does her a sight more harm than good. You won't be gone long?"
               "No—just long enough to do my business. An hour or so maybe."
               "Mary, you run up and get my bonnet and shawl, right away."
               "Your best one, aunt Betsy?"
               "No, child, no. I sha'n't wear that this wet night. It must be dreadful muddy, even if it don't rain."
               The horse was very soon at the door, and they drove off. John resumed his old seat by the fire. Tommy stretched himself on the floor, and lay looking at the pictures in a last year's almanac; and by the time Mary had finished her night "chores," he was fast asleep.
               "Come, John," said she, drawing a small table up before the fire, and placing the candle upon it, "read something to me, won't you? Here is a magazine Mrs. Vaun sent me, and I haven't even had time to look at it. I must sew this evening, for Tommy needs new shirts badly."
               "I don't want to read, Mary, or to do any thing else. I am clear discouraged."
               "What is the matter, John?" The words were simple enough, but there was a world of kindly sympathy in the voice that uttered them.
               "The matter is, that there is no use in my trying to do any thing, or to be anybody. I can't make out, if I try ever so hard."
               Mary sat in silent thought for a few moments before she replied:
               "What makes you feel so to-night, John? You generally see the bright side of every thing."
               "There isn't any bright side to see—not that I know of. Oh! I wish, Mary!—I don't know what I wish—but I can't live so all my life."
               "Live how, John?"
               "Why, as we do here. You know what I mean well enough. Did you know I went after those trees this afternoon?"
               "No—did you?"
               "Yes; and I had just taken the maple up, without breaking any of the roots, and was choosing a hemlock, when father came along."
               Here John came to a sudden pause. There was a rising in his throat, and he could not speak.
               At last Mary said, gently,
               "Well, John?"
               "He told me to put the tree right back where I found it, Mary," said John, speaking very rapidly. "He said I had no business to do such a thing without asking leave, and that he wouldn't have the trees in the yard any way."
               Mary's eyes were bent upon her work, but the blue-veined lids drooped heavily, and her voice trembled as she answered:
               "Don't feel bad about it, John. Perhaps your father will change his mind after he has thought of the matter a little, and will let you transplant them another time."
               "I never shall ask him," exclaimed John, indignantly, "never as long as I live! I have worked hard all my life—ever since I was big enough, I mean—and have had no more privileges than one of the hired men. I have never been to school, where it has cost any thing of any consequence, excepting that one term at Carrolton. I never have had spending money like other boys; and my clothes haven't been very costly either; and I did think that I had earned the right to take up a tree from one place on the farm, and plant it in another, if I chose."
               "John, perhaps your father wanted it for timber, or something. I don't know but it would have been better to have asked him."
               "No, he didn't. I knew it before I touched the tree; and, besides, he said so today. He marked the trees that he wanted should stand for lumber last winter, and there wasn't one in that whole clump. I don't care so much for the trees, Mary," he continued, brushing away something that looked very much like a tear, "but when father knew that I wanted them, and he wouldn't be one cent the poorer, why couldn't he have indulged me? Sometimes I think all he and mother care for, is to get all the work they can out of me!"
               "Oh, John, John, don't talk so—don't!" cried Mary, with a half-terrified glance at her cousin. "They are your own father and mother, and you should not say that."
               "I know it; and it does seem wicked. But, Mary, they never seemed to love me, not even mother. When I was a little boy, she always turned me off, and wanted me out of the way; and she never used to kiss me or pet me, any more than if I hadn't been her child. And I don't believe father ever talked with me half an hour in my life, excepting about the work. He isn't any better acquainted with me than a stranger."
               "Your father does not talk much to any one, John."
               "That's true; still, Mary, I am the only child he has, and I am growing old enough to be a companion for him. If he loves me, why doesn't he treat me as one? I am not an old man, it is true," he added, faintly smiling, "but neither am I a little boy; and why does he treat me like a mere child?"
               "Perhaps he does not realize how fast the years pass away. Very likely he does not think any thing about it, one way or the other."
               "That's the very thing. He ought to think. A father ought to be so familiar with a son, on such terms of intimacy, that he cannot help noticing the flight of time. You don't know any thing about it, Mary. I never have spoken of these things to you, because I knew it would do no good, and you had enough to trouble you with your own and Tommy's affairs. Besides, I didn't like to find fault with father and mother."
               Mary's tears were falling, partly out of sympathy for John, partly on her own account.
               "Father is never willing I should have a horse to go anywhere, unless on business for him," continued John, after a lengthy pause. "It is so strange! even when they are standing in the stable doing nothing; always says that he does not see what I want to be 'gadding' about for. And I don't care much for it. It seems to me that if I had a pleasant, happy home, with plenty of books to read, and could have things about me to please my eye and gratify my taste, I should never want to leave it."
               "Yes, you would, John," replied Mary, with a smile. "You think so to-night, because you are low-spirited; but I know you better. This is a stirring world, and men have something to do in it. They can't sit down and fold their hands in any home, however pleasant."
               "Yes, but I should like to have a real home to go home to, when my work was done. That would be a comfort. Mary, shouldn't you like to sit down, once in a while, somewhere besides in this kitchen?"
               Mary's smile deepened into a low, musical laugh ere she replied to this question.
               "I am so glad to sit down anywhere, generally, that a seat in the kitchen doesn't trouble me very much. I think it is a great deal pleasanter than the sitting-room or parlor."
               "Perhaps it is; but not pleasanter than they would be if they were used, and fairly rid of the cold, gloomy look they have from being always shut up. It would be so pleasant if one need not always see the work going on!"
               "Why don't you sit in the other part of the house when you come in, if you would like it better?"
               "I did try it, one day last summer. Supper was not quite ready, and the kitchen was like an oven. So I went into the sitting-room, and opened the windows, and threw open the front hall-door. There was a fine, cool breeze, and I sat there resting myself, and wondering why I hadn't done the same thing before. Pretty soon mother came in, and wanted to know what I was there for, and I told her. She did not find any fault with me; but she said if I wanted to sit there, I must have the windows shut and the blinds down, for she shouldn't have the carpet faded by the light, nor the room full of dust for anybody. And she closed them herself, in much less time than I was raising them. So that was the result of one experiment," and John laughed in spite of himself. "What is the use of having a room well furnished, and then keeping it under lock and key, from one year's end to another?"
               "I shouldn't think there was any. They don't manage that way at Mr. Vaun's."
               "No, indeed they don't. Mr. Vaun's children will never need to leave their own home in search of a happier one. But, Mary, do look at Tommy. Won't he take cold there on the floor?"
               "I guess not, he's used to it. But it's past his bedtime," she said, glancing at the clock. "Tommy! Tommy, wake up! Why, how sound he sleeps! Tommy!"
               "Don't bother him, Mary. Let me carry him up stairs, and that will rouse him. Heigh-ho! He's growing to be a fine, large boy," and John walked off with his unconscious burden.
               The cool air of the stairway and chamber partially aroused the child, and John placed him on a chair, and left him. Mary soon succeeded in convincing him that it was bedtime, and his head was ere long resting on his pillow, in sweet unconsciousness.
               "Mary," said John, as she came into the kitchen again, "I'm going to try one thing more. There isn't a fruit-tree on the farm, except the apple-trees in the orchard, and they don't bear one-third of the time. Mr. Vaun says a farmer cannot raise any thing that is more profitable than fruit, for it always finds a ready market, and commands a good price. I mean to ask father if I may buy some young plum, and pear, and cherry trees—they don't cost much—and set them out in the lower part of the orchard. There is plenty of room."
               "So there is; and I should think aunt Betsy would be glad to have the fruit. Hark! there they come. Stir up the fire, John. It's chilly this evening."
               John did as he was requested, and then went out to take care of the horse.
               In a few days, with but very little trouble, he ascertained that there were a fine lot of young fruit-trees for sale in an adjoining town, at a very moderate rate; and at the first convenient opportunity, he broached the subject to his father. Poor fellow! He had no better success than with his first experiment.
               "I don't think much of fruit-raising, for my part," said Mr. Graham. "In the first place, two-thirds of the trees, if not more, will die, most likely; and those that live won't bear for an age, maybe not in my day. Then, when they do begin to bear, the birds will take one-half the crop, and the boys t'other half. 'Tain't a very good investment."
               Argument and persuasion were alike useless, and John gave up the matter with, we are afraid, a very bad grace.
               So passed that year and the next, with but very little change in the aspect of things in Farmingdale. Mr. and Mrs. Vaun kept on the "even tenor of their way," happy themselves, and diffusing happiness around them; beautifying and adorning their home—adding occasionally a fine engraving, a rare book, or some other not too costly work of art, to their household treasures—training their children in goodness as well as in knowledge—giving nourishment alike to the young heart and the young intellect—and affording to the yearning affections of childhood a strong and sure support, a firm abiding-place beside the altar of home.
               Amy Thompson had an aunt living in New York, who was in some way connected with a flourishing seminary for young ladies. She had repeatedly written to Mrs. Thompson requesting that her niece might come to her, and attend school for a year; but during Amy's childhood her mother had preferred that she should remain under the paternal roof. Now that she had grown older, however, the offer was gladly accepted, and she had been for several months in the city.
               
               "I shall write you very often, Mary," she had said when she went away, "and shall tell you all I see, and hear, and what I am doing and learning."
               Her promise was literally fulfilled; but there were two drawbacks upon the pleasure with which Mary received the letters. One was, that her aunt never failed to grumble about the postage; the other, that they always made her feel for a time, even more painfully than before, how great was her own loss in being deprived of the privileges usually afforded to her age and sex. A hearty burst of tears generally followed the perusal of one of Amy's cheerful and loving epistles.
               John was now approaching his twenty-first birthday. He was growing daily more and more dissatisfied with the state of things at his father's. The ceaseless drudgery of a farmer's life, unrelieved by opportunities for reading and study, became inexpressibly irksome to him. He became restless, discontented, unhappy. He was growing daily more and more determined, that he would not be a farmer; but how to break away from the chains that enthralled him, and obtain other means of livelihood, he knew not.
               "I shall be twenty-one in the fall, Mary—did you know it?" he asked, one Sabbath evening, as they sat in the porch, while Tommy, at a little distance, was poring over a book belonging to Alice Vaun.
               "I knew it, but I had not thought of it for a good while. Have you selected your 'freedom suit' yet?" replied Mary, with a laugh.
               John's lip curled bitterly. "My 'freedom suit' won't amount to much, I imagine. Mary, I am going away in the fall."
               "Going away, John? Not to stay?"
               "Yes, to stay."
               "Where are you going? and what will you do?"
               "I don't know; but I will do any thing rather than stay here. I can't live so, Mary."
               "Have you said any thing to your father?"
               "No; and I fear he will be very angry. I know he thinks I will stay here, just as I always have done. But I cannot. I must get into some business where I can be independent, and have something that I can call my own."
               "But, John, it will be a good many years before you can be independent anywhere. Wouldn't it be better for you to have patience, and remain here, hoping for the best?"
               "I can be more independent anywhere than here, Mary," he continued, while a bright flush mounted to his very forehead. "I have to ask father for every penny that I want, and it will be so if I stay here until I'm forty. I expect to work hard anywhere, but no harder than I work now, and what I earn will be my own. Besides, I have had enough of farming. I've 'ploughed and sowed, reaped and mowed,' as the old song says, until I am tired of it."
               "I always thought farming was pleasant business," said Mary.
               "It may be pleasant, but not as father manages. Either he doesn't know how to make it pleasant, or he doesn't care; I don't know which it is."
               John's determination was carried into effect. He was unwilling to say any thing to his father on the subject until he had some definite idea as to his future course. He was not wrong in thinking that Mr. Graham would be too much offended to give him any advice or assistance in obtaining employment elsewhere, and he knew that he must depend entirely on his own energies.
               Several years previous to this time one of the Farmingdale merchants had "pulled up stakes" and gone to Ohio. He had entered into business there, and, rumor said, had been very successful. John at length determined to write to him, and request his assistance in obtaining a situation as clerk in a store, or in any other business where he could hope for steady employment and reasonable wages.
               His letter was speedily answered; and contained the agreeable intelligence that his correspondent was himself in need of an assistant; and an offer of a small salary for the first year, with a promise that it should be raised, as his familiarity with and capacity for the business increased. John did not at once accept the offer, but at the earliest opportunity after the reception of the letter, he laid the matter before his father, frankly stating his own wishes. Angry and mortified—mortified that his only child should wish to leave him—and refusing to see that it was but the legitimate fruit of his own management, Mr. Graham received the announcement in stern silence—a silence that was, perhaps, more trying to his son's feelings than the bitterest reproaches would have been.
               
               "Go, if you think you can better yourself," was the only reply he would make to John's oft-repeated efforts to bring about a fair understanding of the matter. He seemed to regard himself as the injured party, and he would listen to no explanations, to no excuses, whether from John's lips or from those of any other person. Mr. Vaun, who understood John's motives and feelings more perfectly than any one except Mary, and who knew, also, how earnestly he wished to be at peace with his father before he left his roof, endeavored to act as a mediator, but to no purpose. Mr. Graham would listen to nothing, and treated John with a studied coolness, scarcely even addressing him for any purpose whatever.
               Mrs. Graham took her cue from her husband, and followed his example as far as she could; but both her tongue and her temper were less under her own control, and a sudden burst of reproach and invective occasionally gave indications of the storm that raged within.
               The weeks rolled on apace, and at last the evening before John's departure arrived. Mary had said nothing of her sorrow, but went quietly on with her accustomed duties; doing, meanwhile, all she could to assist her cousin, looking over his shirts and stockings whenever she had a little leisure, setting a button here, and a stitch there. John had asked her to pack his trunk for him, and she was laying article after article in its place, with a very heavy heart, and eyes that were almost blinded with tears, when Mrs. Graham entered the room.
               There was a little of the mother lingering about her, after all. She had at first thought that she "wouldn't trouble herself about John's clothes;" but she had found it impossible not to do so. And now she approached the trunk with half a dozen new shirts, and as many pairs of stockings.
               "I rather guess I can pack John's trunk without your help. You just go down and 'tend to your own business," she remarked, dryly; and Mary obeyed her, wondering in her own heart whether it was merely a fancy of hers that there was a very slight tremor in her aunt's voice; and wondering, also, when and where the shirts were made—that being the first she had seen of them.
               Mr. Graham seemed to take it for granted that if John had concluded to go to the West, he had also made arrangements for getting there; and did not make the slightest allusion to his means of defraying his expenses thither. John several times tried to allude to the subject, but it appeared to him that his father purposely avoided it. He at last decided to borrow money enough to carry him to the place of his destination, and to pay it from his first quarter's salary. He, therefore, applied to Mr. Vaun; but that gentleman, although he expressed perfect willingness to oblige him, if it was necessary, advised him to pursue a different course.
               "Go to your father, John," he said, "and ask him plainly for some money. You have earned it over and over again; and I presume Mr. Graham expects to give it to you, but is waiting for you to request it. Tell him that you must either run in debt or apply to him for assistance. The first alternative I, for my part, am unwilling to have you adopt. You ought not to start with a debt, be it ever so small, upon your shoulders. Still, if you cannot obtain the money from your father, I will let you have it willingly."
               John promised that he would do as his friend advised; but he kept putting it off from time to time, until this, his very last evening at home. Finding his father alone in the kitchen, he crushed, with a powerful effort, the many emotions that were each bidding him be silent, and asked him for some money—enough to carry him to Ohio.
               "How much will it take?" asked Mr. Graham.
               John told him what he presumed the expense would be, and he counted out the requisite number of bills, and put them in his son's hand without speaking. But there was not a dollar more than was absolutely necessary.
               The next morning, as Mary was looking from the window, with her eyes fixed upon the hill, over the brow of which the stage-coach would soon become visible, John approached her, and stood silently by her side. His face was sad and pale:—going away from home, to shift for one's self, is no very light thing, even if that home is not all that one could wish it to be.
               "No one will miss me here but you, Mary," he said at length, in a trembling voice; "I believe you will."
               "Indeed I shall, John, and so will Tommy. I don't know but I shall miss you too much;" and her eyes filled with tears. "The house will be lonely enough without you."
               "You can't miss me more than I shall you. You have been every thing to me, Mary. Do you know it? It seems to me sometimes that I am not at all the same person that I was before you came here to live; and I have felt, more than once, as if it was wrong and selfish in me to go and leave you. But I can do you no real good by staying here, and perhaps by going—"
               John never finished that sentence, and what great thing his "going" was to accomplish, is more than we dare undertake to say. Presently he went on:
               "After all, Mary, it is as much your fault as mine. I never should have left home if it had not been for you."
               "If it hadn't been for me, John!" exclaimed Mary, in an almost indignant voice. "I should like to know what you mean by that?"
               John smiled at her heightened color.
               "Don't be offended, Mary. You mistake me entirely. I only mean that if you had not taught me that I had a mind that needed culture—if you had not awakened a new train of thought and feeling within my breast, and shown me that I was capable of higher things, I should probably have been contented to remain here always, and should never have cared whether I improved or not. But I bless the day that brought you here, Mary," he added, laying his hand gently on the one that rested on the window-sill—"even if I did say some queer things to you during our ride over the mountains. What did you think of me? I've never dared to ask you."
               Mary shook her head playfully, although her tears were not dried.
               "I can't undertake to look backward so far as that. But I know what I think now, cousin John. It is, that you have been as kind as a brother to me, and have done all you could to make me happy."
               "There comes the stage," said John; and in a very few minutes it was at the gate. Amid the hurry of departure he had time for nothing more than a hasty "Good-by" to Mary. His father shook hands with him stiffly—his mother gave him a cold kiss—Tommy sobbed as if his heart would break—the four gaunt, forlorn-looking horses gave a desperate pull at the touch of the driver's long whip—the lumbering vehicle shook itself, rolled from side to side, then started forward—and John was gone.
               People thought it was a strange thing—a very strange thing, indeed—that John Graham, the only son of a wealthy father, should leave home to make or to mar his own fortune—most probably, so the prophets said, the latter. They thought he must be of a very restless, uneasy, discontented disposition, and very ungrateful withal, to leave his father in his old age, when he might be of so much service to him.
               But they had not looked behind the curtain; they had only seen one side of the picture.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               
                  
                     
                        This disease is beyond my practice.
                     
                     —MACBETH
                  
               
               VERY early one morning in the December following John's departure, the good people of Farmingdale were aroused from their slumber, by the measured tread of a horse galloping over the frozen ground. Many started from their pillows and listened until the sound died away in the distance; and then, wrapping themselves in the warm blankets, sank to sleep again. Some few sprang from their beds, and drawing aside the window-curtains, peered out into the darkness. But they could see nothing but the fast receding outline of a white horse and his rider; and, shivering, they crept back to their couches, thankful that the ominous echo concerned not them. Ah! did it not?
               In after years, the mere memory of that heavy, trampling hoof, breaking as it did the stillness and repose of early morn, was enough to blanch the cheeks, whiten the lips, and send a thrill of keenest agony through the heart of more than one dweller in Farmingdale!
               As Mr. Graham's family were assembled round the breakfast table that same morning, a messenger from Mrs. Vaun broke hastily into the room. Half out of breath, it was a minute or two before he could do his errand. Little Alice had been taken sick during the night—very sick they were afraid—and the doctor for whom they sent some hours ago, had not yet arrived. Would Mrs. Graham come over, and give Mrs. Vaun a little advice? The latter had never seen a similar case, and did not know what to do for the child. Such was the purport of the message.
               Mrs. Graham—their nearest neighbor though she was—had never yet entered Mr. Vaun's house. A foolish prejudice at first, and pride more recently, had kept her away. But this was no time for ceremony; and hastily throwing on hood and shawl, she gave Mary a few directions about preparing for dinner, and followed the messenger. Perhaps in her "heart of hearts" she was not at all sorry of an opportunity to be on rather more familiar terms with Mrs. Vaun, without in the least compromising her own dignity. She was a little flattered, too, by being sent for; and, to do her justice, she was an excellent nurse, and well skilled in the use and nature of simples.
               At the gate she found a "cutter," with plenty of warm buffalo robes, waiting for her. The path across the meadows was impassable during the winter; and although there was but little snow upon the highway—none in fact, excepting close to the fences—yet in the fields there were deep drifts, and plenty of them.
               When she reached the house, Mrs. Vaun came out of the bedroom where her child lay, with traces of tears upon her cheek, yet with her usual calmness of demeanor.
               "This is very kind of you, Mrs. Graham. I am afraid my poor little Alice is dangerously ill. Please come into the other room and see her, when you have laid aside your things, and warmed yourself. It is a bitter cold morning."
               "The coldest we've had yet this winter," replied Mrs. Graham. "But when was Alice taken sick, and what seems to be the matter with her?"
               "She slept quietly enough until about midnight. Then she awoke me, complaining of severe pain in her head, difficulty of swallowing, &c. I bathed her head, put her feet in warm water, gave her some herb-tea; in short, resorted to nearly all the simple remedies that have generally proved sufficient for my children's ailments; but she kept growing worse. At four o'clock we sent to the village for the doctor; and as he did not come, Mr. Vaun has now gone himself, and will not return without some one. We have not had any occasion to employ a physician since we lived here, and hardly knew who to call on."
               "Well, there's three doctors in the village, and some folks likes one on 'em best, and some another. I don't know much about 'em for my part, and what's more, I don't want to. But I s'pose they do good sometimes."
               With this doubtful compliment to the medical profession, Mrs. Graham rose, and signified her readiness to accompany Mrs. Vaun to her child's bedside.
               It needed but one glance of her somewhat practised eye, to tell her that the little girl was indeed very sick. Her lips were parched, her hands hot and dry, her face flushed even to crimson; and she moaned and tossed from side to side, and murmured incoherent sentences and broken words, as if in great distress.
               "Alice, my darling," said Mrs. Vaun, softly, as she stooped to press her lips to her burning forehead, "does your head ache as badly as it did?"
               There was no reply, but the little arms were thrown wildly about, and there was a spasmodic movement of the mouth.
               "She's out of her head, ain't she?" asked Mrs. Graham; "she looks to me as if she was."
               Mrs. Vaun's cheek grew a shade paler.
               "It is possible, but I had not thought of it before. She has seemed rational until now. Alice! Alice!"
               "Don't talk to her, Mrs. Vaun. It'll do more harm than good. Have you looked in her throat? Seems to me it's swollen."
               "It is outwardly; and I put flannel round it, thinking she had taken a little cold. I did not look in her mouth, as she seemed inclined to be quiet."
               "Well, I should like to look in her throat. I should not wonder if she had got the canker-rash. Will you give me a table-spoon?"
               The spoon was brought; and at Mrs. Graham's request, the curtain was drawn from the window at the foot of the bed. Alice lay with her mouth partly open, and placing the handle of the spoon gently upon her tongue, she keenly examined her mouth and throat.
               "It is just as I thought," said she, drawing back and laying the spoon upon the table. "Her throat is all cankered. I guess she's got the canker-rash."
               "Oh, I hope not," said Mrs. Vaun. "I dread it more than I do the small-pox—a great deal more. Will the doctor never come?" she continued, as she went to the window and looked anxiously out. "There's a sleigh coming over the hill now."
               But it went directly past. There was no doctor yet.
               "Oh, this is the worst of living in the country!" exclaimed the weeping mother, as a fresh moan came from Alice's lips. "My poor lamb, can we do nothing for you?"
               "Don't take on so, Mrs. Vaun. I guess we'd better put draughts to her feet."
               "I have them there already."
               "Have you? Do they draw well? No; her feet are cold, and don't look a mite red. These onions ain't strong enough. I'll go out in the kitchen and make a good, stiff mustard-paste."
               She went out, but in a moment opened the door again, and looked in.
               "If I was you, Mrs. Vaun, I wouldn't let the other children come into this room a bit. Canker-rash is one of the catching disorders."
               "It is too late to do any good, if she has it. They have been in and out all the morning;" and Mrs. Vaun clasped her hands in her distress and anxiety. "Oh, that doctor! Why don't he come?"
               It was past noon before Mr. Vaun returned, bringing with him the most skilful physician that the county afforded. He had found those in town all either absent or engaged, and had been obliged to go to Carrolton.
               Dr. Andrews shook his head as he looked at Alice's crimson cheeks, and felt her fluttering pulse.
               "She is a very sick child, Mr. Vaun," he said, thoughtfully.
               For twenty minutes there was no sound in the room, save Alice's inarticulate moans, and the low hum of question and response, as the doctor inquired concerning her previous health, and the manner of her attack. Then there was a long pause.
               "What is the matter with her, doctor? Can you determine at present?" asked Mr. Vaun, as he thought he detected an unwonted shade of anxiety on the physician's face.
               Dr. Andrews hesitated a moment.
               "Yes, but too readily. The symptoms are all strongly marked. The child has the scarlet fever."
               A low, smothered sob arose from the quarter of the room where Mrs. Vaun sat, with her face partly shaded.
               "Do you think the disease contagious, doctor?" at length she asked.
               "Not particularly," was the reply. "It generally prevails as an epidemic, but I have never considered it really contagious. Has Alice been exposed to it?"
               "Not to my knowledge. I was thinking of the other children when I asked the question."
               "They will all be likely to have slight attacks; but, we will hope, nothing more serious than that. We shall be able to take hold of their cases, if they are sick, without loss of time. I am sorry I could not have seen this little girl last night. However, we must do the best we can. Can you give me a sheet of paper, Mrs. Vaun?"
               Alas for human forethought! Alas for human skill! In less than a week, little Ellen, the youngest daughter, lay in a darkened room, with a wreath of geranium leaves, and two or three half-opened buds, that a kind neighbor had stolen from her monthly rose bush, resting upon her marble brow, and her tiny fingers clasped above a pulseless breast; while Ralph was struggling between life and death, and Alice seemed slowly convalescing.
               There were anxious hearts and anxious faces in Farmingdale on the day on which Ellen was buried. One or two children in other families had already been attacked by the same terrible disease, and no one hoped that its progress was yet stayed. There were wailing sobs and long-drawn sighs, as the voice of prayer arose from beside the coffin of the little one so suddenly cut off; and bitter tears were shed upon the pale clay and the cold turf that covered it—tears that sprang from a dread foreboding of coming evil, as well as from grief for that which had already visited them.
               That foreboding was but too deeply realized. Onward, and still onward swept the destroyer, entering almost every house where there were children playing beside the hearth-stone; and blest indeed were those parents who, after his sable wing was lifted from their dwelling, could clasp all their treasures to their hearts, and whisper, amidst tears of joyful thanksgiving, "Ye are ours still!"
               Mary had had the disease in her childhood, and would have felt but little apprehension on her own account, even if it had not confined its visitations principally to the "lambs of the flock;" but her anxiety for Tommy was extreme. He occupied the "boys' room" by himself that winter; and there was scarcely a night in which she did not rise twice, at least, and steal to his bedside, to notice if there was any unusual flush upon his cheek, or if his breathing was less easy and regular than it should have been. As the days rolled on, and the pestilence had twice passed their dwelling, leaving him unscathed, she began to hope that he would escape entirely. But one night she thought she perceived some unfavorable symptoms, and immediately called her aunt.
               Mrs. Graham's heart had been softened by the sight of the suffering around her. She had seen the sods piled upon so many little wasted forms that winter, that even her hard nature shrank from the possibility of witnessing such a scene again. When Mary called her, she arose quickly, threw on her clothes, and hurried up stairs.
               Mary watched her with a throbbing heart, as she placed her hand upon his forehead, felt his hands and feet, and looked at his mouth and throat.
               "He's got it this time, fast enough," said she; and wrapping him up in a large blanket, she carried him down stairs herself, and laid him in her own bed.
               How Mary's tears fell over him! How she prayed that the God of her mother would heal and save! She could scarcely be prevailed upon to leave him day or night; her own life seemed to hang by the same slender thread that held Tommy's; and more than one of those who glanced from the face of one to the other, thought that if he were taken she would soon follow.
               The struggle was long and very severe; but at length the fever left him, he suffered little or no pain, and only one doubt oppressed them,—they feared that he had not strength to rally.
               As days passed, and he seemed to be slowly gaining, even that fear was laid aside; and in a fortnight he could sit up for a few minutes at a time, supported by pillows, and with an old double gown of Mary's wrapped around him.
               One day Mrs. Vaun came down to see him. The sight of her black dress made Mary shiver and turn pale, and her voice trembled, so that she could scarcely utter the customary words of greeting. Tears started in Tommy's eyes, also, as he thought of Ellen, cold in her little grave, of Ralph and Alice, and of all he had himself suffered.
               Mary inquired for the two children.
               "Ralph is gaining rapidly," replied Mrs. Vaun, stooping to kiss Tommy, with trembling lips; "as rapidly as your own little patient will, I trust, be gaining two weeks hence. He begins to look quite like himself again, but I don't know what to think of Alice," and the mother's voice fell as she uttered the last words.
               Mary had been so completely engrossed, mentally and physically, by Tommy, for the last few weeks, that she had hardly given a thought to others. Now her heart smote her for her apparent selfishness.
               "Of Alice, my dear Mrs. Vaun? I supposed that you considered her out of danger long ago."
               "She is—as far as her life is concerned." Here Mrs. Vaun turned a warning glance towards Tommy, and the subject was dropped. But before a great while the little fellow began to grow tired, and Mary laid him in bed again. His eyes soon closed in quiet, healthful slumber, and they stole noiselessly from the room,—remaining, however, near the door, in order that they might hear the slightest movement of the sleeper.
               "Now, tell me about Alice, Mrs. Vaun. You don't know how you startled me," said Mary, laying her hand anxiously upon her friend's arm. "What is it that you fear?"
               "I can scarcely tell you, Mary. I have tried to prevent my anxiety from taking any clearly defined shape. But you know her eyes were very seriously affected, and although her health is now almost restored, her eyesight remains impaired. I sometimes feel very uneasy about it."
               "What does the doctor say?" asked Mary.
               "He says very little; but I have noticed that he watches her closely, and I have thought it was with a view to ascertaining the extent of the difficulty. Still, I may be needlessly alarmed, and I would not, for the world, have Alice know of my fears. I do not think the dear child has even dreamed of danger. But oh, Mary! she mourns and grieves for Ellen, till it seems as if my heart would break. Come and see her as soon as you can leave Tommy." Mrs. Vaun's tears were falling fast, and Mary's kept pace with them; but very soon the former rallied.
               "This will never do," she said, gently; "I shall unfit myself for the discharge of duties that no one else can discharge in my place, and so will you. I try to remember always, Mary, that our God 'doeth all things well,' and that He 'careth for his children.' But where is your aunt? I must see her before I go home."
               Mary called her aunt, and then returned to Tommy's bedside, to gaze with a feeling of thankfulness, for the expression of which she could find no language, upon his calm, placid face, and upon the soft dew on his forehead, from which his rich brown hair rolled back in irregular spiral curls.
               A few days afterwards, when Tommy was well enough to be dressed and sit in his rocking-chair by the kitchen fire, Mary thought of her promised visit to Alice Vaun.
               "Tommy," said she, as she placed the few toys and picture-books that one and another had given him, on a table by his side, "Tommy, I think I ought to run over and see Alice. You know Mrs. Vaun has been here to see you a good many times. I won't be away but a few minutes. Shall I go?"
               Tommy's smile was a very bright one.
               "Yes, go—I want you to; and tell Alice I shall get well first, if she doesn't hurry."
               Mary found Alice lying on the sofa, in the library, alone. Her little thin hand was pressed closely over her eyes, and, thinking she was asleep, Mary was about to steal softly away, when her footsteps reached the child's ear.
               "I am not asleep," she said; "is that you, Mary?"
               "Yes, dear. How did you happen to know my step so well? I was going away quietly, so that I should not disturb you."
               "You don't disturb me. Why haven't you been to see me before? Oh, I remember—Tommy has been sick, too. How is he?"
               "Better. He says he shall be well first, if you don't hurry."
               Alice smiled sadly.
               "I don't get well very fast—not as fast as Ralph. He plays about the house nearly as much as he used to. But poor Ellen! oh, Mary, that morning I was taken sick; she was so sorry for me! and she brought me drink a great many times, and laid her hand on my forehead, because it was cold, and she thought it would make my head better—that was so hot and ached so hard. And that's the way she took the fever," she added, with a sudden burst of tears; "and now I haven't any sister."
               "Yes, you have, dear Alice," said Mary, softly; "you have a dear little sister in heaven, and she is a great deal better off than you are."
               "I know that—mother tells me so; but it does not make any difference about my wanting to see her. She always loved me so," she continued, musingly; "but I don't suppose she does, now that she is up there with the angels."
               What could Mary say? What could she do, save to take the child in her arms and weep with her? She had so recently grieved herself over the fear of being separated from Tommy; she had so recently felt that the world would be dark indeed, if the light of his little face were taken from it, that she realized how empty, how incapable of affording solace to the mourning heart, were the common-place, trite expressions of condolence and sympathy. So they sat there, in perfect silence, for some minutes, until Mary saw that Alice's tears were ceasing to flow, and that her face was growing calm again.
               "But how are you, Alice dear?" she then asked. "I don't think you look very bright yet."
               "I don't feel very bright either, Mary," she added, passing her hand hurriedly over her eyes. "Mary, I want you to take a good look at my eyes, and then tell me."
               "Tell you what?"
               "Why, how they look, to be sure."
               "They look weak, of course. You can't expect any thing else, at present."
               "Yes, but do they look as if I could see."
               "I don't see any thing to prevent it," said Mary, quietly; but her heart was throbbing violently. She wondered what was coming next.
               "But isn't there any thing growing over them?"
               "Nothing at all. What makes you ask such a question, Alice?"
               "Because I thought there was, and I did not like to ask mother. Mary, I can see your face," said the child, gazing earnestly into the one that bent above her; "but I can't see the bookcase—no, nor the table, hardly. It's all a blur."
               "Oh! your eyes are weak yet, Alice. As you grow strong, they will also."
               "I don't believe they will. They grow worse, instead of better, every day. I could see a great deal more clearly when I first began to sit up than I can now. Mary, I'm afraid I am going to be blind."
               "Oh! I hope not, Alice—I believe not. You must have something done for your eyes. Have you told Dr. Andrews?"
               "No, I couldn't bear to. I was afraid he would tell me I never could be any better. He knows they are weak, but he thinks I see better than I do—I know he does; and so do father and mother."
               "Alice, what is that lying on the window-seat?"
               "A book, isn't it? It looks like that."
               It was an oblong pincushion of Mrs. Vaun's.
               "And what is that?" asked Mary, pointing to an orange that lay on the table.
               "Oh! that's Ralph's ball. I can tell that because it's round."
               Mary took good care not to undeceive her; and, soon after, took her departure. She found Tommy watching for her eagerly, and anxious to hear from Alice. So she gave him a glowing account of her walk, but contrived to say very little of his young friend, and nothing at all of the fears that harassed her.
               But those fears proved to be only too well grounded. All that the most anxious affection, aided and guided by medical skill, could suggest, was done; every expedient was resorted to, patiently and perseveringly, that afforded the least chance of restoring to her poor eyes the light that was fast fading away; but all was in vain. For some months Alice could see a little, just enough to enable her to grope her way about the house. Before the June roses were in bloom, she was entirely blind.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           I know to some the world is fair,
                           For them there's music in the air,
                           And shapes of beauty every where;
                           But all to me is dreary.
                           I know in me the sorrows lie
                           That blunt my ear, and dim my eye;
                           I cannot weep, I fain would die—
                           I'm sick of life, I'm weary.
                        
                     
                     —BOKER.
                  
               
               IT seemed to Mary while the epidemic was raging, and even for a month or so after the last child attacked had become convalescent, that her aunt's nature was entirely changed; she was so much more kind and motherly than she had ever been before, so much less disposed to find fault, so much less afraid that the children would have a moment to themselves—in short, so unlike her former self, and so much more like what Mary thought a kind and affectionate aunt ought to be. And most earnestly did she hope that the change might prove lasting. But——ah! if there were not so many buts and ifs on every page of human life, what a very different story we might tell!
               Our readers can anticipate what we have to say regarding the enduring nature of the change in Mrs. Graham. It lasted only while the moans of the dying children, and the wail of the stricken mothers yet lingered in her ear. Just as soon as the grass began to cover the little mounds—there were many of them—in the grave-yard, and the bereaved ones gathered strength to go about their accustomed duties, and to speak of the dead with a calmer and more subdued sorrow—just so soon "Richard was himself again."
               Mary received one or two letters from John during the winter. He was equally pleased with the country, his business, and his employer. Still, he wrote, although he did not reproach himself, or think he was to blame in the matter, that he deeply regretted his estrangement from his father, and could not be quite happy until reconciled to him. Mary placed the letter in Mr. Graham's hand after she had read it, saying simply,
               "This letter is from John, uncle Graham."
               
               She hoped he would read it in her presence, in order that she might see how he was affected by it; but he put it in his pocket, and went out of doors. When he came in to dinner, an hour afterwards, he returned it to her without a word.
               Amy Thompson came home in the spring, a trifle more quiet and subdued in her demeanor, Mary thought; but as frank, as warm-hearted, as impulsive as ever. Going to boarding-school had not spoiled her; she had learned much, and, at the same time, had forgotten neither her old friends nor her old duties.
               Tommy, for a while, gained rapidly in health and strength, and Mary began to think he was as well as before his illness. But as the warm weather came on, he appeared to droop again, and her eyes, sharpened, perhaps, by anxiety and affection, saw many indications of languor and weariness. There were no other eyes in the family, however, equally observing. Tommy was now old enough to be of a good deal of service upon the farm, running of errands, fetching the cows, weeding the garden, and attending to various other out-of-door matters; to say nothing of the churning, the bringing of water, and picking up of chips, that Mrs. Graham—thrifty housekeeper, and provident manager that she was—contrived to get out of him. And it is not to be supposed, that on account of any ailment, real or fancied, unless it was so serious as to endanger life, he would be allowed to sit quietly under the cherry-trees, or to lean upon the table while Mary was at work, asking questions about his mother and their early home. He was on his feet from morning till night, running here and there, bringing this and carrying away that; and, at the same time, when the sun went down, he could seldom show what he had done, and was reproached because he had not accomplished more.
               "Can you get along without Tommy, in the lot, for two or three weeks?" said Mrs. Graham to her husband, one sultry morning in August.
               "I don't know. I suppose I shall have to, if you need him in the house. What do you want of him?"
               "Why, there's that wool. If it ain't picked, I shan't get it carded and ready for spinning, I don't know when. And 'tain't no ways likely that Mary's going to get time to do it, nor me neither, while we have so many hands, and so much milk to see to."
               "Well, keep Tommy in the house then, and have him do it. But you must put up some luncheon, and let James take it along, as we go to the lot, for I can't send after it."
               "The butter will all melt, and the milk be sour before ten o'clock. 'Twon't take him long to come after it. I would send Tommy, but after he gets about that wool, I want to have him stick to it."
               "The butter won't melt enough to hurt it, and I can set the jug of milk and water into the creek. I guess that'll keep it from souring!"
               "Well, I'm suited if you be;" and Mrs. Graham put the bread and butter, the cold meat and gingerbread, of which the men's usual luncheon was composed, into a bright tin pail, spread a cloth over it, and carefully fastened on the cover. Then she called Tommy, and went up garret.
               The garret of a country farm-house has been so often and so ably described—its time-stained, weather-beaten walls, its dark rafters, dim recesses, and shadowy corners, have figured upon so many a page of story and romance, that it is not necessary to paint them here. Suffice it to say, that this was a large, low room, lighted at either end by a semicircular window, and containing its full share of old clothes and empty barrels. Strings of seed-corn, dried apples, and red peppers hung upon the walls, together with huge bunches of dried herbs, and paper bags filled with sage and summer-savory. A large rope was securely fastened across one corner, and upon it were arranged the feather-beds, for which the family found no use during the summer. There was a broken reel, a pair of swifts that looked as if they had seen hard service, and a spinning-wheel.
               But what more immediately concerned Tommy, was a large blue and white blanket filled with wool, and fastened together by long, sharp thorns, in lieu of pins. It lay on the floor in one corner, but Mrs. Graham hauled it into the middle of the room, directly in the range of the two windows, pulled out the thorns, and straightened the blanket. Then she spread a clean sheet at a little distance, and looked about her, seemingly in search of something else. Presently she spied a small box, turned up against the wall, and bringing that, she placed it bottom side up between the two.
               "There, Tommy, you set down on that box, and go to picking this wool. Put what you pick in this sheet."
               
               "I don't know how to pick it," said Tommy, looking dubiously at the immense (so it appeared to his eyes) pile before him.
               "You don't? Well, it won't take me long to show you. You must take a handful—so—and pull each lock apart in this way; and when you find any burs, or any ticks, or any thing, you must be sure to get them all out."
               "What are ticks?" asked Tommy.
               "There's one; that little brown thing."
               "Is it alive?"
               "'Twon't bite, if 'tis. Come, don't take hold so carefully, as if you was afraid of dirtying your fingers. Be spry."
               She stood watching Tommy for a while, as he pursued his task, rather awkwardly at first, but more adroitly as he became familiar with the modus operandi, and then left him to go on with it alone.
               Tommy did not like his new business remarkably. It was dull and lonesome up there in the old garret, with nothing but the rats, that occasionally made him start as they scampered about in the walls, to keep him company. Still, for two or three days he bore it very well. It was a change, and all children like that. Once in a while Mary would steal away from her own work, and pay him a flying visit, just long enough to speak a few cheering words, or to give him a kiss, and sometimes more substantial aliment in the shape of an apple or a doughnut. But this was not often.
               One morning she noticed that he did not eat much breakfast, and that his eyes looked dull and heavy. He hung about while the table was being cleared, as if reluctant to go to his task, but said nothing. Pretty soon Mrs. Graham came in from the garden, with vegetables for dinner.
               "Mercy, Tommy! ain't you to work yet? Go right straight along up stairs—quick!"
               Tommy hesitated for a minute, "I've got a headache, aunt Betsy—a hard one."
               "Nonsense! You always have a headache when a body wants to get any work out of you. Go along; you'll be just as well off up there as down here, if it does ache."
               The child obeyed in silence; but Mary caught a glimpse of his face as he turned to go up stairs, and its expression made her heart ache all the forenoon. She tried to find a spare moment ment in which she might run up and see how he was. It was an unusually busy day with her, however, and she did not succeed.
               When the horn was blown, he came down, looking pale and sad; but as he made no complaint, Mary said nothing to him about his head. She had long ago learned that it is seldom worth while to remind a child that it does not feel well. He came to the table with the rest, ate a few mouthfuls, and then pushed his plate back with an air of disgust.
               "What's the matter with your victuals, Tom?" asked Mrs. Graham.
               "Nothing; only I don't like pork and beans, nor beets either. They make me sick. I wish I could have some bread and milk."
               "Well, you ain't a-going to: if you cant eat what's on the table, you can go without your dinner. You needn't be so mighty particular."
               Tommy swallowed a few mouthfuls of dry bread, and left the table. He walked about in the yard until the men were done eating, and then Mrs. Graham called him, and sent him up stairs again.
               "And you must hurry with that wool, Tommy," she said; "I want it out of the way just as quick as ever it can be."
               The garret was intensely hot. The fervid August sun beat directly down upon the roof; one window was partly open, but it seemed to give admission to scarce a breath of air. Tommy climbed up on an inverted barrel, and tried to unfasten the one opposite. It resisted all his efforts, and he returned wearily to his little seat again, and his fingers resumed their monotonous employment. He glanced at the open window. He could see the tops of the cherry-trees waving in the light breeze that might not reach his burning brow. On the loftiest branch a little bird swayed to and fro, chirruping merrily. Occasionally, as the breeze freshened, he could hear the rustling of the leaves; and when it died away, the faint murmur of the creek would reach his ear, filling his little heart with a feverish longing to bathe in its cool waters. But that was only when he listened intently. For the most part of the time he heard nothing but the creaking of an old window-shutter, that swung lazily on its rusty hinges. The sound became inexpressibly annoying to him. He was exceedingly afraid of thunder yet the wildest war of the elements would have been a relief to him.
               His seat was hard, and there was nothing to support his back. He wondered if he couldn't fix it somehow, and that diverted his thoughts for a few moments. There was an old cushion peeping out from beneath some rubbish in one corner. With a good deal of effort he succeeded in pulling it out and carrying it to his seat; he laid it on the box, and sat down to try the effect.
               "There, that's nice," he said: "now if I only had something to lean against, I should be fixed. Oh, there's a bigger box: that will do, if I can only get it here."
               He dragged the box from its place, and set it up in the required position. But when he attempted to lean against it, it was not sufficiently heavy, and his weight pushed it back. What should he do now? Not give it up; he was in no mood for that. Looking about him, he spied some billets of wood that had been carried there, doubtless for some wise purpose; and, one by one, he brought them and put them in the box.
               "This goes better, a great deal," said Tommy. "Now I can lean my head against it, and I guess it wont ache so hard."
               It did not; but his comparatively easy position, and the dull drowsy nature of his work were too much for him. Slowly his head drooped upon one side, his fingers grew still, and then, with a sudden start, he straightened himself up, and put them in motion again.
               Of course, all this was not accomplished without some noise. The shoving of the large box across the floor was distinctly heard in the kitchen.
               "Hark!" exclaimed Mrs. Graham, "what is all that racket? I am sure it comes from the garret. I'll bet a shilling that that boy plays half his time."
               She wanted very much to go immediately and learn the cause of the disturbance. But she was working butter, and could not conveniently leave it. As soon, however, as she had packed it down, and put away her various utensils, she washed her hands and went up the first pair of stairs. Softly opening the door at the foot of those that led to the garret, she listened for a minute. If Tommy was in any mischief, he was very still about it; but she thought she would go on and see what he had been doing.
               She mounted the stairs, and it was a moment or two before her eyes became accustomed to the dim light of the garret—dim, at least, when compared with that of the lower parts of the house—so as to admit of her seeing any thing. Gradually one object after another became visible, and she saw Tommy lying, half upon his seat, half on the pile of wool, fast asleep!
               Angrily she strode across the floor, grasped the little fellow by one arm, and raising him from his impromptu couch, shook him violently.
               Frightened and bewildered, the child did not speak nor cry, but stared about, as if his senses were forsaking him.
               "What are you doing there, you lazy little imp? going to sleep on the wool, instead of picking it—eh? I've caught you finely this time. There, take that, and that, and that," and she brought her broad hand heavily against one side of his head and then the other, several times in succession. "How did you dare go to sleep when I sent you up here to work—eh?"
               Tommy was fairly stunned by the heavy blows. His sudden awakening, too, had caused his old headache to return, with redoubled strength, and every nerve in his body thrilled with pain. He did not utter a word.
               "Answer me, when I speak to you, Tom Lester, if you know what's good for yourself. What made you go to sleep?"
               Tommy did not answer. It seemed to him that he could not.
               "Answer me!" and Mrs. Graham's hand was again raised.
               He shrank from the threatened blow.
               "Don't strike me again, aunt Betsy. I couldn't help it!"
               His aunt's eye was roving about the room.
               "No wonder you couldn't. What's this cushion doing here?"
               "I got it to sit on," said Tommy. "The box was so hard."
               "So hard! And what's this for?"
               "For me to lean against. My head ached, and my back. I feel sick, aunt Betsy; and it's so hot!"
               "I think it's very likely," said Mrs. Graham, mockingly; "being woke up don't agree with you. But I guess you'll get over it. Now, put these things back where they belong, and then see if you can sit up straight, and attend to your work. And don't you let me catch you asleep again. If you do, it will be the worse for you."
               
               She remained in the garret while the cushion, billets of wood, and box were being restored to their respective places, and until Tommy was again seated on his box. Then, with an admonitive warning, she descended the stairs.
               Half an hour afterwards, Mary went up to her own room after a clean apron, and while taking it from the closet shelf, she thought she heard a low, suppressed sobbing from the garret. Up she flew, to see what was the matter.
               Tommy was at work, picking his wool with busy fingers; but tears were chasing each other down his cheeks, and he did not stop to wipe them away. As he raised his eyes and saw Mary, he dropped the wool, and sprang eagerly into her arms.
               "Oh, Mary, Mary!" he sobbed, "you haven't been to see me once in all this long day!"
               "I know it, Tommy darling; but I have been just as busy as I could be, every single minute. What makes you cry so, dear?" and she tenderly smoothed back his brown curls, and kissed his little tear-stained face.
               But he only cried the more.
               "Oh, my head aches so badly, Mary, and I am so tired! I did not mean to go to sleep, but aunt Betsy boxed my ears very hard."
               Mary did not know what he meant, but by a little skilful questioning she drew the whole story from him. An indignant flush mounted to her brow, and she clasped him closer to her breast.
               "There's that little bird again," he exclaimed, as his eye rested on the swaying top of the cherry-tree. "He sits there half the time. I wish I was a bird, and I would fly way up into the blue sky, and never come back here any more."
               Mary burst into tears.
               "What, and leave me, Tommy?"
               "Mother is up there—up in the sky. Oh, I wish I had a mother!"
               How Mary's heart echoed the wish!
               Tommy lay still for a few minutes, resting his head on his sister's knee.
               "What time is it, Mary?" he asked without raising it.
               "It must be nearly four o'clock: I don't know but it's later."
               "I can't pick any more wool this afternoon—need I? See, I've done so much to-day," and he pointed to a pile lying apart from the rest.
               "I guess you needn't, Tommy. But you stay here, and I'll go and see about it."
               She went down to the kitchen.
               "Aunt Betsy, mayn't Tommy leave the wool for to-night? He's sick and tired, and it is very hot and close up there."
               "I don't believe a word of the story about his being sick. I s'pose you've been up there, pitying and making a baby of him, half of the day."
               "You know I haven't done any such thing, aunt Betsy, for I have hardly been out of this kitchen, since I got up this morning. I have not been up to see Tommy to-day, until just now, and I haven't pitied him either—not to his face."
               "What do you mean by that?" asked Mrs. Graham, angrily.
               "I mean that I have not told him that I thought he had to work too hard, or that you punished him more than he deserved for going to sleep—but I do think so."
               Mrs. Graham was fairly startled out of her self-possession. Mary had borne her own trials so meekly and patiently, that her aunt had thought she possessed little spirit, energy, or determination; and she was astonished beyond measure, when she saw her evincing so much more of these qualities in Tommy's behalf than she ever had in her own. While she was collecting her scattered senses, Mary asked again,
               "Mayn't I go and tell him to come down?"
               "Yes, I don't care if you do. It's most time for him to go for the cows."
               Mary smiled as she turned to go up stairs. For in the first place, she knew it was not nearly time to bring the cows; and in the second, that the men had, for several nights past, driven them home when they came from work. It was a mere subterfuge.
               Many such occurrences in the course of the summer, combined with Tommy's continued feebleness and evident unhappiness—an unhappiness that was growing to be something more than the light and evanescent sorrow of childhood, that was souring his temper, and ruining his disposition—led Mary to ask herself seriously whether she could support herself and him by her own exertions. In her childhood, when she first came to Farmingdale, it had been a favorite fancy of hers that she would some time, when she was older, start out on "her own hook," and make a large fortune in some very easy way. Then she would send Tommy to college, have a beautiful house filled with far more beautiful things—plenty of books, pictures, and every thing of the kind. All this was to be accomplished very easily, and with no great loss of time, strength, or patience.
               But she was older now; she knew something of the realities of life; and she merely asked herself whether she should be able to get a living—food, lodging, and clothing for both, and give Tommy opportunities for acquiring a decent education. Sending him to college was a far-away dream, too bright to be realized.
               It was a difficult question to decide upon.
               "If I should fail," she said to herself, "if I should be sick and unable to work, what would become of us? Would I not regret that I had given up even a certainty no better than this, for an uncertainty? Would I not wish that I had been content to remain here? Is it not more prudent to bear the ills that now fall to our lot than to rush headlong into those that may be far worse? But how can I see Tommy grow up in this way?"
               She said nothing of the thoughts that perplexed her to any of her friends. She knew, instinctively, that they would think it a fool-hardy undertaking, and, in fact, she often thought so herself. And she would give it up and try to confine her attention to her daily tasks, and strive to make Tommy as happy as possible where he was. But that was no easy matter. He was a sensitive, impulsive child, loving, when he loved, with all the wealth of his little heart. And his antipathies were equally strong. His aunt Betsy he disliked more than any other person in the world; and Mary was very sure that she knew it.
               But she was helped to a decision in a very unexpected way.
               It was the middle of September. Yet although the nights and mornings were cool, it was still uncomfortably warm in the middle of the day. Tommy's cheeks, which had been growing gradually paler and paler through the summer, had not yet resumed their wonted color; but Mary hoped that the fresh, invigorating air of the coming months would impart vigor to his frame and elasticity to his spirits.
               "Is the cream in the churn yet, Mary?" asked Mrs. Graham one morning.
               "Yes, ma'am: I'm going to churn pretty soon."
               "No, you ain't; you've got to make bread and pies this forenoon, and I'm going to iron. Tommy must churn: where is he?"
               "Somewhere in the yard; in the back yard, I mean." Mrs. Graham stepped to the door and called him.
               "Take hold o' that churning, Tommy," she said, as he came in, "and keep the dasher moving pretty lively. Get a chair to stand on; you can't reach in that way."
               The butter was a long while "coming."
               "I don't see what ails the cream," said Mrs. Graham, applying her finger to the dasher as she spoke; "it's warm enough, and it ain't any too warm. It must be that the cows wa'n't salted last week."
               Tommy kept on churning. There was not a great deal of cream, and the dasher moved easily; but his arms ached with the steady, uniform motion, and his lips began to grow white. Mary left her pies, and went to relieve him.
               "Sit down a little while, Tommy, and rest yourself. I'll churn a few minutes."
               He gladly obeyed; but there was a cloud gathering on Mrs. Graham's face. He was scarcely seated before she called to him,
               "Here, Tommy, take this pail and run to the pump for some water, and don't let the grass grow under your feet, neither."
               In a very few moments the boy came back, bending beneath the weight of a pail far too heavy for his strength, and sat down panting, and with large drops of sweat upon his forehead.
               Mary took a handkerchief from her pocket and tossed it into his lap. He smiled gratefully, and after wiping his brow, leaned back in his chair, and closed his eyes.
               But only for a moment. They were presently wide open.
               "Come, Mary, give Tommy the dasher again, and you go back to your own work. He's rested long enough."
               "He hasn't rested at all, aunt Betsy. He had scarcely sat down, when you sent him for the water."
               "Well, that rested him. It does boys good to run. And, besides, I want one of those pies for dinner, and you'll have to hurry."
               
               "There is a pie, aunt Betsy, one that was baked day before yesterday. I'll finish the churning, and then make the pies in the afternoon."
               "No, you won't do any such thing. The pies are going to be made right away, and the churning done too. Come, Tommy, take hold."
               He rose slowly and painfully from his seat, but as his hand closed around the dasher he burst into tears.
               "Aunt Betsy, do let me churn," said Mary, pleadingly; "it won't make but little difference with the work, and Tommy looks so tired."
               "Mary Lester, do you behave yourself and stop interfering in my concerns," said Mrs. Graham, exasperated almost beyond endurance; "Tom is getting as lazy as he can be, and you uphold him in every thing. Come along here," she added, grasping Tommy's shoulder, "come along here, and I'll give you something to cry for, and then put you where you'll have a chance to rest."
               For once, Mary was fairly aroused. Her eyes flashed, her form dilated, and springing forward, she placed her hand on the boy's other shoulder—
               "Aunt Betsy, what are you going to do with Tommy?"
               "It's none of your business. I shall do just what I have a mind to with him."
               "Yes, it is my business, aunt Betsy; it is my business to see that he is not whipped unless he deserves it," said Mary firmly, but respectfully; "and he does not deserve it now."
               "Well, if it is your business to take care of him," said Mrs. Graham, pushing the child away from her with such violence that he would have fallen to the floor if Mary had not caught him—"if it's your business to take care of him, you'll have to go somewhere else to do it. I sha'n't be abused and insulted in my own house by a saucy trollop like you."
               "I never have abused nor insulted you, aunt Betsy. You gave Tommy and me a home when we had none of our own, and I have always felt grateful for it. But Tommy is sick, and I can't stand by and see him working when he looks scarcely able to stand; nor punished when he has done nothing to merit it."
               "Take yourself off with him then, and make a gentleman of him," and Mrs. Graham fairly screamed, she was in such a passion. "I won't have you in my house another night! This is all the thanks a body gets for taking care of a couple of beggar's brats, who have never earned the 'salt to their porridge.' Take yourself off, I say!"
               "I will, presently," said Mary. She was very pale, and her hand trembled as she drew Tommy to her side, and twined her arm about him; but her voice was firm and clear. "I will, presently: but mother was not a beggar, and she did not think her own sister would be the first to call her one. And, aunt Betsy, I have earned a great deal more than the 'salt to my porridge.' You have kept a hired girl only one summer since I came here, and before that you always had one. I have done the work just as faithfully and as well as a servant would have done it, and I have certainly 'paid my way,' and Tommy's too."
               Mrs. Graham winced, for she was very well aware that Mary had spoken nothing but the truth. Of course she was, if possible, even more enraged than before.
               "Take yourselves off," she repeated. "I've heard enough of your sauce."
               Mary went up to her room with Tommy—poor, bewildered child that he was—and sitting down on the edge of the bed, she endeavored to collect her thoughts. What were they going to do? Much as she had thought of leaving, it had always been as of something far off in the future, and she had formed no definite plans. How were they going to live?
               For half an hour she sat like a statue, "pondering these things in her heart." At last she started up.
               "This won't answer!" she exclaimed; "we must do something or other. Tommy, my dear child, don't cry so," and she kissed the tears from his little pale cheeks.
               "I can't help it," said Tommy. "Oh, Mary! what will become of us?"
               "We can get a living, Tommy; I know we can," was the cheerful response. "I can work; and you must help me by being good and patient. Don't you remember what you read me last Sunday, in mother's little Bible, about the lilies and the ravens?"
               "Yes; but we ain't lilies, nor ravens, either," said Tommy, smiling faintly; "and we can't live out of doors all the time."
               
               "No; but God can take care of us, and He will if we trust him, and try to help ourselves. We'll find a place to stay—you see if we don't."
               "Let's go to Mr. Vaun's, Mary."
               "No; I don't want to. They always have plenty of help there, and we must go somewhere where I can find work. We can't live on other people, Tommy. We've got to do for ourselves."
               "Mr. Thompson's, then?"
               Mary shook her head thoughtfully; but pretty soon her countenance brightened.
               "I believe that will do, after all. Tommy, you've helped me already."
               "What are you going to do?" asked Tommy, as Mary commenced putting a change of clothing for both into a small basket that had belonged to her mother.
               "You'll see. Run into the boys' room, Tommy, and see if there is any thing there that belongs to you."
               In a very short time Mary had packed their trunk. She locked it, put on her bonnet and shawl, and went down stairs, leading Tommy by the hand. Mrs. Graham was just taking up the dinner.
               "Good-by, aunt Betsy," said Mary, pausing on the doorstep.
               "You can stay and eat your dinners if you have a mind to," said that lady, without looking up.
               Mary hesitated, and looked at Tommy. Pride said "No;" but Judgment said, "Perhaps you'd better stay." So she took off her bonnet, and placed the chairs around the table.
               Neither Mr. Graham nor any of the men were aware that the children were going away, and the meal was eaten rapidly, and almost in silence. When they left the table Mary began to gather up the dishes.
               "What are you going to do now?" asked Mrs. Graham.
               "I thought I would wash the dishes before I went," was the reply.
               There was no objection made; and the kitchen was in nice order before Mary left it. Mrs. Graham had finished the pies; and the churn was nowhere to be seen. Again donning her bonnet she once more bade her aunt good-by, and they left the house.
               "What are you going to do with the trunk?" asked Tommy.
               "Oh, I forgot. Aunt Betsy," said she, turning back; "can my trunk—and the one up garret, too—stay here until I have a place to put them, and can send for them?"
               Mrs. Graham smiled sarcastically. "Yes; I s'pose they can."
               "They'll be back in less than a fortnight," she said to her husband that night, "with a little of the starch taken out of 'em too, I reckon. They'll be a little more pliable after they've been knocked about for a while."
               Mr. Graham looked rather sober.
               "John first—and now the children. Wife, I think we are pretty much alone."
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Why, how now, Adam? no greater heart in thee?
                           Live a little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little.
                        
                     
                     AS YOU LIKE IT.
                  
               
               WITH her basket on her arm, and Tommy's hand clasped firmly in her own, Mary bent her steps towards Mr. Thompson's; not gayly, not thoughtlessly, but yet with no disposition to turn back. As they reached the turn of the road, they paused and looked at the home they were leaving. Alone in the world as they were, is it any wonder that Mary trembled for the future? that when her thoughts flew back to her mother and the "cot where she was born," and she remembered all the trials and annoyances that had darkened her pathway since she left it, her tears fell like rain? Who could tell whether she was not going from bad to worse?
               Her tears fell, but not long. Laying off her bonnet, she bathed her eyes with water from the creek that danced along by their side, and dampened Tommy's hair in order to arrange it more to her taste. Memory recalled the day when her aunt had insisted upon cutting off his curls, in spite of all her remonstrances.
               "I do believe that Tommy will be better off," she murmured to herself, "whether I am or not."
               Lifting up a fervent although wordless prayer to Him who "sitteth in the heavens," she went on.
               It was a pleasant afternoon, and Amy sat on the door-step sewing. As she saw Mary approaching, she threw it one side, and came dancing down the path to meet her.
               "Oh Mary, I'm so glad! for you've come to spend the afternoon with me, I know—and Tommy too. What's become of your red cheeks, dear? have you lost them? Let me take the basket, Mary, and then come right in and lay off your bonnet;" and twining her arm about Mary's waist, she led her towards the house.
               "Here are Mary and Tommy, mother," she continued, as they entered the small yet very cheerful sitting-room. "They're going to take tea with us. What in the world have you got in this basket, Mary? It's heavy enough. Did aunt Betsy give you a dozen shirts to make up for your afternoon's work?" she added, laughing.
               "Amy, Amy!" said Mrs. Thompson, shaking her head reproachfully, "how you do run on! You haven't given Mary a chance to speak one word. Are you well to-day, my child? You haven't been here in a long time;" and she took both Mary's hands in hers, and gave her a motherly kiss.
               "Very well, ma'am." Mary's heart was so full that she could say no more.
               "Come here, Tommy," continued Mrs. Thompson, "come here, and let me take a good look at you through my spectacles. What a tall boy you are growing to be! but he doesn't look very strong, Mary. He needs a good deal of care and nursing."
               "Come with me, Tommy," said Amy. "I've got a family of kittens—the prettiest ones you ever saw in your life—to show you. Come!"
               He bounded away to take her outstretched hand, and she led him out of the room.
               "He doesn't look well at all, Mary," resumed Mrs. Thompson. "I am afraid you are not careful enough of him down to your house. The scarlet fever is a terrible disease," she added, contemplatively, as she settled back in her seat again, and took up the stocking she was darning. "Even when it does not leave a child blind like little Alice Vaun, or deaf like Squire Paige's son, it most always leaves the general health in a bad state."
               Mary forced herself to speak.
               "I have been thinking he did not look well for a good while. But do you suppose he is in any danger?"
               "Oh no, my dear; not if he has proper care. I shouldn't have mentioned it, only that I thought you might not have noticed it, being with him all the time. All he needs is a little nursing," she added, with a smile. "Hadn't you better leave him with me for a week or two?"
               Mary had been struggling with her tears ever since she came into the house, but now they burst their bonds in spite of her. Mrs. Thompson was greatly distressed.
               "Why, Mary dear, I didn't mean to frighten you. I wouldn't have said a word if I had thought it would have made you feel so. Dear! dear! I'm so sorry! Don't take on so, my child, don't! Tommy is a little weak, that's all;" and going to Mary's side, she laid her hand tenderly upon her head.
               Mary seized the kind hand, and covered it with kisses.
               "Oh, it isn't that, Mrs. Thompson; don't think it is that. It is nothing that you have said. But—but—"
               The neighbors all knew Mrs. Graham's "peculiarities," as they called them; and Mrs. Thompson immediately guessed the meaning of the "but."
               "What is it then, dear? have you been having any trouble down to your house? I thought you looked sober when you came in."
               "It isn't 'our house' any longer. We are not going back to aunt Betsy's to live any more, Mrs. Thompson;" and Mary wiped the tears from her eyes, and tried to speak calmly.
               "You ain't! Why, dear child, what's the matter? What are you going to do?"
               "I don't know," said Mary, replying to the last question first; "I don't know; but I shall do something."
               Then, in as few words as possible, she gave Mrs. Thompson an account of the occurrences of the morning.
               "And it's been so all summer, Mrs. Thompson; and that's what makes Tommy look so badly. I am almost glad aunt Betsy turned us away. I have been wondering, for a long time, whether it would be possible for me to earn a living for Tommy and myself, but I shrank from coming to any decision. And now it is made for me, and all I have to do is to go to work."
               "Go to work! You don't look much like it. A little nursing wouldn't hurt you, either;" and with a troubled face the kind lady returned to her seat again. "I can't see that you have been to blame in this matter, Mary; and I don't suppose Mrs. Graham meant to do any thing but what was right, either. If she could only see things a little differently, she would be a great deal happier."
               Good Mrs. Thompson! she always saw the best side of every one.
               "If mother can't find an excuse for anybody who has gone astray," Amy used often to say, "then there is none to be found."
               Just then Tommy came in, with a kitten in each arm, and Amy followed with two more.
               "Why, Mary, what does Tommy mean?" she asked, as she placed them on the floor. "He says you are not going to live at your aunt Betsy's any longer!"
               "And she wouldn't believe me," said Tommy; "but it is just so, isn't it, Mary? Are we going to live there any more?" and running up to his sister, he leaned with both elbows on her lap, and looked confidingly in her face.
               "No, dear, we've got to look up a new home now."
               "Oh! tell me all about it—do Mary," said Amy, eagerly; "won't your aunt Betsy let you live with her? or have you left of your own accord?"
               "I don't know but I ought to answer 'yes' to both your questions, Amy. I can hardly say that I wished to stay, and aunt Betsy certainly did not wish to have me."
               There was a long pause, during which Amy knelt by Mary's side, and laid her head affectionately on her shoulder. She knew instinctively that her friend was in no mood to bear questioning and catechizing, and yet she felt that she needed her sympathy. And she manifested it by those mute caresses that are far more eloquent than words. A tear fell from Mary's eyes and rested upon the hand that so fondly clasped her own.
               "Don't feel bad, Mary—I can't bear to have you," said Amy, while her own voice trembled. "Mother! can't you say something to cheer her up?"
               "Mary will feel better before a great while," was the reply; "it is perfectly natural that she should have some unpleasant feelings now. But, my child," she added, in her calm, motherly way, "I have faith to believe that this will all prove for the best. Your mother taught you to love your Bible, Mary, and you know there are sweet promises there for the 'father-less children.' They should be fulfilled to you in double measure."
               "I know it, Mrs. Thompson," said Mary, smiling through her tears, "and I believe it, too. But still, every thing seems so new and strange to me." She hesitated for a moment, and the color rose to her face.
               "Mrs. Thompson, didn't I hear you say, that day you called at aunt Betsy's, that you were disappointed in your spinning girl?"
               "Disappointed in finding one, do you mean? Yes; I engaged Debby Turner, but her mother is sick, and she can't come. I have been all over town looking for some one else, but all the girls that go out spinning are engaged, except widow Marsh's daughter, and I won't have her. She can't spin an even thread, if she tried ever so hard. Do you know of anybody that wants a place?"
               Mary cast down her eyes.
               "Do you suppose I could suit you, Mrs. Thompson? I have spun a good deal for aunt Betsy."
               "Suit me, dear child? of course you could. But I didn't mean that, Mary. I don't want you to spin for me. You can do something better."
               "What can I do that is better? I don't know of any thing I would as lief do," said Mary.
               "Better?" echoed Amy, "I don't see what she can do that will be half as good. Wouldn't we have nice times, though!"
               "You must stay here just as long as you have a mind to, Mary," continued Mrs. Thompson. "I'll send Harry over after your trunk to-night. I shall be glad to have you here—you and Tommy, too; and we'll try to brighten up the little fellow's cheeks between us. But don't you suppose you could get a school somewhere, this winter? You would like that business a great deal better than spinning."
               Mary shook her head. "Girls don't often teach the winter schools, and I should be afraid to try even if they did. I don't know any thing about teaching, and there are always large boys who attend in the winter, boys older than I am. Next spring will be soon enough to think of that. But in the mean while I must be doing something. If I can spin well enough to suit you, Mrs. Thompson, I would a great deal rather do that than any thing else," and the gentle speaker's eyes again filled with tears.
               "You shall do it, if you want to, dear; I only objected on your own account. Even Mrs. Graham never could find any fault with your spinning. I've heard her say so."
               "She never told me so," said Mary, with a half smile.
               "Well, she did me. She said you was a first-rate spinner, for she taught you herself. But we haven't made any bargain yet, dear. How is it about wages?"
               "Oh, if you please, Mrs. Thompson," said Mary, crimsoning, "if you please, don't say a word about that. Just let me stay here, and give me whatever you think I earn."
               Mrs. Thompson laughed merrily.
               "That's a poor way of doing business, my child; what if I should grow stingy one of these days, and think you didn't earn any thing? If you are going to take care of yourself and this little fellow here," and she laid her hand kindly on Tommy's head, "you must begin right. I will tell you what I will do, I will give you just what Mrs. Vaun gave Debby Turner (and what I was going to give her); and Tommy shall stay here too, and be my boy. You shan't have any thing to do with him, and we'll have some rosy cheeks to show in a month from this time—won't we, Tommy?"
               Tommy gave a pleased assent, but Mary's heart was too full—she could not speak a word.
               "Come, Mary," said Mrs. Thompson again, after a short silence, and there was a roguish twinkle in her eye as she spoke—"come, Mary, I want to have you make your first bargain. Does my proposition suit you?"
               Amy had been standing by the window, carelessly humming a favorite air, and keeping time with her fingers. She turned round suddenly, with a mockingly grave face.
               "I am really surprised at you, my dear Mrs. Thompson! How can you be talking of such vulgar, commonplace things as 'bargains,' and dollars and cents? Don't you perceive that Mary is so much overcome at the prospect of being permitted to enjoy my invaluable society, that she isn't able to answer you?"
               "Do you be still with your nonsense, Amy! You don't think dollars and cents such very vulgar things, when you want a new dress or a new bonnet; and you are not going to cheat me out of an answer to my question. What say you, Mary?"
               "That I am not only satisfied, but far more than that; that I am very, very grateful," said Mary, rising; and going to Mrs. Thompson's side, she clasped her arms about her neck, and kissed her affectionately.
               "Well, then, we've made a 'bargain;' not such a terrible thing after all, is it, Mary? Now run away and help Amy get tea. While I have two daughters, I expect I shall have pretty easy times."
               With what a light heart Mary linked her arm in that of Amy, and bounded away to the kitchen! For a few months, at least, she had, if not a haven of rest—rest formed but a small part of the staple of her day-dreams—yet a harbor of refuge—a home.
               
               "Where is Tommy going to sleep, mother?" asked Amy, after tea. "Mary will share my room, of course."
               "Where was the cot put, when Mrs. Huntington sent it home? You know she borrowed it while the children were sick."
               "It's up garret. Harry carried it there the day it came back."
               "Well, I thought I would have it set up for Tommy in the little bedroom that opens out of your chamber. Mary will feel better about him than she will if he is way off by himself, in the other part of the house."
               "What bedding shall I get for it? Mary says she would rather he wouldn't sleep on feathers."
               "Put a good thick comforter over the straw bed, then; and there are sheets on the shelf in the west closet. He won't need any thing over him for the present but a flannel blanket, and one of those blue and white coverlets. But stop a minute, child," she added, as Amy was dancing away. "You can't fix it now; you'll have to wait until the men come in."
               "Oh, no, ma'am. It's very light, and Mary and I can bring it down the garret stairs without any trouble. We're in a hurry to have every thing settled to-night. Will you send Harry for her trunks?"
               "Yes, I will attend to that. Amy, any one would think that Mary's misfortunes really gave you pleasure," said Mrs. Thompson, half reproachfully.
               "But you see, mother dear," replied Amy, "the truth is, I don't consider it any misfortune at all. Mary will be a great deal happier away from her aunt, than she has been with her. She has been almost worried to death about Tommy; and it is not very likely that she will have any more, or any harder work to do, now that she is trying to take care of herself, than she did before."
               "Maybe so; but, Amy, I fancy you would think it was no easy matter to take care of one's self, and a little brother to boot, if you had to try it."
               "I haven't said it was an easy matter, mother," replied Amy; "but Mary isn't at all like me. She isn't such a giddy rattlebrain as I am; and I do believe she will succeed in whatever she undertakes. I am glad her aunt turned her off. You've no idea how much she has had to bear there, especially since John went away."
               "Well, well, dear," said her mother, drawing Amy to her side. "I have an idea that you love your friends very well, even if you are a 'giddy rattle-brain;' and I don't think you have any idea that Mary ever did a wrong thing in her life. She is a dear child, and we must try to make her as happy as we can while she is with us. But she will wonder what has become of you."
               The trunks were sent for, greatly to Mrs. Graham's surprise, and greatly to her chagrin also. She had found Mary very valuable "help" for the last few years, and she had no sort of belief, when she told her to "take herself off," that she would be literally obeyed. When the children left the house, she thought they would be back in a day or two, if not that night; and her anger and mortification were extreme, when she learned that Mary had engaged to do Mrs. Thompson's spinning, and that Tommy was to remain with her.
               Next morning the wheel was brought from the garret, and established in a light, pleasant chamber. Mrs. Thompson proposed that the spinning should be postponed until the coming week; but Mary was in haste to begin her labors. She longed to feel that she had fairly commenced her task—the task of earning a livelihood.
               "Now, Mary, don't be too smart, and do two days' work in one," said Amy, after all things were in order. "I don't like to see people too industrious, for it makes me ashamed of myself."
               "I'm glad you have the grace to acknowledge as much," said Mrs. Thompson, laughing; "and it gives me courage to think that you may possibly profit by Mary's example. You might have done this spinning yourself just as well as not, if you—"
               "If I hadn't been too lazy? Now, don't say that, mother;" and Amy wound her arm about her mother's waist, and waltzed around the room, half carrying, half pulling her reluctant partner with her. "Don't say that, when you know I have so many cares already. There's the speckled hen, with her one chicken—I have her to feed and to condole with on the loss of the rest of her brood. There's Spot; nobody ever thinks of giving him his dinner except me; and when did I ever forget it? There's my bird; he wouldn't live two days if it wasn't for my tender care. There are my flowers and house-plants; what would they do without me, I should like to know? And there's—there's—"
               "I rather guess you've finished the list, Amy," interrupted her mother.
               "No, ma'am, I haven't," said Amy, clapping her hands. "There are the kittens! I have to look after them as often as three times a day, and give the old cat her milk besides. Now, Mary, I'll leave it to you—Should you think I could have much time for any thing else?"
               "Why, no, Amy. Your cares are really weighty. But who made those nice new shirts for your father that I saw hanging on the clothes-line last night?"
               "I did," said Amy.
               "All alone?"
               "Yes, all alone."
               
               "Who worked the cap and collar that lie on the bed in the best chamber?'
               "Amy Thompson. Do you know her?"
               "Who made that nice little pink frock for Biddy O'Callaghan's baby?"
               Amy laughed, and so did Mrs. Thompson.
               "You do manage to do something besides attend to your 'live-stock,' as your father calls them, don't you, Amy?" said the latter. "But how or when, it would puzzle one to tell. Seems to me you are always on the wing."
               Days and weeks sped on: Mary was almost afraid to think how fast and happily. Tommy's face again glowed with health and happiness, and his sister's heart throbbed with delight as she marked the change.
               "This is a great deal nicer than living at aunt Betsy's, ain't it, Mary?" he asked one morning, as he sat on the floor in the room where she was spinning. "I don't have to churn or pick wool here."
               "No; and I'm almost afraid you'll get lazy, Tommy. You must do all you can to help Mrs. Thompson. She is very kind to us."
               "I do help her a great deal," replied Tommy. "She said yesterday she didn't know as she could keep house if it wasn't for me. I pick up chips, and I gather apples, and sometimes I wipe the dishes, with an apron of Amy's tied round my neck; and once in a while I bring in water in the funniest little tin pail. Mrs. Thompson won't let me take a big pail; but I told her I could just as well as not, for I used to at aunt Betsy's."
               "I am very glad if you are making yourself useful, Tommy. You must be kind, and good-natured, and obliging, and then you will be loved and happy."
               But Tommy had still other business to attend to. Every morning he sat down in Mary's room, and learned a lesson in geography, and in the afternoon he studied the multiplication-table. Then Mrs. Thompson gave him paper to make a writing-book, and Mary or Amy wrote copies for him. That he liked exceedingly, and thought that before a very great while he should be able to write a letter to cousin John with his own hand.
               Mrs. Thompson took good care that Mary should not spin too steadily. Often when she saw or fancied that she looked tired or sad, she would call her down and send her off on some very important mission with Amy; or she would beg her to come and finish some bit of sewing that was needed immediately; and then the sewing seldom proved to be a very long task, and Mrs. Thompson never thought it was worth while to resume the spinning that afternoon.
               "Don't go off up stairs again, Mary," she would say; "it is almost tea-time. Suppose you mix up some of your nice cakes that Mr. Thompson likes so well. And when you've done that, there's the last 'Courier' on the table. I don't believe you've looked at it." And Mary would smile gratefully, and fly away to the pantry.
               It was two months, and over, before the spinning was done.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Summer joys are o'er;
                           Flowrets bloom no more;
                           Wintry winds are sweeping:
                           Through the snow-drifts peeping,
                           Cheerful evergreen
                           Rarely now is seen.
                        
                     
                     —FROM THE GERMAN OF HÖLTY.
                  
               
               IT was a dark, cold, gloomy afternoon in November. Every now and then a fierce gust of wind shook the house, making the doors and windows rattle ominously. Large drops of rain came occasionally in gusts and dashes against the panes—not coyly and half reluctantly, like the gentle showers of April, but with a bold, determined air, as if bent upon forcing their way inward. Mary was spinning the last armful of rolls. Tommy had repeated his lesson and gone down stairs. Mrs. Thompson and Amy were busy with some domestic affairs in the kitchen.
               Mary looked with a sadly earnest eye upon the lessening bundle of rolls that lay across the beam of the wheel. She had been so happy in her present quarters, that she thought of leaving them with a species of dread. Tommy, too, was so perfectly contented, so cheerful and healthy. Where would he find such another home? or friends who would cherish him so tenderly? Mrs. Vaun had urged her to spend the winter with them, and poor little blind Alice had tearfully seconded her entreaties; but our brave yet gentle Mary could not consent to be a guest anywhere at present; she wanted to work.
               
               The room grew darker, and her heart grew dark with it: life looked like a dreary, toilsome path: she began to wonder whether she would not faint by the wayside; whether her strength would not fail before her task was done. And then she asked herself what that task was, and how it could best be accomplished.
               Thoughts like these, although doubtless very profitable companions, were not very inspiriting. Her wheel moved slowly, and it seemed to her that its murmur had suddenly taken a strangely melancholy cadence. Her tears lay just at the surface: it was with difficulty that she kept them back.
               Just then a well-known step ascended the stairs, and Mrs. Thompson slowly pushed the door open, and looked in.
               "Well, Mary, how goes the spinning to-day?" she asked, as she caught her eye; "seems to me you are looking sober. Ain't you tired, dear? This is a bad day. Put up your wheel and come down stairs. Amy and I are just ready to sit down. Come," and she laid her hand with gentle force upon Mary's arm.
               "Not now, Mrs. Thompson. See, I am almost through; these are the last of the rolls."
               "Are they? I thought you had enough to keep you busy a day or two longer. Never mind; leave them till to-morrow. How dark it is in this chamber!"
               "I'd rather finish them to-night. It won't take me long."
               "Well, then, you run down stairs, and get my knitting-work, and I'll sit up here with you."
               The knitting-work was soon brought.
               "Mary, didn't you weave a piece of flannel for your aunt Betsy once?"
               "Yes, ma'am, a long piece; and I have woven coverlets, and blue and white counterpanes, also."
               "I have got to have some weaving done, and Amy wanted I should speak to you about it two or three weeks ago. But I told her we had better wait a while, and see if something better wouldn't turn up—something better for you, I mean. I knew Mrs. Vaun wanted you to spend the winter there."
               "Yes, ma'am, she did. But, Mrs. Thompson, she doesn't need me for any thing at all; and I should feel as if I were living on charity, if I stayed there, and as if I were allowing Tommy to be a burden to other people. They would not feel so, I know; but I should."
               Mrs. Thompson laughed.
               "You are an independent little body after all, Mary, if you do seem so quiet. Now, I really want you. Will you stay with me?"
               "Indeed I will," said Mary with a very bright smile. "I didn't know you wanted any weaving done, or I should have spoken of it myself."
               "I thought at first," resumed Mrs. Thompson, "that I would not have any thing done about it until next summer; but we can have the loom put up in the front kitchen, and use that for a weaving-room this winter, just as well as not. Then we shall not have to keep an extra fire, and it will always be warm and comfortable for you. If it is done now, it will be out of the way, and I sha'n't have it to think of."
               Mary's wheel was by this time singing quite merrily again. She was wondering how it happened that she had not heard the weaving alluded to before; and she had a lurking suspicion that the plan had sprung suddenly into life and being merely for the sake of furnishing her with employment and a home for the winter.
               Presently Mrs. Thompson went on.
               "Amy doesn't know any thing about weaving, and I want to have her learn. I believe I shall borrow a loom somewhere, and set the two up side by side. Some of this wool is so coarse, that it is only fit for a common, heavy piece of flannel; just the thing for her to begin upon. Don't you think it would be a very good plan?"
               "It is a very pleasant plan, I think," replied Mary; "but sometimes I have felt as if my living here wouldn't be very good for me in the end, or for Tommy either."
               "Why so?"
               "Because I am afraid we shall be spoiled for living anywhere else. We can't expect to have such a pleasant home as this always. Dear Mrs. Thompson," she added, with grateful tears starting to her eyes, "you have been more like a mother to us than any thing else."
               
               Very soon the last roll was spun, the wheel disbanded, and carried up garret, and the reel restored to its usual quarters. Mary looked proudly at the huge skeins of yarn that hung against the wall.
               "It's a real nice bunch of yarn," said Mrs. Thompson, comparing the quality of the different skeins, "and you have spun it beautifully. It is as even almost as spool-thread. I shall have some very nice flannel if you weave as well as you spin."
               The extra loom was borrowed, and one end—the lightest and pleasantest—of the large front kitchen was resigned to the looms. Amy was delighted with her new business, and in a short time her shuttle moved as swiftly, and with almost as much precision as that of Mary.
               Those were very pleasant days. In the morning the girls would assist Mrs. Thompson about getting breakfast and "doing up the work," and then, with light hearts and merry faces, they would apply themselves to their own peculiar tasks. Bending over their frames, with their cheeks glowing and their eyes sparkling, their voices would mingle pleasantly with the soft murmur of the loom, sometimes in song, sometimes in laughter, sometimes in earnest conversation. Tommy's daily lessons were not neglected, and many a rapid walk, and many a merry drive, prevented their somewhat monotonous work from becoming tedious or wearisome.
               "Mary," said Amy one day, while their shuttles were rapidly moving to and fro, "you need a new blanket-shawl, or a new cloak, or something; your old shawl isn't near warm enough. Why don't you get one?"
               Mary looked round at her with a comical smile.
               "Sure enough! Why don't I? Why didn't Archimedes move the world?"
               "Ay!" replied Amy, laughing, "but that question is not at all to the point. You've got not only a lever, but ground to stand upon. You needn't shake your head so. Didn't I see mother give you an enormous roll of bills the other day?"
               "Enormous! You must have had on magnifying glasses at the time. There were just twelve dollars, and I have spent every farthing (mentally, that is) three or four times over, and haven't got down to the shawl yet. I must make my old one answer for this winter."
               Mrs. Thompson sat by the fire sewing.
               "What have you to get with your money, Mary, that is of more consequence than a shawl? It seems to me that you need one very badly."
               "So I do, ma'am. But still it is not exactly one of the must haves. I can do without that; but there are a good many other things that I must get. I have got to buy myself a new dress; that I cannot do without; and Tommy must have a new suit of clothes; those he is wearing are altogether too thin; and he needs warmer shirts, or will need them soon, and a new pair of shoes. Then I want to get him a new reading-book, and a better geography and atlas. This one that he is studying I do not like as well as I do one I saw at Mr. Vaun's the other day. And by the time I get all these things, how large do you suppose my 'enormous' roll of bills will be?" and she turned towards Amy with a smile.
               "Don't you trouble yourself about Tommy," said Mrs. Thompson; "I told you when he first came here that he was going to be my boy, and I shall look out for him; so you needn't put him in your calculations at all."
               "But, Mrs. Thompson, I didn't suppose—I didn't mean—"
               "You mean to let me do just exactly as I choose, Mary, and that is to take care of Tommy this winter after my own fashion. It isn't going to cost me much of any thing either, so you needn't worry about that. I'm going to fix him a suit of clothes out of some of Mr. Thompson's old ones, that will be just about as good as new, and look almost as well too. Run up stairs, Amy, and bring down those plaid pants of your father's, and that dark blue coat."
               "There, Mary," she resumed, after they were brought, "these pants are a small plaid, and I think, if they are nicely washed and pressed, they will make over beautifully for Tommy; and the coat is just the thing for a roundabout, it is such a pretty shade of color;" and she held the garment up to the light. "We'll get them ripped and ready, and when the tailoress comes next week to make Mr. Thompson's overcoat, she shall cut them out. I guess I can manage to make them myself."
               Poor Mary! she sat for a moment or two vainly trying to find words that would express her gratitude. At last she said, half-laughing and half-crying,
               "Oh dear! I do wish I was like other people!"
               
               "Like other people! How so?" asked Amy, turning round from her loom. "I never thought you were very odd."
               "Why, it always seems to me that when I feel the most, I can say the least; and when I ought to speak, I am pretty sure to be silent."
               "But you have one advantage over most people, too," said Amy, kissing her affectionately; "your face and eyes speak very intelligible language, even if your tongue does not."
               "Still that does not satisfy me, Amy, and I get so provoked with myself! Your dear mother has been so kind to Tommy and me, and whenever I try to thank her, the tears come and choke me."
               Mrs. Thompson was busily turning over the coat and pantaloons, seemingly in a deep study, and paying no kind of attention to what the girls were saying.
               "There's another thing," she said after a little. "The boy ought to have something in the shape of a wrapper or overcoat. Did your aunt Betsy ever get him one, Mary?"
               "No, ma'am. He had a new one when we came to Farmingdale, and that lasted him for two or three years. Since then he hasn't had any thing, but a little old cloak of mine, to wrap around him."
               "And where is that?"
               "It's up stairs in my trunk. It isn't fit for any thing, except to be used in place of a shoulder blanket."
               "Go bring it down, dear, and let me see what it is good for."
               Mary brought it.
               Mrs. Thompson examined it in silence for a few moments.
               "I tell you what, Amy," she exclaimed, at length, "that old brown cloak of yours, with this for a lining, will make Tommy a nice, warm overcoat. That is good! We are going to be famously provided for. He's got a good enough cap, and the shirts and shoes, or boots—boots would be best for this time of year, wouldn't they?—are easily managed."
               "He's got some red flannel-shirts that he wore last winter. I don't know but they would last him through this season if they only had new sleeves," said Mary.
               "So much the better. I have got plenty of red flannel, and we'll have them fixed one of these evenings; and there are some stockings in the bureau-drawer in my room, that Amy has outgrown—they seemed to shrink badly, too—I don't believe they are a bit too large for Tommy."
               "Well," exclaimed Amy, with a laugh, "I think the young gentleman is pretty well rigged for winter, or will be after all these fine things are done. Now, how is it about that shawl, Mary? Shall we go to the village after it the next time father goes?"
               "I can't very well refuse to get it, now that your mother has removed so many of my excuses. But I must not get a very expensive one."
               "They have nice ones at Johnson's for eight dollars—nice enough—and such pretty colors! I wonder when father is going to the village. Do you know, mother? Where is he?"
               "At the barn, I believe. The men are threshing. I haven't heard him say any thing about going this week."
               "I mean to go and ask him. Come, Mary."
               "No, I must go to work; my web hasn't grown much this forenoon. If Tommy's there, tell him to keep out of mischief, and not to go near the machine."
               "Never fear, Mary," said Mrs. Thompson, "the men will see that he keeps out of danger."
               Amy returned in a little while, and reported that Tommy was in his element, riding one of the horses and leading the other; and that " father" said he was going to the village the next afternoon.
               "Well, then, we must work hard the rest of to-day and tomorrow forenoon, so that we may gain time," said Mary. "Mrs. Thompson, don't trouble yourself with those clothes. I can rip them evenings."
               "No, you could not see very well by candle-light. It won't take me long."
               The next day was a very pleasant one. Snow had not yet fallen, but the ground was frozen and worn perfectly smooth. The girls anticipated a delightful ride; and although their tongues were by no means still, the shuttles flew swiftly all the forenoon.
               "Get ready, right away, girls," said Mr. Thompson, as he arose from the dinner-table. "I've nothing to do but to harness."
               "And to shave, and put on another coat, and make yourself look handsome, father," said Amy, roguishly. "You don't think we young ladies are going to ride with you in such a fix as that?"
               "I guess if 'we young ladies' take offence at my coat, and stay at home, it will be a good deal the better for my pockets," was the good-natured reply.
               "Oh, but you don't mean that, father. You want us to go. Now do shave—I'll get you some hot water—and change your coat, won't you, father?" and Amy clung closely to his arm.
               "Pshaw! what's the use?"
               "The use is, that I like to have you look nicely, and like a gentleman!"
               Mr. Thompson laughed heartily, but twined his strong arm around his daughter's waist as he spoke,
               "'Live and learn' is an old saying, and I never knew before that a coat and a smooth face made a gentleman. I knew they went far towards making a dandy."
               "If you'd seen as many whiskers and mustaches as I did while I was in New York, you wouldn't say that, I fancy," said Amy, echoing his laugh. "But, father, your coat is really all dust. Now do change it."
               "Just what I have been intending to do all the time, Miss Amy. But you and Mary had better hurry. I'll be ready now before you are."
               It was five miles to the village; but to the girls it seemed scarcely two. The road followed the creek, and for nearly the whole distance, was overhung by stately forest-trees that had, by some strange good fortune, escaped the axe of the early settlers. They were leafless now, it is true, and shorn of much of their summer glory, but they were beautiful still. Beautiful they are ever; whether clothed with verdure in the early summertime; whether robed in garments of the gorgeous hues and brilliant coloring that autumn so dearly loves; or lifting up their naked giant arms as if to challenge the whirlwind and the storm,—beautiful are they ever—the glorious, time-honored trees of our own forests!
               Mary drew a deep breath of delight, as the light wagon rolled rapidly over the hard, well-beaten road.
               "What a beautiful world this is, Amy! it seems so strange to me that anybody who has eyes can be perfectly miserable; there is so much to delight us whenever we look out of doors, even if things do not always please us within."
               "That's very true, if we only know where to find beauty, and how to appreciate it when it is found. But how many people are there, do you suppose, who would see any thing to admire in these bare trees, and this frozen stream? I mean how large a proportion of the people that one daily meets in society?"
               "I don't know, I'm sure. Mrs. Heman's says: 
                     
                        'There's beauty all around our paths, if but our watchful eyes
                        Can trace it midst familiar things, and through their lowly guise.'
                     
                   But that's the trouble. Too many people never think of finding beauty in a common thing; and they look so high and so far off that they can never find it anywhere. They look over it."
               "What are you talking about, girls?" said Mr. Thompson, turning his fine, beaming, fatherly face towards the back-seat.
               "You chatter like two blackbirds."
               "Trying to prove that the stump of an old tree, and Beaver Creek, when it's frozen over, are two of the most beautiful things in the world, father. Mary's been quoting poetry."
               "You shall have a chance to quote something else soon. We are almost at the village. What store shall I leave you at? I've got some running about to do, and, meanwhile, you girls can do your trading."
               "At Johnson's. They keep the best assortment of goods there."
               In a very short time, Mary and Amy were deep in the mysteries of shawls, calico, and dress goods of various descriptions.
               "There," said Mary, "these three shawls are all of the same price, size, and quality. Which would you take—the red and green, the crimson with the blue border, or the blue and stone-color?"
               "Don't take the red and green one, it's too common. I like the crimson best."
               "So do I. But the stone-color will be most durable, and more suitable to wear in all sorts of weather. I think I had better take that."
               Amy pleaded strongly for the crimson, but unsuccessfully. Mary clung to her first choice; and made the rest of her purchases.
               
               "Oh dear!" said she, replacing exactly half a dollar in her purse after paying for the goods; "I can't get Tommy's geography this time. He will have to wait a little longer."
               "No, he needn't," said Amy. "Father will let you have more money, or get the books himself, just which you choose."
               "I know he will; but I don't want to have him. Any thing but running in debt!"
               "But this is so little, Mary. It won't be more than a dollar."
               "A dollar is a good deal for me, now-a-days, Amy," said Mary, seriously, and the subject was dropped.
               It was almost dark when Mr. Thompson returned to the store; the girls had begun to grow impatient.
               "Why, father, how long you have been gone!" exclaimed Amy.
               "Well, child, I had to chase all over the village before I could find the men I wanted to see. But now we'll be off in a trice. What, all these bundles? You've been doing a pretty heavy business. Jump in, girls—I can't leave these horses' heads; they have been standing in the cold until they are as skittish as need be."
               Before they had time to "jump in," however, the spruce young clerk was bowing and scraping by the side of the wagon, begging permission to assist them, and they were soon seated; Mr. Thompson sprang to his own seat, and the impatient horses darted forward, with the speed of the wind.
               For the first mile Mr. Thompson had neither eye nor ear for any thing save his fiery steeds; but when their ardor was beginning to abate he slackened the reins, and glanced at Mary.
               "What do you suppose I've got in my pocket for you?" he asked.
               "I am sure I can't tell, sir. Some sugar-plums?"
               "Something better than that, I reckon," and after some unsuccessful search in the wrong pocket, and a good deal of difficulty in extricating it from the right one, he threw a letter into her lap.
               She seized it with a joyful exclamation.
               "It's from John, I know. Oh! it is so dark I can't see to read it. I can hardly make out the direction. Well I must wait until I get home."
               "Let me see it," said Amy. "Why there's something in it, Mary, certainly. I can feel it plainly—no, not very plainly; but there is a little fold of something."
               "So there is; but it isn't best to open it now. We'll be home before a great while."
               With the precious letter in her hand, Amy's merry chattering in her ear, and the half-flying horses, the ride home was a very short one.
               Tea was waiting for them; and after hastily throwing off their things, they warmed themselves for a few minutes by the bright fire, and then turned to the table, in obedience to a summons from Mrs. Thompson.
               "Come, girls, a cup of hot tea will rest you and warm you both. And here's some excellent toast for you, too."
               "Bring your letter to the table with you, Mary," said Amy. "I know you are in such a hurry to read it, that you feel as if you couldn't wait."
               Mary had written to her cousin very soon after she left her aunt's, and had been expecting an answer for some time. She gladly obeyed Amy's playful command, and the toast and tea had time to cool before she had finished the second perusal, and was ready to attend to them. It was a cheerful, affectionate letter. John manifested little or no surprise at hearing that she was not at his father's; and Mary imagined that, although he did not say so, he thought it was all for the best.
               "I have written to father twice, Mary," he wrote, "but he will not, or at least does not, answer my letters. Do you see him often? and how is he? I like my present business, and am happy and contented here, far more so than I was on the farm. I am doing well, also. My salary has been raised, and Mr. Stanley has more than intimated to me, that in a year or two he will be glad to take me into partnership with him. Yet still I know that father is growing old; and I often think he must miss me, and long to have me at home, even if he is too proud to own it. And now that you and Tommy are gone, the old house must be lonely enough. If father and mother would only feel that money is not the only thing in this world worth living for; if they would only remember that the mind and the heart have their needs as well as the body, what a happy family we might be—all together in the old homestead once more! I shall never love any other spot quite as well as Farmingdale, after all."
               
               There were kindly inquiries after Mary's own welfare, fervent wishes for her happiness, earnest entreaties that she would not fail to acquaint him with her plans and prospects, and that she would never hesitate to apply to him for assistance if it should be needed. Tommy was by no means forgotten. There was a long message for him, and a five-dollar bill for a Christmas present. Poor Tommy! if it had been a thousand instead of five, he could have felt no richer. He turned it over and over, and wondered why it was worth more than any other scrap of paper, and how it could be transformed into silver dollars.
               "What are you going to buy with your money, Tommy?" asked Amy.
               Tommy glanced at Mary.
               "What should you buy with it, if it was yours?" he asked.
               "That isn't the question," replied Mary, smiling. "Amy asked you what you would do with it."
               "But it's part yours, I know," said Tommy, leaning on her lap, and looking up in her face. "John didn't mean to send me so much money all for myself. He meant you should have part of it."
               "I rather guess Tommy is right," said Mr. Thompson, laughing. "If you should appropriate half of it, Mary, I don't believe you would have any more than your share."
               Mary colored, not so much at the words, as at the quizzical look that accompanied them.
               "No, it is all yours, Tommy, every cent of it," she replied; "and you can spend it any way you choose. Still, if I were you, I would in the first place get some new books—books that you ought to be studying."
               Tommy willingly assented to that proposition, and the next time Mr. Thompson went to the village he was commissioned to purchase them. But still the purse was not empty.
               One morning, three or four weeks from that time, Amy's shuttle moved rather languidly.
               "What's the matter, Amy?" asked Mary; "are you sick or lazy? Seems to me your work doesn't amount to much this forenoon."
               "I'm not sick, and I don't believe I'm lazy—I'm tired of weaving. Let's go somewhere this afternoon, Mary. Wouldn't you like to?"
               "Where shall we go?"
               "I don't much care. Oh! to Mr. Vaun's. I have been wanting to go there this good while. What do you say, mother?"
               "I've no objections, dear. You have been weaving pretty steadily for these last few days, and a little change will do you both good."
               "Well, then, we'll go. I'm glad your new dress is done, Mary, and Tommy's suit too. He must go with us."
               There was plenty of snow now; but with thick socks drawn over their shoes, and warm hoods and shawls, they did not mind it. Tommy's new clothes fitted charmingly; and good Mrs. Thompson looked very proudly upon her protégé, as she turned him round and round before they started, giving the roundabout a pull here, and a pull there, and settling the collar more to her satisfaction. The overcoat was not yet finished. With a warm cap, tippet, and mittens, however, it was scarcely needed.
               "You must walk fast enough to keep warm, children," said Mrs. Thompson. "I'll send for you this evening." And off they went.
               A warm fire, and a warm welcome also, awaited them at the end of their walk. Alice turned her sightless eyes towards them with a glad smile as they entered. Ralph, who had not yet outgrown his early attachment to Mary, climbed upon her knee and clasped his fat, chubby arms about her neck; and Mrs. Vaun, less radiant, less beautiful, perhaps, than of yore, but even more lovely, now that the light of her eye was softly shaded, and her smile more seriously sweet, greeted them with a cordiality that at once assured them they were no unwelcome guests.
               "I think Alice seems happier than she did," Mary remarked to Mrs. Vaun, as they happened to be alone in the nursery; "she looks much more cheerful than at first."
               "Yes," was the reply, "she is happier. Her health is better, and she is less helpless. She can go from the library to the parlor, nursery, and kitchen alone; and she is losing the feeling that for a while seemed to distress her greatly, that she was a burden and a care to every one around her. Oh, you don't know what a trial it has been to us all, Mary," she continued; "I have shed tears over Alice far more bitter than any that have fallen over Ellen's grave. She was so restless and unhappy at first, I sometimes feared that the struggle between hope and fear would wear her out, and that we should lose her also. But now she is giving up entirely the expectation of any relief; the doctors have pronounced her case hopeless, and she is becoming reconciled to the idea of blindness."
               "It must be a difficult matter," said Mary, shaking her head sadly.
               "It is. It is no easy task to submit unmurmuringly to such a dispensation. We were so proud of Alice—she was so beautiful, so good—and we thought we could perceive in her so many indications of unusual talent. But now it is all over."
               "All over, Mrs. Vaun!"
               "No, no; I did not mean to say that, Mary!" exclaimed the stricken mother; "she is still beautiful, still good; yet oh, this is such a sad awakening from all the bright dreams in which we had been indulging. But if I can only see her happy again, the rest will seem nothing."
               "Don't think me weak, Mary," resumed Mrs. Vaun, after a short pause, while her tears flowed faster and faster. "I seldom yield to my feelings in this way. I put such a restraint upon myself when with Alice, I make such an effort never to speak despondingly, and to show her constantly the brightest side of the picture, that sometimes when I am alone a revulsion will follow. I cannot help it, try as I may."
               "Do not try to help it, dear Mrs. Vaun. He who sends trials upon us never meant that we should not feel them."
               "Yes, but I fear I do not feel them in the right way. It is so hard for me to bow my head, and say from the depths of my heart, 'It is best and right!' Still, I do try to say it, I do try to be reconciled to God's dealings with me and mine, whatever they may be."
               "You can do no more. There will be nothing more required of you," said Mary, timidly, yet earnestly. "Our heavenly Father does not demand impossibilities."
               After a little more conversation they returned to the library.
               "Do you play any now-a-days, Alice?" asked Mary, glancing at the open piano.
               "Yes, a good deal. Isn't it a fine thing that I knew something about music before I was blind? Mother says I could have learned, but it would have been harder."
               Groping her way to the instrument, she sat down; and as her small fingers glided over the keys, a low, sweet strain of music filled the room.
               "Sing, Alice," said Amy. "I haven't heard you since you were sick."
               The child obeyed; and as her clear, bird-like voice rose, tremblingly at first, but growing stronger as she proceeded, Mary turned her eyes towards Mrs. Vaun.
               "Is all over?" she whispered.
               A smothered, yet joyful sob was the only answer.
               Mr. Vaun joined them at the tea-table, and did not go out again.
               "A visit from either Amy or yourself, Mary," he said, laughingly, as he threw himself on the sofa, "is such a rare occurrence this season, that it should be well improved, and I believe I shall leave out-of-door matters to the men. Are those looms busy yet?"
               "They were this forenoon. They are resting just at present, as well as their———what shall I say? employers?"
               "That word will answer, in default of a better. What are you going to do next summer, Mary? have you formed any definite plans?"
               "Hardly as yet. I should like to take a school, sir, if my friends think me capable of managing one."
               "You might possibly have some little difficulties at first; most young teachers do; but I apprehend nothing very serious. It would be a very good plan. Where would you prefer teaching, if you could have your choice?"
               "In this neighborhood, sir. Who is the committee?"
               "Mr. Huntington. But why would you rather teach here than elsewhere?"
               "One reason is, that I don't know how I should manage about Tommy. Another, that I dread going among strangers, and feel as if I would be more likely to succeed here, where I am known."
               "That last reason is not a very good one, Mary. You would be more likely to be unsuccessful down here in our little red school-house, where you have yourself been a pupil, than in any other place. Still, it would be pleasant for you on many accounts, and if you want the situation, you had better make your application soon."
               
               Mary hesitated, and colored a little.
               "Teachers have to pass an examination, do they not, sir? Is it a very severe one? I don't know any thing about it."
               Mr. Vaun smiled.
               "Not very formidable affairs, I believe, these examinations, as they are generally conducted. Still it may be well for you to hunt up your school-books, and refresh your memory a little. You will be better satisfied with yourself, at all events, whether the 'committee' is or not."
               "What are they examined in, sir?"
               "What branches? Geography, arithmetic, and grammar, principally. Reading and spelling come in for a share also, I believe. I don't know much about the matter, though, I must confess," he continued, laughing, "having never had the honor of being school committee, and never having taught either."
               "I don't know how I shall like it," said Mary, with a half-sigh. "When I was a little girl, I used to think it would be just the finest thing in the world to teach school. But, somehow, things don't always show me the same face that they did then. Alice, dear, what are you thinking of?" and the conversation branched off upon other subjects.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           How now, Cordelia? Mind your speech a little,
                           Lest it may mar your fortunes.
                        
                     
                     —KING LEAR.
                  
               
               "I DO hope I shall be able to get this school," said Mary, on their way home that night. "I should have to board round, I suppose, but I could find a good steady home for Tommy. Your mother would keep him, I almost know; and he could see me every day at school. I don't believe I should have any trouble. There are only three or four scholars in school now who went when I did."
               "Oh, you would get along well enough—I'll risk it," said Amy; "and of course there'll be no trouble about getting the school, if you only speak to Mr. Huntington in good season."
               "I wish Mr. Huntington wasn't the committee," said Mary, after a few moments' thought.
               "Why?"
               "Oh, because!"
               "Because what? What are you thinking of, Mary?"
               "Why, I just happened to remember that aunt Betsy and Mrs. Huntington are great friends."
               "Nonsense! What will that have to do with your having the school? It won't make a bit of difference."
               Mary did not dispute the point, and shortly after they were at home.
               It stormed all the next week; snow, rain, hail, and sleet alternately claimed the supremacy, and going very far from the house was not to be thought of. For many days the weaving went on uninterruptedly, and the evenings passed pleasantly in study and reading. But the school was not forgotten, and on the first bright day Mary went to see Mr. Huntington.
               Mary had many and warm friends in Farmingdale; yet there were also many who had heard only Mrs. Graham's version of their difficulties. Of course, these last considered her a monster of ingratitude. Her aunt said but little on the subject, but that little was always said with an air of injured innocence, and never failed to convey to the uninitiated an impression that Mary had left entirely of her own accord—that she was self-willed, ungrateful, and obstinate.
               "I am afraid she will live to see the day when she'll wish she'd stayed, and tried to behave, and make herself useful," Mrs. Graham would say, with a most sanctimonious face; "but of course I don't wish her any harm."
               Mrs. Huntington belonged to this last-named class. On the day after Mary's application had been made, she threw on hood and shawl, and ran up to tell Mrs. Graham the news.
               "Mary has applied for the summer school," said she, almost before she had entered the house.
               "Mary who?"
               "Mary Lester."
               In her astonishment Mrs. Graham dropped her knitting-work; and a kitten that was playing on the hearth, dragged it under the table unobserved, and soon made terrible havoc among the stitches.
               "Mary Lester! you don't say so!"
               
               "Yes, I do. She was down yesterday to see about it."
               "Such impudence!" exclaimed Mrs. Graham, lifting both hands.
               "Impudence, indeed, when she knew that I was such a friend of yours! I never expected she'd darken my doors again." (Mrs. Huntington forgot to say how warmly she had urged Mary to stay to tea.)
               "I shouldn't ha' thought she'd ever have wanted to show her face there. What's going to be done about it?"
               "I don't know. I haven't said a word to Mr. Huntington; hain't asked him whether he was a-going to let her have it or not. I thought I'd come and tell you the story first. You wouldn't like to have her get the school, would you?"
               "Well, I don't much think I should," said Mrs. Graham, angrily. "I hain't got no children to send, to be sure, but we have to pay school tax, for all that. Still, it's none o' my business. Mr. Huntington can do just as he has a mind to;" and she pursed up her lips, and looked round in search of her knitting.
               "Oh! but Mr. Huntington won't want to hire her, if it's agin your wishes. I should think she'd keep a pretty good school, though. Folks say she has good learning."
               "She knows enough," said Mrs. Graham, "but—"
               "I tell you what," she resumed the next moment, laying her hand impressively on Mrs. Huntington's arm, "it's nothing to me as long as I hain't anybody to send, and Mr. Huntington must do just as he has a mind to—just exactly. It's none o' my business, any way; only, as I said, we have to pay school tax. But if I had any children to send, I should want to be pretty sure that there were not any trees nor large sticks anywhere near the school house—that's all. She's got such a temper, Mrs. Huntington! You don't know any thing about it. And to think of all I've borne from her!" and Mrs. Graham wiped away something that really bore some little resemblance to a tear. It was the child of passion, however, not of grief.
               Mrs. Huntington had a half a dozen children, all of whom were upon the school-list. When she went home that afternoon, Mary's chance of obtaining the situation she desired, was a very narrow one.
               Part of Mrs. Graham's displeasure vented itself upon the kitten, when its mistress finally discovered the knitting-work, terribly raveled and tangled, beneath the table; but there was still a plenty left to find expression in words, or rather mutterings, like these:
               "Teaching our school!—the conceited little minx! to fly off on a tangent as she did, and never come back! She never believed I meant to have her go—not she. She only wanted to get where she could have her own way. But she'll not have it this time! I am not a-going to stand over my wash-tub and butter-bowl, and see her a-training by every day with a parasol and a dinner-basket—not I! And Tommy, too! They've got him wonderfully fixed up. I s'pose Mrs. Thompson thinks she's shamed me awfully!"
               "Are you going to hire Mary Lester to keep our school?" asked Mrs. Huntington, when her husband came in from work that night.
               "Well, I rather guess I shall. She seems to be a likely sort of a girl, and she's got herself and that little brother o' hern to take care of. I wonder what is the reason she didn't stay to her uncle Graham's!"
               Mrs. Huntington repeated what she had heard that afternoon of her temper, and said she should really be afraid to send the children to her.
               "That's all nonsense, wife!" was the reply. "You know very well that Betsy Graham is enough to provoke a saint, sometimes; and if the child did use to get into a passion once in a while, as her aunt says, I don't know as it's any wonder. Did you ever hear of her having such a dreadful temper until after she went away?"
               "No," said Mrs. Huntington, rather faintly.
               "Well, I don't believe a word of it. She don't look as if she could hurt a fly. It ain't any more than right that she should have the place if she wants it."
               "But, Bill, it'll make a fuss in the neighborhood, just as true as you're alive. The Grahams will be dreadful mad, and there'll be a good many folks on their side. If you want to represent the town next winter, you'd better not get into a quarrel with 'em."
               Mr. Huntington looked thoughtfully in the fire. He was a kind-hearted man, and his sympathies were somewhat enlisted on Mary's side. But his wife had touched the right chord. To be "town representative" had long been the height of his ambition, and there was now a prospect that that height might be reached the ensuing fall. And he was well aware that a "fuss" in the school district would make a vast difference when the votes were counted.
               "I told her she might come here some day next week to be examined, and that we could talk about her wages then. Still I did not engage her," he said, as if to himself.
               "And you'd better not, if you want to go to Montpelier. She can find places enough to teach, if she tries; and it'll certainly bring us into a muss with the Grahams, if you hire her."
               "Well, well, wife. Don't say any more about it. I shall do just as I think best. If I can't find anybody that I think will answer as well or better, I shall take her. I must do my duty by the district," he added, with a lofty air, "whether it is for my own interest or not."
               Mrs. Huntington was somewhat awed by the official dignity of her husband, and muttering that she "didn't think it was his duty to set the district by the ears," she went to bed.
               Every moment that Mary could spare from her weaving during that week and the next, was devoted to a review of her studies previous to examination.
               "Aren't you taking a great deal of unnecessary pains, Mary?" asked Amy one evening. "If you don't know already quite as much as Mr. Huntington does about grammar, and arithmetic, and geography, I'm very much mistaken."
               Mary looked up from her book with a smile.
               "Perhaps you are right, and perhaps you are wrong. At all events, what I learn will do me no harm; and, as Mr. Vaun said, I shall feel better satisfied myself."
               "When are you going to be examined?"
               "On Saturday, if it doesn't storm."
               It did not, and after dinner Mary started off. Amy would have gone with her, but she was needed at home.
               "There, I see Mary; she's just come round the turn," said Tommy, who stood by the window watching for her. It was near sun-down.
               Amy sprang up, and threw aside her work.
               "Get your cap, Tommy, and we'll run and meet her." And seizing her own hood and shawl, she put them on out of doors, and bounded down the road. Mary was walking very slowly, and did not quicken her pace as she saw Amy coming.
               When within speaking distance, the latter dropped a very low courtesy.
               "Good-evening, Miss School-teacher. Really, you are uncommonly dignified!" and a clear, musical laugh rang out on the wintry air. "Practising, aren't you?"
               There was no reply: but as Mary's spirits were seldom very exuberant, and rarely overflowed like her own, Amy thought nothing of it, especially when she saw that one ungloved hand was extended to meet the warm clasp of hers. She took it, and drew it within her arm.
               For a little while they walked on in silence—Tommy, meanwhile, possessing himself of his sister's other hand.
               "Put up your veil, Mary. Are you tired? What makes you so quiet?" and by a sudden movement, Amy lifted the thick green veil that had hitherto effectually screened her friend's face. One glance was sufficient. She dropped it again immediately.
               "Why, Mary dear, what is the matter? Tears! I did not expect to see them to-night."
               "I am very foolish, Amy, I know: but I can't help it, I am so disappointed!" said Mary with a strong effort at self-control.
               "Disappointed! Not about the school?"
               "Yes."
               Amy sat down on a hard snow-bank by the side of the road, and tried, but unsuccessfully, to draw Mary to a seat beside her.
               "I believe you are only joking! If you aren't, it's shameful! Are you really in earnest?"
               "Yes, in sober earnest."
               "What was the trouble? what does Mr. Huntington say?"
               "Come along, and I'll tell you," said Mary, who was never so absorbed in her own affairs as to forget the interests of others: "you'll take cold sitting there. He said—I'm ashamed to tell you, Amy!"—and she clasped her hands over her face, while tears again trickled through her fingers.
               Presently she went on—
               "He said I didn't pass a good examination, and he didn't think me capable of teaching the school!"
               The blood rushed to Amy's face.
               
               "Oh, nonsense! That is too ridiculous!" she exclaimed, in a voice that seemed strangely puzzled to know whether to wind up with a laugh or a cry. "I wonder who he thinks will believe that?"
               They were just at the door, and Mary made no reply. Mrs. Thompson probably observed the traces of tears upon her cheeks, and the more than ordinary quietness of her manner: for, although she smilingly bade her welcome, she asked no questions.
               But Amy took occasion before they came to the tea-table to acquaint both her father and mother with the true state of the case.
               "This is a queer piece of business, Mary," said Mr. Thompson, as he passed his cup to be filled for the third time. "I don't know what to make of it: but I do know that you are as well fitted for the place as any teacher we have had for several years—and better than most of them. Suppose we ride up and see what Mr. Vaun has to say. Wouldn't you like to?"
               Mary hesitated for a moment. In her innocent little heart, she had not even dreamed that the verdict might be an unrighteous one, and she had been quite as much mortified by the failure of her examination, as grieved at the loss of the school. She had felt, at first, as if she could not bear to have her friends hear of the matter.
               "I must stick to my spinning and weaving," she had said to herself on her way home. "I suppose I was silly to hope for any thing higher."
               But while sipping her tea, she had had time to think of the affair rather more calmly, and to reproach herself for being so easily disheartened. Memory was doing its work, also, and she was beginning to feel that she had been unjustly dealt with. Yet the subject was a sore one still.
               "I don't know what Mr. Vaun will say to me," she said finally, half laughing. "He didn't seem to think these examinations were much to be dreaded, but—Well, perhaps we had better go, sir," she added, turning to Mr. Thompson, who immediately took his cap and went out to "harness up."
               As he had expected, Mr. Vaun was very much surprised when he learned their errand, and looked at Mary rather curiously.
               "How is this, Mary?" he said; "I don't understand it. Our friend Huntington is the last person I should have selected to prove you incompetent to teach a district school."
               Mary laughed, but with an embarrassed air.
               "I can't tell you much about it, sir. I had no idea that I had failed, when he laid his books one side."
               "Did you miss any of the questions he asked you?"
               "Only two in geography, sir, none in grammar, and one in arithmetic."
               "What were the two in geography?"
               "One was concerning the rise and direction of some river, with an unpronounceable name, in Beloochistan. The other was about the boundaries of one of the petty German provinces," said Mary, smiling in spite of herself at Mr. Thompson's astonished look.
               "And what was the question in arithmetic?"
               "I cannot remember exactly now, sir. I could have answered it easily enough, if he would have allowed me to use my slate. But there were so many figures, that I could not carry them out in my head."
               Mr. Vaun sat with his eyes fixed on the carpet for some time. Then he looked up suddenly.
               "Mary, are you willing to be examined again? I should like to try my hand at it," he continued, laughingly. "Perhaps I shall be 'school committee' some day or other."
               Mary blushingly consented, greatly to the amusement of Mr. Thompson, Amy, and Alice. The latter came round the table, and placed her hand in that of Mary.
               "I don't believe father will ask you any very hard questions," she whispered; "he won't, if you don't want to have him."
               Alice was mistaken. Mr. Vaun commenced the business playfully, and in such a manner as to make her feel perfectly at ease; but before he ended it, he examined her very thoroughly in all the branches taught at that time in our common schools.
               "There, Mary," he exclaimed, triumphantly, as she finished parsing the last hard sentence, "I have satisfied myself, and that is all I designed to do. You are perfectly competent to teach any district school in the State, as far as knowledge of the branches you would be expected to understand is concerned cerned. Of course you need experience and age; but those you will gain every day."
               "Didn't I tell you so, Mary? didn't I tell you so?" cried Amy, clapping her hands.
               Mrs. Vaun evinced her sympathy and pleasure by an affectionate kiss; Alice drew still closer to her side; and Mr. Thompson brought his broad hand down upon her shoulder with a force that would have made her wince, if she had not too well appreciated the kindly impulse that led to the action.
               "Well done, Mary!" he said; "I guess you have answered some questions this evening that would have puzzled Bill Huntington's brain. I am just as much pleased as I should be if you were my own daughter."
               As for our Mary herself, she said little; but her grateful, loving eyes, as they glanced from one to another, spoke volumes.
               "Well, this is all very pleasant," said Mr. Thompson, after the little excitement occasioned by Mr. Vaun's words had subsided; "but folks can't live on compliments, and I take it Mary wants something more substantial. What's going to be done?"
               Mr. Vaun paused a moment, and then addressed himself to Mary.
               "I presume that I could obtain this school for you, Mary," he said, "if I should speak to Mr. Huntington about it, for I think I have some influence with him; but I would rather not. After what has occurred, I would rather you would teach somewhere else. There is evidently a motive for all this, and there are probably some in the district who are opposed to your having the school. They might render it difficult for you to give satisfaction, especially as you are a novice; and my advice to you is, to drop the matter here."
               "Very well, sir," was the reply; "I am willing to do as you think best."
               But there was a tone of sadness in the speaker's voice, of which she was herself entirely unconscious.
               Mrs. Vaun noticed it immediately.
               "There are plenty more schools, Mary," she said.
               "Yes," said Mary, with a smile, "but there are plenty more teachers too."
               "Oh, there's no trouble on that score," remarked Mr. Vaun. "Do you know where the Hemlock school-house is?"
               "In the Fitch neighborhood?"
               "Yes."
               "I believe I do."
               "Well, it is the best district in the whole town, and they generally have about the best school. For the last year, at least, I know it has been under excellent management. They give higher wages, too, than have ever been given here, and, on the whole, I think it is just the place for you. I am going out there next week. Shall I speak a good word for you?"
               "If you please, sir. I'm sure I don't know what people do who haven't such kind friends," said Mary, gratefully.
               "And I hope you'll never learn," said Mr. Thompson. "There! the clock is striking ten; girls, we must be off. Mother will wonder what has become of us."
               Mr. Vaun's mission was entirely successful. The "committee" was a friend of his, and he engaged Mary immediately upon his recommendation. The school was to commence the first of April, and continue five months.
               It was now February, and with redoubled diligence Mary applied herself to her various duties. There were new school-dresses to be made for her own wear, and summer clothes for Tommy, besides a good deal of work that she wanted to do for Mrs. Thompson before she left. The latter insisted upon keeping Tommy, and when Mary spoke of his board, she said, lightly,
               "Tut, tut, child! I shall never be any the poorer for the bit the boy'll eat. He does chores enough to nearly pay his own way now. And I think he had better go to school when you are not here to attend to his lessons. It's a pretty long walk, but he can carry his dinner, just as Amy used to."
               Many were the long talks that Mary held with Tommy during these two months. It was their first separation for which she was preparing, and she felt it deeply. And so did he. For hour after hour he would sit by her side watching her as she plied her needle; or bent over her loom.
               "I shall be very lonesome when you're gone, Mary," he said one night, "very lonesome. I wish I was going too."
               "So do I, Tommy dear, but it would cost me so much to pay your board there. I shouldn't have hardly any thing left to buy your clothes with, and your books. You will be wanting ing books all the time now, dear. I hope you'll study very hard this summer."
               "I'm going to try to. I told Mrs. Thompson I would. Oh, Mary, I wish I was big enough to work!"
               "Why, dear? You do work a good deal for a little boy."
               "Oh, but I mean to work like a man, and earn money. Earn money for you, Mary, so that you wouldn't have to spin and weave, and do all these things. But it'll be a great while before I can do that!" he added, with a sigh.
               "Not such a very great while, dear; and you help me a great deal now."
               "How? I don't hardly ever do any thing for you."
               "Yes, Tommy, you do a great deal for me when you try to improve, and to learn your lessons well, and to be polite and obliging."
               "Oh, I know that; but I want to help you really."
               "Well, you can do that by trying not to make Mrs. Thompson any trouble. She won't let me pay her for your board, and you must try to pay her yourself. You must always be ready to run quick and wait on her, and never stay to be told twice."
               "I never do. I always go the very first time."
               "Not always, Tommy. The other day when you were reading, and I called you to bring me some chips, I had to speak twice, certainly, and then you laid your book down very slowly."
               "Why, Mary, I was reading the story of Little Fido in 'Evenings at Home,' and I only waited just long enough to find out what he did to make his master love him—that's all," said Tommy, very earnestly.
               "But that was waiting just so much too long, dear. You should have gone immediately, and then have finished the story when you came in. Wouldn't that have been the best way?"
               "Yes, I suppose so; but I did want to read about Fido—just that one page. Mary, won't you come back here pretty often?"
               "As often as I can. Every other Saturday there will be no school, and Mr. Thompson says he has business out that way once in a while, and that I can come home with him. I want to come often enough to keep your clothes mended and fixed, so that Mrs. Thompson won't be troubled with them."
               The days flew. The weaving was completed—coverlets and all—to Mrs. Thompson's entire satisfaction, and the looms removed from the kitchen. Mary then plied her needle still more indefatigably. She knew that there was cloth in the house to be made into shirts for Mr. Thompson, and she wanted very much to gain time to make them before she went. Amy tried to dissuade her.
               "You've got sewing enough to do for yourself and Tommy, Mary. Do let those shirts alone. I shall have them done in the course of the summer."
               Mary smiled a very bright smile, but worked on as diligently as ever.

                     —SCHILLER.
                  
               
               APRIL came, and with it came leave-taking and new duties for Mary. The shirts were completed, all but the buttonholes of the last pair, very much to her own satisfaction, and, if one might judge from the pleased smile with which she examined them, very much to Mrs. Thompson's, also. Tommy's pantaloons and aprons were all in order, and neatly arranged on a shelf of the closet in his little bedroom. There was also a nice brown linen "roundabout" for extra occasions, and a broad black riband to tie under his collar.
               "Now, Tommy, you must take good care of your things, and not have them scattered all over the house, in Mrs. Thompson's way," said Mary, on the evening before her departure, as she was showing him where she had placed each neatly folded article. "And here is a new hair-brush and comb, that I bought for you the last time I was at the village. Be sure you use them often enough. I sha'n't be here to say, 'Tommy, it's school-time; go brush your hair, and get ready!' You must remember it yourself."
               
               "I sha'n't forget," said Tommy.
               "And don't you suppose you can learn to make your own bed? You used to make it sometimes at aunt Betsy's."
               "Yes, I can make it, but I don't like to."
               "Why not?"
               "It's girls' work."
               "Yes, so it is; and I shouldn't ever want you to make it if I were going to be here. But if you don't do it, Mrs. Thompson or Amy will; and they have enough other work. You mustn't be ashamed to do any thing that is useful and necessary, Tommy, or any thing that will save making trouble for other people; particularly those who are so very kind to you."
               "Oh! I didn't think of that. I'll make it every morning, Mary, before I go to school. I can spread the clothes on just as straight! I've seen you do it so many times."
               "That's right, dear. 'Whatever is worth doing at all, is worth doing well.' And here's your Testament, right in this corner, and your other books."
               "Are your things all ready, Mary? You've been sewing for Mrs. Thompson or me nearly all the time."
               "No; but I shall have some time nights and mornings, and if I don't finish my dresses before I need them, I must get up a little earlier, and work the harder."
               The next morning Mr. Thompson carried her to the scene of her summer labors.
               "I guess I shall be along this way a week from Saturday," he said, as he left her, "and you'd better be ready to go home with me. Tommy will be wanting to see you by that time, to say nothing of Amy and the old woman."
               How tired she was that night! how her head throbbed and her cheeks burned as she turned the key of the school-house, and bent her steps towards her temporary home. She was to board at the house of the "committee" for the first week or two. Indeed, that was to be her head-quarters for the summer; there she was to keep her trunk, and spend her Sundays, when she did not go home—for so she called Mr. Thompson's. Wherever Tommy was, there was her home.
               How tired she was! but it was the fatigue of excitement far more than that of actual labor. Diffident and retiring as she naturally was, it was a very great trial to find that many of her scholars were nearly as old as herself. She thought she could never summon resolution sufficient to enable her to discharge fearlessly and firmly the duties devolving upon her. The hum of voices, the ceaseless calls upon her time and attention, the necessity that was laid upon her of thinking of a dozen different things at one and the same moment, bewildered and distressed her; and when she reached her boarding-place that night, it was with a strong inclination to throw herself upon the first lounge, or into the first rocking-chair, she came across, and have "a real, good cry." But that would not answer for the school-mistress—certainly not, when three or four little heads were shyly peeping in at the sitting-room door, and then darting away again. So Mary went up stairs to the room that had been assigned her, to refresh herself with a bath, a change of dress, and the luxury of a few moments' quiet communion with her own heart.
               "This will never do, Mary," she said to herself, as she took the comb from her hair, and the heavy braids fell upon her shoulders. "You mustn't be so childish. You must learn to speak without blushing and trembling, and not allow little things to excite you so much. How are you ever going to live through the summer, if you don't?"
               Then her thoughts flew to Tommy, and she wondered if he missed her, and what would become of them if she should not be successful in teaching, or if her health should fail; and then—unruly spirits that they were—they rushed back to the schoolroom again, and to her stranger pupils, varying in age from four up to sixteen, and she wondered if she should ever become familiar with them, and ever be able to reduce to order and systematic arrangement the chaotic mass that had been swaying before her eyes all day. It seemed impossible; and finally dropping the brush, and leaning her head upon the toilet-table, her over-charged heart found relief in a violent burst of tears.
               For some minutes they flowed freely, and she vainly strove to check them. It was well she could not. When she at length raised her head, bathed her face and eyes, and took up the brush again—the weight, the pressure was lifted from heart and brain, and the thick clouds were dispersing. She completed her toilet; and sitting down by the open window, took up her little Bible. "Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid," were the first words that met her eye. They seemed silently to rebuke her for want of faith in the protecting care of Him, who in his own infinite mercy and wisdom had placed her exactly where she was. Why, then, if she only tried to do her duty, to do His will, need she fear the result?
               In half an hour she was summoned to tea, and went down stairs with an equanimity that was not overthrown even when she overheard her hostess remark to her husband, that the "new school-ma'am didn't seem to be much more'n a child herself, and she was afraid she wouldn't have very good government."
               But the good lady was most agreeably disappointed. Before many days had passed, Mary was not only mistress of herself, but of her school. Her air of quiet, unassuming dignity commanded the respect of her pupils, as her gentleness and the winning kindness of her manner won their love. There were a few, of course, who were disposed to be refractory and troublesome; but the reins were held by a firm though girlish hand, and they soon concluded to submit quietly. On the whole, the first fortnight passed off quite pleasantly.
               The second Saturday brought Mr. Thompson. Mary had every thing she needed to take home already packed in her little satchel, and she sat by the window watching for him when he drove up.
               "Ready and waiting, Mary?" he said, as she ran out to meet him. "That's right. No, I can't come in. Get your bonnet, and we'll be off."
               "I thought you had some business to do here, sir."
               "I've done all I had to do," he replied, with a half-smile; and Mary bounded back after her bonnet.
               That was a pleasant ride, and warm was the welcome that awaited her at the end of it. Tommy stood on the fence, watching for the first glimpse of the wagon; and as soon as it came in sight, the gate was thrown open, and he ran down the road as fast as his feet could carry him. It had been a very long fortnight to the little fellow. He had never before been separated from his sister for a longer period than twenty-four hours, and his delight at her return knew no bounds. For the first half-hour it exhibited itself in all sorts of capers: he could not keep still; but after a while his excitement abated, and he was contented to stand by her side, with one arm about her neck, and his hand clasped in hers. He had so much to tell her about his own affairs. How he had been to school every day; and how he had carried his dinner in a little tin pail; and what fine times they (that is, himself and the other boys) had had trundling their hoops; and how many times he had been to the head; and how very much surprised Amy had been when she went up stairs to make his bed the day after Mary left, and found that some one had got the start of her; and how she wouldn't hardly believe it was Tommy's work, and said that, at any rate, the witches must have helped him, for he never could have made it so neatly alone. And, more than all, he had two certificates of good behavior to show—one for each week! It would be hard to tell which was the happiest—Tommy in relating these things, or Mary in listening.
               There was no mending to be done that day, and it passed very swiftly. It was so pleasant, after her unwonted confinement, and the restraint that the presence of strangers and her new position had placed upon her words and actions, to be free again; to help Mrs. Thompson get dinner, and Amy skim the milk; to run to the barn and admire the two little calves until even Tommy was satisfied; and to be astonished at the wonderful brood of chickens, that were his especial charge and especial pride.
               Then, in the afternoon, there was a long ramble in the woods with both Amy and Tommy; and although not a single wild-flower rewarded their search, yet they found plenty of buds, a beautiful variety of mosses, and the bright green leaves and coral and scarlet berries of the partridge-plant and squaw-vine.
               "I thought we should find squirrel-cups—plenty of them—by this time," said Amy, peering round among the dried leaves.
               "So did I," replied Mary: "if there are any anywhere, we shall find them round the roots of these old trees. No, there isn't one; but there are a great many buds. They will be open in a few days, and of all colors, too—pink, blue, lilac, purple, and white—I can distinguish the different shades already. And do see how the buds are swelling on the maples and elms!"
               "There's a soft-maple in blossom now—over there, near that opening. Tommy, run and break off some of the small branches. You can reach them."
               
               Away he ran, and soon returned laden with the feathery, scarlet blossoms.
               "How are we going to carry home all these mosses and berries? Oh, I can tie them in my handkerchief. These partridge berries will keep fresh and bright for a long time." And Amy spread her handkerchief on the stump of a tree, and it was soon filled with their varied treasures.
               "I can carry the maple-blossoms—so," said Tommy, and with bright eyes and glowing cheeks the happy party turned their faces homeward.
               The next day they all went to the village to church, and early Monday morning Mary returned to her school again.
               The summer months passed rapidly. Mary was too busy, and too much interested in her daily tasks, to have any time for the indulgence of sad thoughts. "Boarding round" was at first a great annoyance. She would hardly become domesticated in one family before it was time for her to leave it, and repeat the same ceremonies in another: yet, after all, the system had its advantages. It gave her an opportunity to become more familiarly acquainted with her pupils and their friends; and if, as it occasionally happened, she found an unpleasant boarding-place, she had the comfort of thinking it was only for a season. Every two or three weeks she had an opportunity to go home, and once Tommy spent a few days with her. Very memorable days they were. For a long time he regarded that visit as an epoch in his life—every thing being dated either so long before or after "I went to see Mary."
               One Saturday, when she went home, she found Tommy in great trouble. It needed only one glance at his speaking face to satisfy her that something was the matter, and that he had been particularly anxious to see her. He followed her up stairs when she went to put away her things, and seated himself on the edge of the bed, with a very disconsolate air.
               Mary folded her shawl, and laid her bonnet away; but still he sat there, saying nothing, and leaning his cheek on his hand. She seated herself beside him, and placed his head on her shoulder.
               "Are you sick, Tommy?"
               "No, I'm not sick; but, Mary, I don't want to go to school any more. Need I? Mrs. Thompson said I must go until you came, and I had asked you. Need I?"
               "Not want to go to school, Tommy! I am surprised at you. Why don't you want to go?"
               "You wouldn't want to either, if you was me," said Tommy. "The boys all laugh at me and plague me."
               "What do they laugh at you about?" and Mary tenderly stroked back the sunny curls from his forehead.
               "Oh, for every thing. They laugh at me all the time."
               "Not quite as bad as that, I guess, Tommy. Not quite all the time."
               "Well, most all the time, then."
               "But what about? I can't keep you away unless you tell me."
               Tommy hesitated, and hung down his head.
               "Because I wear these aprons—that's one reason!"
               "Oh, Tommy, Tommy, what foolish boys they are! What's the trouble with these aprons? I think they are very nice ones."
               "They're nice enough; that ain't it. But the other boys don't wear 'em, and they plague me, and call me a girl. I wish I need not wear them, Mary. Why do I?"
               Mary, in her turn, hesitated for a moment before she answered. Foolish as the cause of his sorrow was, she yet sympathized with the childish pride in which it originated.
               "I will give one reason for your wearing them, Tommy. I had not money enough to buy as many coats as you would have needed. These aprons look very nicely, belted down in this way, and they do not cost nearly as much as coats. And besides, it isn't half as much work to make them. I made all these six aprons in less time than I was making your linen roundabout. Some of the boys in my school wear them."
               "Well, they don't here; and they make fun of me, and call me names, and plague me so, Mary, I don't want to go to school any more," and the child's lip quivered, and his eyes filled.
               "They're not worth minding, Tommy; I wouldn't be plagued by them."
               "But I can't help it. It makes me cry, and then they only laugh the harder; or else I get angry—" he paused, as if in doubt whether to proceed, but presently, gathering courage, he went on: "One day I struck Sam Huntington, Mary, and then the teacher feruled me."
               
               Dropping his head upon Mary's lap he sobbed aloud.
               How fondly Mary bent over him, and kissed his wet cheek! How she longed to bear all his sorrows and little trials for him!
               "That was very, very wrong, Tommy," she said, sadly.
               "I know it was; but wasn't it just as bad for a big boy like Sam Huntington to plague me so?" he sobbed.
               "It was very wrong for him to tease you, dear; but that does not excuse you, or make it right for you to get angry. Was that about the aprons too?"
               "No. It was one rainy day when I had to wear my overcoat. And Sam took hold of it with his two fingers—so, and held it out, and called me 'Miss Amy,' and told the boys that here was a pretty little girl who had had to borrow Amy Thompson's old cloak on account of the rain. And he whirled me about, and asked me who rolled my hair in curl papers the night before. Oh, it was too bad! it was too bad!" and the little fellow's frame shook with suppressed passion.
               "And then you struck him?" asked Mary, in a trembling voice.
               "Yes, I struck him just as hard as I possibly could. And Sam made a great fuss, and some of the boys went and told the teacher, and she feruled me. She never asked me a single question about it, Mary. She didn't even know what I struck him for, and she wouldn't let me tell her. Was that right?"
               "It would have been better if she had heard your story, perhaps," said Mary, calmly, although her blood boiled. "Sam did very wrong; but, my dear little brother, you were wrong too. What was the verse that you learned in your Testament the last Sunday I was home? Can you repeat it?"
               In a low voice Tommy commenced.
               "'But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you.'"
               "Do you know what that means, Tommy? Do you understand it?"
               "I suppose it means that I oughtn't to have struck Sam, even if he was so ugly to me. But I couldn't help it."
               "Don't say 'couldn't,' dear; say you didn't try hard enough. You can control your temper if you try, Tommy; and the sooner you learn how, the easier it will be. And there is One who will help you to overcome all these wicked thoughts and feelings if you ask Him. Who is it?"
               "God," he replied, faintly; "but I did ask Him the other day, and I don't see as it did any good. I have got angry just as much since; just exactly."
               "The Bible says we must 'watch' as well as 'pray'. What do you suppose that means?"
               "I don't know."
               "It means that we must try to do right—that we must 'watch' our thoughts and feelings, and do our best to drive away such as we know would be displeasing to our heavenly Father. And if He sees that we are trying to do His will, He will help us. Now I expect that when you were so angry with Sam you were not 'watching'—were you, Tommy?"
               "No: but, Mary, need I go to school any more?"
               "Yes, dear, I think you had better go. I cannot be here to attend to your lessons, and I don't want you to lose any time."
               "And wear these aprons?" he asked, dolefully.
               There was a long pause, during which Mary was endeavoring to determine how she should dispose of the matter. At length Tommy repeated his question.
               "Why, yes, Tommy. You've got nothing else. Besides, which do you suppose is the best judge of what is right and proper for a little boy to wear, Sam Huntington or I?"
               "You, of course. Sam Huntington don't know any thing. I do think he's the greatest—"
               "Never mind what you think of Sam, now. That isn't to the point at all. Now I think the aprons are not only pretty enough, but perfectly suitable for you to wear to school. They are cool and comfortable; and as for their being 'girlish' (which seems to be one of your greatest troubles), they are no more like a girl's apron than your linen coat is like my double gown."
               Tommy smiled a very little; the idea that he had perhaps been rather foolish about the aprons, was beginning to dawn faintly upon his mind.
               "But there's the overcoat."
               "Oh, you won't need to wear that much; only once in a great while, on a rainy day. And if the boys are foolish enough to tease you—or rather to try to tease you, for I hope you won't be foolish enough to let them succeed—you must just laugh with them, and ask them if they don't wish they had some coats just like it. If they find they cannot make you angry, they will stop trying very soon."
               "Maybe they will," said Tommy. "I hope so—but, Mary—"
               "But what, dear?"
               "Why," continued he, burying his face in Mary's lap again, "I thought you would take my part, and you don't seem to at all!"
               "Yes, I do 'take your part,' my dear Tommy," replied Mary, lifting him up and making him look her in the face; "if by that you mean thinking that the boys are very much to blame—more to blame, perhaps, than you are, because they are older. I think all that—but wouldn't I be a queer kind of a sister if I should see you in danger of burning your fingers badly and should not tell you of it?"
               "I should think you would be rather queer," said Tommy, laughing.
               "Well, if you don't learn to control your temper, it will lead you into trouble far worse than that—and ought I not to warn you?"
               "Yes, yes, you ought to; you're the best sister in the world; I'm glad you talk to me so," said he, clasping his arms about her neck, and kissing her half a dozen times. "I'd just as lief wear my aprons as not; and I will try not to get angry."
               "And to forgive Sam?" asked Mary.
               "Yes, I'll try to do that too."
               They went down stairs; and Tommy took a little basket and ran out in the garden to pick some beans for dinner.
               "Tommy has been telling you his troubles, hasn't he?" asked Mrs. Thompson. "Poor little fellow! I have been so sorry for him."
               "Yes, he has told me something of them—he thinks he has had a pretty hard time."
               "And so he has. I told him I didn't believe you'd make him go to school any more; but I did not really like to let him stay home until you knew about the scrape. I guess Amy'll get time to hear him recite once in a while."
               "Oh, I am not going to take him out of school."
               "You ain't?"
               "No, ma'am."
               "Well, now that beats me! I had no idea that you'd let him go another day. I wouldn't if he was my child."
               "From all I can gather from Tommy, Mrs. Thompson, I think it would be a very bad plan to take him out of school now."
               "Why? I think he has been abused—shamefully."
               "The boys haven't treated him well, certainly; and I don't think the teacher did just right," replied Mary, "but I don't want him to run away from difficulties. He will have a great many to encounter, probably," she continued, with tears in her eyes, "for he will have no one but me to shield him from them; and the time is coming when I can't do a great deal towards it. He has got to act for himself, and he must learn to meet trouble and conquer it, and not turn and run whenever any thing disagreeable happens to cross his path."
               "I don't know but you are right. I hadn't thought of it in that light. But must he wear the aprons?"
               "Certainly. I want him to have a good education, Mrs. Thompson; and I mean he shall have every advantage that I can possibly give him. But that will be about as much as I can manage. I shall be obliged to dress him plainly; and it is better for me to begin as I can hold out—isn't it?"
               "Yes, I suppose it is," said Mrs. Thompson, wiping her eyes. "I didn't look ahead as far as that. The aprons are good enough, only he does hate to wear them so!"
               "I know he does; but if I should let him lay them by merely because the boys laugh at him, wouldn't he be very apt to think that he might do exactly the same thing in some more important matter? or at least that he might act on precisely the same principle?"
               "You are right, I know you are, Mary, and I am glad you can be so decided. It is a hard matter sometimes. There he comes with his beans. Dear little soul! It's of no consequence how he is dressed. He is as handsome as a picture, any time."
               That afternoon Mary and Tommy were out in the orchard trying to find some early apples.
               "Tommy," said the former, "do you ever see any thing of aunt Betsy, as you go past there on your way to school?"
               "Yes, I see her pretty often. Sally Davis lives there now."
               
               "Does she ever say any thing to you?"
               "Who—Sally?"
               "No, no. Aunt Betsy."
               "Sometimes. I 'most always speak to her."
               "Does she seem pleasant? What does she say?"
               "Oh! she asks me a great many questions. She wanted to know where I got my aprons, and how much Mrs. Thompson paid you for spinning and weaving last winter, and what you had a week now for teaching school."
               "What did you tell her?"
               "I told her I didn't know. And then she asked me what Mrs. Thompson charged for my board."
               "She did!" exclaimed Mary, with a smile. "Well, how did you answer that question?"
               "I said she didn't charge any thing—not one cent. And then she seemed to be angry, and said she should think you would feel cheap—what did she mean by that, Mary?—she should think you would feel cheap to have me living on charity, and hanging on to other people after you had got me away from our own folks."
               "I had got you away! Why, she told us to go."
               "That's just what I said to her, and she turned round quick and went in the house, and slammed the door just as hard!"
               "Does uncle Graham ever say any thing to you?"
               "Yes. One day when I was coming home from school, he was sitting on the front steps, and he came down to the gate and called me. He put his hand on my head, and asked me how we got along; and then he wanted to know if you had had any letter from John lately."
               "Well, what then?"
               "I told him, yes. And he asked me if I remembered what was in it; and I said, no—only that he was well."
               "Did he say any thing more?"
               "No; he only just went back, and sat down again. He don't speak as he used to, Mary; somehow he seems different. It made me feel just as if he was sorry for something."
               Mary sighed, as she took up the pan of apples and went back to the house; but she said nothing.
               Tommy had no more trouble in school. The boys had grown tired of teasing him, and sought out other methods of amusement, and he became quite reconciled to his aprons. But the overcoat was still a bugbear. On more than one rainy day, he managed to slip away to school, unseen by Mrs. Thompson, for fear she would tell him to wear it.
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               
                  
                     
                        She is not well; but yet she has her health: she's very merry; but yet she is not well: but thanks be given, she's very well, and wants nothing i' the world; but yet she is not well!
                     
                     —ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL.
                  
               
               "WHAT are you thinking of, Ellen?" said Mr. Vaun to his wife, one evening, as they sat in the library after the children had gone to bed—the two eldest at least; a little one who had been given them in place of their lost Nelly lay in a cradle at its mother's feet—"what are you thinking of? Your eyes have been fixed on that screen for the last ten minutes."
               Mrs. Vaun started from her reverie.
               "I can hardly tell," she replied, with a faint apology for a smile; "of Alice, I believe."
               "And what of her? My dear wife, can you not become reconciled to the will of our heavenly Father in this matter? Your enduring sorrow grieves me almost as much as Alice's blindness."
               "It is not that, Edward. I am becoming reconciled. I am beginning to feel that the sun shines on, even though earth-born mists may sometimes hide him from our sight. But I have been thinking a great deal of Alice lately. I don't think she is as cheerful and happy as she was."
               "As she was when? before she was sick? You must not expect her to be as mirthful."
               "No, that is not what I mean. I do not think she is as happy as she was before Willie was born."
               "Oh, that is all nonsense, Ellen! You have not quite regained your own strength yet, and are nervous and whimsical. She seems to love the baby dearly."
               "I know she does. But, Edward, the trouble is, she is alone too much. Willie demands so much of my time and attention, that I cannot read to her as often as I used to, and she gets tired of her netting and music, and sits with her hands listlessly folded in her lap, sometimes by the hour together. Or she will stand by the window, with her forehead pressed against the pane, looking——I can't tell you how she looks, but it distresses me beyond measure."
               "Why, I have not noticed any change in her. I think you are imagining all this, or, at least, a great part of it."
               "No, I am not, Edward," said Mrs. Vaun, earnestly, and clasping her husband's arm as she spoke. "She is always glad when you come into the house, and that makes her brighten up a little; and while you are talking with her, she is herself again. So she is when I am at liberty to devote my time to her, and walk with her as I used to; but that is not often, now that I have so many other cares. I read to her an hour every day; still that is only a drop in the bucket."
               "Well, don't look so sober about it, my dear Nelly," said Mr. Vaun, as he playfully kissed her forehead. "We can manage this very easily. Alice ought not to be left alone; and if this young gentleman makes such serious claims upon your attentions, we must find some one who can take your place."
               Mrs. Vaun's countenance did not brighten very fast.
               "That is a great deal more easily said than done. Alice is very capricious in her likes and dislikes since she became blind, and the society of any one whom she does not fancy seems to annoy her exceedingly; and, moreover, I could not satisfy myself very easily. I must have entire confidence in the gentleness, prudence, and integrity of the person to whose care I commit her."
               "She would still be in your own care, my love. I do not mean that you should place her under the control of any one."
               "Influenced, however, if not controlled, she must be by any one who is with her constantly, and whose business it is to interest and amuse her," replied Mrs. Vaun; "and where are we going to find exactly the right sort of person? Refined and intelligent she must be, or Alice will have nothing to do with her; and she must have a large share of discretion and firm religious principles, or I cannot be satisfied. Where shall we find this rara avis?"
               Mr. Vaun shook his head, but did not look a whit disheartened.
               "I can't tell you, Nelly; but I have 'faith to believe' that there is one somewhere—some bird that will exactly answer our purpose."
               "I'm afraid you've no snare strong enough to catch the bird, even if it be in existence," said Mrs. Vaun, smiling; "but 'sable swans' are not very common anywhere, I believe—certainly not in Farmingdale!"
               The baby nestled uneasily, and as he was taken up, the subject was dropped.
               But not forgotten. From that time Mr. Vaun watched Alice with more observing eyes; and he, too, noticed her altered appearance. She was evidently drooping, although there was no evidence of actual disease. At times she would be restless and irritable, wandering about the rooms like an uneasy spirit; and then again she would sit for hours in a kind of stupor, looking—with her pale cheek and lustreless eye—more like a statue than a thing of life. Every moment that her mother could possibly spare from her other children was given to her; and Mr. Vaun's business often stood still while he was riding with Alice, or guiding her unsteady feet along the banks of the creek, or over the breezy hills. But with all their efforts, there were hours each day when she was alone—alone, and in darkness, with her troubled spirit, her strange, wild fancies, and uneasy thoughts. Both of her parents became exceedingly anxious to find some one with whom they would be willing to trust her at all times.
               One day, some three weeks after the conversation narrated above, Mr. Vaun came hastily into the house, and threw himself on the sofa beside his wife, with an exceedingly satisfied air.
               She looked at him inquiringly.
               "I've found the 'sable swan,' Ellen—I certainly have! You needn't look at me so incredulously. After tea, I'm going to try my snare—although I don't know but a net would be the better implement. Will you go along?"
               "Not if you are going to the ends of the earth. Where is this remarkable bird?"
               "In the Hemlock grove. It has a nest there this summer. Ellen, I am talking about Mary Lester; and it is just the strangest thing in the world that we have not thought of her before! Here we've been writing to Tom, Dick, and Harry
                   and I won't pretend to say how many besides, describing the kind of person we were in pursuit of, and using terms every one of which would apply to her almost as well as if we had been painting her portrait, and yet have overlooked her entirely."
               "Grandmother's spectacles were on her nose all the while she was hunting for them, weren't they?" was the laughing response. Mrs. Vaun's countenance had changed several times while her husband was speaking, but at length its varying expressions were all merged in one of infinite satisfaction.
               "I would rather have Mary than any other person in the world," she went on; "and I am sure I don't know why she has not occurred to me. But I am a little afraid about the snare. If she can do better by teaching, I don't know as we ought to ask her to come here. She wouldn't refuse,—but she has Tommy to think of as well as herself."
               "She cannot do better for herself or Tommy, either. I have been thinking it all over," said Mr. Vaun. "Ralph is old enough to learn to read, and to be taught a thousand things; and yet I don't want him to go to school for a good while to come. I can afford to give Mary for teaching him, and reading and studying with Alice, quite as much as she can earn in a district school; and she will be constantly learning herself. She has one of those minds that cannot come in contact with a book, without imbibing its very essence."
               "Not indiscriminately, however. Whatever she reads, is thoroughly sifted. Her mind retains only the purest and most precious particles, and rejects all that is false and worthless. But there is Tommy,—how is it about him?"
               "Oh, you 'womenfolks,' as our neighbors say, must settle that among yourselves. His board will be nothing, comparatively. He may make some trouble. I don't know enough of household matters to judge of that; but I presume Mary will be of sufficient assistance to you in your sewing, and that sort of things, to make amends for it, if he does. Of course he must come with her."
               "Certainly. I should not dream of any thing else. I was only thinking where he could sleep. You know we have not a great deal of spare room in our nut-shell. Oh, well! we can manage in some way, if Mary will only come."
               Very soon after tea was disposed of, Mr. Vaun started for the Hemlock school-house. He did not return until nine o'clock, and found his wife waiting for him. She was standing on the piazza when he drove into the yard.
               "Have you snared the bird?" she asked, as he drew near with slackened reins.
               "I'll tell you presently; as soon as I give this horse a measureful of oats. Where's Alice?"
               "In bed. She was very tired, and I thought she had better go."
               "Yes," said he, as he entered shortly after, "I have snared the bird. I had no trouble, neither did I anticipate any. I knew Mary would be glad to come; and so she is. She seems to think we are doing her a very great favor in giving her employment; but I told her we should consider that she was doing us one equally great, if she would come here and be to Alice a friend, companion, governess, or what not. What shall we call her? 'Governess' seems rather too dignified and formal a term to apply to such a gentle little sprite."
               "We'll call her 'our Mary.' She never ought to be known by any less endearing name. But when will her school close?"
               "In about a fortnight."
               "And will she come here immediately?"
               "She wants to stay at Mrs. Thompson's for a week. Then she will come here. They are very much pleased with her in the Fitch neighborhood, and stand ready to engage her for next summer immediately."
               "On the whole, I am very glad Mr. Huntington wouldn't let her have this school. She has done much better where she is."
               "Yes; she has had better wages, and a better class of scholars; and has made a new set of acquaintances, who may possibly be of service to her some day or other. I always thought Mrs. Graham was the prime mover in that affair."
               If any thing was wanting to complete their satisfaction, it was found in the bright smile that illumined Alice's face when the news was communicated to her. She was not very boisterous in her expressions of joy; but her father and mother thought the look of quiet happiness that dwelt there all day, was enough to repay them for all their anxiety.
               The remaining fortnight sped away like its predecessors, and Mary returned to Mr. Thompson's—not unwillingly. She had applied herself to her summer labors with unremitting diligence and assiduity. She needed rest, and the quiet and repose of home seemed doubly sweet after months of toil.
               Amy hardly knew whether to laugh or cry, when Mary told them of her engagement with Mrs. Vaun. She finally compromised matters by giving her half a dozen kisses, and running out of the room.
               "Am I going too?" asked Tommy.
               "Of course you are, dear. Did you think I would go and leave you here? You have bothered Mrs. Thompson quite enough already."
               Tommy stood for a moment, looking first at Mary and then at Mrs. Thompson. Then he went to the latter, and laid his head in her lap:
               "I haven't bothered you one bit, have I? I'm almost sorry we're going away!"
               "And so am I, Tommy," said Mrs. Thompson,—"almost, but not quite. I am very glad for your sake and for Mary's. It will be nearly as well for you as going to school," she continued, turning towards Mary. "Mr. Vaun has such a good library; and he will of course direct your reading with Alice."
               "He used to be very particular as to what she read, and I presume he will be equally so as to what she hears. I know it will be an excellent thing for Tommy; but, dear Mrs. Thompson, he never can find a better friend than you have been—neither can I."
               "Perhaps you may not find any friends who will be more willing to assist you, or feel more interest in your welfare, my child; but you have already found those who can give you better advantages. I am glad you are going there, Mary, real glad. It is just the spot for you."
               "I hope it will prove to be. We have been wonderfully provided for so far, Tommy," she exclaimed, while tears of gratitude moistened her soft eyes. "What do you suppose would have become of us, if we had not found such kind friends?"
               "I don't believe we should have found them, if you hadn't been so good, Mary, and made people love you," was the just response. "Wicked folks don't have a great many friends, do they?"
               "You had better not run the risk, at all events," said Mary, laughing: "but, Mrs. Thompson, I want some sewing. I am not going to Mr. Vaun's until a week from Monday."
               "Well, I shan't find you the first stitch. Can't you keep quiet one minute? I should think you would want to rest, and could afford to."
               "That's just what I am going to do. It rests me to sit here in this bright, pleasant room, and talk to you, and forget all about A B C's, and the multiplication table. How tired I used to be, sometimes, of going through with just the same round, day after day! And I used to wish I could change my name, so that the children could call me by some new title. It was 'Miss Lester' this, and 'Miss Lester' that, from morning till night! But I must have something to keep me out of mischief. Where's the work-basket?"
               "Mary, if you must work, you can find something to do for yourself or Tommy. Where are those shirts you had cut out for him?"
               "All finished, even to the last button."
               Mrs. Thompson left the room on some errand, and when she returned, she found Mary unrolling a bundle of lace and muslin.
               "What have you got there, child?"
               "I thought I could find something to do, if I hunted long enough. I am going to make these nightcaps. Are they for yourself or Amy?"
               "For me; but what an obstinate puss you are! School-keeping has spoiled you, I am afraid."
               "Perhaps I was spoiled before;" and, with a gay laugh, Mary bounded away after the pattern-basket.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXI.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Oh! never chide the wing of Time,
                           Or say 'tis tardy in its flight;
                           You'll find the days speed quick enough,
                           If you but husband them aright.
                        
                     
                     —ELIZA COOK.
                  
               
               ONE long, bright summer day—when the skies are clear, when the air is bland, soft, and balmy with the breath of flowers, and all nature smiling and serene—will follow another, its very counterpart, and we scarcely heed them as they pass. They make no deep impression upon our memory. They are forgotten ere the last faint sunbeam has faded from the distant mountains. But let there come a day of storms and darkness; let the wind howl, and the rain pour; let the pelting hail or the blinding snow make our journey difficult and hazardous even for a little while, and how long and how well we remember it! And as in the material, so is it in the spiritual world. Days and weeks of calm, quiet, almost unalloyed happiness roll on, and we seldom pause to write upon the tablets of our hearts, "blessed and enduring be the memory of these hours;" but who forgets to note each grief—to record each sorrow?
               The first year after Mary and Tommy became members of Mr. Vaun's family had nothing to mark its flight—nothing save the glow of health and happiness that gradually diffused itself over Alice's pale cheek, and the sure and steady advancement of all the younger branches of the household in knowledge and mental culture. Several hours every morning were devoted to literary pursuits. Mr. Vaun himself selected the books they read. He also procured writing apparatus for Alice, by the aid of which she could write quite legibly. And after the morning reading was ended, while she amused herself with that, or with her piano, Mary heard Tommy recite, or Ralph spell. Long walks and rambles formed a part of each day's duties; and in the evening Mr. Vaun talked with them of what they had read, explaining whatever was not perfectly clear, correcting their opinions when they had adopted those that were erroneous, and gradually leading them on from one step to another.
               One day, about twelve months after this order of things commenced, Mary found Mr. Vaun in the library alone. Stepping into the room, she closed the door behind her.
               "Are you at liberty, Mr. Vaun? May I interrupt you for a few moments?"
               "Certainly," he replied, with a smile, and dropping his book. "What have you to say to me, Mary?"
               "I want to talk with you about Tommy, sir. Isn't he old enough to begin studying the Latin grammar?"
               "Yes, quite. If you wish him to be a classical scholar, the sooner he commences the better it will be. What are you going to make of Tommy—do you know?"
               "No, sir. I have not got as far as that yet; and I don't much care what profession or occupation he chooses. But I do want him to have a good education to begin with. When mother died," she continued, while her color deepened, "I promised her, and I promised myself, that I would be to Tommy, as far as it was possible, what she would have been, if she had lived. And I know that she would have toiled day and night, if it had been necessary, in order to have educated him."
               Mr. Vaun looked thoughtfully on the carpet for a few moments.
               "How old is Tommy now, Mary?"
               "Nearly twelve, sir."
               "He might have commenced Latin long ago. Why haven't you thought of it before?"
               "I have, sir. But I thought he was learning other things that would be of quite as much service to him. Do you think I could hear his lessons (I mean for a while), even if I do not understand the language myself?"
               "You just see that he has his lessons ready, and I will attend to his recitations."
               Mary's gratitude was most warmly expressed.
               "But I am afraid it will be too much trouble, Mr. Vaun. You have plenty of business already."
               "Oh! twenty minutes every evening will be all I shall need to spend with him, provided you will make him learn his lessons. I can't attend to that."
               "He won't need much making, sir," replied Mary. "He has been teasing me to let him begin it for the last six months."
               
               "He is a bright boy, Mary. Have you ever thought of sending him to college?"
               "Yes, sir; I have thought of it a good deal. If I only could!"
               "What is there to prevent it?"
               "Want of means, sir—that is all. I have been almost afraid to indulge the thought; but it would come in spite of me."
               "I think it may be accomplished, Mary; but it will require self-denial and exertion on the part of both. Have you ever said any thing to Tommy about it?"
               "Not a word, sir; but I know he would be delighted."
               "Mrs. Vaun and myself have been thinking about your affairs a good deal lately," said Mr. Vaun, after a short pause in the conversation. "What do you say to opening a school for young misses in Carrolton?"
               "Why, there is a female seminary there now!"
               "I know it; but that is designed for older pupils. Let yours be, in a measure, preparatory to the seminary."
               Mary sat for some time with her eyes fixed upon the floor.
               "There is one very serious objection to that, Mr. Vaun," she said, at last; "and it is strange that you have overlooked it."
               "What is it?"
               "I know nothing of French or Latin; and I believe they are always taught in such schools—the rudiments at least."
               Mr. Vaun smiled.
               "We do not mean to let you leave us yet a while, and perhaps that objection may be removed. There are plenty of Latin books upon that top shelf," he continued; "and if you can contrive to devote an hour a day to them, I will engage that, in the course of a year, you will be competent to teach all that your school will require. You can pursue the study afterwards as far as you choose."
               "But there is French—that is even more essential than Latin."
               "Well, here comes Mrs. Vaun. Ask her how many times she took the French prize while she was at Mrs. Wilson's."
               "More times than I should if I were to compete for it now, I am afraid," said that lady, laughing. "Domestic economy has been my chief study for the last few years; with a page or two on the management of children and servants, thrown in by way of spice. But what put that into your head now?"
               "A wish to console Mary, and encourage her a little. Couldn't you brush up your French for her benefit?"
               "Teach her, do you mean?"
               "Yes."
               "I will give her all the assistance in my power. But times have changed since I was a school-girl. A different class of books are used, and a different method of teaching has been adopted. Why don't you get Amy to read with you, Mary?"
               "Amy!" exclaimed Mr. Vaun. "I didn't know as she understood French."
               "She translates with remarkable ease," was the reply, "and pronounces far better than the majority of our French scholars. Monsieur L'Estrange is considered the very best teacher in New York; and she studied with him the year she was there. I should think that, between us both, you might have all the help you will need at present, Mary."
               "I am sure you are very kind, Mrs. Vaun, even if I am not certain that I shall succeed in making a linguist of myself. But do you think that otherwise, with the exception of French and Latin, I am capable of taking charge of such a school?" she asked, turning towards Mr. Vaun.
               "Perfectly, Mary. I have not the least doubt of it. And now my advice is, that you devote all your leisure time to these two studies. You can learn much in a year; and if you teach in Carrolton, you can join the French classes at the seminary, and be going on with your own studies at the same time that you are attending to your school."
               So saying, Mr. Vaun left the room.
               "What's the trouble, Mary?" asked Mrs. Vaun, a few moments after, as she looked up and saw her opening and shutting one of the books that lay on the table with a restless, hurried movement. "You are trying to muster courage to say something; I know by the expression of your face. What is it?"
               "Why, just this," said Mary, pushing away the book. "I have felt for the past year as if I did not more than half earn my wages; and I certainly sha'n't do even that this year if I go to studying French and Latin, and mercy knows what."
               
               "You have done all we asked of you," replied Mrs. Vaun, quietly, "and a great deal more."
               "I hope that I have; but still, my reading with Alice has been of quite as much service to me as to her; it has been a great advantage to Tommy, also. And now Mr. Vaun is going to teach us both Latin and—you must not pay me any thing this year, Mrs. Vaun; I can't take it," said Mary, laying her hand softly on that of her friend.
               "But, my dear Mary, what will you do? Don't be too independent. You must have clothes, and so must Tommy."
               "I have spent but very little of what you have already paid me, and some of my school-money is due me yet. You are doing far more for me, my dear Mrs. Vaun, than I can do for you if I try my best; and asking me to receive wages besides, is a little too much," she said, laughing, while tears trembled in her eyes.
               "Have it your own way, then," said Mrs. Vaun, kissing her. "I won't quarrel with you. But I shall scold if I find you devoting too little time to your books. You must not read to Alice as much as you have hitherto. Willie is so much older, that I have more leisure myself now."
               "Please don't trouble yourself about Alice and me," said Mary, with a very bright smile; "I'm a pretty good hand to look out for number one. But where are my children? They are all three missing—Alice, Tommy, and Ralph."
               "I saw the boys leading Alice down by the brook," replied Mrs. Vaun. "That was an hour ago. They must be coming home by this time, I should think."
               "No," said Mary, who was looking from the window. "They are all over on Blackberry Hill. It is time they were here," she added, glancing at the clock; and throwing on her sun-bonnet, she started in pursuit of them.
               It was the Indian summer. A soft haze hung over the landscape; and although the fields were robbed of their summer glory, and the meadows were brown and bare, the scene was surpassingly beautiful. The mountains—those in the distance—lay like misty clouds against the deep, blue sky; and of the nearer ones, some gleamed beneath the glowing sunlight as if bathed in molten gold; and others slept quietly, while the shadows, flitting about like weird, unearthly things, seemed to mock their hoary grandeur. With what proud stateliness the tall pines lowered their crests, as the breeze swept by! How that very breeze, as it tossed the dried leaves, and whirled them gleefully about, seemed to sing of joy and hope!
               It sang of naught else to Mary's heart that day. There was no melancholy cadence in the strain, no undertone of sadness, no whispering of decay and death! She was at peace with herself and with the world. Even the thought of her aunt had long since ceased to awaken any unkindly emotions in her gentle breast; and although she did not visit her, because very confident that her presence would be unwelcome, she had met her so frequently in the street, at church, and at the houses of the neighbors, that the unpleasant feelings those meetings had at first occasioned, had entirely worn off. She was beginning to regard their troubles as a far-off dream—one from which she had awakened gladly, and which might not annoy her more.
               She was at peace with herself and with the world; and the peace of God—the "peace that passeth understanding"—brooded over her spirit, filling it with that indescribable calmness which is, perhaps, more nearly allied to perfect happiness than even joy itself. And that morning, as she bounded over the meadows on her way to Blackberry Hill, words of thanksgiving and grateful praise seemed to spring involuntarily to her lips. Her cup of bliss was not only full, but running over.
               "Mr. Vaun does not think it would be foolish for me to try to have Tommy go to college," she said to herself, as she half danced, half walked along—her step was strangely at variance with her usually sober pace—"and now I am determined he shall go, if I can possibly bring it about. And I believe I can. I feel this morning as if I could do any thing—every thing!"
               She was approaching the children, but they could not see her. They were sitting upon the brow of the hill beneath a wide-spreading elm, and although they were in full view when she left the house, the path across the meadow and around the base of the knoll was so circuitous that she had entirely lost sight of them.
               "Mary is coming—I hear her!" exclaimed Alice, as the sound of approaching footsteps reached her sensitive ear.
               "No, she isn't. There isn't any one coming," said Tommy. "Seems to me I do hear a step, though," he added, a moment after.
               
               "And so do I," said Ralph, who was sitting on the grass beside his sister. "I hear somebody—but it isn't Mary."
               "Yes, it is Mary. I always know her step," said Alice, turning a sparkling face in the direction whence the sound proceeded. "There! didn't I tell you it was?"
               "And how do you know it is, now?" asked Tommy. "You don't see her."
               "No, but I feel her. You are here, aren't you, Mary?"
               "Yes, dear;" and Mary affectionately clasped the small hands that were extended towards her. "I have come after you. It's long past our reading-time—don't you know it. And where are your lessons, Tommy? and yours, master Ralph?"
               "Mine is in my head," said Tommy, "I learned it last night."
               "And mine is in my book—that's a good place!" chimed in little Ralph.
               "Well, we'll go home and try to find a better one for it," said Mary, laughing. "Come, Alie dear, I'll lead you. Have you had a pleasant walk?"
               "Very. Oh, it is so pleasant here under this old tree! I like to sit here when the wind blows. Hark!" and the child lifted her finger and listened intently, while a glow of delight lit up her delicately chiselled features. "Hark! It is so sweet! Don't you love to hear it, Mary?"
               "Dearly, Alice! It is sweeter to me than your choicest music."
               "It isn't to me," said Tommy. "I like the 'Starlight waltz' that Alice plays, a great deal better. But I don't see how you notice different sounds as you do, Alice."
               "Notice the difference in sounds, you mean, don't you, Tommy?" asked Mary.
               "Yes. She will tell by the sound of the wind among the leaves and branches, whether we are under a pine-tree or a maple, and I can't contrive how she knows."
               Alice paused thoughtfully before she replied.
               "I don't know as I can tell you, Tommy. Before I was blind I did not notice these things any more than you do. Sometimes I think God means that my ear should take the place of my eye. I know you all by the tones of your voices, or the sound of your footsteps—and it almost seems as if I could see you in my heart."
               It was a pleasant thing to see those two merry light-hearted boys taming down their own quick footsteps to the slow and cautious pace to which Alice was confined. But Mary thought it was time they were at their lessons.
               "Run on, boys," she said, "and get the chairs and table ready, and the books down. Alice and I will be along presently."
               "Come on, then, Ralph—let's have a race," said Tommy.
               "Oh, but you are so much bigger than me that it won't be fair! I never can beat you, Tommy!"
               "Yes, it will be fair if I let you have the start. Run along, and when you get to the first bar-post I'll follow you. Now!" and Ralph scampered away as fast as his little feet could carry him.
               Alice's thoughts were still upon the track to which they had been led by Tommy's remark. She was still thinking, not so much of her blindness, as of the mercies and blessings that smoothed her darkened pathway.
               "I have a great deal to be thankful for, Mary," she said, "even if I am blind. I used to be so discontented and unhappy. Oh! you don't know how I felt, and I can't tell you. I used to think that I should be a burden and a trouble to everybody around me all my life, and that I never could do any good, and never could learn any thing; and I used to think of Ellen, and wonder why I did not die too, and to wish that I might die, for I felt as if I should be so much better off. But that has all passed away. I don't feel so now."
               Mary pressed the arm that lay within her own closer to her side as she answered:
               "God 'tempers the wind to the shorn lamb' always, dear Alie. When He takes from us any blessing, He either gives us strength to bear the loss, or He gives us something else to supply its place. Do you not find pleasure in many things now that you scarcely thought of when you could see like other people?"
               "Yes, in a great many. I take more pleasure in learning than I used to, and in trying to wait on myself, and in helping mother about little things. I love to take care of Willie—and it seems as if the little fellow knew that I could not carry him about as others do, for he will sit so still in my lap, and not cry at all. And I can knit just as well as if I could see; and write very well; and my music—oh, Mary, you cannot think what a comfort that is to me! I always loved it, but now—I don't believe I could live without it! But there is one thing that seems strange—I used to feel as if people would not love me as well if I was blind, and would think it was a great task to take care of me. It is not so at all. You never get tired of me, any of you, and I know I make a great deal of trouble."
               "Not so much as you suppose, my dear Alie. You are growing quite independent, now-a-days. But if you could see, and little Willie were to become blind, do you suppose it would make you love him less? I think you would love him all the more because he was helpless and needed your care."
               "Ah, but that is a different thing!"
               "It is only the difference between 'me and mine,' and 'thee and thine,' dear Alie," said Mary, stooping to kiss the sweet face that was uplifted to her own. "If you feel that Willie would be all the more dear to you if he were blind, you must be content to believe that your friends love you even more than they would otherwise."
               Alice smiled gratefully.
               "Then I ought to be almost glad that I am blind. I would rather be as I am now, and be loved, than to have my sight again and lose my friends. But oh, Mary, how I wish I could just see mother's face again!—and Willie! Does he look as Ralph used to? Is he pretty?"
               "Very pretty, dear. He is a sweet child. There! now we're at the gate, and I can see through the window that the boys have made every thing ready for us. What shall we read this morning?"
               That very afternoon Mary went to consult with Amy, and make arrangements for carrying the French plan into effect. Amy would have been delighted with any project that would have enabled her to receive more frequent visits from her friend; but this one pleased her particularly.
               "Help you study French, Mary? I don't know of any thing I should like better, unless it is learning to weave again, with you for a teacher. Oh! I do wish you would come back here and live! Have you got a French grammar?"
               "No; but Mrs. Vaun will let me use hers."
               "Take mine; it is a better one. Mary, if you had only thought of this when you lived here! But we'll get along finely as it is. How often will you come down?"
               "Twice a week. Oftener if I can find time. It isn't going to be play-work—make-believe work, but real work, Amy. Mr. Vaun thinks that if I understood French and Latin, I might teach school at Carrolton; and I am going to study them both this year, and study them faithfully, too."
               "I should think you would a great deal rather stay at Mr. Vaun's. They are so kind to you; and I know they love to have you there."
               "I know it too. But, Amy dear, I have got a good deal to do. Don't you know I told you, a great many years ago, that I was going to send Tommy to college?"
               "Now, Mary! How in the world will you ever do it? I didn't suppose you would dream of such a thing."
               "I have dreamed of it ever since I was a little girl. Now I am going to make my dream a reality, if I can."
               "But, my dear child," interposed Mrs. Thompson, "I am afraid you don't realize what you are undertaking. Just think! not only your own self to support, but Tommy's board, lodging, clothing, and books to provide, besides his school-bills to pay! It will cost a great deal merely to fit him for college."
               "I believe I do realize it fully, Mrs. Thompson; and I expect to work hard and live economically. I shan't be able to buy a great many 'nicknacks' for either of us," she added, with a smile, "but that won't grieve me very much, and Tommy must get used to it."
               "But, Mary, if you should get him a place in a store, or have him learn some good trade, seems to me it would be better. It is just as respectable, if he behaves himself; and in a very few years he could not only support himself, but you also."
               "I am perfectly willing he should go into a store, or learn a trade, or be a farmer, or any thing else he chooses, after he has been to college, Mrs. Thompson. But I do want him to be well and thoroughly educated. I did not think you would try to discourage me," she continued, half-reproachfully; "you who have always seemed so proud of Tommy. I thought you would be very much pleased."
               "And so I am, dear child, if it won't be too much for you. But I am afraid it will be."
               
               "Don't be such a gloomy prophet, then," said Mary, playfully, caressing her kind friend. "If I can keep up good spirits, it will be half the battle. At all events, whether I succeed or not, it will do no harm to try. 'Faint heart never won faire ladye;' and I believe that, if Tommy lives, he will show you his diploma one day or another. It will be a good while first."
               "I suppose he could do a good deal to help himself through college, if you can once get him fairly started. May be you could get him in as one of the charity students."
               "Never!" said Mary, "never! He shall go on his own hook, or rather on my hook, or not at all. I should not be willing to have him enter as a charity scholar."
               "Why? I don't see why you object to it. A great many fine young men have been educated in that way."
               "I don't doubt it. But they weren't my brothers," said Mary, laughing. "I don't want Tommy to be under any obligations, excepting to those who love him; and I want him to be perfectly free, when he leaves college, to choose any profession or business he prefers. But this is looking ahead a great ways. Talking about his graduation before he has learned to decline 'Penna, Pennæ!' Mr. Vaun is going to hear him recite in Latin every evening—did I tell you?"
               "You said you were going to study it yourself," replied Amy. "Why don't you begin German and Spanish? You have so little to do!"
               "Don't laugh at me, Amy! You'll see that I will do all I have to do, and perhaps that is even more than you are aware of. But I must go now. Next Tuesday, remember, I shall be down here with my French books."
               "You can learn your verbs on the road," said Amy, "just as you used to get your grammar lesson, that summer we went to school to Miss Stowe. Perhaps I will come and see you once in a while, and give you a little extra help."
               "It will all be extra help, whether given here or elsewhere. But I shall always be glad to see you, and so will Mrs. Vaun. Good-by. Good-by, Mrs. Thompson."
               The first Latin lesson was recited that evening. Mary and Tommy commenced together, and for two or three weeks kept along side by side. But the former soon began to feel as it she were losing time, and her lessons grew longer and longer. Soon Tommy was left far behind, very much to his chagrin.
               "Never mind, Tommy," said Mr. Vaun. "'Slow and sure' is the best motto for you, now-a-days. If you learn each lesson thoroughly, they will grow less difficult as you proceed; and when you commence Greek, I expect Mary will find it hard work to keep up with you."
               "Greek! Am I going to learn Greek, Mr. Vaun?"
               "Certainly, you are: but not now. We must have some hard studying here, Tommy. These nouns and verbs must not be half learned. You must know them as well as you know the alphabet. What else are you at work at now?"
               "Arithmetic, sir, and grammar. Then we are reading English history, and Goldsmith's Animated Nature. Alice and I write compositions every week, too."
               "That will do very well. What was your last composition about?"
               Tommy blushed and hung down his head, but said nothing.
               "What ails you, Tommy? Why don't you answer Mr. Vaun?" said Mary.
               "Because, I don't want to be laughed at: it was such a very simple subject, Mr. Vaun."
               "I shall certainly laugh if you don't tell me, Tommy. What did you write about?"
               "About—about—going up on to the mountain a-fishing last summer, with Mr. Thompson. But the one I wrote before that was on the 'Instability of human greatness.'"
               Mr. Vaun did not laugh, but he glanced at Mary with a comical twinkle in his eye.
               "May I see those two compositions, Tommy? I should like to read them very much."
               Tommy hesitated. Alice was standing by her father's side, with one arm about his neck.
               "Go and get them, Tommy," she whispered; "I think they are real good."
               Thus encouraged, he went up stairs to find them.
               "And what did my happy little Alice write about?" asked Mr. Vaun, drawing her still closer: "you haven't told me any thing about your last composition."
               "Oh, I wrote a kind of a story about a little blind girl—but she wasn't like me," she added quickly: "she was a poor little orphan, and she hadn't any one to take care of her, and so she died."
               Mr. Vaun kissed her two or three times, and some unuttered, perhaps undefined emotion, kept him silent for a moment.
               "And what made you think of that, my daughter? What made you choose such a sad subject?"
               "I was thinking one day about myself, and of the many things I have to make me happy, even if I am blind. And then I thought that perhaps there were a great many little blind girls in the world who have no father and mother, and no home—and no Mary," she said, turning her beautiful, though sightless, eyes towards the spot where Mary sat: "and so my story came to me—I hardly know how."
               "I must see it, dear: but here comes Tommy. Shall I read them myself, sir, or will you read them to me?" he asked, as Tommy handed him the two neatly-folded papers.
               Tommy preferred that Mr. Vaun should read them; which he did, apparently with some care.
               "I expect you will be very much surprised when I tell you which of these compositions I like best," Mr. Vaun said, as he gave them back.
               "No, sir, I shall not be. That one about going a-fishing isn't worth reading, I know. The subject was so—so trifling, that I couldn't make any thing of it."
               "But, Tommy, that is the one that I like best."
               "It is, sir!" Tommy's astonishment was too overpowering to admit of his saying more. The composition on the "Instability of human greatness" was one of his pets. He thought it was decidedly the best he had written; and he had always felt as if he had rather lowered his dignity when he chose so humble a theme as "going a-fishing" for its successor.
               "Yes, Tommy, I think this composition about the fishing excursion is much the best. It is really very good indeed. You were interested in your subject; you had something to say, and you said it in direct and simple words, that exactly conveyed your meaning."
               "I thought the other one was the best, sir."
               "I am not surprised at that. When young folks first begin to write, they are very apt to think that they cannot write well, unless they choose some very profound theme, and use very large, high-sounding words. But if they attempt that—as profound found and unintelligible bear very nearly the same meaning in their vocabulary—they are quite likely to get beyond their depth, and write words rather than ideas. Always select some subject that interests you, one that you understand thoroughly, be it ever so simple. Then one thought will suggest another, and you need not trouble yourself greatly about the words. They will come as a matter of course. But where is your little story, Alice? I must see that now."
               With but little difficulty—indeed, had it not been for a slight degree of hesitancy in her step, one would scarcely have suspected she was blind—Alice made her way across the room, opened her writing-desk and brought the story to her father.
               "How your writing—your penmanship, I mean—improves, Alice! Really, you might put many girls who have the use of both their eyes to the blush. But now for the story. Shall I read it aloud so that mother can hear?"
               Alice smiled her assent, and Mr. Vaun read it through, slowly and distinctly, but not without tears. The sketch was exquisitely simple and touching; childlike, and yet womanly, were the feelings it expressed; and when he had finished it, the father caught his gifted but unfortunate child to his heart, in a burst of emotion that he could not control.
               Very soon afterwards the children were dismissed to their own rooms, but not before Ralph had exhibited his attempt at writing a composition. It was a single sentence, printed in large capitals on his slate.
               "Once I had a little dog—and his name was Jack—and he loved me very much."
               But Ralph received his due share of praise, and went off in high glee.
               "Alice must be encouraged to write," was Mr. Vaun's last remark to his wife that night: "it will be a great pleasure to her, and if she is capable of the improvement that I think, it may in time be more than a pleasure. It may save her from the feeling of helplessness and loneliness that she so dreads—if she should outlive us."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXII.
               
                  
                     
                        O this learning! what a thing it is!
                     
                     —SHAKSPEARE.
                  
               
               OUR Mary was no laggard; but, as the weeks rolled away, she found that she had not as much time to devote to her French and Latin as she needed, in order to make the rapid progress she desired. Still she was unwilling to drop any of her old duties, or to shorten the hours that she spent with the children.
               "You will ruin your eyes, Mary," said Mrs. Vaun, as one evening, just at dusk, she entered the library, and found her, with her dictionary lying on the window-seat, poring over the closely-printed pages. "Come, put up your book, and wait until the lamps are lighted."
               "Just as soon as I finish this sentence, Mrs. Vaun," said Mary, without turning her head. "I have got to recite after tea, and my lesson isn't half learned. Oh! do please stop!" she continued, laughing, as Mrs. Vaun came up behind her, and playfully clasped both hands over her eyes. "I can't see at all."
               "I don't mean you shall. Why have you not learned your lesson before?"
               "Oh, I could not very well. I suppose I was lazy!"
               "Lazy! Mary, you must not spend so much time with the children now. They can get along without it."
               "I suppose they can. They could 'get along' without me at all. But they are learning so fast now, and Alice is so much interested in our reading, that I can't bear to lose a moment of the time. I can manage in some way."
               "I shall not allow you to manage in this way, however. If you can't contrive to get your lessons without studying by this 'dim uncertain light,' you must leave the children to themselves. 'Discretion is the better part of valor;' and it is not worth while for you to attack your books too furiously. A knowledge of French and Latin gained at the expense of your eyesight, won't avail you much."
               Mary said nothing; but she was determined that she would not deprive Alice of one of her chief pleasures, or of the long walks in which she so delighted, and which were so beneficial to her health. The weather was growing cold, almost wintry, but she had become so accustomed to Mary's guidance, that, when leaning on her arm, she walked with a tolerably firm and rapid step, and, well protected by warm hood and shawl, breasted both wind and storm quite bravely.
               "It does Alice so much good to be in the open air, that I must go out with her," said Mary to herself; "and she enjoys our morning readings more than ever lately. And there's that sewing—dresses for myself, and Tommy's winter clothes. Oh dear! how shall I manage?"
               Before she went to bed that night, she went out into the kitchen. Bridget was stirring up the buckwheat cakes for breakfast. Mary was an especial favorite of hers, and she looked up with a bright smile as she entered.
               "An' sure, Miss Mary, you're not afther making me many visits these days."
               "I haven't much time, Bridget; I'm so busy."
               "Sure, an' you're always busy!"
               "And I always want to be. Bridget, I came out here tonight to see if you couldn't help me to a little more time."
               "Indade and I will, Miss Mary. I will be glad to any thing for ye. I mind who tended me when I had the fayver last winther. Och! but the sight o' your bonny face was enough to make me well, let alone the broth and the powders!"
               Mary smiled.
               "I don't want you to do much for me, Bridget. You have work enough of your own. I only want you to call me in the morning, when you first get up. How early is it, generally?"
               "Too early for the likes o' you. Four o'clock, or a little afther."
               "That will do nicely. Who makes the fire in the library—you or Michael?"
               "Mike; but not thin—not till the breakfast is jist ready."
               "Well, if he will leave some kindlings there over night, I will start the fire myself. Now, don't forget to call me, Bridget, just as soon as you are up. Will you remember?"
               Bridget looked at her curiously.
               "And can't ye be afther doing enough by the daylight? Sure if ye rise with the sun, it's airly for a young crather like you!"
               "Not early enough to suit me just now, Bridget. I want to rise when you do. Come in very softly, so that you won't wake Alice. She needs to sleep later."
               Bridget promised, and Mary went to bed. But it was a long time before she slept. The verbs and pronouns which she had been studying during the day haunted her continually. They rang in her ears, and they danced before her eyes, banishing drowsiness very effectually. When Bridget came to her bedside the next morning, shading the candle with her hand, and whispering softly,
               "Miss Mary, Miss Mary, shure and I'm up!" it seemed to her that she had but just fallen asleep.
               "What time is it, Bridget?"
               "Its going on for five. And I tould Mike to make a fire for ye in the libry, and ye'll find it bright and warm."
               "Light my candle, will you, Bridget? I am much obliged to Mike;" and giving her eyes one more rub, Mary crept carefully from the bed, with a due regard for the sleeping Alice, hurried on her clothes, and went down stairs.
               As Bridget had said, it was "bright and warm" in the library. Drawing the sofa close to the table, she established herself cosily in one corner, and began studying with all her might.
               It was a full hour before she was interrupted by the sound of Alice's footsteps overhead. Their room was directly over the library; and hastily throwing her book one side, Mary darted up stairs to help her dress.
               "Why, Mary! Why didn't you wake me when you got up? Have you eaten breakfast?"
               "No, Alie. You are no later than common. I got up a little earlier than usual—that's all. Shall I help you?"
               "Not unless my hair needs parting. It feels as if the part was not quite straight—is it?"
               "As straight as can be. I don't think you need eyes, Alie. You get along without them so well. Are you almost ready to go down."
               "Very nearly. You needn't wait, Mary. I can come down alone. What have you been doing?"
               "Studying a little. Don't fall as you come down stairs."
               "I thought you said I didn't need eyes!"
               "And I haven't said that you do need them, have I? I might give that advice to anybody. Ralph caught his toe in the carpet, and nearly fell from the top to the bottom yesterday."
               "I will be careful. And, Mary, don't let anybody move my writing-desk. I don't want to have those papers disturbed."
               "They shall not be moved a hair's breadth, Alie. But come down as soon as you can. It is cold up here;" and shivering, she ran down stairs.
               It had been a part of her business, ever since she came to Mr. Vaun's, to keep the library in order. Now, raising the windows, she seized the broom, and went to work in good earnest. When Alice came down, she found Mary enveloped in a small cloud of dust.
               "Go into the dining-room, Alie—that's a good girl. You'll be smothered here."
               "I should think you would be? Whew—how dusty! and how your hair will look!"
               "It won't disturb you," said Mary, laughing; and taking her by both arms, she half pushed, half carried her into the other room. "But yours will trouble me, so you had better keep out of here. My hair is protected; I've a cap on."
               "And like a very dignified old lady you look," said Mr. Vaun, who at that moment entered the dining-room from the opposite direction. "What are you about?"
               "Bringing Alice in here, sir;" and after a low courtesy, she flew back to her work again.
               By the time breakfast was on the table—at seven o'clock—the room was nicely swept and dusted, the books all in their places, and every thing ready for the day.
               "Isn't it a very pleasant morning?" asked Alice, while they were eating.
               "Yes," replied her father. "Why do you ask?"
               "Oh! I was only thinking about our walk. It stormed so hard yesterday that we could not go far. But we shall have a nice time this morning."
               "Tommy and I aren't going," said Ralph. "You can go if you want to."
               "Thank you, sir. But why aren't you going?"
               
               "Oh, because!——Tommy is going to mend my sled. He said he would."
               "You needn't be in any hurry about that," said Mr. Vaun. "There are no signs of snow yet."
               "But I want to be all ready when it does come. We are going out to the workshop right after breakfast. The girls can go without us."
               Accepting Ralph's gracious permission, Mary and Alice went out as soon as they left the table. It was nine o'clock when they came in, refreshed and invigorated by the pure mountain air, and with a healthful glow upon cheeks and lips. Mary immediately rang the bell.
               "I don't expect the boys have finished the sled yet," said she; "but time is precious, and you and I can't afford to lose any, can we, Alie?"
               Presently the boys came in, bringing with them a faint, pleasant smell of pine-shavings.
               "What are you going to do while we are reading, Ralph?" asked Mary. "You can't understand this book."
               Ralph looked about him with a very dissatisfied air.
               "I wish you would read good books," he said. "That ain't worth any thing, and you've been reading it this ever so long."
               "What do you mean by good books?" and Mary playfully tapped his cheek with the ends of her fingers. "I don't believe you are much of a judge."
               "Why, yes I am! I mean nice books—pretty books—that have pictures and funny stories. I can't bear that one!"
               "You needn't, Ralph. Run into your mother's room and play with Willie; and when we are through, I'll read you a first-rate story. Won't that answer?"
               Ralph ran off smiling, and Mary and Tommy read alternately for two hours, occasionally pausing to interchange comments and questions, and to remind each other that such and such points must be referred to Mr. Vaun in the evening. Mary did not sit with folded hands while Tommy was reading. Her work-basket stood on the table by her side; and while her thoughts were roving in other lands, holding familiar converse with the sages and seers of other days, or listening to the trump of battle, and the heavy tread of armed men, her fingers were busied with hems and overhand seams, gussets and bands.
               The clock struck eleven.
               "There, Tommy, put up the book, and take your arithmetic. You've read long enough."
               "Just let me finish this chapter. It's only—only"—and Tommy hastily turned over leaf after leaf.
               "Only a dozen pages, more or less. No, dear, it's time you were busy with your slate and pencil. I want you to get through the 'Rule of Three' this week. What are you going to do, Alice?"
               "Finish my composition. Somebody has been at my desk. These papers are not as I left them."
               "Your father borrowed a sheet of paper last night. He couldn't find any in his own desk. Has he done any mischief?"
               "Nothing very serious. Find me a good new pen, will you, Mary? This one is worn out."
               While Tommy was "ciphering," and Alice writing, Mary called Ralph, heard him read and spell, and then, in a low voice, read him the "first-rate" story she had promised him.
               Mrs. Vaun was very busy that day preserving quinces. But immediately after dinner, Master Willie grew tired of amusing himself, and was equally averse to being entertained by others. He wanted his mother; no one in the house could supply her place.
               "You must be quiet, Willie. I can't take you now," she said, as she placed him on the floor, with his playthings around him. "If you won't stay with Bridget nor play with Alice, you must sit there."
               "He looks sick, Mrs. Vaun," said Mary, taking him in her arms. "See how his gums are swollen!"
               "I know they are; but he seemed well enough this morning. And now I have got those quinces so far under way that I can't leave them. Bridget is not to be trusted with fancy work. Plain cooking is about as much as she can manage."
               Willie liked Mary's arms no better than Bridget's just then.
               "Do take him, Mrs. Vaun. I really believe he is sick. His face is so red, and his hands are so hot! I'll go and finish the quinces."
               Mrs. Vaun laughed as she took the baby.
               "I should think they would be, after crying at that rate. Oh Willie! Willie! aren't you ashamed now?" she said, as the child hushed his sobs, and began to play with her watch-chain. "Mary, you haven't learned yet to distinguish the different species of tears. This young gentleman was crying from impatience, not pain."
               Mary was already on her way to the kitchen.
               "How long must the quinces boil, Mrs. Vaun?"
               "Until they look clear. Then lay each piece by itself on a platter, and let them cool, while the syrup is boiling. You know how to clarify it."
               While Mary stood with her skimmer in one hand, attending to the syrup, her French grammar was in the other. She was to go to Amy that afternoon, and had not yet reviewed what she had learned since her last visit. The conjugation of verbs kept time to the low murmur of the kettle.
               It was nearly three o'clock when the last layer of quinces was placed in the jar, and the syrup poured over them. Mary hastily changed her dress, and went into Mrs. Vaun's room after her gloves. She had left them there the day before.
               "Why, Mary! I had forgotten that it was Tuesday, and you were going to Mr. Thompson's. You oughtn't to have touched those quinces! Why didn't you tell me?"
               "Because I couldn't bear to hear Willie cry. I shall have time enough."
               "Oh, Mary, I wish I could go with you!" exclaimed Alice. "Mayn't I? Amy wanted me to come sometime."
               Mary would have said "yes," although she knew it would hinder her very much. But Mrs. Vaun interposed.
               "No, no, Alice; not to-day. It is late already, and you could not walk fast enough. I am sorry I was so thoughtless, Mary."
               "I am not in the least," said Mary. "Good-by, Alie. You shall go next time, if it is pleasant."
               Amy was waiting for her; and they were absorbed in their books until almost dark. Then Mary started up.
               "I must go this very minute. It is past sundown already. How short the days are!"
               "Yes; but it was almost night when you came. Do stay to tea, Mary. Can't you?" said Amy.
               "Not to-night. I can't possibly. I have a great deal to do this evening."
               "Wait just one moment, then," said Mrs. Thompson. "I've got something to send Tommy."
               She went into her bedroom, and soon returned with two pairs of nice gray stockings.
               "I thought you wouldn't have a great deal of time to knit, Mary, and that these might be acceptable. And here's some of that flannel you wove last winter to make him a couple of shirts. Don't stop to thank me, dear, but, if you must go, run along. It will be dark before you get home."
               Amy was ready, as usual, to go "as far as the turn;" and as Mr. Vaun's house was then in sight, the remaining distance seemed short.
               We must not forget to say, that when the flannel was unrolled, Mary found there was not only enough for a couple of shirts for Tommy, but for a skirt for herself.
               Tea was ready when she got home; and afterwards came the recitations in Latin, and the review of the morning's reading. Then Tommy's coat needed mending, and some stockings of her own. And by the time that was done, it was past ten, and Mary went to bed—to rise the next morning at five, and be equally busy the coming day.
               Thus the time flew until the holidays approached.
               It wanted only a few days of Christmas, when Mary found her brother leaning his head upon the mantelpiece, and gazing in the fire with a most thoughtful and disconsolate face.
               "How sober you are looking, Tommy! What's the trouble?"
               "Nothing," said the boy, raising his head, and throwing back his hair, with an air that seemed to say "something" as plainly as possible.
               "Yes, there is something troubling you. Tell me!" she continued, peremptorily, and enforcing her words with a kiss.
               "'Tisn't much of any thing, Mary. Only I wish I had some money!"
               "'Money is the root of all evil,' Tommy," she replied, with mock gravity. "What do you want of it?"
               "Why, it's almost Christmas, and I do wish I could give somebody a present. I never did in my life."
               "Somebody! Who is somebody, Tommy?"
               "Somebody means a great many people," said he, laughing. "I should like to give Mrs. Vaun something, and Alice, and Ralph, and Mrs. Thompson, and you, Mary—you more than any one else. But I haven't got but just twenty-five cents."
               "Don't think about me, dear. You make me a great many presents."
               "You, Mary? I never gave you any thing!"
               "You make me a present every time you study hard, and learn your lessons so well that Mr. Vaun praises you."
               "What kind of a present?"
               "The best in the world, Tommy. A present of Hope and Courage. The hope that you will in time be all that I wish you to be, and courage to work on for many years, if it is necessary, in the sure belief that you will not fail me or disappoint me in the end. Do you think I want any thing better than that?"
               There were tears in Tommy's eyes as he threw his arms about his sister's neck, and whispered,
               "I will try to make you such a present every day, Mary. But I should so like to give you something really. Maybe I will one of these days."
               Mary drew him to a seat beside her on the sofa.
               "You say you want to give somebody a Christmas present. Now, Tommy, we are not rich enough to give presents to all our friends, but I think we can afford to do a little in that line. As we can't give to all, you shall make your own choice. Who shall it be?"
               It was a hard question. Tommy pondered the matter a long time.
               "I should like to give something to Alice and Ralph," said he, after a while, "but then they always have a great many presents, and I don't know as they would care for it much. Then there's Mrs. Vaun, she is very kind to me, always, and I love her. But somehow, Mary, it seems as if Mrs. Thompson loves me better than any one else does, besides you. I believe I had rather—I don't know—oh dear! Who shall I choose?" he asked, suddenly turning round.
               "If we were rich we wouldn't be troubled in this way, would we, Tommy? I think you had better leave Alice and Ralph out of the account entirely: then you will only have to determine whether it shall be Mrs. Vaun or Mrs. Thompson."
               "But I can't determine: they are both so good, and have done so much for me. You decide it, Mary."
               "Suppose you draw lots," said Mary, smiling.
               "No, I shouldn't like that: it would seem as if it wasn't my present. I'll leave it to you."
               "Well, Tommy, I hardly know what to tell you. I have been thinking of these things for a week or two, as well as yourself. I suppose if we can make up our minds to be a little more economical ourselves, we might get something for both of them."
               "Oh, Mary, I should be so glad if we could! I am willing to be economical."
               "And do without that new cap you have been talking about so long?"
               Tommy hesitated. He had quite as much pride and anxiety about his personal appearance as the generality of boys, and he thought his old cap looked rather rusty. But at last his wish to manifest, in some slight degree, his gratitude to his kind friends, triumphed over vanity.
               "Yes, I'll do without the cap."
               "And I'll make my old gaiters answer for this winter. I was intending to get a new pair; but I will bind these over, and make them look as well as I can. You see, Tommy, I am not earning any thing now, and I have only about thirty dollars. When we go to Carrolton we shall both have to have some new clothes, and we must try to make our old ones answer until then. What shall our present be?"
               "Oh, I don't know. You'll have to go to the village after them, won't you?"
               "Yes. Perhaps we had better not decide until I look about a little, and see what there is to be found. But, my dear boy, I haven't the least idea when you are intending to learn your Latin lesson. Have you?"
               "I am going to learn it now—right away—this very minute," said he, turning towards the library.
               "And you have no time to lose. Tea will be ready in less than an hour."
               Mary had no opportunity to go to the village the next day, but nevertheless she decided what the presents should be, provided she could procure the requisite materials.
               "Tommy," said she, "did you see that 'Ladies Companion' that Mrs. Barton had when she visited here?"
               "'Ladies' Companion!' what sort of a thing is that?"
               
               "Oh, it is a sort of needle-book, work-box, money-purse, thread-case, &c., &c., &c., all in one. It is made of morocco and silk. Mrs. Barton's was purple."
               "I remember it: but what made you think of that now?"
               "Why, Mrs. Barton gave me the patterns for one like hers, and if I can get the morocco cut and stamped here (there are as much as a dozen pieces, and they must all have a narrow gilt border), I could make them myself. I can't think of any thing Mrs. Vaun or Mrs. Thompson would like as well."
               "But you won't have time to make them before Christmas."
               "If I can get to the village to-morrow, I can finish one before Christmas, and the other for New-year's. That will do just as well."
               "To-morrow" came, and with it a chance to ride to the village.
               Mary had some difficulty in procuring the articles she wanted. There was but one book-bindery in the town, and there she could find no morocco of suitable color and quality. After a good deal of search, she came across some in a little shoe-shop that she thought would answer. She bought it, and then went back to the book-bindery. The master himself was out, and it was only with an infinite amount of trouble that she succeeded in making the sleepy-looking apprentice understand what she wanted. Then, after spending an hour in explanations, and in showing him where and how each piece must be stamped, she learned, to her great chagrin, that the work could not be done that day.
               "You see it's going to be considerable of a chore," said the young man: "it can't be done to-day, no how. All these little fiddling pieces to be cut out and stamped, so dreadful particular—and there's nobody but me to do a thing."
               "When can I have them, then?" asked Mary, after some unsuccessful efforts to persuade him to a little extra exertion.
               "Wall, I'll try to have 'em done by to-morrow noon. You can send for 'em then, any way."
               "Cut me a little sample of the morocco, if you please," said Mary; and having received it, she went in pursuit of silk for lining, and ribbon for trimming. That was easily accomplished; but she went home, wondering how she was going to get the morocco on the ensuing day.
               She was quite as much at a loss when she woke the next morning. Immediately after breakfast Mr. Vaun went away on business in exactly the opposite direction, and did not intend to return until after dark; and Mike went to the woods, taking his dinner with him, so there was no chance in that quarter.
               "Oh, Tommy, I do wish there was a horse that you could drive!" she exclaimed, after the forenoon lessons were concluded.
               "I can drive Racer, just as well as not."
               "Mr. Vaun wouldn't trust you with him, I know. What are we going to do about that morocco?"
               "I can walk to the village, Mary; 'tisn't but four miles, and I have walked farther than that when I have been a berrying."
               "But four miles there, and four back, make eight. You would be very tired, and have a headache to-morrow, probably: you always do when you walk far."
               "Yes, in the summer; but the sun won't hurt me to-day, I guess. I'd just as lief go, if you want me to. Maybe I can get a ride home with somebody who is coming this way."
               So it was concluded that Tommy should go, and in due season he returned with the morocco. Mary had greatly feared that it would not be forthcoming.
               By sitting up very late the two nights before Christmas, she succeeded in finishing one "Companion." A very happy boy was Tommy, when he stole into the breakfast-room and laid it on Mrs. Vaun's plate, nicely wrapped in white tissue paper; and his pleasure in no way abated when he saw a beautiful book lying on his own, and something—he couldn't determine what—on Mary's.
               "What have I got here, I wonder?" said Mrs. Vaun, laughing, as she seated herself at the table and commenced pinching the white parcel: "I'm sure I can't guess. It's neither very hard nor very soft."
               "Open it and see, mother—do!" said Alice, who sat next her mother, at the same time extending her hand and taking the paper. "Oh! I know what it is! can't you tell?"
               "I don't believe you can tell, Alice," said Mary. "What do you think it is?"
               "It is one of those things that Mrs. Barton had; I've forgotten gotten what she called it," she replied. "Now, mother, please open it, and see if I am not right."
               A general laugh assured her that she was right, even before Mrs. Vaun spoke.
               "It is a 'Companion,' Alice—and a beautiful one, too. I think you must have been in the secret. But who am I to thank for it?" and her eye glanced from one to another of the smiling faces around her. It rested finally on Mary.
               "It is Tommy's gift, Mrs. Vaun," she replied, to the inquiring look.
               "Yes, but you made it," said Tommy. "It is more your present than mine."
               "Then I must thank you both. It is just what I wanted," said Mrs. Vaun, examining it. "How neatly it is made; and my favorite color, too. My presents fit each other exactly," she continued gayly, as she drew a little gold thimble from her pocket, and slipped it into the companion. "I found this on my dressing-table this morning."
               "Oh, what a beauty!" exclaimed Mary. "The companion must have been made on purpose to keep it in. But see what I've found!" and she unrolled a pretty, black silk apron.
               Alice and Ralph had found their presents under their pillows, and Mr. Vaun sported a new guard for his watch. There was more talking and laughing than eating; and they loitered away an hour or two at the table very pleasantly.
               In the course of the forenoon Tommy told Mrs. Vaun that there was a "companion" to be given to Mrs. Thompson, also; but that Mary had not had time to finish it yet.
               "Are they just alike, Tommy?"
               "Yes, ma'am, just exactly."
               "Then you won't care which one I have; and if you would like to give Mrs. Thompson hers to-day, because it is Christmas, take this and carry it over to her. Mary will get the other done in a few days, and I can have that."
               Tommy demurred a little at first: but at length he concluded that the plan was a very fine one, and adopted it.
               Mrs. Thompson was as much pleased as he wished her to be, and that is saying a great deal.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           I would make
                           Reason my guide, but she should sometimes sit
                           Patiently by the wayside, while I traced
                           The mazes of the pleasant wilderness
                           Around me. She should be my counsellor,
                           But not my tyrant. For the spirit needs
                           Impulses from a deeper source than hers,
                           And there are motions in the mind of man
                           That she must look upon with awe.
                        
                     
                     —BRYANT.
                  
               
               "WHO want's to go up on the mountain with me to-morrow?" asked Mr. Vaun one pleasant afternoon of the next summer.
               "Oh father, how are you going?" said Alice, who was leaning on his shoulder.
               "You little yankee! I asked who wanted to go with me, and you answer by asking how I am going."
               "Well, but father, I can't tell whether I want to go until I know that. If you are going in an ox-cart, I shouldn't like to go, or on horseback, either."
               "That means that you would like it very much, if I am going in a nice carriage; but if not, you would prefer staying at home, doesn't it?"
               "No, sir," replied Alice, laughing; "I don't care about the carriage being so very nice. Any kind of a wagon will do."
               "Well, is there any one else who would like to go?"
               "I should," said Ralph.
               "And I," said Tommy.
               Mr. Vaun looked at Mary.
               "Why don't you say, 'And I,' too?"
               "It isn't necessary, sir. You know I am always ready for a ride, when—"
               "When you can have one just as well as not. Where's your mother, Alice?"
               "In the nursery. No, here she comes. Mother, father is going to take us on to the mountain to-morrow."
               "I haven't promised yet, Alice. I have only been asking questions. I wish you could go, Ellen," he continued, turning to his wife. "There is every prospect of our having a fine day."
               "If it were not for Willie," said Mrs. Vaun; "but if he should worry or be troublesome, it would spoil the pleasure of the whole party."
               "Don't take him. Leave him with Bridget. He loves her dearly, and she takes excellent care of him."
               "But it seems too bad to leave the little fellow!"
               "He's almost two years old, and you can't expect to take him everywhere you go, or to be always tied to his cradle-post yourself. It will do you good to have a ramble, Ellen. You have been looking pale for two or three weeks."
               The children added their entreaties, and Mrs. Vaun consented to go.
               "But what time shall we start, and when will we get home?" she asked.
               "We must start bright and early. Have breakfast by six o'clock, and we will be off as soon after as is possible. We can get home before dark."
               "Where shall we get our dinners?"
               "Carry them with us. We shan't find very good hotels up there."
               "Mayn't I take my fishing pole, Mr. Vaun?" asked Tommy.
               "The very thing! and I'll take mine too. Cut some nice slices of pork, Mary, and we'll cook our own dinners."
               "What shall we cook them in, and where?" asked Alice, dubiously.
               "You are not versed in the mysteries of mountain life, Miss Alice. Take a frying-pan with you, or broil the fish on the coals, whichever you prefer. What's the matter with you Ralph?"
               "Nothing, sir. But where'll we find a fire?"
               "Carry that along—hadn't we better?"
               "Why, father! we can't do that!" exclaimed Ralph, earnestly. "We should be burned up—wagon and all."
               "Not if we carry it in the shape of a box of matches, Ralph; and we shall find plenty of dry wood. If Mary will put up a loaf of bread and some salt, we will have a famous dinner in the woods."
               The children were out of bed and dressed before sunrise. Ralph came down to his mother's room daintily attired in a pair of white pants, and an embroidered sack that Mrs. Vaun had finished a few days before.
               "Why, Ralph Vaun!" she exclaimed, lifting her head from the pillow, "what have you been about?"
               "Getting ready to go on the mountain. Father said we must get up early. Tommy's up too, and Alice."
               "But what have you got those clothes on for? How perfectly ridiculous!" she continued, laughing. "Go change them immediately."
               "They ain't ridiculous!" said Ralph, fairly startled out of his usual respectful obedience. "It's a real pretty sack, and I like it. You made it."
               "So I did, Ralph, but not for you to wear on the mountain. Go put on the clothes you wore yesterday."
               Ralph lingered with his hand on the door-knob, looking half-puzzled and half-vexed.
               "Obey your mother at once, Ralph," said Mr. Vaun. "I will talk to you about this matter by and by."
               Ralph did as he was told, and came to the table shortly after with his every-day suit on, but a dissatisfied face.
               "Now, come here, my son," said his father, as he finished his last cup of coffee. "Come and tell me all your troubles. I thought you were more of a man than this—to look so unhappy and discontented merely because you are not allowed to wear the coat that you first chose!"
               "That isn't it at all, father," replied the boy, drawing himself up proudly. "But I didn't know what mother meant."
               "Meant when?"
               "When she said my clothes were ridiculous. What made her make them so?"
               Mrs. Vaun laughed.
               "I did not say that your clothes were ridiculous, Ralph. I only said it was ridiculous to think of wearing them on the mountain. The sack is very pretty indeed."
               "But if it is pretty, I should think I might wear it!"
               "It is pretty here, Ralph," said Mr. Vaun, "or to wear at church, or when you are making a visit with your mother or Mary, but it would not be pretty in the woods or on the mountain."
               "Why wouldn't it?"
               "Because it would be out of place. It would not be suitable able, and nothing looks well unless it is. Ask mother how she likes my new overalls."
               Ralph looked inquiringly at his mother, without speaking.
               "Very much," she answered, "in the barn-yard or stable. I don't admire them in the parlor."
               "Well, Ralph," resumed Mr. Vaun, "I admire your sack very much in the parlor; but if I saw it in the woods, making its way through briers and brambles, or clambering up the sides of a mountain, I should not think it pretty at all. Do you understand me?"
               "Yes, sir."
               "Then get your hat; it is time we were off," he said, glancing at his watch. "Mary, are the knives and forks, the frying-pan, and all the other 'fixins' in the wagon?"
               "Yes, sir, they are all ready. I packed them in a basket last night."
               Mrs. Vaun exchanged a few words with Mary in a low voice, and the latter ran down cellar and brought up a large fruit pie, which she placed carefully, wrapped in a napkin, on the top of the basket.
               "Mayn't I sit on the front seat with you, father?" asked Alice, as she was lifted into the "lumber-wagon."
               "Why, my daughter? You will ride more comfortably behind. I have fixed a nice place for you there."
               "Because I like to have you talk to me when we are riding, and describe the trees, and the road, and the rocks, and every thing that we pass. It almost seems as if I could see them."
               "You shall sit just where you choose, Alie. Tommy and Ralph can take the middle seat. There—are you all ready?"
               "Yes," replied Mrs. Vaun. "Good-by, Willie darling. Bridget, you must take good care of him. Let every thing else go."
               "Shure an' I will, ma'am," was Bridget's hearty response. "There shall no harm come to a hair of his head. Good-by, and a fine day to yees all," she added, in reply to the boys' noisy farewells; and the wagon rolled out of the yard.
               Sightless though Alice was, there were none of the party who enjoyed the ride up the mountain more than she did. She could not see the blue skies or the floating clouds, the smiling valleys, the beetling crags and frowning precipices, the dark ravines, the sunny openings, the changing shadows, or the stately trees. But they were all daguerreotyped upon her memory; they were painted upon her heart. And as her father, in glowing words, spoke of one or the other, their images rose clearly and distinctly before her, and she half forgot her blindness.
               "Father," said she, as they were slowly pursuing their "winding way,"—"father, don't you think I ought to be very thankful that I wasn't born blind? If I had been, you know, I could not understand you at all when you speak of the trees, and the flowers, and every beautiful thing."
               "It is indeed a blessing, my daughter. It is a blessing that you can remember, even if you cannot see."
               "And I can hear too. Oh how sweet that is!" she exclaimed, as the wind swept over the pine-trees, and their whispering voices met her ear. "Aren't there cedars about here?"
               "Yes, and hemlock. Ralph, look,—quick! There's a squirrel. Isn't he a beauty?"
               The sun was high in the heavens before they reached the spot where they proposed to fasten their tired horses, stroll about for a while, and partake of their dinners.
               "Where are we going to catch our fish?" asked Tommy, as he alighted from the wagon. "I don't see any brook about here."
               "You'll hear one, if you listen," said Mr. Vaun. "Hark!"
               They all paused, and presently heard the pleasant, dashing sound of waters, half-leaping, half-gliding over a rough and stony bed.
               "You'll find fine fishing just round that rock, Tommy. I stopped here because this was the best place for the horses. Now, ladies," he added, bowing playfully, "allow me to show you Titania's Retreat. Here it is. Tell me, Ellen, Mary—think you the fairy queen ever held her revels in a lovelier spot?"
               "Not hereabouts, certainly," replied Mrs. Vaun, seating herself on a natural sofa, and taking off her bonnet. "Here's the very 
                     
                        'Bank whereon the wild thyme blows,
                        Where ox-lips and the nodding violet grows;
                        Quite over-canopied with bush woodbine——.'
                     
                   But I don't see the 'sweet musk-roses and the eglantine'—where are they?"
               
               "Probably that 'shrewd and knavish sprite, called Robin Goodfellow,' has plucked them up by the roots," replied Mr. Vaun, laughing. "Never mind, we don't need them; and we'll take the liberty of converting her fairy majesty's parlor into a dining-hall. There's a beautiful table all ready for us. Shall we call 'Peas-blossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustard-seed?'"
               "No, sir," said Mary, "not with my consent. You read Bryant's little poem—'the Painted Cup'—the other night. Have you forgotten it?"
               "Not exactly. Still, I hardly know to what your refer."
               "Then your memory isn't very good, sir. Bryant says: 
                     
                        'Call not up,
                        Amid this fresh and virgin solitude,
                        The faded fancies of an elder world.'"
                     
                  
               
               "And you agree with him? Well, so do I. We'll leave the fairies on the other side the Atlantic, where they belong."
               "But we won't banish the 'gentle manitou of flowers,'" said Mary, as she stooped to pick a gorgeously-tinted chalice that grew at her feet. "We will still 
                     
                        'Let him come
                        On summer mornings, when the blossoms wake,
                        And part with little hands the spiky grass;
                        And touching, with his cherry lips, the edge
                        Of these bright beakers, drain the gathered dew.'"
                     
                  
               
               "Beautiful! beautiful!" exclaimed Mr. Vaun. "We do not need the 'faded fancies of an elder world,' that is certain. But where's my fish-pole? has anybody seen it?"
               "Here it is," said Ralph. "I've got it."
               "Ah! Ralph, how you brighten up when we begin to talk English!" said his father, taking the pole.
               "That was English—what you said—wasn't it?"
               "But not very intelligible to little folks. Tommy! where are you?"
               "Here I am, sir," responded a voice from above them. "I've caught one trout already!"
               "I'm coming to try my luck, presently. But first I'll make a fire somewhere about here, for your culinary operations. Where shall we have our kitchen?"
               "Not too near the parlor," responded Mrs. Vaun. "Round behind that clump of trees would be a good place."
               "Just leave me the matches, if you please, sir, and I'll make the fire myself," said Mary. "Ralph shall help me. Or would you rather go to Tommy?" she continued, taking the match-box.
               "Tommy says I scare the trout when I'm up there. I wish I was big enough to fish. When will I be?" the little fellow replied.
               "You're big enough now to fish—after a fashion," said Mr. Vaun. "I'll cut you a pole. Mary, have you got a piece of twine?"
               "Yes, sir. Here's a bit that was tied round the basket."
               Mr. Vaun fastened a fish-hook to the piece of twine, and that in its turn to the pole. Then he led Ralph to a shady seat, some distance below himself and Tommy.
               "There, Ralph. You may fish just as long as you have a mind too; only look out that you don't fall in. It isn't deep enough to do him any harm if he does," he added, as he walked away.
               Before he had taken many steps, Ralph recalled him.
               "Father! father! There isn't any worm on my hook. I can't catch any fish so!"
               "Can't you? I don't believe it will make any difference with your success, one way or another. But I will bait your hook for you;" and having done so, he went to his own station at a "deep hole" farther up stream.
               Mary made the fire, spread the clean, white cloth upon their impromptu table, and arranged upon it sundry plates, and knives, and forks.
               "Better leave the bread and pie in the basket, until we are ready for our dinner, Mary," said Mrs. Vaun, who was gathering a bunch of fragrant wild-flowers for Alice.
               "I'm going to set the basket in the shade, somewhere," she replied, looking around for some cool, sheltered nook. "The butter is very soft—almost melted."
               "What is it in? I didn't see you when you put it up."
               "In a little tin-pail."
               "Fasten the cover on tightly then, and set it in the brook. It will be hard enough by the time we want it. Oh dear! I wish I could manufacture a vase out of something or other."
               "A vase, mother! What do you want of a vase?" asked Alice.
               
               "I want to put some of these flowers on the table. They're beautiful," she said. "Isn't there any kind of a dish that you can spare, Mary?"
               "Nothing but the pepper-box," replied Mary, laughing. "I've been making a salt-cellar out of birch-bark, and I suppose I can make a 'pepper-cellar' to match. Shall I empty it?"
               "Yes," said Mrs. Vaun, slowly. "I must have something. But that won't hold many. Where did you find that birch-bark?"
               "On a tree in the kitchen! Shall I bring you some?" and scarcely waiting for a reply, she darted away after it.
               "What are you going to do with the bark, mother?" said Alice.
               "Make some mock vases. We'll put the pepper-box in the centre of the table, and a birch-bark vase at each corner."
               "But they won't hold water!"
               "No; but I will wrap the stalks in wet moss, and they will keep fresh a good while. The bark would hold water if I could fasten it together properly; but I haven't the materials for that here."
               "The Indians make canoes out of birch-bark, don't they?"
               "Yes, and a good many beautiful things. Thank you, Mary, I sha'n't need half this."
               "I want a little piece for my 'pepper-cellar,'" said Mary, gayly, as she threw herself upon the grass, and tossed off her bonnet. "Simplicity seems to be the order of the day."
               "I wonder if there were ever any Indians here—right where we are!" said Alice, in a low, dreamy tone, as if she were scarcely addressing those around her.
               "There is no doubt of it, Alice," replied her mother, "none at all. Such a fine trout stream as this would never have escaped them, even if they had had no eyes for the grand and beautiful. But they had. Those dark-browed warriors were men of excellent tastes, in some respects."
               "Very well added, Mrs. Vaun," said Mary. "Some of their tastes—most of them indeed—would hardly accord with our ideas of excellence."
               "Standards differ. Don't say any thing against my red friends, Mary, or I shall pick a quarrel with you. I am always ready to throw down the gauntlet in their behalf."
               "And as I, certainly, am not always ready to take it up, I won't tempt you to do so. Alice!"
               Alice started, as if the war-whoop of the red man had fallen upon her ear.
               "Was that you, Mary?"
               "To be sure it was, I wanted to call you back."
               "Call me back! I wasn't going anywhere."
               "Weren't you?" said Mary, laughing. "I thought you had gone as far back as 1723 at all events, and had peopled these hills and valleys with savages again. Oh, what a string of fish!" she exclaimed, as Mr. Vaun and Tommy appeared, well laden.
               "Pretty well for an hour's work," replied the former. "But where's Ralph?" and he looked hastily around.
               "Ralph!" echoed Mrs. Vaun, in a tone of alarm. "I supposed he was with you!"
               "I haven't seen him for the last half hour. He hallooed to me that he was tired of fishing, and I told him to come to you."
               Mrs. Vaun's cheek grew deathly pale, and she sank back upon the turf from which she had risen.
               "The brook—the brook!" she faintly murmured.
               "Don't be alarmed, Ellen. The water is not deep enough to do him any harm," said Mr. Vaun; but he turned hurriedly and retraced his steps to the little stream. Mary and Tommy had already darted away in opposite directions.
               Mrs. Vaun sat for a moment with her hands pressed to her face. Then she sprang to her feet, and would have followed her husband; but at that instant he turned, and cast a hasty glance backward.
               "Don't leave Alice alone, Ellen," he cried. "We shall find Ralph in a minute. Stay where you are."
               Mrs. Vaun hesitated, looking alternately at Alice and in the direction of the brawling, babbling brook. Presently, however, she came back to the former—who was sitting on the grass, motionless as a statue, almost as white, and listening intently to the faintest sound—threw herself down by her side, and laid her head in her lap.
               Mary had rushed to the banks of the stream, and was gazing anxiously up and down, half afraid to look in the little eddies and mimic whirlpools, and beneath the clumps of bushes that grew close to the water's edge. Tommy was clambering up the rocks at some distance above her. Mr. Vaun called to him:
               "Tommy, you are looking in the wrong direction. Go down stream!"
               For half an hour they followed the windings of the stream—and one more capricious and irregular, was never born amid the wild and solitary grandeur of those mountain passes—shouting Ralph's name, and then pausing to listen for a reply.
               But only the mocking echoes answered them.
               "This won't answer," said Mr. Vaun, coming to a sudden stop, and wiping the perspiration from his forehead. "We are going the wrong way. He could not have wandered farther down than this, and—"
               He paused, and looked around with a searching eye.
               "But if he has fallen in!" said Mary, in a low voice. She could not trust herself to say "if he is drowned."
               "If he has," replied Mr. Vaun, speaking with a visible effort, "he would not have floated farther. We must go back."
               They were but a very few moments retracing their way. Anxiety lent them wings.
               After ascertaining that Ralph was not with his mother, they again prepared to start in pursuit of him.
               "Oh, I must go with you!" exclaimed Mrs. Vaun, while tears were streaming from her eyes. "I know I can find him!"
               "Never mind me, mother," said Alice. "I can stay here. I won't stir."
               "But I don't think it is safe to leave you alone here, Alice," replied her father. "And you are not strong enough either, darling," he continued, in a lower voice, as he stooped to kiss his wife's pale forehead. "You are not strong enough to go. Stay here, and do not be frightened. I am sure Ralph is not in the water; he has only wandered off and lost his way. We will bring him back very soon."
               Mrs. Vaun made no reply, but she wound her arm about Alice's waist, and leaned her head upon her shoulder.
               Tommy had been examining the spot where Ralph was fishing.
               "There's something that looks a little like a path, leading back into the woods, just below there," he said, coming up at that instant. "Hadn't I better follow it?"
               "I will go there myself," Mr. Vaun answered. "Mary, do you and Tommy follow this path to the right. Keep together, and remember this tall tree, so that you can find your way back."
               On, and on, and on they wandered, every now and then calling, "Ralph! Ralph!" sometimes separately, and sometimes in concert.
               "It seems to me that he would hear us, if he were anywhere about here," said Mary. "Mr. Vaun hasn't found him, for I hear him shouting. Oh! that brook! It will kill his mother!"
               "You don't think he is drowned, Mary? Oh, it can't be! it can't be!"
               "I don't know, Tommy. But it is very strange we don't find him. He could not have gone so very far in such a little while. We had better go back, and look somewhere else."
               They did so; not following, however, exactly the same course by which they came.
               "Oh, Mary, what splendid blackberries!" exclaimed Tommy, as they came to a plot of comparatively open ground, thickly covered with bushes. "I never saw such monsters!"
               Mary was too anxious to admire blackberries. But how to get around or through the bushes, required some thought.
               "We shall have to make our way along here 'Indian file,' Tommy. How the trees on each side are pressed together!" and gathering her skirts closely about her, she went on, frequently forced to pause and disengage herself from the briers. At length they were all passed, and she stopped to shake out her clothes, and wait for Tommy, who was behind her.
               Presently she gave a low scream of delight.
               "Tommy, Tommy, come here—quick—do!"
               There lay Master Ralph close to the bushes, with his head pillowed on his arm, fast asleep. His straw hat was on the ground by his side, lined with oak-leaves, and nearly filled with the large, shining berries. Just then, while Mary and Tommy were looking at him, he raised himself on one elbow, rubbed his eyes, and stared about him with a bewildered air.
               "Oh, you rogue!" exclaimed Mary. "You have frightened us all half out of our wits!"
               "How? I haven't done any thing to scare you," said Ralph, in a sleepy tone, and slowly winking, while his head manifested a strong inclination to seek the ground.
               
               "I shouldn't think you had! We were afraid you were in the brook, or somewhere where you ought not to be. But you mustn't go to sleep again, Ralph. You must run to your mother as fast as you can."
               "Where are my berries?" he asked, looking around.
               "Here they are," said Tommy. "I'll carry them for you. How did you get here, Ralph?"
               "Why, I couldn't catch one single fish, and father told me I might go to mother and Mary. And when I was going along I saw a blackberry bush, and then another, and another, and I thought I would pick some berries for our dinner. I don't see what you were scared for! I've been a berrying a great many times."
               "How do you suppose you would have found your way back alone?" said Mary.
               "Just as easy! I should have walked right along where we are walking now."
               "Maybe so. But I shouldn't know which way to go, if it were not for that tall tree. That is close to the place where your mother and Alice are."
               They were hurrying along at a rapid rate, for Mary longed to relieve Mrs. Vaun's anxiety. Tommy hit his toes against the roots of a tree, and over he went, berries and all.
               "Oh, that's too bad!" said Ralph, almost crying. "I wanted to carry them to mother."
               "Run along, Ralph, you and Mary. It's only a few steps now, and I will pick the berries up," replied Tommy. "They aren't hurt at all—nor I either," he added, in reply to a commiserating look from Mary.
               In a very few moments Ralph was clasped to his mother's heart, while her soft kisses were showered upon his lips and brow.
               "Oh, Ralph, my child! how could you do so? I thought you were surely drowned!"
               "I was only just a blackberrying, mother. See, ain't they nice ones?" he asked, as Tommy came up with the hat.
               "But you must never stray off so again, Ralph. You are not old enough. You couldn't have found your way back possibly. What would have become of you, if Mary hadn't happened to go to the very spot where you were?"
               "Oh, I shouldn't have starved—there were a great many blackberries. And I like to sleep in the woods."
               "Yes, in the day-time. I imagine you would tell a different story when it begins to grow dark. Tommy, go to that path and call Mr. Vaun. Perhaps he will hear you."
               But he had already heard their voices, and Tommy met him coming towards them.
               "Now for dinner!" said Mary, when the joyful tumult had subsided. "I, for one, am pretty hungry. Tommy, just dress some of those fish, while I look to the fire. I presume it has gone out."
               By the time the fish were prepared, the fire was in readiness.
               "I'm going to cook the fish myself, Mary," said Mr. Vaun. "You attend to your table."
               "A great deal you know about cooking," said his wife, laughing. "When did you take lessons?"
               "Longer ago than I care to remember," he replied, with a half sigh, and a whole smile. "I've cooked fish in the woods many a time. Where's the frying-pan, Mary, and the pork?"
               "At the fire, sir. But—"
               "I see you are all very much afraid I shall spoil your dinner; but I shall do no such thing. You'll say you never ate better fish."
               Mary stood at a little distance, laughing at Mr. Vaun as he burned his face over the fire, or started back when the hot fat snapped and sputtered, whenever he attempted to turn the fish.
               "Stop laughing, Mary, or you sha'n't have any dinner. Oh! we must broil some of these beauties. Bring me a couple, Tommy, and then hang the rest in the water, until we are ready to go home."
               Meanwhile Mrs. Vaun filled her birch-bark vases, and arranged a seat for Alice. Mary brought the bread and the pie, and soon the two dishes of fish were smoking upon the table.
               "Where's the butter, Mary? aren't we going to have any?" asked Mr. Vaun, after he had placed a goodly portion of more solid food upon each plate.
               "Oh, I set the pail in the brook to keep it cool," she replied, springing up. "I will bring it in a minute."
               It was full five before she returned, empty handed.
               
               "It's gone down stream, or else the fishes have stolen it," she said, with a ludicrously grave face. "There isn't the least sign of either butter or pail."
               How they all laughed! Little things amuse light hearts.
               "But are you sure it's gone, Mary?" said Mrs. Vaun, as soon as she could speak.
               "Perfectly sure, ma'am. I looked all about there."
               "Never mind," remarked Mr. Vaun, "we can do without it, that's very certain. Such bread and fish are not to be despised, even without butter."
               "And such pie and berries!" added Ralph.
               "Mr. Vaun, what was the reason that Ralph didn't hear us when we called him?" asked Tommy.
               "Why, I was asleep!" interrupted Ralph.
               "I know it; but we made noise enough to wake forty boys of your size."
               "That blackberry patch is in a sort of a hollow, if I remember aright," said Mr. Vaun. "The sound passed over him, probably."
               Ample justice was done to that meal in the green-wood; and there was little, save dirty dishes, to pack away in the basket. A long ramble in search of flowers, mosses, and all sorts of curiosities, had been in the programme of the day; but they were all tired enough to throw themselves on the grass, and keep quiet, during the short time that intervened between dinner and the hour when they proposed starting for home.
               They were half down the mountain when a sudden gust of wind swept over the tree-tops, making them moan and shiver most piteously. Mr. Vaun checked his horses and looked around him.
               "We are going to have a thunder-shower; a hard one, the clouds say. We must try to get out of these woods before it reaches us. It is better to be wet, than to be crushed by falling trees;" and gathering up the reins, he urged the horses forward, at as rapid a pace as was consistent with safety.
               The thunder muttered and rumbled in the distance. Now and then a fierce flash of lightning made them close their eyes instinctively, and large drops of rain splashed in their faces. The children grew silent, and drew more closely together, while Mrs. Vaun looked anxiously at the threatening clouds.
               "If there was a house, or any sort of a shanty about here!" she said.
               "There is a house a little way below. I am trying to reach it before the storm does," replied Mr. Vaun; "but it is a doubtful case."
               The horses seemed to understand what was required of them, and dashed on with a speed that would have terrified Mrs. Vaun, if any other hand than that of her husband had held the reins. She was never afraid when he was driving.
               Tommy and Ralph were on a keen look-out for the house.
               "Is it very near here, father?" asked the former.
               "I can't tell exactly. I have a kind of an idea that we shall come in sight of it when we turn that sharp corner."
               But he was mistaken. The road stretched before him in an almost straight line for some ways, but no house or other vestige of humanity met their gaze.
               Louder and nearer grew the thunder; faster and faster plashed the rain. The clouds became denser and darker every moment, and there was a preternatural stillness, save when the wind sighed and soughed, or the thunder roared.
               "There it is! I see the house!" cried Tommy, as the horses swept round a broad curve, and a log tenement rose before them. Had it been the stateliest mansion in the land, they could not have greeted it more gladly.
               "Quick, now!" exclaimed Mr. Vaun, as he dropped the reins, and sprang to the ground. "The rain will fall in torrents in a moment. Run in; don't wait for ceremony;" and taking Alice in his arms, he set her down just within the door, and then hurried back to find a shelter for his horses.
               "May we intrude upon you for a few moments, ma'am, until the shower is over?" asked Mrs. Vaun, with a conciliating smile, as a tall, gaunt woman rose from her seat by the fire, at their approach.
               "Wall, I don't know as you kin find a decent place to sit down," she replied, bustling about, and seizing a broom. "Louisy Matildy, take Phil's dish o' pudden' and 'lasses out o' that ere cheer, and wipe it out, afore the lady sets down in it."
               An untidy girl of fourteen or fifteen summers, who needed only soap, water, a good hair-brush, and decently clean clothes, to have made her really pretty, advanced to do her mother's bidding, while their hostess herself began sweeping most vigorously.
               Mrs. Vaun thought that treading dirt beneath her feet, even at the risk of soiled skirts and stockings, was far preferable to breathing it.
               "Don't trouble yourself, ma'am," she said; "it is entirely unnecessary; and do not move the little boy's pudding on my account," she added, as Phil gave a loud scream, and seized the plate with both hands; "I prefer standing."
               "Take it right away from him, Louisy Matildy. Phil, ain't you ashamed o' yourself, acting so afore folks, eh?" and lifting him by one arm, the mother placed him on the floor in the farthest corner. "Now stay there."
               Then wiping the chair with her apron, she pushed it towards Mrs. Vaun.
               "You'd better set down. It's as cheap settin' as standin'."
               Mrs. Vaun could not refuse.
               "Thank you. You have one advantage here on the mountain, ma'am, this hot weather. It is much cooler than on the plains."
               "Wall, I can't see as there's much advantage 'bout it, anyhow. But it don't do a speck o' good for me to say a word agin livin' here. He will do just as he's a mind to, for all me."
               "Probably your husband finds it profitable," said Mrs. Vaun. "I see you have a fine lot of young cattle."
               "Humph! they're just decent, when you come to see 'em near by. They don't bring in nothin' now; I d'no' as they ever will. He ain't no hand at makin' a bargain."
               Here the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of the gentleman under consideration, followed by two half-grown boys. They were dripping wet; and, having come in at the back-door, had not see Mr. Vaun and the horses—to say nothing of Tommy—under the shed which fronted the road. They started back in amazement at the unexpected apparition of Mrs. Vaun and her party.
               "Come on to the mountain a pleasuring, ma'am?" said the man, after exchanging a few words with his wife.
               "Yes; and very fortunately we reached your house just in time to escape the shower."
               "The heft on't, you mean. I see that smallest gall got wet some;" and he pointed to Alice's sleeve.
               "A little—only a trifle. She was on the front seat with her father, and was more exposed than the rest of us. Does it look like clearing up?"
               The man looked out of one of the small four-paned windows, and shook his head dubiously.
               "Can't say it doos. Should'nt wonder if it rained all night. Ain't there somethin' or 'nother kinder curus about that gall?" he continued, staring intently at Alice as he spoke. "Seems to me there is!"
               Alice colored painfully, while her mother replied:
               "She is blind."
               "Blind? You don't say so! Wall, I never! Born so, ma'am?"
               "No; it was occasioned by sickness."
               "I do declare! Meesles, or canker-rash, most likely?"
               "Yes—scarlet-fever."
               Miss "Louisy Matildy" had by this time emerged from the bedroom, with her hair in a little better order, a pair of mismated shoes on her feet, and a large blue glass breast-pin fastened to the front of her dress. She sidled up to look at Alice, who was suddenly metamorphosed into a curiosity. "Phil" stole out from his corner, and the boys and their mother joined the circle.
               "It's dreadful to think on!" said the woman, presently; "but it don't come so hard on you as 'twould on poor folks."
               Mary, who was watching Alice with a very different motive, soon perceived that the scene in which she was bearing so conspicuous a part, was becoming too much for her. Her cheeks were crimson, her long eyelashes drooped heavily, and a large tear gathered beneath them. Mary sprang up, and placing herself in such a position as to shield Alice from observation, began to ask "Louisy Matildy" a host of questions about mountain life. That young lady, like her mother, expressed herself highly dissatisfied. She wanted to "go down and live amongst folks."
               Meanwhile the boys were teasing for their suppers.
               "We hain't had a mite to eat sense mornin'," said the eldest. "So, come now, gin us our suppers, right off. Louisy Matildy, come, why don't you stir your stumps?"
               "Cause I ain't a mind to, Josh Wilkins," replied the "bonnie nie lassie," with a very dignified air. "Ain't you 'shamed o' yourself to speak so?"
               Her brother stared at her as if in astonishment.
               "You don't, though! Oh! where'd you get so much breast-pin? Pete Smith gin it to you Sunday night, didn't he? Ha, ha! ha, ha!"
               "Stop your noise, Josh," said his mother, angrily. "I'll get your suppers bime-by. You won't starve yet a while, I'll warrant."
               "Don't let us disturb you, ma'am," interposed Mrs. Vaun. "The boys must be hungry. Pray give them their suppers."
               "Wall, I thought I'd get somethin' for your folks to eat first. Louisy Matildy, hang on the kettle."
               "Oh, no; not by any means! We had a late dinner, and we shall get home in good season for tea. The shower seems to be passing over. Do not wait on our account," said Mrs. Vaun, hastily. To tell the truth, the cups and plates that stood in the open cupboard were not of a very inviting color.
               There were no evidences of poverty in that mountain-home—none, at least, of the poverty that affects the body; but there were many of sloth and negligence. There was plenty of the "bread that perisheth,"—nothing, absolutely nothing, alimental to the mind and soul. Mary wondered as she looked upon the discontented, spiritless wife and daughter, and the dull, inanimate, soulless faces of the husband and sons, after the first flush of curiosity had died away—wondered what they had to live for—how they could even dream of happiness.
               The table was lifted into the middle of the floor. Its coat of varnish had long since disappeared, and the paint was now going in search of it. No neat white cloth covered the various stains and scratches, no plates were arranged upon it. A knife, fork, and spoon, and a thick slice of rye and Indian bread, were laid for each member of the family. A huge pan of baked beans stood in the middle of the table, and a plate of butter.
               Ralph watched the preparations with a curious eye.
               "Mother," he whispered, as the family seated themselves, after having again invited Mrs. Vaun to partake with them, "mother, they've forgotten the plates."
               "Hush!" said his mother, "hush!"
               But his eyes grew larger than ever, when he saw each one take his spoon or knife, as he preferred, dip it into the pan of beans, and literally help himself. The butter met precisely the same treatment; and one large pitcher served to quench the thirst of the whole group.
               It was not a very agreeable sight; and Mrs. Vaun sprang up with alacrity when her husband appeared at the door, saying that the rain had nearly ceased, and he thought they might venture to go on.
               "Better not be in too big a hurry," said Mrs. Wilkins. "This ain't a very nice place, but it's better than nothing."
               "Thank you; but we have a long way to ride;" and slipping a small piece of silver into Phil's hand, they took their departure, glad enough to breathe the fresh air again.
               "Well, Ralph," said Mr. Vaun, as they were leisurely completing the descent of the mountain, "how should you like to live there—where we stopped?"
               "I shouldn't like it at all. I wouldn't live there."
               "Why not?"
               "Why, father, you never saw such queer folks! They don't have a table-cloth, nor any plates, but every one dips his spoon right into the dish!"
               His father smiled at his horror-stricken face.
               "Which is the worst, Ralph, to have plenty of food and no plates, or to have plates, but nothing to put on them?"
               Willie was clapping his little hands when they drove into the yard. At an early hour they sought their pillows; and for many weeks their day on the mountain furnished food for thought, and words for the tongue.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           With reverence be it spoken, I will try
                           To overcome the lightness of my nature.
                        
                     
                     —FAUST.
                  
               
               SEPTEMBER came all too soon for Mary.
               "I don't know what has become of this last year," said she, as she sat in Mrs. Vaun's nursery one morning, busily engaged with her sewing. "It has flown like a dream."
               
               "A happy one, I hope?" responded Mrs. Vaun, with a smile. "It ought not to seem like a dream, though, for it has left enduring traces behind it. The denizens of dreamland do not often make as rapid progress in Latin and French asyou have during the past twelve months. Mr. Vaun says it is really wonderful."
               The smile that lit up Mary's face as she replied, rivalled that of her kind friend in sweetness and brilliancy.
               "Probably they do not have as powerful incentives. I have been so anxious to prepare myself for teaching this Carrolton school; and yet, now that the time is drawing near, I feel almost inclined to shrink from the task. Strange, isn't it?"
               "Not by any means. Most people shrink instinctively from whatever is new and untried. Did you ever start on a journey without feeling, when the moment of departure had arrived, a strong inclination to unpack your trunk, hang up your dresses, lay away your finery, and stay at home?"
               "I never started on a journey but once," said Mary, laughing, "and that was when I came to Farmingdale; so I have not much experience in the matter. I know I felt then very much as if I would prefer staying where I was. Dear, good Mrs. Gibson! how I should like to see her, and Fanny, too! I mean to go there some time."
               "How is it about Tommy's clothes, Mary? He will have to have, at least, one new suit, will he not?"
               "Yes, I suppose he will; but it must not be a very expensive one. I don't know but the coat he is wearing for his best one now, will answer until my first quarter's payments come in. He has shirts enough; and Mrs. Thompson told me the other day, that she claimed the right to provide his stockings."
               "What a good, motherly soul she is! There isn't a person in the neighborhood that I should miss half as much. But it's a mystery to me, Mary, when you made all those shirts."
               "I hardly know myself. They were in my work-basket for a long time. But they are done now, that's one consolation—enough to last him more than a year. Oh! have you seen Alice's last story?"
               "No; I didn't know she had finished it."
               "She finished it last night. It appears to me that it is vastly better than any thing she has written."
               "The dear child! She is a busy little spirit. And do you not think her character is a singular one? She is at once so childish and yet so womanly."
               Mrs. Vaun was right. Alice was a child in manner and appearance; diffident and retiring in no ordinary degree; shrinking from the notice of strangers, and rarely speaking unless she was addressed. Perhaps the consciousness that her tongue was an unfaithful interpreter of her thoughts, that her lips never did justice to the emotions that swelled her heart, made her unusually silent; and she flew to her pen in order to gratify that "craving for utterance" which would else have worn her very life away. Yet the long hours of solitary self-communion, uninterrupted by intercourse with the visible world, which were hers, in spite of all the watchful precautions of her friends, strengthened and elevated her spirit, until 
                     
                        "Her lightest word or fancy,
                        Unarrayed for human ear,
                        Might be echoed by an angel
                        Watching near!"
                     
                  
               
               "I feel as if we ought to do something about Mary," said Mrs. Vaun to her husband, about a week after the conversation narrated above; "but I hardly know how to manage."
               "Well, really, Mrs. Vaun," was the laughing response. "You are exceedingly choice and definite in your mode of expression. What idea do you intend to convey by 'something about Mary?' and what is it that you 'hardly know how to manage?' You are too deep for me."
               "Why, you know she said that I must not pay her any thing this year, and manifested so much feeling about it, that I don't like to allude to it again. But, really, I cannot see that she has been of much less assistance to me this year than she was last. She has not sewed quite as much, it is true; but she has accomplished a good deal even in that line; and she has not neglected Alice at all. At all events, if she had not been here, I should have been obliged to have had some one in her place. And she needs the money. She has but little, and both herself and Tommy ought to have more clothes before they go to Carrolton."
               "What do they need more particularly?"
               "Mary ought to have a good black silk dress. She would shake her head and look grave, if I should tell her so; and say that if she had any money to spare, it must go towards a coat for Tommy. She isn't a bit like other girls. I believe she would be willing to wear ninepenny calico all her life, if, by so doing, she could clothe that boy well, and send him to college."
               "The world would be better off if there were more girls like her, that's a sure case. And Tommy is worth working for. But about that dress. If she needs one, she must have it."
               "She does need it. It is necessary for the success of her school that she should dress well—respectably, I mean. She has few acquaintances in Carrolton; and the first impression she makes upon the ladies there will be affected, more than you men can possibly imagine, by her being tastefully and genteelly dressed, or the contrary. I suppose you think it's all nonsense," she continued, as Mr. Vaun smiled comically; "but it is just exactly so."
               "I don't doubt it, dear, at all. I was only wondering why Mary couldn't be just as 'genteel' in calico as in silk. But the best thing you can do, is to get the dress without saying any thing to her about it. Call it a present or not, just as you choose. If you were going to pay her the money, how much should you think she had earned?"
               "Fifty dollars, at the very lowest calculation. I do not believe I could have found any one who would have filled her place, for any thing like that. She think's Tommy's board is a great deal; but I doubt whether our house-bills amount to a farthing more than they would if he were not here."
               "His board is nothing; and as for the Latin lessons, they have been merely an amusement to me. I'm going to Carrolton to-morrow; and if you will go along, we will get the dress, and whatever else you think best."
               "A coat for Tommy, then, for one thing. The one he keeps for his best now, is just fit to wear to the academy, and he needs another for extra occasions."
               The dress and coat were bought, as well as some smaller articles. Mary had herself commissioned Mrs. Vaun to purchase a couple of school dresses, and a few yards of muslin; and therefore was not surprised when a goodly-sized bundle was placed in her hands. But when she opened it, and saw the lustrous silk, a neatly embroidered collar, and the cloth for the coat, the color flashed to her face, and she dropped them on the table, as if, to use Ralph's words, they had burned her.
               Mrs. Vaun was watching her, with a smile on her lip.
               "Aren't you pleased with my selections, Mary?"
               "Pleased! But, Mrs. Vaun, are all these things for me?"
               "For you and Tommy."
               "They are beautiful. That silk is elegant; but—"
               "I haven't been running you in debt, Mary," said Mrs. Vaun, laughing, as she rightly interpreted the expression of her face. "I have as great a horror of that, as even yourself. The things are all paid for."
               "But with whose money?"
               "Your own."
               "Now, Mrs. Vaun, I know you are only amusing yourself at my expense," said Mary, with as near an approach to anger as she had manifested since she had been in the family; "and I wish you wouldn't. I am not in the mood for it to-night;" and pushing them farther back, she sat down on the sofa. But Mrs. Vaun noticed the trembling lips and quivering eyelids.
               "My dear Mary," she said, as she seated herself beside her, "I was not joking, or trying to tease you. The things are yours, and were bought with your own money. You must allow me to judge for myself whether I am indebted to you. I certainly am; and these articles do not amount to as much as I should have been obliged to have given any one who would do as much as you have done in my family."
               "But I can't think so, Mrs. Vaun. I've had time to study, and—"
               "You have made time; how I do not pretend to know. You certainly have not neglected any duty that you owed to me or mine. Take these articles, dear Mary, and regard them as your own just dues. You have fairly earned them, and I cannot tell you with what pleasure I feel that it is so;" and twining her arm about Mary's waist, Mrs. Vaun kissed her as fondly as if she had been a younger sister.
               How warmly it was returned! How confidingly Mary nestled in those friendly arms! How quietly and happily flowed her tears!
               "I'm a queer girl to cry so, when I ought to laugh," she said at length, lifting her head from Mrs. Vaun's shoulder. "Oh, let me go, let me go! Mr. Vaun is coming, and if he finds me crying, I never shall hear the last of it. Do please let me go, Mrs. Vaun;" and breaking from her laughing friend's embrace, she escaped through one door, as Mr. Vaun entered at another.
               "Did you think to inquire whether Mrs. Pierce had concluded to take boarders?" she asked, when, all traces of tears having disappeared, she re-entered the library half an hour afterwards.
               "Of course I did," replied Mr. Vaun. "She says her daughter is so feeble that she has made up her mind to 'live alone for a spell.' And then I went to see Miss Skinner."
               "Miss Skinner! But what did she say?"
               "She will take both yourself and Tommy. What makes you exclaim 'Miss Skinner!' so dolefully, and with such a long-drawn sigh after it?"
               "Nothing. Only they say she is so very particular about every thing."
               "'They' often make very strange mistakes in estimating characters. But even if she is very particular—even notional—I think you will find her an excellent hostess. There will be no other boarders, and you will have two pleasant bedrooms—one for yourself, and one for Tommy, and the use of her parlor whenever your friends call to see you."
               "I shall like there being no other boarders. I wonder she consented to take us!"
               "Why?"
               "Oh, boys of Tommy's age are so noisy, and so apt to be mischievous. I wonder she wasn't afraid of him."
               "She was a little," said Mr. Vaun, laughing. "She said she wouldn't have two boys in her house for an 'interest in Goshen,' but thought 'maybe she might manage one.' Tommy, you must never go in at the wrong door, or look out of the wrong window, or forget to scrape your feet, or brush the dust off your coat, before entering the house."
               "And you mustn't touch the brasses with your ungloved hand," continued Mrs. Vaun. "I wonder if Miss Skinner's door-knobs ever did need polishing! or lay so much as a finger upon one of her shining tables. They are equal to a mirror any time."
               "Nor go up a whole flight of stairs at four steps, as you did the other day," added Mary. "Nor leave your hat in one room, and your gloves in another, and your books in a third. And when you have occasion to change your clothes, it might be as well not to toss one boot in the corner, and the other under the bed, and your stockings under the table, and your cravat on it, and your pants in the middle of the floor, and your coat—"
               "Oh Mary, do stop and take breath," said Tommy, with a smile, but coloring deeply. "I know well enough what you mean. But I was in such a hurry that day!"
               "And I'm afraid you will be in a hurry all your life, if you don't look out, Tommy. You will be, certainly, if you don't learn to be orderly and methodical about your business."
               "I'm going to be, Mary. I'm going to turn over a new leaf just as soon as ever we get to Carrolton. I'll be just as sober and steady then—you'll hardly know me!"
               "Why not begin now?" said Mary, laughing, and passing her hand caressingly over the mass of rich brown hair that lay upon her brother's forehead. "You are just like little Jane Foster, Tommy. 'To-morrow night at sundown' she was going to 'begin to be good'—but she couldn't possibly begin before."
               "Mary!" exclaimed Mr. Vaun, suddenly. "Isn't that boy ever going to be called any thing but 'Tommy?'"
               "Really, I don't know, sir," was the gay response. "Does he merit a better name?"
               "He merits one rather less babyish. Why, he'll be only 'little Tommy' all his life, if we don't commence calling him something else pretty soon. What say you, Tommy? are you to be 'Thomas,' or 'Mr. Lester,' after you go to Carrolton?"
               But Tommy only laughed, and said he didn't think it was of much consequence; he'd as lief be called Tommy as any thing else.
               "You will always be Tommy to me—my own little brother Tommy," said Mary, affectionately. "You'll never be too old for that, will you, dear?" and she wondered why it was that she had to struggle so hard to keep her tears back—why something seemed rising in her throat to choke her, and why her voice fell.
               "What—not when he has graduated?" said Mr. Vaun. "For my part, I'm going to call him Thomas after this."
               
               "So will I, before strangers," replied Mary. "But I need not when we are by ourselves."
               A little while afterwards Mr. Vaun looked up from the paper he was reading.
               "Thomas, I wish you would see if there are any apples in the house. I should like one."
               'Thomas' did not move or look up, and the request was repeated.
               "Did you speak to me, sir? I beg your pardon. I did not hear you," said he, when at length, by a species of magnetism, he felt that every eye in the room was upon him.
               "You didn't know your name. That was the trouble, and it is one that I anticipated. Now will you see if you can find some apples?"
               "Yes, sir. I shall know who you mean next time;" and he departed, leaving a laughing group behind him.
               A few weeks more found Mary and Tommy fairly established in their new home.
               The school opened most auspiciously, and at the end of the first week, Mary had as many pupils as she could attend to.
               "Is your mother going to send Emma to Miss Lester's school?" asked Miss Langdon (one of the young ladies who patronized the Carrolton Female Seminary) to a companion, on their way to recitation.
               "No indeed she isn't, not by a great deal," responded Miss Andrews.
               "Why not? Our Fanny goes, and she thinks there never was such a school, or such a teacher as Miss Lester."
               "Humph!" muttered Miss Andrews, whose father was one of the wealthiest merchants in town. "I can't help it if she does. The school never will be any thing, for the teacher ain't anybody herself;" and here the speaker lowered her voice, and bent her head so close to that of her friend (?), that she nearly ran against one of the college students before she perceived him.
               "Mercy! I didn't see Frank Mills. Why didn't you tell me he was coming?" and the whispering continued for some minutes longer.
               "It don't seem possible," said Miss Langdon, as her companion ceased. "Ain't you mistaken?"
               "Not a bit of it. This Mary Lester is the very same girl that was spinning at Mrs. Thompson's two or three years ago—maybe more. I was riding out that way with father, you see, and I was thirsty, and went into the house to get some water. This girl was at work at the wheel in one corner of the room—no, I don't know but it was a loom—and I took a good look at her. When she came into meeting yesterday, I knew her right away. I don't know when I've been so thunderstruck! If Emma had been to school before that, I should have made ma take her out at once. Emma Andrews going to school to a spinning-girl, or a weaver! That would be great!" and the fair speaker's lip (she really was fair—surpassingly so) curled in contemptuous scorn.
               "But they say she is an excellent scholar," said Grace Langdon.
               "Understands arithmetic, probably, and maybe geography; but she can't be competent to teach such a school as she has started. It's all humbug; and of course she has no air, no manner. She won't be able to—to—," and Miss Andrews, somewhat at a loss how to convey her meaning, finished the sentence by a toss of the head.
               "Sophia Solace says she has joined the advanced French class at the seminary; and she is taking lessons in Latin of Tutor Ainsworth from the college, twice a week."
               "Oh, nonsense! I don't believe a word of it. Where could she have studied French and Latin? Soph always knows everybody's business; and what she don't know, she can guess at. I never have seen this school-ma'am up to the seminary."
               "The advanced French recite in the lower recitation-room, at the same time that we recite in rhetoric up stairs. Who is that lady coming down street?"
               But Miss Andrews drew her veil more closely over her face, and hurried past the stranger without replying. Miss Langdon, however, turned for a second glance.
               "Who is it, Caddy, do you know? How gracefully she walks!"
               "How should I know? Maybe it's Senator Strong's niece,—she's come."
               "No it is not. I've seen her, and she can't hold a candle to this lady. I wonder who she is!"
               Just at that moment little Fanny Langdon came running along with her satchel of books.
               
               "Oh, sister Grace, did you see Miss Lester? Ain't she sweet?"
               "Miss Lester! Where?"
               "Why that lady who passed you. I saw you looking at her."
               "Was that Miss Lester?"
               "Yes. Oh, ain't she pretty?"
               "No, not pretty. Why, Caddy Andrews, where are you going?"
               "Never mind, Grace, let her go. Don't you think Miss Lester is pretty?"
               "No; but I like her looks if she isn't."
               "Won't you go and call on her, sister Grace?" continued the enthusiastic little prattler. "Oh, I wish you would! I heard her say she wasn't acquainted with hardly anybody here."
               Sister Grace promised, and kept her word.
               A week or two after the second quarter commenced, Mrs. Andrews applied to Miss Lester to receive her Emma as a pupil, but unsuccessfully, very greatly to that lady's surprise and chagrin. Mary replied that she had already more scholars than she could do justice to, and that Miss Emma would be obliged to wait until the beginning of the next term.
               Tommy, meanwhile, was very busy with Greek and Latin, gaining the approbation of his teachers, the good-will of his schoolmates, and praise from Miss Skinner, because he was such a "well-behaved boy," and made so little trouble.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXV.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Art thou come with the heart of thy childhood back,
                           The free, the pure, the kind?
                        
                     
                     —MRS. HEMANS.
                  
               
               "THERE'S a gentleman down stairs who wants to see you, Miss Lester," said Miss Skinner, one evening in the ensuing spring, as she tapped at Mary's door.
               "Who is it?—Mr. Vaun?" she asked, springing to her feet, and hastily rearranging her hair, which she had pushed back from her forehead.
               "No 'taint Mr. Vaun, or any of those farmer-boys that he has sometimes sent here on errands. I don't know who 'tis."
               "Mr. Ainsworth, perhaps."
               "Oh, I know him; and this one don't look that way at all."
               "Well, tell him I will be down in a minute."
               It was scarcely that when Mary entered the parlor.
               A tall; finely-formed man stood on the hearth-rug, gazing thoughtfully in the fire. Mary's light step did not reach his ear, and she paused just within the door, and looked at him earnestly, while her color deepened. Then, with a glad cry, she sprang to his side, and laid her hand on his arm.
               "Why, John Graham—cousin John! how little I dreamed of seeing you to-night!"
               "Mary!" exclaimed John, as he bent to kiss her uplifted forehead, "as little did I dream of being here to-night two weeks ago. But didn't you receive a letter from me last week?"
               "No; I haven't heard a word from you in three months. I began to think you had forgotten me."
               "Then you didn't know I was coming home?"
               "I didn't even mistrust such a thing."
               "Well, I wrote you all about it. Probably I have travelled faster than the mails."
               "When did you get home?"
               "Last night. Haven't you heard about father's sending for me?"
               "Not a word. Did he?"
               "Yes; he wrote me that he wanted me to come home and stay as long as he lived. Mary, how he has altered!"
               "In what respect? I have hardly spoken to him in three or four years."
               "In every thing. When I came in last night, he trembled so violently that he could not rise from his chair; but he reached out his arms, and, as I stooped towards him, he threw them both round my neck, and sobbed like a child."
               A tear dropped from John's eye as he spoke, and Mary's face was turned away.
               "And your mother?" she asked at length.
               "She is not changed at all, that I can see," he replied, with a long-drawn sigh. "She shook hands with me, and told father there was no need of his making a fool of himself!"
               Mary did not make any response, and very soon John went on again.
               "Why haven't you been there sometimes, Mary? I think from what father said to-day, that he would have been glad to have seen you."
               "Would he? But I did not know it, and I knew aunt Betsy would rather have me stay away. I used to meet her occasionally in the neighborhood, and she never spoke if she could possibly avoid it. She never came to Mr. Vaun's after I went there."
               "Father looks miserably. I am afraid he feels as if he was not going to live long."
               "I heard Mr. Vaun say, as much as a year ago, that he seemed to be failing."
               "He says," continued John, in a trembling voice, "that he has not known a really well day, or a happy one, since I went away. It seems so strange to hear such words from him! and he has not been willing to lose sight of me to-day. Even when I started to come here, after tea, he begged me not to be gone a great while."
               "It is very strange he did not send for you before."
               "He was too proud to do it, Mary, and, besides, he thought I would not come if he did. But what do you suppose was the very last thing he did in the fall?"
               "I'm sure I can't guess. What was it?"
               "He went to the woods, and found that very tree that I wanted to transplant the year before I left home—you remember, the one that I dug up, and that he made me put back again—and set it out in the corner of the yard, where the old lilac stood. It was the first thing that I saw when the stage drove up to the gate, and I recognized it at once. Mary! I had much ado, man though I am," he continued, with a faint attempt at a smile, "to keep from shedding tears, before that coach full of people!"
               "It would have been no disgrace to you, if you had," replied Mary, with a sympathetic clasp of her cousin's hand. "None at all. I always thought that your father would have been a very different man, if he had had a different——if he had been——" She hesitated, and paused. She did not like to complete the sentence.
               "If he had had a different home, and been under different influences? You need not hesitate to say it, for I have felt it these many years. Ah, Mary! it is a terrible thing when woman tramples upon the altar of her household gods, and instead of cherishing and strengthening the pure, and holy, and tender affections that gather around it, neglects and scorns them! It is a hard thing for a son to say—but if I had had a different mother, I should have had a different father."
               "I know it, John. I know it. But perhaps aunt Betsy will alter. If she only would!"
               A deep sigh, and a slow shake of the head, were John's only answer.
               "You will stay with your father, will you not?" asked Mary, after a pause.
               "Of course; but I must go back and close up my business. My partner's death left it all on my hands, last spring, and I must return for a while. Two months will be sufficient, I hope."
               "How will you like farming, think you?" said Mary, smiling. "Have you rested long enough, so that you can 'plough and sow, reap and mow' without considering it a terrible trial?"
               "Time will tell—I dare not. There must be a great deal of hard work about farming; but I always did believe that there was no necessity for a farmer's being a mere drudge—a mere machine. I think I shall like it, if I can have a voice in the management of affairs. But where is Tommy? I have been expecting him every moment."
               "Oh, I forgot! He doesn't know you are here;" and springing to the door, she called him from the foot of the stairs.
               "How you have altered, Mary! and improved," said John, as she returned to her seat. "You are so much taller, and so much more womanly in your appearance."
               "I ought to be, now that I am a 'school-ma'am!'" she replied, laughing; "and if one couldn't improve in five years, there would be little hope for them. Shall I return the compliment? I almost wonder that I knew you. Here comes Tommy. Do you know this gentleman?" she asked, as he paused, and seemed at a loss how to make his salutations.
               
               "I can answer for him that he does not," said John, advancing to meet him, "unless his eyes and his memory are better than mine."
               But Tommy was looking at him earnestly.
               "I think you are my cousin John," he said. "But if you are, you have changed very much."
               John laughed.
               "Not more than my cousin Tommy. Mary, he will be as tall as I am."
               "He has grown very fast for a year or two."
               "But, Tommy, what are you doing here? Going to college?"
               "Not exactly; getting ready to go. Mary is determined on it."
               "And don't you like it yourself?"
               "Yes, I should like well enough to go to college," said the boy, hesitatingly. "That is, on some accounts. But I would rather go into a store, or some manufacturing business, if Mary would only consent to it."
               "You can do that after you have graduated, Tommy," said Mary. "I don't care about your studying for a profession. But I do want you to go through college."
               Just then, two or three of Mary's pupils came on an errand, and as they did not like to go into the parlor, on account of the strange gentleman whose voice they heard, Miss Skinner showed them into her little sitting-room, and summoned Mary.
               "When will you be ready to enter college, Tommy?" asked John, after she had left the room.
               "Mr. Ainsworth says I can be prepared to enter when I am sixteen, very easily. But Mary seems to think I had better wait a year longer."
               "Well, even if you do, you will graduate before you are twenty-one, and you will be quite young enough then to engage in any business you prefer. Tommy, I think you are a foolish boy."
               "But you wouldn't think so, if you knew why I don't want to go to college," said Tommy, while the tears stood in his large, dark eyes; "you wouldn't wonder at all. How would you like, if you was a great boy like me, to see the only sister you had in the wide world, working like a slave, to support you? I don't like it at all!"
               "But, Tommy, it is no hardship to Mary. She does not consider it as such; and Mr. Vaun told me her school was doing finely."
               "So it is; but you don't know how hard she has to work. Some nights she is tired to death, almost. Then she has to pay a pretty high rent for the school-room, and there's her board, and mine, and my bills at the Academy, and my text books, and clothes, as well as her own—and it isn't such an easy matter. She won't lay up money very fast, even if her school is 'doing finely,' as long as she has me to support."
               "But if you were in a store, Tommy, you would be able to command only a very low salary for the first year or two."
               "I don't suppose I should have a high one, but it would not be so hard for Mary; and in a very few years the tables would be turned, and I could take care of her. If I am ever a man she shall stop working. I won't let her do any thing—only to read or study if she wants to."
               "What horrible threat are you making now, Tommy?" asked Mary, who at that moment came back to the parlor. "Is it for my benefit?"
               "Yes, for your's entirely. I was saying that when I am a man, if I ever get to be one, you shall stop working. You've done your share already."
               "Don't be so hard-hearted, Tommy. What would you have me do? Sit in the parlor all day, with my 'Sunday-go-to-meeting-dress' on, and my hands in my lap? I shouldn't live a month."
               "Well, then, you shall have some of what you ladies call 'fancy-work,' and all the new books you want—and you shall only do just what you have a mind to."
               "I do no more than that now, dear; I am not half as badly off as you think I am. Have you seen Alice Vaun, John?"
               "Yes. What a misfortune her blindness is!"
               "When you are accustomed to it, it will not seem half so terrible. There are very few people who are happier than she is."
               "Her father tells me she writes a good deal."
               "She does—some of her poems are very beautiful. And Amy—have you seen her?"
               "Not yet. Mr. Thompson came to see me to-day. Amy has gone away somewhere for a week or two, he said."
               
               "She is a very sweet girl. When are you going West again, John?"
               "In a couple of weeks," he replied, rising; "and now I must go home. I will be here again some evening next week."
               "It is not late."
               "No, but I promised father I would only make a short call this time. Tommy, does the old Academy look as it used to?"
               "I'm sure I can't tell," was the laughing response. "I had not the honor of its acquaintance until about six months since."
               "I wonder if my name is carved anywhere about the premises, or pencilled on the white-washed walls! I must try if I can find it, some day when I have leisure. Mary, take good care of yourself. I shall be here to look after you now, as well as Tommy; and you will run the risk of some rare lectures, if you don't do as you are bid."
               "I am not easily frightened, particularly by words; and I believe I am growing obstinate. At all events, I generally manage to have my own way—don't I Tommy?" she said, playfully, as they approached the door.
               "Well, if your way is the best, you ought to have it. Mr. Ainsworth says you are always in the right."
               "Mr. Ainsworth! Why, Tommy!"
               "If he didn't say those very words, he said what meant the same thing, for I heard him."
               "You mustn't tell tales out of school, Tommy," said John, laughing; "I must inquire about this matter," and gathering up the reins, he sprang into the wagon, and drove off rapidly.
               Mr. Graham had uttered no untruth when he said that he had not known one happy day since John left home. For a year or two the stern pride of his nature—the same pride that had kept him from saying a single word in opposition to his son's wish to go forth into the world and seek his fortune—prevented his acknowledging it, even to himself. But he felt it, nevertheless. The still, small voice within, would make itself heard, despite all the efforts of a strong will to enforce silence upon it. A low, thrilling murmur, it followed him to the field—to the wood-lot—to the barn—to the market—to the house of God. It made itself heard in the deep silence of midnight—in the joyful tumult of early morning—in the slumberous repose of summer noons—in the cheerful humming of the household fire. His son's face haunted him continually. Now it was that of a babe in the cradle; now that of a child rolling upon the greensward, and striving to catch the cherry-blossoms that each passing breeze scattered like snow-flakes upon its head; now that of a bright and fearless boy, with a ringing laugh and a bounding step. And then he remembered—it seemed very strange how or why—he had scarcely noticed these things as they passed. He remembered how, by slow degrees, all had changed; how the babe became a child—how the boy's face grew dark and sullen, how the laugh became more rare, and the bounding step lost half its lightness. He remembered how, as the years went by, the boy and himself grew farther and farther apart—and how he had made no effort to draw back the heart that God and nature had designed should throb close, close beside his own. He remembered how, as his son grew older, the labor of a full-grown man was required of him, and how the expansion of his intellect, the cultivation of his mind, were left neglected and uncared for. He recollected how, for a while after Mary came to Farmingdale, the cloud was lifted, and the pride of newly awakened thought and feeling seemed beaming in his eye—how happy and cheerful he had been when attending the Academy at Carrolton, and with how much more of conscious dignity and self-respect, he had returned to his wonted tasks.
               And as Mr. Graham remembered these things, he cursed himself for his folly and blindness. He wondered why he had not seen that his son was pining for a nobler and more exalted life than that he was leading; why he had not profited by past experience, and allowed him, from that time forward, to mingle, in some slight degree at least, the ideal with the actual—to amass treasures for the mind as well as for the body. But no. He remembered, with a groan that came from the innermost depths of his heart, that he had not done that. He had taken him from school, and fastened him down at once to close and unremitting toil. He had allowed him no money for the purchase of books, and the gratification of his tastes; he had been unwilling even to make so small a sacrifice of his own early habits and notions, as to permit him to transplant a tree from the wood-lot to the yard. And at length the sight of John's favorite maple became an eye-sore to him. He could not pass it without a feeling of remorse and bitter self-reproach. The very wind, as it played among the thrifty boughs, seemed to utter his son's name complainingly; and he took it up with his own hands, and planted it in the very spot where John had designed to place it.
               These changes of feeling had not been wrought in one year or in two; and it was very long after he yearned to embrace his son, before he even dreamed of recalling him. During the first twelve months of John's absence, he wrote several times to his father, but receiving no reply, he ceased to write entirely.
               "Let him stay where he is," Mr. Graham would say to himself, as he slowly paced back and forward in the yard, or sat by the silent hearth;—for his wife as she grew older, grew less and less companionable. She had fastened the mantle of earthly care so closely about her, that she could not have undone the clasp even if she had tried. But she did not. She had sold her birthright for a mess of pottage, yet she was satisfied.
               "Let him alone where he is!" he would say. "He has forgotten his old father, and it's no wonder. Why shouldn't he? And 'tain't likely he would come back even if I sent for him; and I can't do that. I can't stoop to my own son, even if I haven't done by him as I'd ought to. They say he's doing well, and making money. Let him stay where he is!"
               It is possible Mr. Graham might never have spoken in different language—strongly as his heart pleaded with him to be reconciled to his son—if his health had not failed him. As strength declined, pride and self-reliance declined with it. He longed for a strong arm to lean upon, as he trod life's downward path. He longed for the affection that he had regarded of so little moment when in the freshness and vigor of manhood. He pined for the caresses that he had never paused to lavish upon his child.
               And at last he penned, with a trembling hand, the few lines that had recalled John to his early home once more.
               "Come back to your old father, my son," he wrote. "I have been in the wrong path all my life, but now I want you to come back and stay with me till I die. I am broken down, and feeble, and all alone. Come home."
               And John obeyed; not joyfully, perhaps—for he had formed new ties in his western home, his business was prospering, he was becoming emphatically a "rising man," and it was no small sacrifice to return to his old life on the farm—but promptly and willingly. He did not answer his father's letter; but even before Mr. Graham was looking for a reply, his son was standing by his side.
               "You won't leave me again, will you, John?" he asked, in feeble, tremulous tones, on the night of his return. "You will stay here on the old homestead until I die, even if you don't want to spend your days here?"
               And with no stipulations, but with a gush of uncontrolable tears, John bowed his head upon his father's trembling hand, and promised that he would remain with him; he would only go back and close up his business, and then return to leave him no more.
               Mrs. Graham had not exactly encouraged or discouraged her husband in his determination to send for John.
               "To be sure, I should like to see the boy well enough," she said; "and if you feel as if you can't live without him, why you'd better send for him to come back. But it seems as if it was a kind o' foolish business. He's a taking care of himself, and stands a chance to get rich, folks say. I should think you might let well enough alone. 'Tain't no ways likely he'd be much help to you on the farm, for I s'pose he's got higher notions than ever by this time. Still, maybe it would be for the best—I don't pretend to know."
               "I don't care whether he's any help or not, wife. I've got money enough to hire all the hands I need; and if I'd only thought so years ago, John wouldn't have gone off. But he won't sit down and fold his hands anywhere, if he holds his own yet. There never was a lazy thread about him. Oh wife, wife!"
               "What's the matter now?" asked Mrs. Graham, sharply. "You're all the time a groaning and whining. Why don't you send for the boy and be done with it, if you want to?"
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           A foul and loathly creature sure in sight,
                           And in conditions to be loathed no less:
                           For she was stuffed with rancor and despite
                           Up to the throat, that oft with bitterness
                           It forth would break and gush in great excess,
                           Pouring out streams of poison and of gall
                           'Gainst all that truth or virtue do profess;
                           Whom she with leasings lewdly did miscall
                           And wickedly backbite: her name men SLANDER call.
                        
                     
                     —SPENSER.
                  
               
               IN the course of a week or two, John went West again, and immediately directed all his attention to the settling of his affairs there. He was more successful than he expected to be, and in a month's time they were in such a condition that he could safely leave them. Early in June, to his father's great delight, the stage again drew up before the big gate, divers trunks and boxes were deposited on the ground, and John was at home.
               His father came down to the gate to meet him. John noticed that he leaned heavily upon his cane; and as the red light of sunset streamed full and clear upon his uncovered head, he saw that his hair was almost blanched. Only a very few raven threads mingled with those of purest silver.
               Yet Mr. Graham was not a very old man—in years. He was yet far from the "three score and ten" that holy writ has allotted to humanity. But he had worn himself out in his eager pursuit of the "gold that perisheth." He had not only completely exhausted the strength belonging to each day, but he had encroached upon the precincts of the morrow; he had stolen what should have been reserved for the next. And at last nature had rebelled; she had long murmured at this infringement of her rights, but now she had arisen in her might, and would be obeyed.
               "We ought to kill the fatted calf to-night, John," he said, as he warmly clasped his son's hand. "I rode down to the village to meeting last Sunday afternoon, and the sermon was about the prodigal son. And I thought if there was such feasting and rejoicing when the boy came home who had wasted his father's substance in 'riotous living,' I ought to kill at least two when you came back to me."
               "Thank you, father," said John, gayly, and with an affectionate smile; "thank you; but one would be a great plenty for your prodigal, and a warm welcome is worth a dozen fatted calves. Aren't you glad to see me too, mother?" he asked, as he advanced to meet Mrs. Graham, who was now approaching.
               "Of course I be! But, mercy! what a lot o' trunks and boxes you've got! I guess you won't want no more clothes this year."
               "Oh, they are not all filled with clothes, mother; not by a great deal. I'm not such an extravagant fellow as that."
               "I don't know where they'll all be put. Seems to me the house is chuck full already," said Mrs. Graham, eyeing them suspiciously.
               "If you'll let them remain in the hall until to-morrow, I'll find a place for them," replied John, as they entered the house. "Some of them can stand in my room."
               "That makes me think," said his mother, "there must be another bed put up in the boys' chamber. There's room enough."
               "For John?" inquired Mr. Graham.
               "Yes."
               "Well, he isn't going to sleep there," said his father. "There ain't a single chamber used in the front part o' the house, and there ha'n't been this great while. They ain't any too good for him, the very best of 'em."
               John said not a word.
               Mrs. Graham looked at her husband in some astonishment for a minute or two, and then remarked quietly,
               "The boys' room is good enough for anybody; but John can sleep just where he takes a notion."
               Accordingly, he took possession of one of the front chambers.
               A handsome shawl for his mother was found in one of the trunks that was opened that night.
               "It's a real beauty, John. I declare it is," said she examining it curiously, "and as fine as silk. But it's a great deal too nice for me. I can't afford to wear such things."
               "Not when they are given to you?" replied John, laughing. "I should think them cheap enough at that rate."
               
               "Well, I s'pose they be, if a body can only think so, but I——What's that?" she asked, as she spied the corner of a similar shawl still remaining in the trunk.
               "That's one I brought for Mary," he said, unfolding it as he spoke. "It's of the same material and size as yours, but I chose brighter colors, as more suitable for her age."
               Mrs. Graham turned on her heel and walked off, without deigning to cast a second glance upon the offending article.
               When the other trunks and boxes were unpacked, they were found to contain a small but choice and well-selected library. Small, comparatively. Mrs. Graham, however, thought John had been very extravagant in the purchase of books, if not of apparel.
               "I think I had better take the lumber-wagon, father, and go to Carrolton after a bookcase. There doesn't seem to be any place for these books."
               Mr. Graham looked at them, as if taking their dimensions, and shook his head.
               "You won't find a bookcase in all Carrolton large enough to hold 'em. And I suppose you'll all the time be buying more. Hadn't you better have a carpenter come, and put up some shelves in the middle room or the parlor?"
               "That would be the best plan; but I did not know as you would be willing to have the rooms disturbed."
               It was touching to see the look of mingled reproach, respect, and affection with which Mr. Graham laid his hand on his son's shoulder, as he replied,
               "I did not call you back here to make a boy of you again, John. I want you to do just as if the place was your own. It will be, sometime."
               "But it will be a long while—a great many years first, I trust, my dear father. You are a young man yet; and now that you will not have so much care, and will have some one to see to your business, I expect you will recruit rapidly. We shall have you in the field again yet, swinging your scythe with the best of us."
               Mr. Graham shook his head mournfully this time.
               "No, John, the day for that is past. I may live a few years longer, but I shall never be a strong man again. And it's all my own fault; I've no right to complain. God gave me as good a constitution as anybody ever had, but I've abused it shamefully."
               Mrs. Graham made some feeble opposition to the shelf project; but she did not say much. She thought her husband was certainly in his second childhood, or growing crazy—she could not tell which.
               To Mary that summer passed very happily. Almost every week, either business or pleasure led John to Carrolton; and she soon learned to regard him—as she had in the early days of their intercourse—as a dear brother. Generally he was alone; but sometimes he brought Amy with him, and once Alice and Ralph. Mr. Vaun was away from home attending to some business-matters, in a distant city, nearly all that season; and, consequently, John's advice and assistance were doubly grateful to her.
               Often he managed to arrive just as school was dismissed; and then how delightful to herself and Tommy were the long rides they took by the bank of the river, or over Carrol's Hill, or down by the paper-mill, where the air was so laden with fragrance from the cedar grove! How pleasant were the social chats in Miss Skinner's quiet parlor, and the hours they occasionally spent over some choice volume from John's library! They had changed places now. Years ago her's had been the guiding mind, the controlling thought. Now she looked up to him as to one wiser as well as older than herself. It is possible—probable, perhaps—that in mere book-knowledge he was still the inferior. But so much more had he learned from travel, and from intercourse with the world, from mingling with men, and from actual observation and personal experience; and he had, moreover, a foundation of such good, sterling common sense for all his acquirements to rest upon, that no one could have regarded him as such. Certainly not one as little inclined to over-estimate her own abilities as was Mary.
               Twice Mr. Graham himself came to see her. He did not say a great deal, it is true, but he seemed kind and pleasant, and his visits gave her very great satisfaction. She was sure, after that, that he cherished no other than kindly feelings towards her.
               And she received other and more substantial benefits that she felt obliged to lay to his charge. When she went to pay her half-yearly rent for the school-room, she found that some one had been beforehand with her. It was already paid in her name, and a receipt awaited her appearance. Mr. Vaun was not home, and his wife plead "not guilty." John declared that it was none of his work; and she was compelled to believe that it was her uncle's. But done, she did not doubt, at John's suggestion.
               She was very happy. Tommy was making rapid progress in his studies, and seemed to grow daily more and more devoted to the sister who had proved herself so devoted to him. Of course he did not always do right. He occasionally fell into "scrapes" and difficulties like other boys; difficulties that, perhaps, like the hooping-cough and the measles, if not exactly essential to their growth and development, are yet to be expected, and regarded as the natural order of things. There was nothing of the angelic about him, and he sometimes gave trifling displeasure to his teachers, and offended his schoolmates. But Mary had too much judgment, too much faith in the good that she knew was in him, to be disheartened or rendered unhappy by these things. She believed that if she did her own duty earnestly and faithfully, and endeavored to lead him gently by the hand in the same narrow path, the God of their mother would surely guide them safely to the end.
               Her own studies proceeded without intermission. She still attended French recitations at the seminary, under a faithful and experienced teacher; and twice every week Mr. Ainsworth read Latin with her. She was going on also with a thorough course of English reading, long ago marked out for her by Mr. Vaun. Her school flourished; and as she became better acquainted in Carrolton, a host of friends seemed to spring up around her path; kind looks and pleasant voices met her where-ever she turned.
               But at length there came a change. At first Mary thought it lay entirely in her own diseased imagination, and reproached herself for yielding to a depression of spirits that she was yet unable to shake off. As the weeks rolled on, however, she became sure that it was not all fancy; and she began to look more cautiously about her, and to ask herself what could be the matter. She could not reply to the question.
               Miss Skinner's face—which, in her very kindliest moods, was somewhat hard and forbidding—grew sterner and harsher than ever; and her tall, spare figure held itself even more primly erect behind the coffee-urn. Their meals, which had heretofore been enlivened by a constant flow of chit-chat, were dispatched hastily and in silence. Their hostess was disinclined to talk, and Mary found it impossible to break the spell that seemed to brood over the table. For some months Miss Skinner had been in the habit of addressing her, in the privacy of their own family circle, by the familiar name of Mary. Now it was "Miss Lester" always. Nothing less formal would suffice.
               That was the first thing she noticed; and it is very probable that if there had been no coldness at home, reserve and distance from abroad might have escaped her observation much longer than they did. But ere long she began to see, or to fancy, averted faces, and a disposition to avoid her on the part of her acquaintances. On several different occasions young ladies, with whom she had become quite familiar, crossed the street for no other purpose, apparently, than to escape the necessity of meeting her. One Sunday, as she was coming out of church, she paused in the porch to speak to a young girl who had formerly been one of her pupils. She had hardly done so, before a hasty summons from the girl's mother recalled her to her side, and Mary was left alone, with the half-finished sentence on her lips. Still she felt that these things might be purely accidental; and she struggled faithfully with the painful emotions that they excited.
               At last some of her very best scholars were taken from school, with no explanation save the simple assertion that it was not convenient for them to attend any longer.
               With a flushed cheek and a heart that was throbbing painfully, Mary called upon the mother of one of the children, and asked her if in any way she had failed to give satisfaction as a teacher.
               "I've no fault to find with the school, that I know of," replied the lady, drawing herself up haughtily; "but if I don't choose to send my daughter any longer, I suppose I have a perfect right to keep her at home."
               "Certainly you have," was the reply; "and I am not at all disposed to dispute it. I called merely because I wish to please my employers; and if I have failed to do so, I would like to know in what manner."
               "I don't know that I am under any obligation to give a reason son for every thing I do," rejoined the mother; "and I have no desire to be called to an account for my actions, either. I believe your bill is paid."
               Mary left the house indignantly, and with a spirit much farther from being at rest, than when she entered it.
               "Aren't you going to Mrs. Langdon's to-night, Mary?" asked Tommy, a few day's afterwards, as he came into her room just before tea.
               "To Mrs. Langdon's? No. What made you think of it?"
               "Why, George said they were going to have a party there this evening. It's Miss Grace's birthday."
               "Is it? I had not heard of it."
               "It's very strange they didn't invite you. They always have until this time, haven't they?—ever since we came to Carrolton."
               "Yes, dear. But perhaps they have only invited their very particular friends."
               Mary spoke cheerfully. Her heart, however, sank within her. She knew there must be some other cause for this neglect. Both Mrs. Langdon and Grace had been extremely kind to her, and little Fanny was one of her especial pets out of school. Moreover, Grace had told her several weeks previous, that her mother had promised her a birthday party, and had spoken of her presence as a matter of course.
               Mary slept but little that night. She resolved and re-resolved that she would go to Mrs. Langdon the very next day, and strive to obtain a clew to at least a part of these mysteries. But when the morning dawned her courage failed her. How many a project that has seemed perfectly easy and feasible amid the darkness and shadows of midnight, has failed to bear the clear, strong, common-sense light of the coming day! Mary felt that she could not go to Mrs. Langdon.
               What should she ask if she did go? Why she had not been invited to the party? No. That would never do. Mrs. Langdon was entirely at liberty to invite precisely whom she chose. Besides, her first effort at obtaining an explanation had disheartened her. She dreaded another repulse.
               To add to her perplexity, it had now been three weeks since she had seen John, or heard from him. She began to feel as if she had no one to lean upon.
               "Oh, if Mr. Vaun would only come home!" she murmured to herself that night, as she sat, with clasped hands, thinking of these matters. "He would soon make things straight. Or if I could see Amy, or John, or any of them!"
               John did call the next day, but only for a few moments. He was unusually busy, he said, and should be for several weeks. His father was more unwell, and wished him to attend to some business in an adjoining county. He had been at home only a few days during the last month.
               So Mary said nothing of her own troubles. Indeed she had no opportunity during John's flying visit; for Tommy was in the room all the time, and she was unwilling to grieve him, by making him a participant of her sorrows.
               The cloud grew denser and darker.
               "I've made up my mind that I shan't take boarders no longer," said Miss Skinner, at the breakfast-table one morning; "so, Miss Lester, you must look out for another boarding place for you and Tommy—that is, after this quarter closes."
               Mary's lip quivered.
               "Do you find us so very troublesome, Miss Skinner?" she forced herself to ask.
               "Well, I don't know about that. But I always have been very particular, and I always mean to be. A poor, lone body like me hasn't nothing to depend on but her character. When that's gone, all's gone."
               "What do you mean by that, Miss Skinner?" asked Mary, while her cheek crimsoned vividly. "Is your reputation endangered by our being here?"
               "I don't mean nothing in particular: only I reckon I shall stop taking boarders," and pursing up her mouth with an expression that said as plainly as possible, "ask me no questions, and I'll tell you no lies," she sailed majestically out of the room.
               "Humph!" said Tommy, as he rose from the table, "Miss Skinner is growing quite important. I guess we can find boarding places enough," and he went up stairs.
               Mary sat for several moments, balancing her teaspoon upon the edge of her cup. Her brain was in a whirl. What did Miss Skinner mean? What did other people mean? She would find out that very minute. She would endure it no longer. And she followed Miss Skinner into the kitchen.
               
               She found that lady weighing butter, sugar, and flour for cake, and waited until she had counted the "notches" on her steel-yards before she spoke.
               "Miss Skinner, what did you mean by what you said just now?" she then asked.
               "Just what I said—that I ain't going to take boarders any longer."
               "I understand that. But you said something about your character—I cannot repeat your words—in such a connection as to lead one to suspect you thought it might suffer from our boarding here. That is what I do not understand."
               But Miss Skinner was not at all disposed to commit herself.
               "Oh, folks will talk, and they do talk—and I can't help it, and I don't hold myself accountable. But I don't want to say any thing myself, nor to hurt anybody's feelings. I don't know any thing at all about it. I didn't mean any thing in particular."
               "Who talks? You can tell me that."
               "Why, the folks—I can't say who in particular; and I don't want to say any thing about it, any way."
               "But you shouldn't have said what you did, Miss Skinner, unless you are willing to tell me more. I do not know what you are talking about."
               Miss Skinner set down the pan of butter and sugar, impatiently.
               "Well, if you don't know, I'm sure I don't know who ought to. There's enough said, but it's none o'my business to go round retailing what other people say. If folks will be imprudent, and do what's wrong, they must expect to take the consequences—that's all the consolation I can give 'em."
               "Will you tell me what you mean, Miss Skinner? or what you have heard?"
               "No, I won't. There—now I guess you've found out. For my part, I don't pretend to know any thing at all about it. I hain't said any thing, and I don't calculate to. If folks have got any fish to fry, they must fry 'em themselves," and Miss Skinner commenced stirring her cake with fearful rapidity.
               In utter despair Mary turned away, and went to her own room. What was this cloud that was hanging over her? She tried to recollect whatever she had done or said—to think if she had been guilty of any imprudence or indiscretion that could give occasion for scandal. But it was all in vain.
               Tommy had gone to recitation before Mary went up stairs; and she had no leisure to give vent to the tears that pressed so heavily upon heart and brain. It was time she was in the school-room, and hastily tying on her bonnet she repaired thitherward.
               It was a long, dreary day. She missed one or two more of the bright faces she had been accustomed to see. One was that of Fanny Langdon—and her cup seemed full. She did not go home at noon. She had no appetite for her dinner, and she wished to avoid Tommy's sympathizing, as well as Miss Skinner's curious eyes.
               "I must see Mrs. Vaun," she said to herself. "I cannot live so any longer. Tommy shall go to the livery stable and try if he can find a horse and carriage this very night. I can come home to-morrow morning before school-time."
               Full of this determination, she hurried through her afternoon labors, and dismissed her pupils half an hour earlier than usual.
               After hastily changing her dress, she seated herself by the window to watch for Tommy; intending to send him immediately for the carriage, and to start without waiting for tea.
               But an hour passed and he did not come. The tea-bell rang, and Mary went down—from the force of habit—not because she was hungry. Eagerly she listened to every passing footstep, but no one paused at the gate; and going up stairs, she again resumed her watch by the window. The sun went down; the twilight shadows began to gather; and now and then a light glimmered far down the village street. Still no signs of Tommy.
               With a very heavy heart, Mary gave up the idea of going that night, and attempted to prepare a French lesson for the morrow. She felt no particular anxiety about her brother. It was Tuesday night, and Wednesday afternoon was always devoted to declamation, reading of compositions, and other public exercises in the chapel of the Academy; and she presumed that he had remained with some of his companions for a rehearsal. But she was greatly disappointed, and found it quite impossible to confine her thoughts to her book.
               At length she heard Tommy's step on the stairs. She hardly recognized it, however, it was so much slower than usual.
               He strode heavily past her door, and sought his own room. Hastily throwing aside her book, Mary followed him. Tommy had thrown himself on a chair by the table, and was leaning his brow upon his folded arms.
               "Why, Tommy! how late you are. Are you tired?"
               "Some," he replied, without raising his head.
               "Your tea will rest you; have you been preparing yourself for declamation to-morrow?"
               "No." A heavy sigh followed the word.
               Mary was rummaging, in the dark, among the various articles on the mantel-piece.
               "Where's your lamp, Tommy? I can't find it."
               "I don't know. Never mind, Mary, I don't want a light, I'm going to bed pretty soon."
               "What! so early? and without your supper? That won't do. Stay, I'll bring my lamp, and then perhaps I can find yours."
               In a moment she was back, lamp in hand.
               "You'd better go down and get something to eat, Tommy. It isn't well for you to go without your supper."
               Tommy did not answer, but as Mary placed the lamp on the table, he drew his arms more closely round his face.
               "What is the matter, dear? Are you sick or tired? You needn't go down. I will bring your supper up here."
               "No, no, Mary. You need not do that," said he, reaching out one hand to detain her. "I don't want any supper."
               "Then you are sick and must have something to take. How strangely you act, Tommy! and your hand is like ice. I am going to call Miss Skinner."
               As Tommy sprang up to prevent her from executing her purpose, the light fell upon his face, and Mary fairly screamed with terror. The boy was pale even to ghastliness, his eyes were swollen and blood-shot, and there was a large bruise upon his forehead.
               "Hush, Mary!" he said, placing his hand over her lips—"hush! I am not much hurt, and somebody will hear you."
               "But what is it, Tommy? What have you been doing?"
               "Fighting," he muttered through his teeth, and with his hands clenched so tightly that the nails were a dark purple.
               "Fighting—oh Tommy! I would not have believed it! And with whom?"
               "Harley Strong."
               For sometime neither of them spoke, but tears were slowly trickling through Mary's fingers.
               "I am very sorry," she began at last: "I would rather—"
               "I am not sorry at all," interrupted her brother. "I would do the same thing over this very minute. The lying scoundrel!—"
               "Oh, don't talk so, Tommy, or you will break my heart," exclaimed Mary, throwing her arms around his neck as she spoke; "I cannot bear it."
               "And you must not find fault with me, Mary, or you will break mine. I cannot bear that," replied Tommy, kissing her wet cheek. "I could not help it."
               "But what will become of you, Tommy, if you don't learn to help it? I have talked to you so much about controlling your temper, and becoming its master, instead of allowing it to govern you in this way. You must try, Tommy. What was the trouble between you and Harley Strong?"
               She was not answered, unless it was by another kiss.
               "What was it, Tommy?"
               "It is too long a story to be told, Mary. Won't you be satisfied if I tell you that I am not to blame?"
               "I know you think you are not, dear. But when we are in a passion we are not very good judges. We are very apt to think ourselves blameless."
               "I am not in a passion."
               "But you have been. You need not tell me the whole story. Just let me know what your quarrel was about."
               For a moment or two Tommy hesitated. Then he replied in a very low voice,
               "It was about you, Mary."
               Mary's cheek grew as white as Tommy's had been.
               "About me, Tommy? You and Harley Strong quarrelling about me? Oh, that is worse than all the rest!"
               "I could not help it, Mary. Don't cry so," he continued, as his sister dropped upon his old seat by the table, and buried her face in her arms. "I was not to blame; indeed, indeed I was not."
               
               Mary wound one arm around him as he bent over her, and drew him close to her side.
               "Tell me all about it, Tommy, quick! I must know! Oh, what will come next?"
               "It was nothing, Mary," he replied, surprised and terrified by her emotion. "Only I happened to hear Harley Strong say something about you that did not suit me very well, and I told him they were false, and he must retract his words."
               "Well?"
               "He repeated what he had said in stronger terms than before, and I told him he lied. And then he struck me, or tried to. I believe I got the start of him."
               "What were the things you heard him say, Tommy?"
               "I can't tell you, Mary, and it would do you no good to know."
               "But I must know. You must tell me. I will not be kept in the dark in this way," said Mary, who was weeping as if her heart would break.
               Tommy threw himself on his knees beside her, and laid his head in her lap, as he had been wont to do in his childhood.
               "I will not tell you what he said, Mary, for I cannot. But it was about you and cousin John, I guess he won't say it again, for I gave him such a drubbing as he won't forget very soon. Don't cry, sister; I can't bear to have you. I did not mean you should know one word about it."
               Mary looked at him earnestly for a moment.
               "Are you determined in the matter, Tommy?"
               "I cannot tell you, Mary? Don't ask it of me."
               "Then I must make some move myself. If my brother is obliged to fight in my defence, I have been kept in the dark quite long enough."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVII.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           At last a story got afloat,
                           And like a wild-fire flew,
                           That Polly Peep knew—certainly!
                           Exactly what she knew!
                        
                     
                     —EASTMAN.
                  
               
               THE next morning as Mary was passing slowly through the hall, on her way from the breakfast-table to her own room, she stepped to the front door, and glanced down the street. It was nearly empty; but as she stood there, leaning against the wall, and thinking over and over again the same sad thoughts, Harley Strong suddenly turned the corner just below the house, and stood face to face with her.
               Mary's first impulse was to draw back before he should notice her; but a bright thought flashed like lightning athwart her brain, and she advanced towards him, without the least hesitation.
               "Good morning, Mr. Strong," she said, bowing gravely. "Will you be so kind as to walk in? I would like to see you for a moment."
               A dozen different shades of color passed over the face of the boy, or young man we, perhaps, ought to call him—he was two or three years older than Tommy—in the space of half a minute; and he would certainly have been more inclined to turn and run, than to have complied with Mary's request, if he had been allowed any time for reflection. But, surprised and bewildered as he was, he meekly mounted the steps, and found himself occupying a chair in Miss Skinner's parlor, almost before he was aware of it.
               Occupying it, we said. It was hardly that. He was perched upon the very edge of the chair, twirling his thumbs in a most pitiable state of fear and embarrassment, while his hat stood on the carpet between his feet. If Mary had not been so deeply engrossed with her own thoughts, that her usually keen appreciation of the ludicrous lay entirely dormant, she would certainly have laughed at the unwonted apparition.
               Her own position was not particularly pleasant, either. She had acted from a momentary impulse, and with hardly an idea of what she was to do or say. But her guest's confusion tended to remove her own, if she felt any; and she was presently as calm and self-possessed as she had ever been in her life.
               After a word or two on indifferent subjects, in order to give the young gentleman time to collect his thoughts, and recover the use of his tongue, Mary said,
               "I was very sorry to hear that my brother and yourself had some difficulty last night, Mr. Strong, and my sorrow was greatly increased when I discovered that I was the cause of it."
               Harley Strong said, afterwards, that if Mary had called him Harley, treated him like a boy, and given him a good scolding, he should not have felt half as badly. But when she addressed him as a man, and appealed to him as such, so calmly and yet so firmly, he longed to sink through the floor—anywhere—so that it was out of her presence. He sat with downcast eyes, and said not a word.
               "My brother did not tell me the precise origin of your quarrel. He simply said that you made some assertions relative to my cousin John and myself that were offensive to him. Now, I do not ask or wish that you should tell me what my own brother could not repeat in my hearing. But I must beg you, Mr. Strong, to give me your authority for making statements that, I am perfectly confident, were calculated to injure my reputation."
               "I did not mean to injure you, Miss Lester," said Harley, gaining a little courage as Mary proceeded. "I was only repeating what I had heard others say, and I did not believe a word of it."
               "I am very glad if you did not, for I had always considered you one of my friends. But your own opinions had little to do with the effect produced upon the minds of others by what you said. My brother supposed that you believed what you were repeating, and probably others did also."
               "Well, you see, Miss Lester, Thomas came up while we were talking—a lot of us together—and heard me say something that made him very angry, I suppose. He said right off, without giving me a chance to explain, that I was telling what was not true, and must take back my words. That made me angry, and I said it over again, just because I was so mad that I didn't know any better; and then Thomas called me a liar, and we got to fighting. I am very sorry, and I really did not mean to do you any harm by what I said, Miss Lester. I did not, indeed."
               "Prove it, then," said Mary, smiling, "by being more thoughtful for the future. A gentleman will never speak of a lady in terms that are capable of misconstruction. But I find there is some report in circulation that is doing me serious injury—affecting my business as well as my comfort—and I must trace it to its source. All I ask of you is, that you will tell me what you know of the matter, or rather, that you will inform me through what channel this report reached you."
               "Through Mrs. Langdon, in the first place. I overheard her talking with my mother. After that the boys at school said something about it."
               "Thank you. I will not detain you any longer. But here is my brother," she added, as Tommy opened the door, and drew back again, in unbounded surprise, when he saw that his sister was tête-à-tête with Harley Strong. "Come in, Thomas."
               He did so, scowling defiance at Harley.
               The latter was, although thoughtless and passionate, a noble, generous boy at heart; and after a short struggle with himself—a struggle that was very apparent to Mary's observing eyes—he rose and frankly offered his hand to his late antagonist.
               "I beg your pardon, Thomas, as I do that of your sister. I can only say to you, as I already have to her, that I did not mean to injure her, and that I never believed a word of the silly story I was repeating."
               Tommy warmly clasped the outstretched hand, and they went off to school as good friends as ever. But Harley paused on the door-step to say,
               "You have given me a lesson that I shall never forget, Miss Lester. I shall be more careful of my words for the future."
               After tea that evening, Mary put on her bonnet, with a determination that she would call on Mrs. Langdon. She dreaded she knew not what; but she felt that any thing would be better than this harassing consciousness that there were influences at work against her, of the source and nature of which she was ignorant. As she approached the large and elegant mansion, however, she heard the sound of gay voices and laughter issuing from the closed shutters of the parlor windows, and she could not gather courage to enter. Passing on, she walked a quarter of a mile, and returned. All was quiet then, and ascending the marble steps, she rang the bell.
               Mrs. Langdon was in—so said the little waiting-maid who opened the door—and Mary was ushered into the parlor. It was several minutes before the lady appeared, and in the mean time she was striving to summon all her fortitude, and to nerve herself to meet suspicion, perhaps reproach.
               Mrs. Langdon received her with cold and distant politeness, and Mary at once broached the subject which was uppermost in her thoughts.
               "I have called here to-night, Mrs. Langdon," she said, in a voice that trembled in spite of herself, "on what you will perhaps consider a singular errand. I have noticed for two or three weeks a peculiar restraint and reserve on the part of many of my acquaintances, and some eight or ten of my best scholars have been taken from school. But it is only within the last two days that I have had the least clew to the mystery."
               Mary hesitated for a moment, but Mrs. Langdon still sat with her eyes fixed upon the carpet, and she went on.
               "I am convinced that there are some reports prejudicial to me in circulation in Carrolton, but I cannot ascertain their nature or their author."
               "The less you say about them the better it will be, I imagine," said Mrs. Langdon, coldly. "Scandal soon wears itself out, unless it has a broad and strong foundation to rest upon; and one who is conscious of innocence can afford to wait patiently until the storm has blown over."
               "Not if the storm threatens destruction to their house and fortune, Mrs. Langdon," replied Mary, earnestly, while tears started to her eyes at the insinuation that she felt rather than heard. "Not if it threatens to blast their hopes and prospects, and leave them destitute and helpless. My school is my all, and if that is broken up, I have no means of support for myself or my brother. If it were not for that, I would far rather 'wait patiently,' even in the midst of neglect and reproach, than to attempt to read this riddle. Do not doubt me, Mrs. Langdon," she continued, rising from her seat and drawing nearer, as she spoke. "Trust me at least so far as to talk with me frankly and candidly about this matter. Of what am I accused?"
               "Of an unwarrantable intimacy with John Graham. That is the principal charge."
               "And who brings it? and who believes it?" asked Mary, while an indignant flush rose to her very forehead. "Mrs. Langdon, you cannot look me in the face, and say that you do!"
               "I do not know what to think, Miss Lester. I have been very unwilling to believe any ill of you. But you must admit that there has been some imprudence, at least, on your part?"
               "I do not admit any such thing. I am not conscious of the slightest degree of impropriety in our intercourse."
               "What! not in your long walks and rides, returning home so late at night?"
               "You are laboring under some singular misapprehension, Mrs. Langdon. I have been out but twice in the evening with my cousin, and then we were home before nine o'clock, and Thomas was with us."
               "And receiving so many expensive presents from him. What do you think of that?"
               Mary laughed bitterly.
               "My 'expensive presents' can be easily inventoried. When John came home, after an absence of five years, he brought me a shawl. I needed it, and accepted it thankfully. Since then he has given me two or three books."
               "Has he not given you a very elegant silk dress?"
               "No, madam, he has not. My dress was a present from Mrs. Vaun. But what if he had? John is my own cousin, Mrs. Langdon, and I have scarcely any other relative in the world, besides Tommy."
               "But, Miss Lester—pardon me," she added, as she noticed Mary's heightened color, "and remember that you forced this discussion upon me; it was not of my seeking—people do not make a great deal of allowance for your cousinship, when they know that you are at open variance with your aunt; that you have not entered the house for years. They think it is rather singular, to say the least, that you should be so intimate with the son, when you are not on speaking terms with the mother—and she your mother's only sister."
               
               "I was not aware before that all my private affairs were so well known to the good people of Carrolton; and I do not choose to explain to them the whole story of my difficulty with my aunt. But, Mrs. Langdon, you know something of her character, and you know also something of my cousin's. Now tell me frankly, do you think it at all strange that I could not live with her, or that I do like him?"
               "Well, no, Miss Lester, I can't say that I do," said Mrs. Langdon, after a short pause.
               "Then please do not judge me by what other people say. But is this all?"
               "Not exactly, It is something that your cousin has himself said, that first started these scandalous stories. Young girls cannot be too careful."
               The color that had partially faded from Mary's cheek, rushed back again, until neck and brow were suffused with deepest crimson, and then fled, leaving them paler than usual.
               "Something that my cousin has said! Mrs. Langdon, that cannot be. John is one of the best friends that I have in the world."
               "I don't doubt you think so. But may I ask you a few questions?"
               "Certainly; as many as you please."
               "Were you not particularly attached to your cousin before he went to the West?"
               "What do you mean by being particularly attached to him?"
               "Were you not, in common parlance, in love with him?"
               "No, ma'am; neither am I now. I never thought of the thing."
               "Well, he has given people the impression that you were, and that your affection was not returned. Under these circumstances, you will not wonder that your intimacy with him now has occasioned remark."
               "Where did you learn all this, Mrs. Langdon?"
               "I don't know that I can tell you. It seems to be in everybody's mouth. Such things run like wild-fire, and it is almost impossible to trace them back to their source."
               "I cannot believe that my cousin has said any thing that will bear such a construction, without being so twisted and altered that he could not recognize his own words. I know he has not"
               "Better not be too sure. Oh! Fanny is sick. Would you like to see her?"
               "Fanny sick! Is that the reason she has not been at school for the last two days?"
               "To be sure it is. Did you think I had taken her from school?"
               "I was afraid you had; and you don't know how it pained me."
               They were ascending the stairs side by side, and Mrs. Langdon paused, and laid her hand on Mary's arm.
               "I will frankly confess, Miss Lester, that I have been greatly prejudiced by these stories. I had heard them from so many sources that I thought—to use the words of Blanchard—there could not be so much smoke without some flame. But I am beginning to feel that I have, perhaps, been too hasty. If so, I am willing to make you all the amends in my power."
               "I ask nothing but that you will continue to have faith in me until I am proved guilty," said Mary, bursting into tears. "Judge me as you would wish Grace to be judged under like circumstances, Mrs. Langdon. Remember how very few there are in the world on whom I have the claim of relationship, and ask yourself if it is strange that I am unwilling to believe that my cousin is not one of my truest friends, or that I have trusted him and clung to him, as to a brother!"
               They had reached Fanny's door, and Mrs. Langdon only replied by a silent pressure of the hand. But she walked straight to the window, and Mary noticed that she brushed away a tear or two before she turned round.
               It was growing dark when they left the sick room, and Mary declined to enter the parlor again. Mrs. Langdon accompanied her to the front door.
               "Fanny will be in school again in a few days, I hope," she said. "I am sorry she happens to be sick just now, but I shall be careful to have it understood that she will recommence her studies as soon as she is well enough. I trust this matter will be all explained before a great while, and in the mean time I, at least, will have faith in you."
               Mary smiled gratefully as she bade her good-evening.
               Mrs. Langdon was a kind-hearted, good-natured little body, very easily influenced by the opinion of those with whom she associated. But it was far more pleasant to her to think good than evil of those about her, and accordingly she was quite as ready to believe Mary innocent on her own mere assertion as she had been to believe her guilty on that of others. And she returned to the parlor fully determined to do all in her power to assist and sustain her.
               It would be difficult to say whether Mary returned from her interview with Mrs. Langdon with increased or diminished depression of spirits. In one quarter of the heavens the clouds were a little less dense than before, but in another they were growing darker and heavier. She was glad to know that Mrs. Langdon had not withdrawn Fanny from her school—that she had promised to have faith in her; but when she thought of John, it was with a fresh burst of bitter tears. She hurried home, with her face closely hidden by her veil, and quickly ascending the stairs, she gained her own room, and turned the key. She felt unable to see any one, even Tommy, until she had had time to think.
               And throwing herself on the bed, she did think long and painfully. Her whole life passed in review before her. She thought of her early cottage home—the dear, little brown house—of her dead mother, and her humble grave upon the hill-side, and oh! how her heart yearned for the love and sympathy that had passed from earth with the light of that mother's face!
               "If she were only here," she murmured, amid her scalding tears, "there would be some one to love and trust me always! But now—" and burying her face in the pillow, she sobbed like a grieved child.
               She thought of her first arrival at her aunt's—of the long years that followed—of John's kindness—of his efforts to make her situation more pleasant and home-like—of his own troubles, and of his leaving home.
               There had been nothing in their intercourse previous to that time that the whole world might not have known; she could recall neither look nor word for which she would have blushed, even in an angel's presence.
               And then, with a feeling of indignation that dried her tears, and brought the color to her cheeks again, she thought of their intimacy since his return. She felt that they had both been grossly misrepresented and abused.
               John had been kind and attentive to her; but his kindness had been such as a brother might show to a dear sister—nothing more.
               "It is too bad—too bad!" she exclaimed, as she rose from the bed, and began to gather up her dishevelled hair. "It is too bad! If I were Grace Langdon or Emma Strong not a word would have been said. They can ride or walk with half the gentlemen in town, if they please, and it is all perfectly right and proper. But I have no influential friends here, and therefore must not venture to ride with my own cousin. What do these people mean? Why do they talk about my having received expensive presents from him? Who could have started that story?"
               These were questions she could not answer; but the more she considered the matter, the more confident she became that John had not made such statements as had been represented.
               "It is all off the same piece of village gossip," she thought. "Well, I don't know what more I can do. I suppose I must only 'wait patiently,' as Mrs. Langdon said."
               About the middle of the next forenoon, Mary was interrupted by a light tap at the school-room door. She opened it, and saw no one; but as she stepped into the narrow entry, Amy Thompson peeped round a corner, with her arms folded, demurely.
               "Please, ma'am, may I come to school?" she said, dropping a low courtesy.
               "Never was pupil more welcome," replied Mary, as she closed the door behind her, and embraced her affectionately. "Oh Amy! you don't know how glad I am to see you. How did you come?"
               "With father. He was going out to the Lake, and was coming back to-morrow morning. So I thought I would take a ride, and make you a visit—kill two birds with one stone. Father said we mustn't talk all night."
               "But you didn't make any promises, I hope?" said Mary, laughing, "for I have a great deal to tell you. I wish I could dismiss my school for the rest of the day, but it wouldn't do. Come, Amy, the children will think I have run away," and they entered the school-room.
               At noon there was an intermission of an hour and a half; and when they were quietly seated in Mary's little chamber, Amy was speedily made acquainted with the state of her friend's affairs.
               How her color rose, and how her eyes sparkled!
               "But you don't pretend to say that anybody believes this precious bit of scandal?" she asked.
               "'Anybody' is very credulous, Amy. If I were to judge from present appearances, I should say that half the people in town believe me to be—any thing but what I am, or what I ought to be."
               "But it can't be possible, Mary!"
               "Yes it is, dear. Remember there are none here who know me as well as you do. Consequently, they are more ready to think evil of me."
               Amy remained looking silently out of the window for a few moments. Then she turned round suddenly.
               "What are you going to do about this business, Mary?"
               "Nothing. I have done all I can do consistently with my own self-respect. Mrs. Langdon is one of the first ladies in town, and was one of my earliest friends here. I have talked with her on the subject, but I cannot go all over the village repeating what I said to her. I did think, at first, that I would try to thread the labyrinth. Its windings grow more and more intricate, and I shall just let it alone."
               "Mary, you don't think that John has said any thing to injure you?"
               "No, I am sure he has not, intentionally. But he may have made some thoughtless remark that has been repeated, and altered, and added to, until it has entirely lost its original shape. Things 'grow as they go' in this world."
               "I should think they did! It would break John's heart if he knew of this. He thinks you are perfection itself."
               "I gave him credit for better sense than that," said Mary, shaking her head half mournfully, half playfully, "and so should you. Oh dear! it is school-time. I am not in the teaching mood to-day."
               "I believe I won't go to the school-room this afternoon," said her companion. "You will be back in two or three hours, won't you?"
               "Yes; I will try to get through as soon as I can. Here are some books, and the last number of the 'Lady's Magazine.' You can take a nap if you like."
               "Thank you. I shall take good care of myself—hope you will do likewise! Did you say that Mrs. Barnes and Mrs. Lee had taken their daughters out of school?"
               "Yes, and two or three others. But I must go now. Good-by."
               As soon as Mary was fairly out of sight, Amy put on her bonnet and mantilla, and went down street. She had not returned when Mary came home from school.
               "Why, Amy!" exclaimed the latter, as her friend came in, a short time afterwards, panting and breathless, and threw herself into a large arm-chair. "Where have you been?"
               "Taking a walk. Don't talk to me, Mary. I want time to collect my scattered senses. I'm afraid I have left them on the road somewhere;" and she playfully rubbed her forehead.
               "You'd better advertise immediately, then," said Mary, "and offer a large reward for their safe return. They will never be brought back if you don't. What have you been about, child? You look tired to death!"
               "I've been on an exploring expedition. I didn't want to waste my time while you were gone."
               "What region have you been exploring?" asked Mary, looking at her curiously.
               "Scandalania. Did you ever hear of such a place? Don't look so gravely at me, Mary," she added, throwing her arms around her neck. "I was determined to know more about this matter. I felt as if I must."
               "But, Amy—"
               "'But me no buts,' Mary dear; or at least wait until you have heard my story. You must know that I am acquainted with both Mrs. Barnes and Mrs. Lee. So I did nothing very outré in calling on them."
               "I was not afraid you had been doing any thing improper. But I know you have been on a very disagreeable errand, my dear Amy, and whether you have or have not accomplished any good, I shall not soon forget it."
               "I have discovered one thing, at all events; and that is, that these good people don't know what they are talking about. They seem to have an exceedingly indefinite idea of—something—! It would puzzle the head of a Philadelphia lawyer to tell what! Mrs. Barnes had heard that Mrs. Lee had been told that Mrs. somebody had been informed, &c., &c., &c. And the pith of the whole matter seems to be that they suppose John has made some awful disclosures with regard to your character; and 'of course they cannot patronize you.' I have no patience with them!"
               "I am afraid you hadn't a very large stock to begin with, Amy. How your cheeks glow!"
               "But it is so unwomanly! I always think there is something wrong about a woman's own heart, when she is so very ready to believe evil of her sister. 'To the pure all things are pure.' Mary, this matter shall be sifted to the very bottom! And then I should like to show these ladies the little grain of truth that may possibly remain in the sieve."
               "I think it is more than probable that they could not perceive it without the aid of a microscope. But what can it be about John? That puzzles me, I must confess."
               "And me also. Wait until one week from to-night, and then I will tell you more about it. See if I don't!"
               Mary shook her head.
               "You mustn't say any thing to John, Amy. I do not wish to have you."
               "I don't intend to. But mother shall. And to Mrs. Huntington. Mary, I really believe that she and your aunt Betsy are accountable for all this."
               "She and aunt Betsy!" cried Mary, clasping her hands in astonishment. "How can that be?"
               "Haven't you suspected them before? I have from the very first, and that was what made me think of going out this afternoon. I wanted to discover, if I could, whether the stories originated in Farmingdale or Carrolton."
               "But did you?"
               "Yes, to my own satisfaction. I am very confident that Mrs. Huntington can explain this matter, if she chooses."
               Just then Tommy came in, and the subject was dropped.
               We have no means of ascertaining whether the girls talked all night. But certain it is, that the low murmur of their voices, in the adjoining room, was the last sound that met Tommy's ears ere he fell asleep, and the very first that greeted them in the morning.

               THE next morning Amy went home. She had hardly entered the house when she began to repeat the story of Mary's troubles, and for a few moments her tongue moved nimbly. But she talked so fast and so earnestly, that her mother was but little the wiser.
               "Sit down, child," she said at last, laughing and drawing her towards the rocking-chair; "sit down and keep quiet for at least five minutes, before you attempt to speak again. I haven't any kind of an idea what you are trying to tell me."
               But when Mrs. Thompson did understand her, she was nearly, if not quite, as much vexed and annoyed as Amy herself.
               "I wish John was at home. He isn't coming until tomorrow night, so your father told me," she said. "That business has been very troublesome."
               "But you can go and see Mrs. Huntington. Do go, mother! this very afternoon."
               Mrs. Thompson thought it was a doubtful expedient.
               "It won't do, Amy. I can't charge Mrs. Huntington with having circulated these reports, for I am not sure that she did."
               "You need not, mother. If she is guilty, she will betray herself. Just mention Mary's name, and it will be all sufficient. The woman never knows when to keep still."
               "But it almost seems as if it would be meddling with what is none of my business. I hate to be prying into other people's affairs."
               "Now, mother! You do not really mean that. Whose business is it? Mary has no father nor mother, nor brother nor sister. She has no relatives to sustain her; and who will fight her battles for her, if her friends do not?"
               "No brother? What do you call Tommy?"
               
               "Oh, you know what I mean. No brother who can advise or support her in such a case as this. Tommy is so much younger. But, poor fellow! he did all he could, and he feels so sorry for Mary. If I was in her place, you wouldn't be so much afraid of prying into other people's affairs."
               "Your affairs would be mine; but don't look so troubled, so anxious, my dear child. We must all have our share of trials in this world; and they seldom overwhelm those who, like Mary, put their trust in the living God, and strive as earnestly as I believe she does to do his will."
               "They are hard to bear, nevertheless," said Amy, with tears in her eyes, "and I feel as if those who love Mary ought to do all they can to help her."
               "Well, well, child. I will go down to Mr. Huntington's right after dinner, if it will be any comfort to you. Perhaps I can learn something about the matter."
               Amy took care to have dinner on the table in good season, and it was quite early in the afternoon when a rap at Mr. Huntington's door warned the inmates of the mansion that a visitor sought admission.
               "Somebody's at the door," said Mrs. Huntington. "Here, Tom and Harry, take your sticks and things right into the back-kitchen—quick! Mari! you sweep up that pile o' shavings. Jane, take your duds and baby-rags off into the bedroom;" and after straightening her own cap, and smoothing her apron, she proceeded to answer the summons.
               "Why, Mrs. Thompson! 'Tain't you, is it? You're good for sore eyes. Walk in—walk in. It's an age since you've been here."
               "A very little age," replied Mrs. Thompson, carefully wiping her feet. "I was here last week, wasn't I?"
               "Well, maybe you was. It don't make no difference, any how. All well to your house, I s'pose?"
               "Very well, thank you. How are your little ones?"
               "Oh, middling—just middling. They ain't very tough, none of 'em. There's Tom—he can't bear nothing. He just eat a half a dozen o' them winter apples when he was going to bed t'other night, and he was sick near about all the time till morning. And Mari ain't much better."
               Mrs. Thompson smiled; but before she could reply, her hostess continued,
               "I see Amy go by with her father t'other day. Been to Carrolton?"
               "Yes. She came back this morning."
               "See Mary Lester, I s'pose?"
               "Of course. She went on purpose."
               "Well, I ha'n't seen much of her late years; and what's more, I don't want to. I never could make out what it was that made the Vauns take such a dreadful shine to her. I never see that she was any thing wonderful."
               "She is not, neither does she pretend to be."
               "She's got up in the world at a wonderful rate, any how. It's strange to me how some folks get along so dreadful easy."
               "Mary is very industrious and persevering. She has worked very hard ever since I knew her," said Mrs. Thompson.
               Mrs. Huntington tossed her head, and pursed up her lips.
               "I'll tell you what, Mrs. Thompson," she said, drawing her chair nearer, and laying her hand on that lady's arm; "I'll tell you what—Mari! go in t'other room, and stay with the boys—if other folks knew as much as I do about Mary Lester, she wouldn't hold her head quite so high. She's a perfect piece of deception!"
               "I never thought so," said Mrs. Thompson, gravely, and instinctively shrinking from her companion's touch.
               "I know that, and it's gone to my heart this great while to see you so carried away with her. If Amy was my child, I'd put a stop to their being quite so thick."
               "Why so, Mrs. Huntington? You ought not to speak of Mary in this way, unless you have good grounds for it. It does not take a great deal to injure a young girl's reputation, especially when they have no father nor mother to look after them."
               Mrs. Huntington's sallow cheeks took a faint tinge of red at the implied rebuke, and she replied rather hastily,
               "I guess I'm about as particular what I say as other folks be. But when I hear a thing, I hear it."
               "So do I; but whether I believe it or not depends upon who it comes from."
               "Well, I s'pose you'd believe what Mrs. Graham told you, wouldn't you?"
               Mrs. Thompson was on the point of replying that that would depend upon circumstances. But remembering the old maxim, that "least said is soonest mended," she wisely held her peace, and her companion proceeded in a lower voice,
               "Mrs. Graham has told me a few things, and them I know. 'Tain't likely she'd say any thing agin her own niece that wasn't the gospel truth. And being so near 'em, I've seen some things with my own eyes too. Now, I tell you what 'tis, Mrs. Thompson; there's more going on betwixt John Graham and that girl than most folks dream on. And 'tain't very creditable to neither on 'em. I wouldn't have you mention it as coming from me, but I don't mind telling you. John Graham never would have left home, and gone off out there to the West, if it hadn't been for that little minx."
               "What had she to do with it?"
               "Why, you see, Mary sot her cap for him just as soon as ever she came there, and—"
               "Oh, Mrs. Huntington," interrupted Mrs. Thompson, "that can't be. Mary was only a little girl when she came to Farmingdale."
               "Well, then, just as soon as ever she got big enough. I s'pose she thought 'twould be a mighty nice speculation, if she could catch John. She sot her cap for him, and she used to be dreadful sweet and pretty when he was round, and go to him with a long string o' complaints every time she couldn't have her own way. Mrs. Graham says it used to fairly make her sick to see the child go on. But John see through it all, and I s'pose he got clear out of patience, finally. He couldn't have no peace of his life to home, and so he just took himself off."
               "And stayed five years?" suggested Mrs. Thompson. "I should have thought a shorter time would have answered his purpose."
               "Oh, he'd had some little difficulty with the old man, besides. But he wouldn't have cleared out, if it hadn't been for Mary."
               "I am sure you are mistaken, Mrs. Huntington. John—"
               "Well," interrupted her companion, "all I've got to say is that Mrs. Graham heard John tell Mary so, the very day he went off. And the girl was a crying and taking on terribly. Why, it's just as plain as day! John hadn't been gone but a little while, when she followed suit, and cleared out too."
               "Did Mrs. Graham say that Mary wanted to marry John?"
               "Why, not exactly—not in them very words. But I knew well enough what she meant. Now, I say, that under these circumstances, it's dreadful queer he should be a hanging round her so now, or that she should let him. He's there two-thirds of the time."
               "Hardly as much as that, Mrs. Huntington. He rides over every week or two, I believe. Amy has gone with him several times."
               "Nobody knows how often he goes. He has the team just when he wants it, and nobody to call him to account. Mrs. Graham says the old man's dreadfully broke down. And as long as Mary knows he don't want to marry her, I should think, if she was what she'd ought to be, she'd tell him to be off and mind his business."
               "It is very probable to me that he does want to marry her," said Mrs. Thompson; "and she's plenty good enough for him."
               "Humph! John Graham is a regular chip o' the old block. He'll look out for the cash when he gets a wife. And then it don't seem right and proper his giving her so many presents. I shouldn't think any thing of his giving her some little thing once in a while, seeing she's his cousin; but when it comes to thirty-dollar shawls and silk dresses, it's a leetle too much;" and the worthy dame brought her hand down very energetically.
               "He hasn't given her any thirty-dollar shawl—it could not have cost that; and Mrs. Vaun gave her her black silk, if that's the one you mean."
               "You don't say so! I heard somebody say it was a present to her, and I s'posed it must ha' been John's doings, and so did Mrs. Graham. I should ha' thought the Vauns might have given her something a little more profitable, if they'd tried. Well, I am sure I hope it'll all turn out for the best. I don't wish Mary no harm. Still, in my day—when I was young—if I had managed the way that girl does, I should have expected—but I don't want to say any thing. It's nothing to me."
               "It is something to me," said Mrs. Thompson. "Mary has been in my family a great deal, and I have never known her to do or say an improper thing. And if her aunt talks of her in this way, it is perfectly shameful."
               There was an unusual tremor in Mrs. Thompson's voice, and her usually calm face was agitated and glowing. Mrs. Huntington began to fear she had gone rather too far.
               "Come, come, Mrs. Thompson, we won't quarrel about her. 'Tain't worth while. You'll see for yourself one of these days maybe, and 'seeing is believing.' I'd just as lief you'd think Mary Lester an angel, if you want to, and all the rest of the world. I hain't nothing agin her. Has Mr. Thompson sold his wool yet?"
               And the conversation branched off on to other subjects.
               Amy was more than ever impatient for John's return, after hearing her mother's account of her visit to Mrs. Huntington.
               "He never said any such thing, mother. I know he never did," she exclaimed. "And I don't believe Mrs. Graham has ever said half as much as Mrs. Huntington pretends. Do you?"
               "No, dear, I do not. I guess Mrs. Huntington's imagination has had quite as much to do as her ears have."
               John came home the next evening. Mrs. Thompson was on the watch for him; and as he saw her standing in the door, he reined his horse up to the gate.
               "Will you come in, John?" she said. "I have a story to tell you."
               "A story!" he replied, jumping from the wagon and fastening his good steed. "Of course I will come in. You haven't told me a story these many years, Mrs. Thompson—not since I have been able to reach this knocker, without standing on tiptoe," he added, laughing, and laying his hand on the shining lion's head that ornamented the front door. "What is it about?"
               But the smile vanished from the young man's face, and it grew dark and frowning as she told him. He listened without speaking; indeed he scarcely even moved, until she had finished her recital. Then he rose, without a word, and crossed the room with a firm and rapid step. Mrs. Thompson followed, half frightened—not at the storm she had raised, but because she had raised none. She did not like that ominous silence.
               As he reached the outside door, however, he paused, laid his hand on her arm, and met, calmly and steadily, the somewhat anxious eyes that were studying his face.
               "You do not doubt me, Mrs. Thompson? You do not doubt that Mary's interests, her name, her happiness, are as dear to me as to yourself?" he said, earnestly.
               "Indeed I do not, John. I have not doubted it at all. But can you undo this snarl? That is the most important thing."
               "If it is in the power of mortal man to undo it, it shall be undone, and that speedily. This is Saturday. You shall hear from me early in the week; and by that time I hope to know what all this means."
               And hurrying down the steps, he was presently out of sight.
               John found his father and mother at the tea-table. Both seemed pleased to see him; and the former had so many questions to ask concerning the business in which he had been engaged, that he had no opportunity to allude to the subject that was just then uppermost in his thoughts. At length, the old gentleman pushed back his cup, leaned back in his chair, and looked fixedly at him for a moment or two.
               "What ails ye, John? You don't look as bright as common. Had any thing in particular to trouble you since you went away?"
               "Not while I was away. Mother," he continued, turning round suddenly, "what is the meaning of all this scandal with regard to Mary and myself?"
               "Scandal?" replied Mrs. Graham. "Scandal about you and Mary? I ha'n't heard of any, I'm sure. What's the fuss?"
               "That is exactly what I am trying to ascertain. I hope, I really believe that you have not intended to injure Mary. But, mother, what have you been saying?"
               "Nothing," said Mrs. Graham, tartly. "I don't trouble myself a wonderful deal with her affairs. She's made her own bed, and she must lie in it. That's all I've got to say."
               "But, mother, there are some very strange stories afloat in Carrolton, and you and I figure in them rather too largely for our own credit. How are we going to get out of the scrape?" asked John, fixing his eyes steadily on his mother's face.
               Hers drooped, and she exclaimed angrily:
               "How on 'arth do you s'pose I know what you're a talking about, John Graham? It's nothing to me what Carrolton folks are a mind to say. I shall live just as long if they say one thing as another;" and shoving back her chair with great violence, she hastily retreated to the back kitchen.
               But John followed her; and Mr. Graham, whose curiosity was excited by the remarks he had heard, was not far behind.
               "I'll tell you what I am talking about, mother, if you will keep still for five minutes;" and in a very few words he told her what he himself knew of the matter.
               She said not a single word in reply, but kept on rattling the dishes in the sink with unabated vigor, while Mr. Graham stood midway between her and John, looking anxiously first at one and then at the other.
               "What does this mean, wife?" he said at last. "It can't be that you've been talking about Mary in this way!"
               "I ha'n't said no more'n the truth, if I have," she replied, sharply. "But I do wish Mrs. Huntington—"
               "No more than the truth!" interrupted John. "Oh, mother!"
               "Do you mean to say I've been a lying?" she exclaimed, fairly beside herself with rage and mortification. "A great deal of good all your book-larning has done you, if you don't know any better manners than that!"
               "I haven't said so, mother," said John, gently. "But what can I think of these things? You surely never told Mrs. Huntington that I left home merely to get out of Mary's way—that she was so much in love with me—and all that!"
               Mrs. Graham muttered some indistinct reply as she bent over the dish-pan. Her face was half hidden by the dense clouds of steam that arose from the hot water.
               "Do speak to me, mother! Do tell me that you didn't say so!" and John drew nearer, and laid his hand on his mother's shoulder.
               She jerked it away with a quick, impatient gesture.
               "I sha'n't say any such thing, for I think it's more'n likely I have said it. Mary hadn't been in the house six months—no, not three months—before I see that she was setting her cap for you, if ever a girl did. And for my part, I was more'n half glad when you cleared out, just on that very account. If you hadn't been as blind as a bat, you'd ha' seen through it before she'd been here any time at all, hardly."
               "Mother, this is perfectly ridiculous! We were mere children dren, both of us. Mary is a dear, kind, affectionate girl; but she never gave me reason, by word or look, to think that she regarded me in any other light than as a friend—a brother. If she had, perhaps—"
               "If she does, she'll make you a first-rate wife, John," said Mr. Graham, bringing the knuckles of one hand with much force against the palm of the other: "and 'tain't the first time I've thought of it neither—not by a long shot. She's a real good girl, and pretty enough, too."
               "Well, she won't be brought into this house to live, not while I'm alive," exclaimed Mrs. Graham, stripping the soapsuds from her hands, and facing them, in great fear lest her weapons were to be pointed against herself, and do execution in the wrong quarter. "If you're a going to marry her, you may just—"
               "Don't be alarmed, mother," said John, smiling faintly as he interrupted her tirade. "I am unable to perceive that there is any probability of such an event. But Mrs. Huntington says that you heard me tell Mary, the day that I went away, that I never should have left home, if it hadn't been for her."
               "You did tell her so."
               "When and where?"
               "You were standing by the window in the big kitchen, both of you, waiting for the stage to come along. I was going through the room, and I heard you say them very words."
               "Oh, mother! I may have said so—I do not remember—but if so, I did not mean any thing like what you led Mrs. Huntington to suppose. I only meant—I only intended—" He hesitated, glanced at his father, who was listening eagerly, and then came to a full stop. He could not explain his words without saying what would give the old man pain, and he let them pass.
               "I didn't pretend to say what you meant. Didn't s'pose 'twas any o' my business to go round interpreting plain English; and I thought that was pretty considerable plain—I never heard nothing much plainer."
               "But you knew better, mother. You knew that Mary had never said or done any thing to drive me away from home. How could you have done so! It was cruel, unkind, ungenerous; and she your own sister's child, and an orphan. She had nothing but her good name, and you have tried to take that away!"
               Between John's desire to vindicate Mary, and his unwillingness to grieve his father, or to say any thing unbecoming in a son, or that would tend to increase the bitterness of his mother's feelings towards Mary, he hardly knew what he did say. But Mrs. Graham was excessively angry.
               "Don't go to giving me none o' your sauce, John Graham," she said. "I won't hear the first word."
               "Hush, wife!" interposed Mr. Graham; and he laid one hand over his wife's lips, while with the other he grasped John's arm. "Hush, both of you. We won't have any quarrelling here. I can't stand it. If Mary's been wronged, we must try to right her. But this is your mother, John."
               "I will not forget it, father. I did not mean to be disrespectful or harsh. And now we will let the matter drop."
               Mrs. Graham turned away with a sullen face, and picked up her dish-wiper, and John went to his own room. He remembered perfectly, when he turned his thoughts backward, what he had said to Mary on the morning of his departure. He could recall, not only the words he used, but the feelings that prompted them. How different a signification had they borne then, from that since given to them by envy and malice!
               The next day was Sunday; and as John came out of church, he contrived to whisper to Mrs. Thompson the solution of the mystery, and to assure her that it should be explained to the entire satisfaction of the Carrolton people.
               "Well," exclaimed Amy, when her mother repeated John's words—"well, if this isn't a great affair to stir up such a fuss! The mountain has dwindled down to a mole-hill very suddenly—a smaller one than I anticipated, even. I never will believe a story again as long as I live!" and so she ran on between tears and laughter.
               "I hope it will teach us all to have charity, my child," said the calm voice of Mrs. Thompson—"the charity that 'thinketh no evil.' We shall be far nearer the angels if it does."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIX.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Serenely go your glorious way,
                           Secure that every footstep onward
                           Will lead you from their haunts away,
                           Since you go up, and they go downward.
                           
                        
                     
                     —MRS. OSGOOD.
                  
               
               THAT John may have had, in his boyish days, dim, flitting visions of a home where some sweet and gentle being, strikingly like Mary, should preside in calm and graceful dignity, we will not pretend to deny. But those visions had never been so clearly defined as to take the form and semblance of reality, or to become part and parcel of his thoughts. And as the years rolled on, and he became more and more engrossed in the stir and bustle of western life, they grew still more indistinct. The deepest feelings of his heart lay comparatively dormant during those five years. Shut out as he was from the sweet influences of home and of domestic life, there was little to call them forth, to rouse them from their long repose. His thoughts were of business—of the whirl of speculation and enterprise in the midst of which he moved—of the chances and changes of commercial life—of profitable investments, and safe bargains. These were his thoughts by day; and his evenings were devoted generally to his books and his pen. Society had claims to a share of his time, and those claims were not neglected. But he found little there to disturb even the surface of his heart—nothing that could reach its depths.
               He thought of Mary often, it is true, and their correspondence was prompt, confiding, and affectionate in its character. He thought of her as of one purer and holier than himself, with a species of reverence that was born in the earlier days of their intercourse; and with a feeling of gratitude that she had awakened within him aspirations after a loftier life, and a more enduring wealth than that which had, before her coming, in a measure satisfied him. But he never paused to ask himself if his affection for his cousin might not deepen into a stronger and more engrossing attachment. He did not pause to examine his heart, to inquire whether he loved her or she him. And when he met her again, it had been gladly, joyfully. But no quickened pulse—no throb or heart-beat betrayed the existence of any warmer emotion.
               Now, however, he was awakened from his trance rather rudely. He was forced to think. He was forced to ask himself how his own heart stood affected, and whether he did indeed wish to bind his cousin to him by yet closer and holier ties—to call her by the sacred name of wife. Perhaps it was hardly the most favorable time for a calm and unimpassioned consideration of the question, when his heart was thrilling with its bitter sense of the wrong and injustice that had been done her; when it was filled with burning indignation that he had been made an instrument in the hands of others to rob her of her fair and spotless fame; when the very thought that he had, even unconsciously, occasioned her such deep sorrow, and drawn such scalding tears from her eyes, of itself awoke a wild yearning to clasp her in his arms, to fold her to his breast, to kiss away those tears, and bid her weep no more. It was not the very best time, we repeat, to decide such a question.
               John was not one who could sit down quietly and allow a wrong to right itself. He did not doubt that Mary would, in time, out-live these slanders, or, rather, live them down. He did not doubt that her perfect purity of deed and thought would maintain itself, and sustain her, eventually; that she would come out from the fiery furnace, not only unscathed, but strengthened and exalted by the ordeal. But he was not disposed to wait patiently until that time arrived. He wanted to do something himself—to lift her at once from the shadows that encompassed her, and place her where the clear, unobstructed sunlight might play around her—that all might see how pure and true and fair she was.
               Yet he was very well aware that it was necessary for him to be cautious. By any rash or unadvised step, he might do Mary's cause more harm than good.
               "I wish I could consult some woman about this affair," he thought, "that is, some true and noble woman. Such a one would be my best counsellor."
               Of course Mrs. Thompson presented herself before his mind's eye. She was a good and noble woman, but he felt that in this case he would rather take counsel of one more worldly-wise than herself—of one who had seen rather more of "the world we live in."
               "Mrs. Vaun!" he exclaimed at last. "She's the very one;" and seizing his hat, he was soon striding across the meadows in that direction. The "cross-lots" path had come into use again since his return.
               It was Monday morning. Bridget was busy with wash-tubs and rubbing-board; Alice was amusing Willie, and at the same time helping Ralph shell some late beans for dinner, and Mrs. Vaun was not to be seen.
               "Where is your mother, Ralph?" asked John, after answering Alice's bright smile of recognition with a few playful words.
               "Oh, she's out somewhere. I don't know exactly," he replied.
               "Ask Bridget, Ralph," said Alice; "she knows."
               Throwing his lap-full of beans into the pan, he ran off to the wash-room, leaving, boy-like, every door open behind him.
               "Shure and it's out in the field she is, along with Mike and that greenhorn that's just come over from the ould counthry. It's a born natural he is, that same. Mike can't do nothin wid him;" and Bridget leaned against the pounding-barrel, and wiped the perspiration from her ruddy face.
               John laughed, and so did Alice.
               "I will wait," he said. "I presume she will be in presently."
               And in a very few minutes Mrs. Vaun came, laughing as she displayed her drabbled dress.
               "So much for being a farmer's wife," she exclaimed, gayly, "or, rather, for being the farmer himself. You don't know what a time I've had this summer, John, since Mr. Vaun has been away. I've tried my hand at almost every thing."
               "But I don't like to have you, mother," said Alice. "I shall be glad when father comes home. It seems as if it wasn't a lady's business to see about the ploughing, and the corn, and the horses, and every thing!"
               Mrs. Vaun affectionately parted the hair on Alice's beautiful forehead before she answered.
               "I am not at all alarmed about myself, my dear Alice. A lady should be woman enough to be able to do, or to attend to, whatever is necessary, without compromising her own dignity or self-respect. I feel quite as much like a lady in the barn-yard, when a due regard for your father's interest calls me there, as I do in the parlor or library. I will be at your service in a moment, John," she added. "Bridget said you wished to see me."
               "For a very little while," he replied. "I will not detain you long this busy morning."
               She returned shortly, having changed her wet dress, and led the way to the library.
               "Do you know Mrs. Langdon?" she asked, after John had given her some little insight into the state of affairs.
               "Not intimately; still I have some acquaintance with her."
               Mrs. Vaun made no reply, but sat as if lost in thought, and presently John went on.
               "I feel as if a few words from me with regard to this business, spoken in exactly the right place, and in just the right way, would have a great effect in enlightening the minds of these people. But I want to be sure of my ground before I venture upon it."
               "That's just what I was thinking of," said Mrs. Vaun. "I believe the best thing you can do is to go to Mrs. Langdon and explain the whole thing to her. She is an enthusiastic little body, and has much influence in Carrolton. If you can only satisfy her that Mary has been wronged, her feelings insulted, and her business injured by these scandalous stories, there will be nothing more necessary. She will do all the rest."
               "So I thought—so I hoped," said John, rising; "but I knew her so slightly, that I did not like to go forward until I had consulted you. I will see her this very afternoon."
               "And Mary, of course? Tell her Mr. Vaun will be home in a few days, and that I hope to be with her then."
               "I shall not see her until I feel that I have earned the right to do so. I cannot look her in the face, Mrs. Vaun, until I am satisfied that these aspersions can work her no farther injury."
               "You are not to blame, John."
               "Not intentionally. But I cannot wonder if she thinks that I am."
               John felt that his own mother was more to blame than any one else. She had given vent to her dislike to Mary in hints and insinuations, which others had taken up, and converted into matters of vastly more importance than she had herself intended tended. And he felt that it was his duty to remove the sting from her words.
               But how was he to do so without criminating her? She had strangely forgotten a mother's place, and her son did not, could not love her as he would otherwise have done. Still she was his mother, and he could not bear to bring reproach upon her gray hairs.
               He was obliged to drive past Miss Skinner's house in entering Carrolton; and accordingly he chose an hour when he knew Mary would be busy in her school-room, upon another street, and not likely to see him. He went at once to Mrs. Langdon's. That lady received him cordially, and begged him to be seated.
               They were in the front parlor. The folding-doors between that and the back, were partially open, but no one was in sight.
               "Excuse me, Mrs. Langdon," he said, refusing to sit, but placing his hand upon the back of the chair she offered him—"excuse me. I called merely to make some explanations to you with regard to the strange reports that are, I learn, in circulation concerning my cousin Mary and myself."
               "It is not necessary, Mr. Graham, not at all, as far as I am concerned. I have perfect confidence in Miss Lester's integrity, and in what she has herself told me."
               John acknowledged her words by a bow and a smile, that Mrs. Langdon declared afterwards were perfectly bewitching.
               "But I must make them, nevertheless. I must at least exculpate myself from the charge of having ever said any thing, either wilfully or otherwise, that should bring reproach upon her name. There is not a person in the world for whom I have a more sincere respect than for her; and that I could not have, if there was a single grain of truth in the statements you have heard."
               Just then there was a rustling and a whisper behind the folding-doors, and John paused.
               Mrs. Langdon smiled, and, stepping lightly across the room, drew the said doors completely back, discovering a group of ladies—half a dozen or more.
               "I presume that you will allow my friends to hear what you have to say, Mr. Graham," she said, bowing slightly to both parties. "These ladies are all acquainted with Miss Lester, and most of them have daughters attending her school. All of them have had."
               Hereupon Mrs. Barnes and Mrs. Lee, who were the foremost of the group, walked off with an air of offended dignity, and seated themselves on a distant sofa. John knew them by sight; and as he had heard their names in connection with this affair, his color heightened perceptibly. For a half minute he was inclined to think that Mrs. Langdon had done a very foolish thing, and he knew that she had placed him in a most unpleasant predicament.
               But as he met the glance of her eye—half roguish and half determined—he felt sure that although done hastily, and apparently from the impulse of the moment, it had not been without a motive; and he replied with but little hesitation.
               "Certainly. I have nothing to say that these ladies may not hear. Indeed, I shall be glad to have them hear me, if they are acquaintances of my cousin."
               He paused for a moment, and then proceeded.
               "Only a day or two has passed, ladies, since I first learned that falsehood and slander had dared to take Mary Lester's name upon their unhallowed lips. And it was with surprise and indignation, to which I can give no expression, that I heard, also, that I was charged with having said something derogatory to her fair fame. That last assertion has been traced back to its source, and it amounts to simply this. On the morning of my departure from Farmingdale, more than five years since, I remarked to my cousin, in the course of our last conversation, that I should never have left home if it had not been for her. Why I made that remark, or what idea I meant to convey to her mind by it, concerns myself alone, and I do not intend to explain it here. Suffice it to say, that she understood me perfectly, and knew that the words which have since been construed so very differently, sprang from a heart overflowing with affectionate reverence and gratitude. When I repeat what I said to Mrs. Langdon, that there is not a person on the wide earth for whom I entertain a more deep, sincere, and well-grounded esteem than for Mary Lester, I trust you will believe, ladies, that as far as I am concerned, she is worthy of your confidence. And the only charges brought against her are connected with myself, I believe?" he added, inquiringly, as he turned his eye steadily from one to another of the little circle.
               There was no reply. Mrs. Barnes and Mrs. Lee were looking out of the window, but every other eye met his unshrinkingly.
               "She is charged with no other improprieties?" he said again.
               "Not the shadow of one," replied Mrs. Langdon.
               "Then allow me to tell you, ladies," he said, with a slight smile and bow, "that you have been grossly misinformed with regard to the circumstances of the case, and have been—in common parlance—vastly more frightened than hurt. The sum and substance of the whole matter is, that my cousin Mary has been to me, for many years, one of the best and truest of friends—that she has placed me under infinite obligations, and that I have tried, in some slight degree, to repay the debt of gratitude that I owe her. Are you satisfied?"
               "I, for one, can answer that I am, entirely so," said Mrs. Langdon; "and I may add that I exceedingly regret having been so credulous. Whatever I can do to make amends for the unhappiness we have occasioned Miss Lester, shall be done."
               "I am satisfied," replied another lady.
               "And I," said another.
               "And I," echoed a fourth; "but, Mrs. Langdon, what do you mean by saying the 'unhappiness we have occasioned?' You and I did not originate these reports; we are not accountable for them."
               "But, my dear Mrs. Loomis," said Mrs. Langdon, "if there is one lady here who has not aided in circulating the slander, by repeating it to, at least, one person who had not heard of it previously, I should be glad to have you point her out. We are all guilty—every mother's daughter of us," she continued, with a lightness of expression that was belied by the gravity of her voice, "and the best way for us to get out of the scrape is to 'own up,' and sing with the little girl, 
                     
                        'Oh do but forgive us this one little time,
                        And we'll never do so any more.'"
                     
                  
               
               "I will leave you to a private discussion of this matter, ladies," said John, who had already turned to leave the room, "I presume that my cousin will consider your restored confidence ample reparation."
               Mrs. Langdon followed him into the hall.
               
               "You seem to forget entirely, Mr. Graham, that some apologies are due to yourself. You have been wronged as well as your cousin."
               "I have felt the blow only as it reached me through her," he replied, drawing himself up proudly. "I should never have taken this trouble to defend my own character from the aspersions of—I beg your pardon, Mrs. Langdon—either Farmingdale or Carrolton gossips."
               "I shall not quarrel with you for your pride or temper. Use just which word best pleases you," said Mrs. Langdon, laughing, and extending her hand. "But you must not leave me with such a frown upon your face, Mr. Graham, or refuse to shake hands with me either."
               John took her delicate, outstretched hand with evident pleasure.
               "And if you should happen to see me drive by here this evening with my cousin, would you be inexpressibly shocked?" he asked.
               "Please don't say another word to me about that, Mr. Graham," she answered. "I am thoroughly ashamed of myself, and I do not doubt that the other ladies are."
               John looked at his watch as he turned towards the gate. It was five o'clock, and Mary's school was out. Yet he shrank from seeing her. How would she meet him? Even if she had never believed that he had said ought to injure her, he feared that she would be intimidated by the knowledge that others had misconstrued her frank, child-like manner towards him, and that she would be reserved and distant.
               But he did not judge her rightly. She was too generous and confiding to do things in that half-way style. As long as her own heart and conscience told her that not the slightest tinge of impropriety had sullied their intercourse, she would not do herself injustice by assuming a different manner, or wrong her cousin by an appearance of distrust and coldness. It may be that her color deepened a little, a very little, as she entered the room, and that there was the slightest possible degree of embarrassment in her air. But it passed in a moment, and she responded to his words of greeting as cordially as ever.
               No allusion was made to Mary's difficulties for some time. At length John said,
               "Mary, will you ride with me? It is a beautiful evening."
               Mary hesitated. She could not determine whether John was aware of the existing state of things.
               "Is it best?" she asked, finally, raising her eyes to his face.
               "Best? Certainly it is, if you would like to go. I know all that has troubled you for the last few weeks, my dear Mary," he added, taking her hand in both his own, "and I cannot advise you to deprive yourself of any innocent gratification in the hope of escaping calumny. I really think that your best course is to walk calmly on in the very same path you have been treading."
               "But will it not seem like braving public opinion?"
               "I have just seen Mrs. Langdon," he replied, "and I gave her to understand that I should take you out riding this evening, if you would allow me to do so. I think you need have no more uneasiness, Mary. I believe she is entirely satisfied that we have given no occasion for scandal. And if she is enlisted in your behalf, others will soon join the ranks."
               "Fanny was in school again to-day," said Mary. "I wish Tommy was here! He has gone fishing with some of the boys."
               John watched her, gravely yet curiously, as she traced the figures on the carpet with the toe of her slipper. Looking up suddenly, she met his eye.
               "I will go," she said, laughing, and blushing in spite of herself; and away she ran for her bonnet.
               Mrs. Langdon was sitting by her parlor window, and kissed her hand to Mary, gayly, as they passed.
               "Is your mind perfectly at rest about these stories, Mary?" asked John, as they rode along. "Are there no questions that you want to ask? I have been expecting a dozen, at the very least."
               "I don't think it is necessary," she replied. "I am sure you will tell me if there is any thing that I ought to know."
               "There is one thing that you must know for my satisfaction, if not for your own," said John. "You must know and believe that if you were my own sister your reputation could not be dearer to me, or more sacred in my eyes, than it is now. You have not doubted me, Mary?"
               "No, John, not at all. For a little while I was shocked—distressed beyond measure—by what I heard. My brain was in such a whirl, that I could not tell what I thought, or what I feared. But as soon as I could think, I was sure you had not said what I heard you did."
               A quick, eloquent glance, full of grateful affection, was the only reply she received.
               "Do you remember our conversation the morning I left Farmingdale?" asked John; "while we were watching for the stage?"
               "Not particularly."
               "Don't you recollect my telling you that I should not have left home if it hadn't been for you?"
               "Yes."
               "Well, those few harmless words have been made of sufficient importance, and endowed with sufficient power, to conjure up this bugbear to frighten us all."
               "Why, John!"
               "It doesn't seem possible, does it? But that is all there is of it. Mother was passing through the room, and caught just that sentence. She told Mrs. Huntington, and Mrs. Huntington repeated it with her own comments and explanations. You hadn't a great deal of reason to doubt me, Mary!"
               Tears were running from Mary's eyes. It would have been difficult for her to have told from what source they sprang. The fountain was brimming full, and its waters were bittersweet. John slackened the reins, and allowed the horse to choose its own pace, as he strove to soothe her. He had never seen her so greatly agitated.
               "It is too bad!" she exclaimed, at last, dashing away the bright drops.
               John smiled.
               "What is too bad? That I haven't been an unfaithful friend?"
               "No, no, John, not that. But that I have been made so unhappy for nothing! That such a trifle should have been so magnified! I don't know, on the whole, but I would rather have had a better cause for my sorrow."
               "You don't fancy 'much ado about nothing,' then?" said John. "Neither do I, generally. But I can't join in your tears on that score, in the present instance."
               Mary did not tell John the feeling that was, perhaps, uppermost in her heart just then. In spite of the ill-treatment she had received from her aunt—small reason as she had to love her—she could not forget—she did not wish to forget—that she was the sister of the mother she had so fondly loved, so deeply mourned. Unconsciously even to herself, she had hoped that the day would come when they might be upon different terms. And this new evidence of animosity, of determined ill-will on the part of the only woman in the wide world to whom, she was bound by the ties of kindred, affected her more deeply than she would have cared to acknowledge.
               And the thought, too, that such mere trifles—the veriest nothings, in truth—had been made to work her so much injury, and cause her so much grief, made her realize more painfully than ever before how few there were whom she could trust, or whose interests were identical with her own.
               John perceived, to his sorrow, that there was for Mary quite as much pain as pleasure in that ride; and he soon turned his horse's head homeward.
               Weeks passed, Mrs. Langdon was no lukewarm friend, and her efforts to increase the number of Mary's pupils, and to restore her to her old position in the estimation of the community, were unceasing and successful. Those scholars who had been withdrawn, were all restored to her, with the exception of the daughters of Mrs. Barnes and Mrs. Lee. They still remained true to their old enmity; but their children's places were more than filled, and Mary did not regret their loss.
               Miss Skinner made numberless apologies for her unkindness, and begged so earnestly that Mary would remain with her, assuring her that she should not feel that she was forgiven unless she did, that the idea of another boarding-place was given up, and all things, apparently, moved on smoothly as before.
               But Mary's face did not brighten very fast—not as fast as her good friends wished. She had felt far more than she had expressed. She had made no parade of her grief, and it had lain upon her heart, leaving a deep and enduring impression there. Her peculiarly sensitive nature—her shrinking delicacy of feeling, had received a shock from which they were long recovering.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXX.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Rosalind.
                           Not true in love?
                        
                        
                           Celia.
                           Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
                        
                     
                     —AS YOU LIKE IT.
                  
               
               IT was a cool evening in October. There was a small, bright fire glowing on the hearth in Miss Skinner's parlor. The curtains were closely drawn, and the shade-lamp stood upon the centre-table, around which sat Mary, John, and Tommy.
               The work-basket of the former, two or three volumes of poetry and romance—to say nothing of an open lexicon and a Greek grammar, upon the fly-leaf of which was inscribed in large letters, "Thomas Lester, Carrolton Academy"—lay upon the table. The group around it were unusually silent. All seemed intent upon their various tasks. Mary stitched away upon the collar she was making for Tommy; he himself, every now and then, turned the leaves of his lexicon with a rapid hand, rustling the leaves at a terrible rate; and John's attention was, ostensibly, devoted to the book he held. But a close observer would have noticed that his eyes sought Mary's face, far oftener than was indicative of very absorbing interest in the pages over which he was glancing.
               At length Tommy broke the silence.
               "Are we having a Quaker meeting, or aren't we? Because if we are not, I think it is time for somebody to speak."
               "I should think somebody had spoken," replied Mary, smiling. "What are you buttoning up your coat for, Tommy?"
               "I must run over to the academy for a few minutes. Professor Larkins promised to meet a few of us there to make some, arrangements about exhibition."
               "Don't be out late, dear. You have such a cold. Fold this handkerchief round your throat."
               "No, no," said Tommy, pushing it from him with a laugh. "John, Mary never will believe that I have outgrown the years of babyhood;" and off he went.
               "Put up your work, Mary," said John, playfully taking it from her hand. "You'll spoil your eyes. Come and read with me."
               "That won't mend the matter much," she replied. "Sewing is no worse than reading. What book have you there?"
               "The last edition of Bryant. I'll read to you. I want you to admire this poem—The Past—as much as I do."
               "It is one of my favorites already. But read it. It will bear countless repetitions."
               John read admirably. His voice was full, richly toned, and under perfect command. When he had finished the poem, he glanced at Mary, expecting to see, as usual, her pleasure in her eyes.
               They were cast down; and their heavy lashes drooped beneath the weight of unshed tears. As he looked, the sparkling drops fell, one after another.
               "Mary! my dear Mary! what is grieving you this evening?" asked John, as he drew more closely to her side. "What is it? Don't weep so, but tell me!"
               "It is nothing—nothing new, John. I have felt sad all day," she replied, trying to keep back the tears that would have their way; "and that noble poem opened the flood-gates, I suppose. Don't mind me. I am very foolish."
               "I must mind you, Mary. I cannot help it. You are so altered of late. You seem to look at life with another pair of eyes. If you were seldom very gay, you always used to be cheerful."
               "I am growing older. Probably the change can be accounted for in that way."
               "No, it cannot. I wish you would stop teaching, Mary. The confinement is too much for you. It weighs upon your spirits. Go back to Mr. Vaun's. They miss you; they long to have you with them again. I heard Alice say so the other day."
               "That is not it," she said, slowly shaking her head. "Work does not hurt me; it does me good."
               "But not too much of it. Do you have any difficulty with your school nowadays, or with any one?"
               "No."
               The tears were falling faster and faster.
               "Mary, I believe you are allowing that foolish piece of scandal dal to trouble you yet," said John, laying his hand gently on hers. "You should not do so. It is needless, entirely."
               "It does not trouble me now, John. I hardly think of it: but yet it affects me. I can't help it. I have not the same confidence in myself or others that I had before. I seem to be all the time on the lookout for some hidden evil. The unsuspecting frankness of my nature is all gone. And I can't bear to feel so."
               "You will not feel so long, Mary. You are not well. You are nervous and tired. You must close your school and go home."
               "Home!" echoed Mary's heart, but not audibly. Where was her home?
               "You forget Tommy," she said.
               "No, I do not. Tommy shall stay just where he is. I will attend to that."
               Mary smiled through her tears.
               "I cannot consent to that, John, although I am not the less grateful to you. I promised myself, long ago, that he should never be dependent on any one but me."
               "I do not wish him to depend on any save you—and yours," he added in a lower voice. "Mary, give me a brother's right to provide for and look after him."
               She cast one startled glance at his face, and then her eyes sought their old position—the floor.
               "Will you not, Mary?" he continued, as she did not speak. "Will you not be my wife? I have loved you these many years."
               The manner in which Mary received this—the first declaration of love to which she had ever listened—was, perhaps, characteristic. She did not blush, nor tremble. But gravely, very gravely, her thoughts retraced all the years of her acquaintance with the friend by her side. The tumult of feeling, the tears, the excitement, subsided in a moment, and she sat motionless as a statue, and, to all appearance, as calm; while, as at a glance, her spirit was reading the pages of the past.
               Several minutes passed before she turned the last leaf, and her thoughts came home to the present again. Then she became conscious that her cousin was awaiting her reply, and that she must speak.
               Her hand lay in his, and she did not withdraw it. On the contrary, she placed the other by its side, as she replied:
               "Not your wife, John, but your best friend, always!"
               John looked steadily and earnestly in the clear eyes that now sought his own so calmly and truthfully. There was no concealment there. He felt that her words had not sprung from maiden coyness, or from a coquettish wish to test the strength of his affection. She was too frank, too confiding for that.
               Reverently he bent over her, and touched his lips to her forehead.
               "May God bless you, Mary. You have long been that. My love for you is not a romantic passion, but it is deep and abiding. If your lot were cast with mine, my life should be devoted to your happiness."
               "I do not doubt it, John. I trust you entirely. But it cannot be: it is not best."
               "Why?" John would have asked, had not something in Mary's face told him it would be useless. He kissed her hands two or three times, and released them. Mary felt, as he did so, that the subject was dismissed forever.
               The conversation of that evening did not, apparently, affect their relations in the least. John's calls were no less frequent than they had hitherto been. If there was any difference at all, Mary thought he was even more kind, thoughtful, and brotherly than before.
               One afternoon when Mary returned from school, she found Mrs. Vaun awaiting her arrival.
               "But where is Mr. Vaun?" she asked, after they had exchanged greetings.
               "He will be in by and by. He had some business to attend to at the court-house."
               They went up stairs to Mary's room. It was some time since they had met, and there was much to say on both sides. At length, during a short pause in their conversation, Mary looked up suddenly, and met her friend's eyes, which were fixed upon her with a curious expression.
               They both laughed.
               "Mary, what in the world is the reason that you wouldn't marry John?"
               She started.
               "How did you know I had had a chance to marry him?"
               
               "A little bird told me. Come! I am going to sit in this great chair, invest myself with the dignity and office of a confessor, and ask you just as many questions as I please. Why didn't you say 'yes' instead of 'no?'"
               "I had several reasons for not doing so."
               Good ones?"
               "First-rate, two of them."
               "Well, for pity's sake, do, tell me what they were. I think it would have been just the thing."
               Mary hesitated for a 'little while Mrs. Vaun still kept looking at her with that curious smile.
               "What were they? I must know!"
               "In the first place, Mrs. Vaun, I didn't think I loved him well enough."
               "Pshaw! I don't suppose you knew whether you did or not. You shouldn't have been in such a hurry."
               "I knew well enough. If he had been more of a stranger, perhaps it would have taken me longer to decide."
               "I always supposed you thought the world of him!"
               "So I do. But, Mrs. Vaun, he seems too much like a brother. I don't believe I could force myself to regard him in any other light."
               "Did you ever see any one whom you liked better, Mary?"
               "No one whom I like better. But I haven't the least doubt that there are those whom I could love better, even though they were less worthy of love. I couldn't marry a cousin."
               "I can't quarrel with that reason, if you feel so, Mary," said Mrs. Vaun. A woman's heart is a wilful thing. I believe it is easier to conquer an attachment than to force one. But what was your other reason? You said you had two that were first-rate.'"
               "I didn't think John loved me, either. Not as he thought he did."
               "Why, Mary!" exclaimed Mrs. Vaun, while her eyes dilated. "Is that doing him justice? What could have made him ask you to become his wife, if he didn't love you?"
               "I never doubted that he believed he did, Mrs. Vaun. But, nevertheless, I thought, and I still think, that he was mistaken."
               "It's a queer thing for a man to be mistaken about!"
               Is it? I don't, know. It seems to me very possible."
               "Do explain yourself, Mary. You are really provoking. What do you mean?"
               Mary laughed a low, musical laugh.
               "I hardly know how to make myself intelligible. But I have a strong impression that I am correct. Have you ever heard that Pity was Love's twin sister?"
               "What has that to do with the case? Confine yourself to the point at issue, if you please, Miss Lester."
               Mary went on more soberly.
               "Isn't it strange, if John really loved me, that he didn't find it out before? I don't believe he ever thought of it until this last month; until—to speak plain English—it was put into his head by other people, and he couldn't help thinking of it."
               "That is no reason why you should think he does not love you now."
               "Perhaps not. Don't misunderstand me, Mrs. Vaun. I have perfect confidence in John's truthfulness and sincerity."
               "He said he loved you, didn't he?"
               "Yes. Mrs. Vaun," she continued, laughing again, "my powers of expression seem to be inadequate to this occasion. I love John as a dear brother—almost as well as I do Tommy—and I believe he loves me as a sister. But not a whit more or less."
               "How happened he to make such a blunder then?"
               "Very naturally, I think. The stories these Carrolton gossips made such an ado about, aroused his indignation exceedingly. And in proportion to his anger towards them, was his pity for me. Perhaps it was all the greater because he knew that his mother was at the bottom of it. He couldn't help thinking of me a great deal; and I don't doubt that what he must have heard about my being attached to him, and all that, made some impression on him. And, finally, he began to think he loved me even more than he did. Can't you see how it was?"
               "You have made out a very fair case," said Mrs. Vaun, "and an odd one. Girls are more apt to think their lovers are dying for them."
               "Well, I can't think so in this instance. I haven't seen the least symptom of a broken heart in John yet. Have you?"
               "I can't say that I have," replied Mrs. Vaun, laughing. "But I will give you credit for a little penetration—that is, if you correct—"
               "I did not need a great deal. You will agree with me one of these days, my dear Mrs. Vaun. I am sure you will."
               "Maybe so. I am not convinced yet, however. John is no sentimental, woe-begone lover. Still I believe he is deeply attached to you."
               "So do I; but not in a way that will destroy his peace of mind: that isn't in a particle of danger. You needn't give yourself the least uneasiness on that score, Mrs. Vaun."
               Mrs. Vaun shook her head.
               "We shall see. Perhaps you are not as wise as you think you are."

               THE last of January arrived, and with it a four weeks' vacation for Mary and Tommy. The former had purposely set her watch by the academy clock, so that, when her brother was free, she might be also.
               Mr. Vaun came for them the evening that their schools closed. Miss Skinner followed them to the door, laden with divers boxes and satchels.
               "Now, children, I shall look for you again four weeks from to-night. I'll have a good fire in your room, Mary, and some of Tommy's cakes all ready for tea. Sure you've got enough wraps? It's stinging cold;" and she tucked the buffalo-robe more closely around Mary. "I hope you'll hunt up a little more red for your cheeks while you're gone. You hain't got a mite to spare now!"
               "I'll try my best, Miss Skinner," said Mary, with a smile. "A little rest will do me good, I think myself."
               It was indeed cold enough. They were all glad when the ruddy light, streaming from the windows of Mr. Vaun's house, gave sure promise of warmth and comfort within. The coldness and the darkness were all out of doors: they had penetrated neither the walls of the dwelling, nor the hearts of its inmates.
               "I am not going to spare you as much as I did last vacation, Mary," said Mrs. Vaun, after tea was over. "Amy claimed you full three-fourths of the time, and it's my turn now. If she wants to see you, she may come here and stay."
               "She promised to be here as much as she could," replied Mary—"whenever she could be spared from home. But you know Mrs. Thompson isn't very well this winter."
               "She is better—much better than she was. I will send for Amy to-morrow. What have you there, Mr. Vaun?"
               He was cutting the leaves of a magazine, apparently with very great satisfaction.
               "The Evergreen. It was in the evening mail. Come here, Ellen."
               She obeyed; and looked over his shoulder as he pointed out some passages in the editorial comments upon the number. Her eyes filled with tears, and, snatching it from his hand, she hastily glanced at the table of contents.
               Alice was at the piano, touching the chords with one hand, and talking to Tommy, who leaned against the instrument. Soon her father called her.
               "Alice, I want to read you some lines I have found in the Evergreen. Come sit by me. Will you hear what the editor says of them first?"
               "If you please. I always like to hear his remarks. But I don't always agree with him."
               "I wonder if you will this time? He says: 'We present to our readers this month—among other gems—an exquisite little poem from the pen of a new contributor. When they note its rare delicacy and beauty, and are informed that the authoress is yet very young—scarcely more than a child—we are sure they will think, as we do, that a star of no ordinary brilliancy is dawning upon the literary world."
               "Flattering enough," said Alice. "But how do you know it refers to the poem you are about to read? There is no name given."
               
               "Because there is only one article in the magazine by a new contributor. All the rest are from the pens of old writers."
               He had scarcely read the first line when Alice started and crimsoned violently. By the time he had finished the first stanza, she was trembling like a leaf; and when he commenced the second, she burst into tears.
               "Hush, Edward," whispered Mrs. Vaun, as she saw that her daughter was now growing paler and paler. "It won't do. Alice! my dear child!"
               Alice threw herself into her mother's arms, and hid her tearful eyes upon her breast, still quivering like an aspen. Mr. Vaun laid down the magazine.
               Alice threw herself into her mother's arms, and hid her tearful eyes upon her breast, still quivering like an aspen. Mr. Vaun laid down the magazine.
               "Alice, my darling," he said, "what shall I say to you? I thought I should give you so much pleasure!"
               She did not answer, but clasped the hand that was so fondly laid upon her shoulder.
               "Are you sorry I sent the poem to the Evergreen, Alie? I did not dream that you would be. I thought it would only be a pleasant surprise."
               "It isn't that I am sorry, father," said Alice, lifting her head, and turning her sightless eyes towards him. "I don't know as I am. But I was so startled—so shocked! I had never thought of such a thing. I believe I was frightened."
               "I have been thinking of it this long time, my daughter. Shall I read the rest of the verses now? Have you recovered from your fright? Really, I didn't know but you were going to treat us to another novelty, in the shape of an hysteric fit, or something of that sort."
               Alice laughed as she left her mother's arms, and clung to Mr. Vaun, caressingly.
               "No fear of that, father," she said. "I was in no danger, though I was completely bewildered for a moment or two. I could not comprehend it at all, for I supposed the only copy of the verses in existence, was locked up in my writing-desk. When did you send them?"
               "Three or four weeks ago. Don't you remember my asking you for your key one day?"
               "Yes, sir. But I found my inkstand replenished, and a fresh supply of paper, pens, and all other necessaries, and I did not look to see if any thing was missing. Does the editor know my real name?"
               "No, dear. You may preserve your incognito as long as you please."
               "I hope he don't know any thing about me."
               "Why?" asked Mr. Vaun.
               "Because if he knew I was blind, he might feel sorry for me, and praise my verses when they didn't deserve it. I couldn't bear to be praised out of pity!"
               "He does not know it, Alie."
               Mary, Tommy, and Ralph had all gathered around the table, and watched silently, but with sympathetic faces, the progress of the little scene. The former now laid her hand on the magazine.
               "Please finish the poem, Mr. Vaun. We are all waiting to hear it."
               It was read, and to a most appreciating little audience. For once, at least, the prophet was not "without honor" in his own country. Mary's eyes glistened with pleasure and sympathy. Tommy pronounced it "capital!" and congratulated Alice most warmly; and Ralph hung around her with a shy, embarrassed air, as if he was in doubt whether he might venture to claim her as a sister. It was touching, and yet funny—the astonishment, mingled with reverence and affection that beamed from his face as he looked at her.
               The excitement at last subsided. Mary was turning over the pages of the magazine.
               "I haven't seen the Evergreen for several months," she said. "I perceive that Mrs. Villars writes for it still."
               "Yes; there is something from her pen in nearly every number."
               "What a melancholy thing this little poem of hers is! Its sadness is really contagious. Do but hear it;" and Mary read it aloud.
               "She must have suffered long and deeply," she added, with a sigh, as she finished the last wailing strain. "Every thing she writes has that same undertone of sadness."
               "It will hardly do to call it an 'undertone,' Mary," said Mr. Vaun. "It is the prevailing—the only—tone. I think Mrs. Villars must be a very miserable woman."
               Mrs. Vaun laughed.
               "You are very much mistaken—both of you. I have known her for many years, and I am certain that she is a very happy woman."
               
               "Is it possible!" exclaimed Mary. "But what makes her write as she does? Her poetry is the quintessence of sadness."
               "Yes," said Mr. Vaun. "Broken hearts and broken vows, and blasted hopes and blighted flowers—and I don't know what all! Every thing she looks at is 'withered,' or 'crushed,' or 'drooping,' or dying, or in its very last agonies. Ellen, does she wear lead-colored spectacles all the year round?"
               "Lead-colored spectacles!" she replied, laughing again. "No, What do you ask that for?"
               "For curiosity's sake. I supposed she did. Mrs. Villars is a woman of undoubted genius," he added, more seriously; "but really I have no patience with her. If, as you say, she is happy herself, she has no right to make others wretched by publishing such terribly doleful verses."
               "Is her husband living?" asked Mary.
               "He is. They have one of the happiest homes in the world, and her children are little fairies. How astonished you do look!"
               "Well, who would not? I supposed she hadn't a friend on the face of the earth. For full three years I have been wasting my sympathy on her. It is too bad! I never shall have any faith in the sorrows of poetesses after this."
               "I think you are too harsh, Mary, and Mr. Vaun also. Mrs. Villars has the sensitiveness of genius, as well as its other gifts. A delicately organized nature like hers, is more keenly alive to the trials of life, than one differently moulded can be."
               "That is very true, Ellen. But should it be alive to the trials only? That is the charge I bring against Mrs. Villars. Not that she occasionally droops beneath the shadow, but that she never seeks the sunlight. Not that she sometimes sings of the restless yearnings that may never be satisfied here,—of darkened hours—of bitter grief and despairing sorrow. These form a part of our existence, and may not be forgotten or disregarded. But I censure her because she never sings of joy and hope—because her harp is never tuned to strains of gladness and thanksgiving. Life is not all shadow; it has more days of sunshine than of storm, let these sentimentalists bewail it as they may. Come, Alice, now for a song. I see Thomas is casting very wishful glances towards the piano."
               Alice had been sitting with a happy smile on her lip, and her hands meekly folded, listening intently to the conversation, but bearing no part in it. Mary noticed the expression of her face.
               "Wait a moment, Alie," she said. "Tell us first what you think of this question."
               "Let me state it, then," interrupted Mr. Vaun. "Mrs. Villars has received from the hand of her Maker the glorious gift of song. She would not barter it for the wealth of the world. She would count whatever might be offered her in exchange as the small dust in the balance—"
               "Even love?" suggested Mrs. Vaun. "I do not believe that the gifts of Genius, be they ever so glorious, ever satisfied a woman's heart."
               "But, according to your own representation, the boon of love is hers also. Affection makes still brighter a pathway that was luminous before. Now, Alie, is she justified in cherishing a morbid sentimentality, in overlooking the countless blessings of her lot, and in forgetting or refusing to bring her thank-offering to the feet of Him who has so exalted, so blessed her?"
               Alice colored painfully. She was so timid, so inclined to shrink from the expression of her feelings, save with her pen, that it was difficult to draw them forth, even in the domestic circle.
               "I haven't experience enough to decide such a question, father," she said.
               "I don't ask you to decide it, my love. I only want to know what you think about it."
               "I think that persons of real genius ought to have a keener sense of the beauty, as well as of the trials of life," she said, hesitatingly. "If they are more sensitive to its ills, so are they to its joys. Wasn't it Coleridge who said, 'Poetry was its own exceeding great reward?'"
               "Yes."
               "Then I should think poets ought to be, to say the least, quite as happy as other people."
               "I don't like the tendency of the kind of poetry that Mrs. Villars chiefly affects," continued Mr. Vaun. "It fosters, particularly in young people, a sort of sickly sentimentalism, a habit of looking only at the dark side of things, of considering themselves 'unappreciated' and 'misunderstood,' and of perpetual petual whining because 'kindred hearts' and 'congenial spirits' are such unfortunately rare articles. The truth is, children," he went on, looking about him with a beaming smile, "I advocate a more genial philosophy. It is true that there are depths of feeling in the heart that mortal line may never sound, phases of thought and of experience that can be understood only by those who have the key, and such we may not often find. But still, as we are all in precisely the same predicament, why need we grumble? And after all, sympathy, even with the wildest vagaries of genius, is far more universal than is supposed. What's the matter, Ralph?"
               "Nothing, sir. Only I don't understand what you are talking about."
               "And consequently don't find it very interesting? Well, you'll find Alice's music more intelligible. We'll have that song now, dear, if you please."
               Two weeks of the vacation passed rapidly. Mary thought old father Time had hunted up an additional pair of pinions, and was testing their virtues. Mrs. Vaun sent for Amy, as she had promised. But Mrs. Thompson consented to spare her only on condition that Mary and Tommy should spend at least one week with her. John and the "cross-lots" path became more familiarly acquainted than ever before; and his horses and sleigh—with himself for a driver, of course—were in readiness whenever the girls were in the riding mood. And that was every day.
               At the close of the second week it was necessary for Amy to go home, with the understanding, however, that at the beginning of the fourth Mary should come to her.
               One morning John and his horses failed to make their appearance at the usual hour. Towards noon he came over to say that Mrs. Graham was sick, had been so all night, and to ask Mrs. Vaun to go home with him. There was no woman in the house, unless a younger sister of Sally Davis' might be called such, and he thought his mother would be glad to see her.
               She went immediately. It was nearly dark when she returned.
               "Your aunt is very sick, Mary," she said. "If you will take Willie in your charge, and let him sleep with you, I will go right back, and watch with her to-night."
               "Of course I will. But what is the matter with aunt Betsy? Are they alarmed about her?"
               "The doctor is afraid of typhus fever. I don't know what others think, but it appears to me that she is in a very dangerous state. Just make me a cup of tea, Mary, while I put my double gown into the satchel, and I will go at once. John offered to come for me, but I would not let him, it is such a short distance."
               The tea was ready in a very few moments.
               "Run down cellar, Mary," said Mrs. Vaun, while she was drinking it, "and bring up a pie and a loaf of sponge-cake that you will find in the little dark closet. Mrs. Graham has always made such things herself, and I presume Ruby Davis don't know any thing about cooking. Tommy shall go with me and carry them, for I saw that the pantry was as bare as 'old mother Hubbard's.'"
               Mary was pouring coffee at the breakfast table the next morning, when Mrs. Vaun came in. She looked pale and exhausted, and her husband made her sit down in the large rocking-chair, and empty the cup he brought her with his own hands before he would allow her to make her report.
               Mrs. Graham was no better. She had been greatly distressed through the night, and now lay in a half unconscious state.
               "I don't know how they are going to get along," Mrs. Vaun continued. "Ruby is good for nothing, unless she has some one to direct her. When Mrs. Graham was sick before, Mrs. Huntington was there a great deal. But now they are not on speaking terms, and it isn't probable she will go near the house. John has gone after old Mrs. Humphreys. If he can get her, they will do very well. She is an excellent nurse."
               But in the course of an hour they saw him pass alone.
               A more uneasy mortal than was Mary all that forenoon, Mrs. Vaun thought it had never been her fortune to see. Half a dozen times she seated herself with her sewing, and as often threw it one side for a book. In five minutes that would be discarded, and she would stand first at one window and then at another, thrumming on the pane, and humming little snatches of song. Then she would go to the nursery, and have a frolic with Willie, and from thence to the kitchen to see what Bridget was about. So she wandered around until dinner-time.
               
               As they rose from the table, she went to the window again, and stood for some minutes gazing at the path across the meadows.
               At last she turned round suddenly.
               "Mrs. Vaun, I don't know but I ought to go to aunt Betsy's. What do you think?"
               "I have been expecting that question all the forenoon," she replied, smiling. "I knew your restlessness was the forerunner of some unusual action on your part."
               "But had I better go?"
               "I think you had. One thing is very certain—you are needed there. You or somebody else. I would go myself if I were stronger; but my head admonishes me that I must keep quiet."
               "It won't do for you to go. Oh dear! I wish I could metamorphose myself for a little while!"
               "What good would that do?"
               "Why, Mary Lester feels a very strong disinclination to doing what she knows to be her duty. Perhaps if she were some one else, it would be easier."
               "It may not be necessary for you to go to your aunt's room."
               "But that isn't all. There's John. Won't it look strangely for me to go there, after all that has passed?"
               "John will not misinterpret your motives; and I do not think that others will."
               "If I only knew some one whom I could send in my place!"
               "Yes, if you only did. But that is a very large if.
                  I don't know of anybody. There are very few young women about here; and those who are married, have their own families to care for."
               "I must go," said Mary; "there is no help for it. Will you send Tommy over with my satchel, if I put up some things?"
               "Yes—either Tommy or Ralph. I will be over myself before dark, if I can; if not, early to-morrow morning."
               How many memories rushed over her as she once again trod the narrow path to her uncle's! How her thoughts reverted to the evening of her first arrival there! How well she remembered the heart-sick yearning after sympathy and affection that had filled her little breast! And as her feet retraced the path, so her mind retraced the years, until, with a subdued and chastened, yet grateful spirit, she swung back the little gate, and went on to the kitchen door.
               Mr. Graham heard her light tap, and opened it.
               He started back with surprise; but, recovering himself as he met her quiet smile, he drew her gently into the room.
               "Come in, Mary, come in," he said. "I'm right glad to see you. Come right straight up to the fire and take of your hood. Are you well to-day?"
               "Very well, thank you, uncle," she replied. "Is aunt Betsy any better this afternoon?"
               "No better, my child. I'm not sure that she isn't worse. She's very poorly;" and the old man shook his head gravely.
               "Is there any one with her now?" asked Mary, after a pause. "She's in her own room, I suppose?"
               "Yes; the same room she used to have. John's in there now. Ruby don't amount to much."
               "Where is she, sir?"
               "In the back kitchen, or the buttery, or somewhere—I don't know exactly. Ruby!" he called.
               "Never mind, sir. I can find her;" and laying aside her bonnet and shawl, she went into the adjoining room—the well-remembered back kitchen.
               It had not altered a particle. The yellow paint was just as fresh and shining; the windows were just as bright; the little table stood in precisely the same position; and the large sink, where the coarser and heavier part of the dish-washing was done, looked—with the tin-dipper hanging over it, and the water-pail on the shelf at one end—exactly as it used to look. Mary thought the soap in the tiny keg that stood in one corner of the sink, must be the very same with which she had filled it the day she went away—it so resembled it in texture and color.
               Ruby was not there; and she went through into the woodshed.
               As she stood there, wondering if that wasn't the very same wood-pile, with the outer layer half torn down—she was sure there was the very same basket in which she used to pick up chips—the object of her search came along. She did not look as if the responsibility resting upon her shoulders caused her much uneasiness.
               
               "Mercy! Well, I never!" she exclaimed. "Is that you, Miss Mary?"
               "I believe it is," said Mary, smiling, "How do you do, Ruby?"
               "Oh, I'm pretty well for me to be. I ain't never very tough."
               Mary smiled again, as she glanced at the speaker's full, red cheeks and dimpled arms, bared to her elbow, cold as it was. It was difficult to believe that she was in any particular danger, even if she was not "very tough."
               "How is it about the work, Ruby? What have you got for supper?"
               "There ain't much of any thing. There's a little o' that cake Mis' Vaun brought over. They eat the pie for their dinner. That cake was proper good. I liked it first-rate."
               "Is there plenty of bread?"
               "No; there ain't more'n two slices. You see it was baking day to-day, and then Mis' Graham took sick, and so—"
               "I understand, Ruby. If you'll sift some flour, I'll make some biscuit; and we must set sponge to-night."
               Rolling up her sleeves, Mary set about collecting the various utensils she needed. She knew exactly where to find them. The rolling-pin hung on the self-same nail, suspended, she really believed, by the self-same bit of twine. She thought, with a half smile, of the last time she used it, and of her sudden interruption.
               "You take hold real handy," quoth Ruby. "I s'posed you'd forgot all about house-work."
               "I hope not," said Mary, proceeding with her mixing and kneading. "Doesn't the fire need more wood? Biscuit ought to bake quickly."
               "Be you a-going to stay here 'till Mis' Graham gets well?" asked her companion, suddenly remembering what Mary had said about the sponge.
               "I don't know. I am going to stay to-night."
               "I should be awful glad to have you stay. We'd take solid comfort, you and me together!"
               Mary made no reply to this patronizing speech. Probably she thought that comfort sometimes bore one meaning and sometimes another. Vocabularies differ.
               Just as she was putting her biscuit into the oven, John came into the room. Mary never knew whether he was aware of her being there, or whether he was not. She thought it was most likely that he was. But be that as it may, he had the good-breeding to manifest no surprise either at her presence or her employment. No one would have mistrusted—as he came quickly forward and shook hands with her, in spite of the flour that she laughingly displayed—that her visit was not an everyday occurrence, and herself a looked-for guest.
               For a few moments he conversed with her in his usual tone, but Mary saw that his face was very grave.
               "What do you think of aunt Betsy, John?" she asked, as Ruby went into the wood-shed. "How is she?"
               "She is very sick, Mary. Come into the bedroom and see her."
               "It wouldn't be best, would it?" said she, hesitating. "I don't think she would like to have me here, and it might disturb her if she knew it."
               "You can see her without running any risk of that, Mary, even if you think right. Mother has not recognized any one since noon. Come!"
               Mary followed him quickly to her aunt's bedside.
               Mrs. Graham lay in a kind of lethargy, with her eyes closed, and her hands falling helplessly by her side. Mary saw at a glance that she was resting in an uneasy position, and that her cap was disarranged in a manner to render her uncomfortable.
               Very quietly, yet expeditiously, she shook up the pillows, and, with John's assistance, lifted her upon them, brushed the hair from her forehead, and tied on a clean cap that she found in the bureau-drawer. The little old cap-box stood in the very corner that it did years ago. Then, with a light step, she passed round the room, picking up things here and there, hanging up this, and straightening that—giving it, in short, a much more orderly and comfortable appearance.
               "I guess them biscuits is done," said Ruby, putting her head in at the door. "They're beginning to brown."
               Mary went out to look after them, and John followed her, leaving Mr. Graham with their patient.
               While she was putting the warm cakes upon a plate, Ruby came in with a satchel.
               "Here's something or nuther Ralph Vaun brought. He wouldn't come no further'n the chips."
               
               "What is it?" asked John.
               "It's mine; it's for me," replied Mary. "Mrs. Vaun promised to send it. I'm going to stay a few days, if you'll keep me."
               She received no answer save an eloquent look of thanks, but she saw that John's brow lightened immediately. Presently he went into the bedroom, and his father came out.
               "John says you are going to stay here for a spell," he said, taking Mary's hand affectionately in his. "The Lord bless you, dear child. I didn't know where to look for a single soul to help us; and, as I said before, Ruby ain't good for much—not unless she has somebody to tell her just what to do, and how to do it. You've taken a load off my mind."
               "I am very glad if I have, uncle," replied Mary, struggling to keep back her tears. "I thought you might need me while aunt was sick;" and she made her escape to the pantry.
               "'Tain't every girl who would have come, though, if she was needed," said the old man to himself, as he gazed after her, with a strange mingling of affection and sorrow in his look. "She's just about as near right, according to my way o' thinking, as anybody can be."
               Mary watched with her aunt that night. John spread some buffalo-robes on the kitchen floor, and threw himself upon them, so that he would be within call, and could attend to the fires.
               There was no change for the better; and when morning dawned, Mrs. Graham lay in the same state of stupor. The doctor came about sunrise.
               "It is a very bad case," he said, in answer to Mary's inquiries. "Still, while there is life, there is hope."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXII.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           There was a time!—oh, sad and bitter breath
                           That sighs o'er loss of days, no more to be—
                           Of actions dropt to dreams—and dreams to death,
                           And then—Eternity!
                        
                     
                     —THOMAS BUCHANAN READ.
                  
               
               So the days rolled away, until it was nearly time for Mary's school to commence. Her aunt was no better. She had been with her by day and by night, tending her as faithfully as a daughter; but no word of intelligent gratitude had issued from Mrs. Graham's parched lips—no glance of recognition had beamed from her sunken, lustreless eyes.
               "I don't know what to do about my school, John," said Mary, one morning. "Vacation is over next Wednesday."
               "Not as soon as that?" exclaimed John, starting. "What can we do? It would be selfishness in us to ask you to stay here any longer, Mary, but I don't know how we shall live without you."
               "You needn't ask me; it isn't necessary. I haven't said one word about going, have I?" replied Mary, smiling a very faint little smile. "I shall not leave you until aunt is better. But I don't know how to manage. I dislike to have the scholars come together, and be disappointed in finding their teacher."
               "Why can't you put a notice in the Carrolton papers?"
               "Will there be time?"
               "Yes, plenty. The Star and the Galaxy are both published to-morrow, and if you will write your notices, I will take them to their offices this afternoon."
               "I'll write them as soon as I give aunt Betsy her medicine. Tommy must go back without me, and perhaps in a week or two I can join him. It doesn't seem to me that your mother grows worse, John; does it to you?"
               "I can hardly tell. She is evidently growing weaker from day to day, and her being no better is of itself a bad sign."
               "The doctor said yesterday that he thought her symptoms were a little more favorable."
               
               "I know he did; but Mrs. Vaun told me that she had a worse night last night than any when she has watched with her."
               "Did she? She was gone before I came down this morning. I thought aunt Betsy seemed rather more comfortable."
               John looked very gravely in the fire for several minutes.
               "I don't want to discourage you, Mary, but I cannot feel that mother is any better while she lies in this state. If she would become rational, and appear to recognize us, I should think there was some hope."
               But that week passed, and the next, and still they could not say to each other confidently, "she is better." Almost unconsciously their voices grew lower and lower, and their footsteps more and more quiet. The hush, the stillness of death brooded over the house, and each one felt it in his heart of hearts.
               Notwithstanding all the ridicule that has been poured forth at the expense of the eulogistic epitaphs that have been inscribed on the monuments of the most worthless of men, one of the most beautiful characteristics of humanity is to be found in the almost universal disinclination to speak ill of the dead or dying, or to cherish any feeling akin to animosity towards those who have "passed away." And as Mrs. Graham lay stretched upon the bed that all now realized to be her bed of death, it was not necessary for any one to say to those who stood around her— 
                     
                        "Touch her not scornfully;
                        Think of her mournfully,
                        Gently, and humanly;
                        Not of the stains of her,
                        All that remains of her
                        Now is pure womanly."
                     
                  
               
               They forgot all her coldness, all the harsh severity of her character, all that she had done or said amiss. Or they remembered it in deep sorrow, rather than in anger, and only prayed the more fervently that time for repentance might be granted her.
               Mr. Graham had not been a "man of prayer;" but more than once, as he sat by his wife's bedside gazing upon her ghastly face, he suddenly bowed his head, and his lips moved. Mary was sure it was in prayer for the helpless one before him. The old man clung to Mary as his chief support in that time of trouble.
               "If your aunt could only have her reason again," he said, "and know that she was dying, it seems to me that I wouldn't ask any thing more. But I can't bear to have her go in this way. We hain't either of us lived as we'd ought to; and maybe it's been more my fault than hers. I was the oldest by a good many years, and if I'd begun right, and thought more about what we are taught in this book," he continued, laying his hand on the worn cover of Mary's little Bible, "it's more'n likely that she would too. Oh! may God help us all!" and he groaned bitterly.
               "He will if we ask him, dear uncle," replied Mary, weeping, but twining her arms about his neck. "He is always ready to hear us."
               "He'd hear you, I know, and John, maybe; but I don't expect him to hear such an old, hardened sinner as I be. 'Tain't reasonable to expect it."
               "Yes it is, uncle. It is reasonable to expect that our heavenly Father will keep the promise he has made, and he has said that his ear is always open—that he hears the feeblest cry his children utter."
               But Mary's own heart was very heavy. Memory was constantly bringing before her, in vivid contrast to that dreary room—made dreary by the heavy, monotonous breathing of the dying woman, and by the pallid face, illumined by no light from within, no ray of joy or hope—the holy quiet, the sacred repose of her mother's death-bed scene. She remembered the subdued sorrow at the thought of leaving her children that had for a time shadowed that mother's face; but she remembered also how, day by day, the shadow had faded before the glorious light of love and faith, until at last it seemed as if she were so near the golden gates that her countenance had caught the surpassing radiance of the other world. And the scene in which she was now bearing a part seemed so hopeless, so cheerless in comparison, that she could hardly endure it.
               How earnestly she prayed—how earnestly they all prayed—that the spell might be lifted for a day, for an hour! that the departing soul might not rush heedless and blindfold into the presence of its Maker!
               We cannot read the heart. We know not, as we gaze upon the pale, cold brows of those who have passed away, apparently "without hope, and without God," what intercourse may have taken place between the spirit and Him who gave it—what homage and worship may have been offered within the heart's innermost temple, or what tokens of forgiveness and peace may have been sent to the struggler in the dark waters, even after, according to mortal judgment, "hope hath ceased its peradventure."
               This thought was all that gave consolation to those who stood by the death-bed of Mrs. Graham.
               Mrs. Vaun and Mrs. Thompson were both present when she died. Indeed they had been there, one or the other of them, nearly every day during her sickness. But after the last offices for the dead were performed, and the body was placed in the darkened parlor, with a fine linen sheet covering its rigid outlines, they went away, promising to return on the morrow.
               Ruby bustled about as usual, making a great parade to very little purpose. At length she came to the sitting-room door, and announced that tea was ready.
               Mr. Graham looked round with a bewildered air. He could scarcely realize that time rolled on just as it always did; that the petty cares and duties of life demanded attention just as imperatively; that there was no change in the world of nature or of men, save that one soul had deserted its earthly tenement—one restless, troubled heart had ceased to beat. It was only after much persuasion from both Mary and John that he was prevailed upon to join them at the table.
               "It don't seem right," said the old man, pushing back his half-emptied cup; "it don't seem right for us to be sitting here just as we used to, and Betsy in there;" and he pointed towards the parlor-door with his trembling fingers. "I can't eat."
               Mary and John glanced at each other as he rose, and followed him into the sitting-room again. They thought, as they looked at him that evening, that he appeared ten years older than he had the week previous. He seemed shocked, overwhelmed by the sudden rupturing of ties that had endured so long. Sudden—for death is always sudden, even when its approach has been long expected.
               "Get your Bible, Mary," he said, "and read a chapter—something that will do me good."
               Mary did as she was requested; and for a half hour the stillness of the room was unbroken, save by the low tones of her voice, as she read passage after passage—selecting those that she considered most appropriate.
               "That will do now," said her uncle, after the lapse of that period. "You have comforted me, my child."
               Bowing his head upon his staff, he remained motionless for many minutes. Then rising, he spoke, solemnly, and with a trembling voice:
               "Children, let us all try to pray."
               There was wailing and sobbing in the room as its inmates knelt, and the old man's feeble, tremulous tones floated on the evening air. The twilight was fast gathering; and when they rose from their knees, they could hardly see each other's faces.
               "If I had done this years ago, John," said Mr. Graham, as he released his son from a long embrace, "I should be a happier man now. My father was a good Christian, if there ever was one, and my mother was a praying woman. I was always used to having family prayers at home; and when I came here and set up for myself, it didn't seem right to me to get up in the morning, and go out to work without a word of prayer. And so, for the first few months, I used to have family prayers regularly, just as they did at my father's. But after a while it got to be an old story, and I couldn't get out to the field so early, and it kept the men from their work—or I thought it did—and so I began to leave it off whenever we were in a hurry. And it wasn't a great while, John, before we were always in a hurry, and I hain't prayed since—not until lately. If I had, maybe things would be different now."
               He was not very explicit; but the expression of his eye—as he turned it towards the parlor, while the faint light from the windows fell upon his face—was sufficiently so.
               The altar that evening re-erected, was never afterwards torn down, or suffered to lie in silent neglect. Morning and evening humble and grateful hearts gathered around it, and from it ascended the smoke of the sacrifice.
               Mary sometimes thought it strange, knowing as she did her aunt's peculiarities, and the very slight degree of affection that had seemed to mark their intercourse, that her death should make so deep an impression upon her husband. But, in the first place, she did not make sufficient allowance for the force of habit. For nearly thirty years they had lived together; they had grown old together. All the associations of vigorous manhood were connected with her. Since she first became his wife, they had scarcely been separated; and it seemed to him a terrible thing that she who had been so full of energy, of bustling, untiring industry—so engrossed with the cares of this world, and the acquisition of its wealth—should lie there in that darkened room, bound in chains that might never be broken, and stripped of all in which her soul delighted.
               And, in the second place, he had probably loved her as well when he first led her to his home, as most men love their wives. But that love—tender plant that it was—had drooped in the ungenial soil where it grew, and the cold breath of neglect had withered it. Yet the root still lived, and beneath the fostering hand of tenderness and trust, it would have sent forth strong and healthy shoots. It had done so, even in the chilling atmosphere of that room of sickness and of death; and with the thrilling whispers of conscience in his ear, he was ready to acknowledge—not as a mere form, but in deep sincerity of heart—that her errors had had their source in his own mistaken views of life.
               Whether he was right or wrong, is not for us to decide.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIII.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Little old woman; and whither so high?"
                           "To sweep the cobwebs out of the sky!"
                        
                     
                     —UNKNOWN.
                  
               
               ABOUT a fortnight after the funeral, as Mrs. Vaun was sitting in the library alone, and busied with some sewing, a light tap at the door made her lift her eyes suddenly. But before she could rise from her chair, or even say 'Come in,' the door opened, and Mary entered the room. Hastily throwing off her hood, she sank upon a cushion at Mrs. Vaun's feet, panting and breathless.
               "Oh, my dear Mrs. Vaun, I am so glad you are alone! I have been wanting to see you terribly all day."
               "Have you?" said Mrs. Vaun, smiling, and placing her hand lightly on Mary's forehead. "What's the trouble?"
               "Nothing—no trouble in particular. But I don't know what to do!"
               "That's trouble enough, I should say," replied her friend, allowing the smile to deepen into a laugh. "Trouble enough! 'Don't know what to do'—about what?"
               "Why, about any thing. Going or staying, either. I don't know what I ought to do."
               "Has your uncle said any thing more about it?"
               "Yes; he speaks about it every little while. He says that I must stay; that he cannot get along without me at all. And really, I don't see how he can—unless John gets married," she added, laughing.
               "What does John say?—you have never told me."
               "Not one word—not even a syllable; and he generally contrives to make his escape just as soon as uncle alludes to the subject. But I know he wants me to stay, for all that."
               "Of course he does. Probably he is afraid that any thing he might say, would do more harm than good."
               "It wouldn't. Mrs. Vaun, did you ever hear of persons going through the world with their eyes shut?"
               "No. Why?"
               "Oh, nothing! I merely asked for information."
               "What do you mean, Mary? You have the most provoking way, sometimes."
               "Way of what?"
               "Why, of saying things!"
               "I haven't said any thing, I'm sure," said Mary, casting down her eyes very demurely.
               "No, I presume you haven't—you never do," responded Mrs. Vaun, as she playfully pinched the tip of Mary's ear. "But I thought you were in a great hurry to talk with me. Have you forgotten it?"
               "Oh no, ma'am, not by any means;" and Mary's face, that had been brightened by an unusual expression, half fun and half mischief, resumed its wonted gravity. "Do tell me what you think about this business!"
               "I must know how you feel about it, Mary, before I can advise you."
               "I would rather go back to my school again."
               "Would you? I am surprised at that."
               "I have become attached to my scholars," continued Mary, "and interested in their improvement, and I do not like to have the school broken up. The idea is really a painful one; and, besides, if I go back to Carrolton, I can be with Tommy. You don't know how I miss him!"
               "Sure enough, there is Tommy! I have been leaving him out of my calculations entirely. What arrangements will you make for him, provided you conclude to stay here?"
               "Uncle said he should take charge of him if I remained here, and that all my plans for him should be carried into effect. Oh, Mrs. Vaun!" she added, while tears sprang to her eyes, "uncle Graham is so altered! I wouldn't have believed it! He doesn't seem like the same man that he was when I used to live there. Did I tell you that we have prayers now night and morning?"
               "Yes. What a change it is!"
               "A blessed one!" replied Mary. "He couldn't be kinder to me if he was my own father."
               "I should think you would like to stay there now," said Mrs. Vaun.
               "There is another reason why I would rather go back to my school," replied Mary. "It is so long since I have had any housewifely cares, that they really annoy me."
               "That is an unwomanly reason, my dear. I dislike to hear a woman say she don't like housekeeping. It is her peculiar province, and she ought to like it."
               "So she ought, and so shall I, after I have become a little accustomed to its details. Just now its petty cares, its host of trifling duties, its ceaseless demands upon one's thoughts, the constant attention to little things that it requires, perplex and trouble me. I like teaching better, because it is more improving, and I have more time for my own studies."
               "I have my doubts as to its being more improving, Mary. A woman needs the discipline of home-life for the full and perfect fect development of her character. It' cannot fully develop itself in any other atmosphere."
               "But I have had that discipline, dear Mrs. Vaun," said Mary, affectionately clasping the hand that lay upon her shoulder, and looking up with her heart in her eyes. "I was at home when I lived here with you; and in as happy a home as one need ask for."
               "Ay—but a little more of it won't hurt you. You don't have a great deal to do over there?"
               "No—no more than I can do with perfect ease. It isn't the work. It is this feeling obliged to see to every thing. Uncle has four cows milked this winter, and I told Ruby she must be very careful about skimming her milk; to be sure to attend to it every day, and so on. I didn't go into the milk-room for two or three days; but yesterday, I peeped in as I was going by. Such a sight! Half the pans had whey upon the top, and many of them were covered with a thick, dirty-looking mould. The cream was spoiled."
               "Ruby isn't partial to skimmers, then!" said Mrs. Vaun, laughing heartily. "You must watch her more closely."
               "But I don't like this watching of other people. I called uncle Graham to come and see a specimen of my housekeeping."
               "What did he say?"
               "He said if I didn't meet with any worse luck than that, I would get 'broken in' very easily."
               "And he was right. I believe you ought to stay there, Mary. Don't you think so yourself?"
               "Sometimes. It isn't always easy to decide what course to take."
               "You'll stay; I know you will," said Mrs. Vaun, kissing her; "and very glad am I. We'll have fine times. I shall take my sewing, and Alice her knitting, and run across the lots of an afternoon, to sit with you; and you'll repay us in the same coin. Won't that be better than teaching little girls their French verbs and Latin lessons?"
               "It will be very pleasant; but don't ask me to compare two pleasures so totally unlike. I believe teaching is my vocation after all."
               But if it was, Mary proved to all her friends that she could succeed admirably in another. Tommy was, at first, very much chagrined at the position of affairs. He did not like being separated from Mary. He missed her every hour in the day. But after a long conversation with John, he was apparently satisfied, and submitted with very good grace.
               As spring came on, Mary found her new duties at the same time more arduous and more pleasing. There was more to be done, and there were more hours when both Mr. Graham and John were out upon the farm, leaving her alone, or with no better company than Ruby. Yet still she was not lonely. The house seemed so much more cheerful and airy after a thorough spring-cleaning, and a new and more tasteful arrangement of the furniture.
               "This room looks uncommonly pleasant," said John, as he entered the sitting-room one evening in May. "What have you been doing to it, Mary?"
               "Not a great deal," she replied, with a bright smile.
               "What's the matter with the carpet?" asked Mr. Graham, who had followed his son. "It looks as bright as a new one, near about!"
               "I turned the other side up, uncle. It wasn't worn much. And then I wheeled the table that stood between the windows into the middle of the floor, and borrowed some of your books, John, to lay upon it; and put that little stand where the table used to be."
               "Well, it is a decided improvement," said John, glancing around with a very well satisfied air, and finally allowing his eyes to rest on a pitcher, minus a handle, in which were some wild-flowers. "But can't you find a better vase than that?"
               "No, sir; I tried my best. I had a tumbler at first, but that did not answer at all."
               "You shall have the prettiest pair of vases that can be found in Carrolton—at the stores, I mean—the very next time I go there. I wish we had better curtains. I don't like these green-paper shades."
               "Neither do I," said Mary. "If I had some muslin, I could make pretty ones."
               "What's that you are saying, children?" asked Mr. Graham. "I must have got cold, somehow. I don't hear very well these last few days."
               Mary told him.
               "You shall go to the store with me to-morrow, child, and get some, if you want it," was the reply. "For my part I'd about as lief see a good, nice window-paper, as any thing else. But times change, and I suppose folks must change with 'em."
               "And, uncle, if I had some chintz, John should make the frame for a lounge, and I could cover it as well as any upholsterer; and I would cushion your big chair, too."
               "Fix up just as much as you have a mind to, dear. I'll get whatever you want."
               "Don't trust me too much, uncle," she replied, laughing. "I'm very extravagant sometimes, and you may repent it if you give me unlimited license."
               Mr. Graham gave her an affectionate smile by way of answer, and called for his newspaper.
               "This is a beautiful work-box, Mary," said John, examining one that stood upon the table. "I never saw it before."
               "It is a beauty, isn't it? A few of my oldest scholars gave it to me last Christmas."
               "How they all loved you! I saw Mr. Langdon the other day, and he said they were going to have you back again yet."
               "Did he? What did you tell him?"
               "I told him that that remained to be proved."
               Mary laughed, and went to see about Ruby's supper-table. This last-named lady had not an artistic eye for the elegant arrangement of dishes and viands.
               When the muslin curtains were hung, and looped back with broad blue riband; when the neat chintz-covered lounge and Mr. Graham's large chair filled their appropriate niches; and when one or two choice engravings, which John found at the bottom of a box of papers, were framed and placed upon the wall, Mary thought there was not a pleasanter room in all Farmingdale. John did not forget the vases, and they were very seldom empty.
               Tommy came home nearly every Saturday; and in August there was to be another vacation. It would be hard to tell which anticipated it with the greatest delight—Mary, or the school-boy himself.
               "Mary, I think we might contrive to go somewhere when Tommy comes home," said John. "A little jaunt would do us all good. What do you say to Lake George?"
               
               Her eyes sparkled, and then a shadow passed over them.
               "I should like to see Lake George very much," she said. "But, John, I promised myself, long ago, that the first journey I made should be in another direction."
               "In another? Which? North, south, east, or west? We will go just where you choose, provided it isn't to the moon. For my part, I don't care a straw. I would as lief go to one place as another."
               Mary made no reply. She seemed to be struggling with her tears.
               "Where shall we go, Mary? It shall be just as you say."
               "I should like to go over the mountain, John—where we used to live. I want to see the little brown house again, and mother's grave."
               Her voice faltered. The last few words were scarcely audible. John took her hand gently in his.
               "You shall go, Mary. We will all go. I wonder I didn't think of it myself. Tommy will be home in two weeks from Wednesday night; and we'll start the first of the next week."
               "But how can uncle get along without us?" asked Mary, looking up in a kind of dismay. "Ruby is such a miserable calculator. I don't believe she would even think that bread didn't grow on bushes," she added, laughing, "until she went to the box and found it empty. They would certainly starve, both of them, while we were gone."
               "I'll risk it. You just see that her ladyship has plenty of bread and other 'fixins' in the house before we start, and we'll be back in time to save them from starvation. Father will be glad to have you go."
               "I might boil a small ham," said Mary, pondering over ways and means, "and roast a chicken or two. And Ruby can boil eggs, and make eatable custards now. I wish you could have seen her first experiment in that line!"
               "Why didn't I, then?" asked John, laughing.
               Mary shook her head.
               "They would hardly have been an ornament to the table, and you would never have wanted to see another custard. But she does better now. I don't know but I might leave things so that they could manage comfortably for a few days."
               "I know you can. Don't trouble yourself to raise objections, Mary, because it won't do any good. Go you must."
               "The weather is so warm," continued Mary, "that I am almost afraid the ham and chickens would spoil."
               "No, they won't. We'll put them in a pail, and hang them in the well. It is a first-rate refrigerator. If I live another year, we'll have an ice-house."
               "I do wonder they are not more common! I don't believe there are three in all Farmingdale. Mrs. Vaun says their ice is such a luxury; and the expense was very trifling—a mere nothing in comparison with the comfort."
               "Do you know how to make ice-cream? I mean to get a freezer the very first time I come across one."
               "No; but I know somebody who does," replied Mary, with a sly glance at his face as she ran away.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIV.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           There lived we many years;
                           Time dried the maiden's tears;
                           She had forgot her fears,
                           She was a mother;
                           Death closed her mild blue eyes,
                           Under that tower she lies:
                           Ne'er shall the sun arise
                           On such another!
                        
                     
                     —LONGFELLOW.
                  
               
               A VERY happy fellow was Master Thomas Lester when the plan for a trip over the mountain was unfolded to him.
               "Capital!" he exclaimed, springing from his chair in a sudden fit of enthusiasm, and giving Mary a kiss. "Capital! I've been wishing we could go somewhere, or do something, this vacation."
               But a glance at his sister's face sobered him at once, and he realized that the journey must, for her, be fraught with pain as well as pleasure. They were going on a pilgrimage to their mother's grave. Time had nearly obliterated all traces of her form and features from the tablet of his memory. There was a faint, shadowy outline—not clearly defined, but wavering and changing as he gazed upon it—a transient gleam of soft brown hair, an occasional glimpse of an eye in whose liquid depth was an unfathomed fount of tenderness, and at times the faintest possible echo of a fond, low voice—that was all. He remembered nothing more of his mother.
               To Mary her memory was still a living, breathing reality. The lapse of years had only mellowed and softened the picture. Not a tint had faded, not a line had been effaced. It glowed as brightly, as distinctly as when first painted upon her heart; and in spite of the radiant morning—the inspiriting sounds of early day—the easy carriage that John had procured for the occasion—his strong, cheerful voice—Tommy's buoyant air—Mr. Graham's parting benediction, and Ruby's curiously-worded congratulations—in spite of all these, it was with a saddened brow, and eyes that, by their drooping lids, gave sure evidence that tears were near the surface, that she gave her hand to her cousin, and sprang lightly to her seat.
               John both understood and appreciated her feelings; but so successful were his efforts to divert her from painful thoughts, that before they reached the mountain, the cloud was lifted, and her spirits had regained their wonted elasticity.
               And when they commenced the ascent—ah! then she had no time for the indulgence of sad memories. Eye and heart were both busy. Sometimes, it is true—perhaps we should say often—her mind reverted to her other ride over the mountain in precisely the present company. But it was with a burst of exultant thankfulness. With a mischievous delight, she leaned leisurely back upon the soft cushions (the carriage itself was in striking contrast to the heavy lumber-wagon of that olden time) and compared the John of the present with the John of the past, and wondered if the intelligent, gentlemanly man before her was indeed identical with the boy whose ill-timed questions and remarks had so annoyed her. She came to the conclusion that he was not.
               Mentally she retraced her past life, with its changing lights and shadows, its alternate—nay, its mingled—joys and sorrows. And as she looked upon her brother's sunshiny face, glowing with intellect, sparkling and animated, and met the glance of his flashing eye, so full of love for her, she felt that she was indeed "well appaid" for all the toils and sacrifices of her girlhood.
               They had started early, and long before sundown were approaching ground that was familiar to Mary's eyes. One after another, well-known objects rose before her. Now it was a red farm-house, with the customary out-buildings; now a solitary barn in the centre of some large meadow; now a tree of taller and more luxuriant growth than its fellows; now a patch of woodland, where the school-children used to go a-berrying. Eagerly she leaned from the carriage, tearful, yet smiling, and directing Tommy's attention hither and thither.
               "Look, Tommy! way off on the hills yonder! Do you see that little brown bit of cleared land? More trees have been cut down, and its shape is somewhat altered now; but when I was a little girl, I used to call it 'North America;' its outlines so closely resembled the map of that country as I found it in my atlas. There are Florida, the gulf, and the isthmus. Can't you see them?"
               Tommy gave a laughing assent; said he did, now that she had pointed them out, but thought she must have had a vivid imagination when she made the discovery for herself. Tracing the resemblance was like hunting for faces among the figures on wall-paper.
               At last John drew up the reins at a place where four roads met.
               "Which way now, Mary? Where do you want to go first?"
               She did not answer, but her cousin followed the direction of her eye.
               Far off, upon a sloping hill-side, the graveyard was just visible, with its unpretending headstones gleaming in the sunlight.
               "You look tired, Mary, and it is a mile off. Shall we go there to-night?"
               "If you don't think it will be too much for the horses. I am afraid it will be, John. They have had a hard day," she replied, with a tremor in her voice.
               John answered by turning their heads in that direction, and proceeding slowly onward. Not a word was spoken until they reached the gate.
               John sprang to the ground, and attempted to open it.
               "It is locked, Mary, and there is no key here."
               "I expected it would be. We must climb the fence. They always used to keep it locked."
               
               The horses were fastened, and presently they stood within the "place of graves." After looking around for a moment with a thoughtful brow and an earnest eye, Mary led the way towards the farthest corner of the yard, while her companions silently followed. But before she had reached it, she paused, and glanced about her with a puzzled expression.
               "What are you stopping for, Mary?" asked Tommy. "Can't you remember the place?"
               "It was in that corner, I am sure," she replied. "Father was buried there, and mother was laid by his side, of course. But yet there are gravestones at both those graves. Can it be that I have forgotten!"
               "Let us go on and see," said John, drawing her arm within his. "There were stones at your father's grave?"
               "Oh yes; but none at mother's."
               They had reached the two graves, a little apart from the rest, whose slanting shadows streamed far down the hill.
               John laid his hand upon the one nearest him, and commenced reading:
               "Mark Lester, died January 3d, 18—, aged thirty-nine years."
               Tommy heard him, but Mary did not. She was gazing in mute bewilderment upon the other stone, whereon were inscribed these words:
               "Jane, wife of Mark Lester, died October 5th, 18—, aged thirty-six years. 'Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord.'"
               "Oh, mother! mother!" she exclaimed, with a burst of passionate tears, as she read that beloved name; and falling upon her knees by the grave, she laid her cheek to the cold sod, and wept in utter abandonment. Tommy crept round by her side, and twining his arm about her waist, mingled his tears with hers, while he strove to soothe her. John leaned upon the headstone, gazing with moistened eyes, not at the graves, but at the kneeling figures by them.
               "'They are at rest, but we are in tears,'" said Mary, when at length she arose from her knees, unconsciously quoting a favorite author. "My poor father!" she added, passing her hand mournfully over the inscription. "It is strange that I don't remember more about him, for he died only three years before mother did."
               Her eye and her thought flew to the other stone.
               "But what can this mean, John? I am sure there was nothing left of mother's little property—nothing to pay for gravestones."
               "Why, only look!" said Tommy, who was closely examining the simple monument. "Mary! this is a new stone! It hasn't been up a week! See! The earth is fresh yet, where the turf was torn away when it was planted."
               "So it is!" replied Mary, while her cheek flushed. "Who can have done it? I don't know of any—John!"
               She sprang to his side, and, clasping his hand in both hers, showered kisses and tears upon it. His swimming eyes had betrayed him.
               Gently he drew his hand away, and supporting her trembling form with his arm, tenderly and in silence kissed her forehead. Tommy had grasped his other hand, and between them both he was a fast prisoner.
               "Shall we go now, Mary? The dew is falling."
               "Not till I have thanked you, John. But I can't; I have no words!" and again her tears—joyful, grateful tears now—choked her utterance.
               "I don't want you to, Mary. You have thanked me already. But don't weep so. You will be sick to-morrow. Come! I am going to take you back to the carriage now. I will bring you here again before we go home."
               "What made you think of this, John? How did you manage it? I don't understand," said Mary, as they were retracing their steps.
               "Why, after we concluded to come here, I recollected that I had heard you say, years ago, that there were no stones at your mother's grave; and I thought it would be a pleasant surprise to you to find them here. So I went to Carrolton, found a pair that suited me, had the lettering done, sent them on, and ordered them to be put up immediately; and then I wrote to your friend, Mr. Gibson, and asked him to see that the orders were obeyed."
               "Oh, John! how can I ever repay you?"
               He whispered a word or two in her ear, that brought a smile to her lip and brightness to her eye.
               "Of course," she replied to the whisper. "I should have done that any way."
               
               "Shall we go to Mr. Gibson's? You must give me directions, for I don't remember any thing about the place."
               "Yes; they shall have the first call. Drive on until I tell you to stop. You didn't tell Mr. Gibson we were coming?"
               "No. I thought perhaps you would prefer that I should not."
               Twilight was fast gathering when they paused at the well-remembered gate. It was so dark that Mary could only see the outlines of the dear little brown house. Tommy looked round for the bridge. That, and a faint idea of Willie Gibson and old Whiteface, were all that remained to him of his early home. But it was not visible.
               "You can't see it from here, Tommy," said Mary. "It is round behind that clump of trees. I wonder if they will remember me!"
               A light was burning in the neat kitchen, and the curtains were not yet drawn. Through the clear windows Mary saw an old lady—not so very old, either—busied about some household work.
               "It is Mrs. Gibson!" she exclaimed. "Oh, that is good! I was afraid they might have moved."
               Without waiting for assistance, she sprang from the carriage, and while John and Tommy were still busy with the horses, ran up the little path, and rapped at the door.
               Mrs. Gibson opened it, shielding the candle from the air with her hand.
               "Is Fanny—Miss Fanny Gibson in?" asked Mary.
               "Fanny? Why, no. Fanny was married a year ago, and lives down in the village. Do you want to see her? But come in; the wind flares the candle so."
               Mary obeyed, throwing back her veil as she did so.
               "Take a chair," said Mrs. Gibson, setting down the candle. "Yes, Fanny was married—let's see—it'll be a year next month. I thought everybody knew it by this time!"
               "Probably everybody about here does know it," replied Mary, smiling. "But don't you know me, Mrs. Gibson?"
               She started. Something in the tone of Mary's voice had aroused long-slumbering memories. Seizing the candle, she held it so that the light fell full upon her face.
               "Bless me! it is—no, it can't be," she said, gazing earnestly upon the expressive features it revealed. "I was going to say it was Mary Lester—a little girl who used to live here; but it isn't. I don't know who you are!"
               Mary smiled. Surely she had seen that smile before; and again the candle was brought to bear upon the stranger's face and form.
               "I really believe you are Mary Lester, after all," she went on, "now that I take a good look at you."
               Mary waited for no more, but threw her arms about the kind old lady's neck, and kissed her affectionately.
               "You are right, Mrs. Gibson. It is Mary Lester, come back to see her earliest friends again."
               Most warmly was her embrace returned.
               "And right glad they'll be to see you—all of them. I am, for one. But where did you come from? and where's that little brother of yours—Tommy?"
               "He's out here at the gate;" and stepping to the door, Mary called him.
               Thomas was very tall for his age, and had quite a manly air. Mrs. Gibson, who, half-forgetting the lapse of time, was looking only for little Tommy, started back in surprise when he entered.
               "Why, can this be Tommy Lester?" she exclaimed. "He is taller than Willy—a good deal!"
               "He always was," said Mary, laughing. "Don't you remember how they used to measure by the kitchen door, and Tommy's mark was always highest?"
               Mrs. Gibson was looking from one to the other.
               "You look like your mother, both of you," she said, wiping away a tear with the back of her hand. "Tommy has his father's looks, too. He was a very handsome man. I don't know as I ever saw a handsomer. But you must be tired and hungry. How did you come?"
               "My cousin brought us; the one who took us away. Here he comes," she said, as John entered to tell her that he was going on to the village with the horses, and would be back in the morning.
               "Mercy!" said Mrs. Gibson. "I sha'n't let you do any such thing. There's plenty of room in the stables, and lots of hay and oats. You mustn't stir an inch, Mr. Graham. Maybe that's the way you manage over your side of the mountain, but we don't do so here. We've got plenty of beds, and I'll have tea for you in a trice. You must all stay here. Jim!" she called, addressing an Irish boy, whose head was dimly visible in a back-room. "Take this gentleman's horses right off to the barn, and take good care of 'em."
               John made some faint objections, but they were quickly overruled. The horses were led to the stable, and tea was soon in readiness. Mr. Gibson came in, and added his cordial greeting to that of his wife.
               "You're welcome here, Mary," he said, shaking her hand very heartily. "I'm real glad to see you. Wife and I and the children have often talked about you and Tommy."
               What a host of questions were to be asked and answered!
               "Now, tell me all about Fanny, Mrs. Gibson," said Mary. "Whom did she marry?"
               "You remember Mr. Jones, who kept store in the village, don't you?"
               "Yes, ma'am."
               "Well, she married his oldest son, Robert."
               "Oh, I remember him! Didn't he have black eyes and curly hair? and didn't he sometimes wait on the customers?"
               "Yes; he's the very one. Fanny has done well. He's a fine young man, and is in partnership with his father now. Fanny will be so glad to see you."
               "And where are Sam and Willy? I don't see either of them."
               "Sam is married too. He lives on the old Willard farm. You must go there. He's got a real pretty wife, and two bright children. Willy is at the village with Fanny. He goes to a sort of select school they've got there, and boards with her."
               "Willy never was a bit like the other children," said Mr. Gibson. "The others took to their books pretty well, but he's always been crazy after 'em."
               "Yes," continued Mrs. Gibson, while her eye kindled with motherly pride; "Willy is going to college."
               "Ah! is he?" interrupted Thomas. "So am I! When is Willy going to enter?"
               "A year from this fall."
               "Why! so am I," said Tommy, again. "Isn't it queer! What college is he going to?"
               "Well, he ha'n't really determined. Some tell him to go to one place, and some another. His teacher graduated at Yale, and thinks that's the best place. But there's one objection to that. Willy ain't very tough. You know he never was," continued Mrs. Gibson, turning to Mary, "and I hate to have him go so far from home."
               "Oh, why don't he go to Carrolton?" asked Tommy. "I'm going there, and we should be classmates. I'll see him tomorrow, and talk with him about it."
               "Has Willy determined upon his future course? his profession or business?" said Mary.
               "He don't say that he has," replied the mother; "but I think he will enter the ministry. Willy has always been a serious, thoughtful boy, and it has been my prayer for a great many years that I might live to see him in the pulpit, preaching the gospel of Christ. And I feel as if I should."
               A pause followed this announcement, which was made with an earnestness and solemnity of manner that was both impressive and contagious. But there was too much to be said to admit of long delays.
               "Do tell me, Mrs. Gibson," said Tommy, "is old Whiteface dead? I remember her better than any thing, or anybody, except Willy, about here."
               Mrs. Gibson laughed.
               "She was a good old creature; but she isn't alive now. She lived a good many years, though, and was a grand milker to the very last."
               Mary inquired for Dr. Williams.
               "He's dead—the dear old man—and his wife, too. They both lie in the graveyard on the hill, where your parents were buried."
               "That makes me think—" interrupted Mr. Gibson. "Mr. Graham, I attended to the putting up of those stones, as you requested."
               "I saw that you did, and am greatly obliged," replied John. "We went to the yard this afternoon."
               "Did you?" said Mrs. Gibson. "But I might have known you would go there first," she continued, as she met Mary's tearful eyes. "It does my heart good to think you've had some stones set up, Mary. It hasn't seemed right to have her lie there without any."
               Mary was about to disclaim having had any thing to do with the stones; but John suspecting her intention, immediately changed the subject, and she had no opportunity of alluding to it that evening. The next day, however, she explained the matter to Mrs. Gibson.
               "You don't know how I have longed to get the stones, Mrs. Gibson; yet I couldn't. It has been all I could do to get along and educate Tommy. And I have felt," she added, tearfully, "that if my mother was permitted to look down from her home on high and behold her children, she would regard my efforts to take care of her 'little one,' as she used to call him, and to bring him up as she would have wished, as a far greater proof of my love for her than the costliest monument would have been."
               "It is—it is, my dear child," was the affectionate reply. "I didn't mean to hurt your feelings by what I said. I loved your mother most as well as if she had been my own sister; and she wouldn't have lain there so long, with nothing to mark the spot where she was sleeping, if we'd been richer. But it's been about as much as we could do to live. Mr. Gibson wanted to do something for Sam; and then there was Fanny's setting out when she got married; and educating 'em all. We hain't laid up much."
               Let it not be supposed that all the questions asked came from Mary's lips. Mrs. Gibson, on her part, had many inquiries to make. It seemed as if she could never hear enough of the welfare and the plans of the children in whom she had felt so deep an interest.
               The next few days fled like a dream. There were so many old familiar haunts to revisit—so many old acquaintances to hunt up. Every nook where Mary had played in her childhood; every spot that had been loved by their mother, she was anxious that Tommy should see. The little brown house was uninhabited, and going to decay. The woodbine had clambered up on the roof, and clung around one of the chimneys. The moss had grown thicker and greener than ever, and the rose-bushes on either side of the humble doorway had stretched their arms across, as if to guard the entrance.
               But despite the damp, and the crumbling walls, and the creaking floors, they spent some sadly-pleasant hours within and around the little building. Tommy left it with a far clearer impression of his mother than he had ever had before. Here she had lived and loved, and suffered and died. Her presence seemed to linger about the spot—her spirit to hover over it. They carried away a bit of the broken mantel of the room in which she breathed her last, to be treasured through their whole lives as a most sacred relic.
               Fanny seemed delighted to welcome Mary to her own pleasant home—and Sam none the less so.
               When our friends left them, it was with the promise of a speedy reunion at Farmingdale.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXV.
               
                  
                     
                        May this be possible? May this be true?
                     
                     —SHAKSPEARE.
                  
               
               SUMMER had flown; but her fair children—the flowers—yet lingered in the sheltered valleys. The corn was shocked, and ready to be drawn to the already overflowing barns; and huge piles of apples lay beneath the trees in the orchard. Mrs. Vaun saw Mary coming with a rapid step across the meadow, and went down to the gate to meet her.
               "What pleases you, Mary?" she asked, after they had exchanged greetings. "I haven't seen you look so bright this long time."
               "I have come to bring you an invitation to the wedding," was the reply.
               "The wedding! Whose wedding?"
               "John's."
               "John's!" exclaimed Mrs. Vaun again. "Mary, if you have been playing me a trick about this business, I'll never forgive you."
               "I haven't played any."
               Mrs. Vaun looked at her earnestly for a moment, and then asked,
               "Who is John going to marry?"
               "Amy Thompson, ma'am," she replied, laughing merrily, and dropping a low courtesy. "Oh, Mrs. Vaun! Mrs. Vaun! There are 'none so blind as those who won't see.'"
               Mrs. Vaun sank upon the door-step, and clasped her hands over her eyes.
               "Don't quote any musty old proverbs to me," she said presently, laughing as heartily as her guest; "and don't be saucy! Why haven't you told me of this before?"
               "Because, in the first place, Amy wanted that nothing should be said about it. And in the second, I wanted to see how long you would persist in believing that John was desperately in love with me, in spite of all my asseverations to the contrary. You have been 'not faithless, but believing,' for a whole year!"
               "Didn't I tell you not to be saucy? How long have they been engaged?"
               "All summer. Mrs. Vaun, I saw how this would end as long ago as last winter, when Amy and I were at your house; and so might you, if you hadn't been so determined to keep your eyes shut. I think John was more deeply attached to her than he was aware of, even when he was trying to persuade himself that he loved me."
               "I haven't another word to say," said Mrs. Vaun, laughing again. "When are they to be married?"
               "Next week, on Thursday. They are going to New York to see Amy's friends there, and round home by way of Boston."
               "You will go with them?"
               "No; I shall stay at home, and have every thing in order for the bride's return. They invited me to accompany them, but on the whole, I thought I had better not."
               "Amy is a sweet girl," said Mrs. Vaun, musingly.
               "She is a darling girl! I would rather have John marry her than any one I know. You don't know how glad I am, Mrs. Vaun!"
               Thanks to Amy's own ingenuity and industry, and Mary's skill with her needle, she had been able to dispense with the services of a seamstress and dressmaker. This circumstance will partially account for the fact that the rest of the good people of Farmingdale were as much surprised as Mrs. Vaun had been, when the forthcoming wedding was announced. Many happy hours had the two girls spent that summer in preparing the bridal outfit, and deciding upon the colors, materials, shapes, and trimming of the articles required.
               The wedding was over; and John and Amy had started on the journey that some one says is so often the first and the last of a woman's life. Mary remained with Mrs. Thompson for a while after the other guests had departed, and it was after sundown when she reached home.
               Mr. Graham sat in the porch waiting for her. As she came up the steps, he extended his hand and drew her to his side without speaking.
               "You look dull and tired to-night, uncle. Have you missed me?" she asked.
               "Missed you? I guess I have. It's been the lonesomest day!"
               "It oughtn't to have been lonesome to you," was the laughing reply. "I didn't wonder that it was rather a sad day for Mrs. Thompson, for she has in a measure lost a daughter, whereas you have gained one."
               The old gentleman made no response to this speech, but sat for a long time in thoughtful silence.
               "I guess Amy 'll make John a good wife," he said, at length.
               "An excellent one, uncle. He couldn't have found a better."
               "But, somehow, I ain't quite satisfied after all. I've had a kind of notion that maybe you and John would take a liking to each other, sometime or another."
               "We have a strong liking for each other now, uncle Graham, and have had this long time," said Mary, smiling.
               "Yes—but I hoped you'd take it into your heads to get married."
               "But if we had, you would have made nothing by it," she replied; "and as it is, you have. I am a sort of a daughter already, and now you have Amy besides—two instead of one."
               Mr. Graham shook his head.
               "I'm afraid my 'sort of a daughter' won't stay with me a great while; that's the trouble. Mary, Mr. Langdon came here to-day, and left a letter for you."
               "A letter!—for me? Oh! it's from Grace, probably, or Fanny."
               "No, 'tisn't. He seemed disappointed because you wa'n't to home, and said something about the trustees of the seminary nary. I couldn't exactly make out what. But here's the letter."
               "Don't sit out here any longer, uncle. It is getting damp. Come in, and I'll get your slippers for you. Did Ruby make you a good cup of tea?"
               "Yes, good enough. I wa'n't much hungry."
               "Oh! I forgot Tommy," said Mary, as she started to bring a lamp. "Did he have a chance to ride back to Carrolton?"
               "He went along with Mr. Langdon," was the answer.
               The lamp was brought, and the slippers and the dressing-gown, with the nicely-quilted lining, that Mary had made for her uncle.
               "Come, child, ain't you going to read your letter? I want to know what it's about."
               Mary seated herself by the table, and broke the seal. As she hastily glanced at its contents before reading it aloud, the color deepened on her cheek, and a faint exclamation of surprise and pleasure escaped her lips. She had expected to find a request from Mr. Langdon, and perhaps two or three other influential citizens, that she would reopen her school in Carrolton. But, instead of that, she discovered it to be a missive from the Trustees of the Seminary, formally notifying her that, at a recent meeting of the board, she had been unanimously elected principal of the institution. Accompanying this formal announcement, was a note from one or two of the trustees with whom she happened to be more particularly acquainted, warmly urging her acceptance of the appointment.
               Forgetting that Mr. Graham was impatiently awaiting his share of the news, she dropped the letter in her lap, and, shading her eyes with her hand, sat lost in thought for many minutes. This was the realization of the dreams of her childhood, but with an important variation from the established rule. The reality was more highly colored than the dream. When first, beneath the humble roof of the little brown house, she had looked upon her suffering mother with the hope that, when she grew older, she might be a teacher, and provide for her wants and those of Tommy, both her wishes and her expectations had stopped far short of this. The position offered her was of itself an honor. It had been filled for a series of years by women distinguished alike for talents and attainments; loved and honored alike in literary and domestic circles, and reverenced for their unceasing and successful efforts to elevate the standard of female education. And was she—Mary Lester—the little egg-barterer—the maid of all work—the spinner and weaver—was she deemed worthy to tread in their footsteps?
               But this was not the thought that brought the quick tears to her eyes, and a gush of sweet emotions to her heart. They had their source in a far deeper and holier fount—that of sisterly love.
               Tommy! All that she had ever dreamed of doing for him she could do now, independently of aid from others. In spite of reason and judgment and common sense, she had felt as if the ties between them had grown weaker since he had been less exclusively her own peculiar charge, and her heart had rebelled at their separation. Now she might be with him through his entire collegiate course—ever at hand to cheer and encourage him in the occasional lassitudes and despondencies of boy-life—to cherish and strengthen each aspiration after truth and goodness—to check each unworthy ambition, and to nurture with the tenderest care those home affections—those "tenderly-strung chords" whose "low and gentle music" is so often unheeded amid the strife of mind with mind, or drowned by the louder and more spirit-stirring tones of the awakening intellect.
               Mr. Graham laid his hand on her arm, and her thoughts came home again. She picked up the letter, and read it aloud.
               "There!" said her uncle, as she finished the last sentence. "It's just as I expected. I had a good mind not to give you that letter."
               "Why?" asked Mary, laughing. "You hadn't read it."
               "No; but I mistrusted what was in the wind. I knew there was some plan afoot to get you to teaching again. I wish they'd let you alone."
               "Why, uncle! I thought you would be pleased with such an offer as this!"
               "So I am—pleased that they think so much of you. But we want you here, and here's where you ought to be."
               Mary hesitated. Then affectionately stroking her uncle's hand as it rested on her knee, she said,
               "I don't think so, uncle. I don't think it would be right for me to refuse this appointment."
               "Why not? There's no need of your teaching."
               
               "I must do something, and I would rather teach than any thing else."
               "'Tain't so, Mary. There's no need of your doing any thing—that is, any thing towards getting a living. I'm able and willing to see to you and Tommy, and I calculate to do it."
               Mary hardly knew what to say. She was truly grateful for her uncle's kindness, and was unwilling to hurt his feelings by making a vain show of independence. Yet she felt that she could not concede to his wishes in this matter.
               "Not if it will make me happier to work, and see to myself, uncle Graham?" she said softly, after a pause.
               "Can't you be happy to live here with me and John and Amy?" was the response.
               "Not in idleness, dear uncle. I was born under a working planet. When you needed me for a housekeeper, I could stay here and be content. But that time is past now, or will be when Amy gets settled, and I feel as if I ought to go where I am needed. I can see Tommy every day, also, if I go to Carrolton, and that is a strong inducement."
               "I should think you'd want to rest. You've been to work all your life."
               "Not quite all, uncle. I've had a good many play-spells. I haven't earned the right to rest yet."
               "Humph! How long will it take you to earn it?"
               The question was accompanied by a look in which vexation struggled with tenderness.
               "Let me see; it will be just about—I can't tell exactly how many years, my dear uncle," she said, with a bright glance at his face; "because it depends partly on Tommy. When he has graduated, established himself in some kind of business, and has a home to offer me, I shall think I have earned the right to accept it."
               "Pshaw! You ought to have a home of your own before that time. Or ain't you ever going to be married?"
               "That depends on circumstances," said Mary, blushing slightly. "I haven't any idea of it at present. Don't think me foolish, uncle Graham," she continued, earnestly and with increased seriousness. "I have no wish to be particularly independent, or any thing of that kind; but while I have strength to labor, either with my head or hands, I shall feel better and happier to do it. I cannot be contented unless I feel that I am accomplishing something; and I should lose my own self-respect if I were to sit listlessly down, with my hands folded, and allow another to lift the burden I had lightly cast aside."
               "Well, well, child. I won't oppose you, if you've got your heart set on't. But I don't know what John and Amy 'll say."
               "John and Amy" said a good deal, but to very little purpose. There was one consolation, however. Her services would not be required under three months, and during that time they would have her all to themselves. Amy declared that she wouldn't spare her, even for a day.
               One more conversation between Mr. Vaun and his wife—a conversation that occurred about twelve months after John's marriage—and this simple story of every-day life is ended.
               "Mr. Graham made John a birthday present last week," said the former.
               "Indeed! Was it any thing valuable?"
               "Well, rather so. People estimate things differently, however."
               "What was it? Do tell me."
               "He gave him a deed of the farm and all its appurtenances, and of the mountain land also."
               "He did?"
               "Yes. Wasn't it a present worth having?"
               "Certainly. But I am surprised at it. I have heard Mr. Graham say, fifty times, that it was such folly for a man to place all his property in the hands of his children, and then be dependent upon their charity for a livelihood the remainder of his days. You know how it was with old Mr. Humphreys."
               "But Mr. Graham hasn't done so. He said he should 'practise as he had preached,' although he wasn't at all afraid to trust John. He has invested several thousand dollars safely, the interest from which will afford him ample support."
               "I don't see why it wouldn't have been just as well to have left every thing as it was," said Mrs. Vaun. "John was satisfied, wasn't he?"
               
               "Perfectly. Still, Mr. Graham knew that he had given up a lucrative business in compliance with his request, and in order to make his declining years happy. And he told me he felt as if he ought to do this. It was a mere form, to be sure, for it would all have been John's eventually. But that isn't all he has done."
               "What else, then?"
               "He has made provision for Mary also. He said that he was thinking, one day, that if he and John were gone, she would be almost alone in the world, and there was no telling what might happen. He wanted to do something for her while it was in his power. Accordingly he has settled such a sum upon her as will render her, under any circumstances, entirely independent, and able to carry out her plans with regard to her brother."
               "Now I am glad. What did she say to it?"
               "She does not know it. Her uncle said he did not mean to tell her at present. By the by, I saw Professor Harris this morning. He says Tommy acquitted himself nobly at the examination."
               "He is really in college, then? Dear Mary! she has been striving for this a long time."
               "Yes. Professor Harris remarked that he had seldom seen a happier face than hers was yesterday."
               "Or a lovelier, I'll warrant," said Mrs. Vaun. "She wouldn't listen to Mr. Ainsworth's addresses—did I tell you? I do wish she would marry; she is so eminently fitted to adorn a home."
               "I don't much care whether she marries or not," was the reply. "Mary will adorn her station, whatever it may be. She will make an admirable wife; or if not—"
               "What then?"
               "Why, then she will be the dearest old maid in the world, and do credit to the sisterhood."

            CHOICE NEW WORKS OF FICTION,
            PUBLISHED BY D. APPLETON & CO.
            
               ROMANCE OF ABELARD AND HELOISE.
               BY O. W. WIGHT,

               One Vol., 12mo. Cloth, 75 Cents.
               "Abelard and Heloise, the greatest man and the greatest woman of the Twelfth Century: with the one began the enfranchisement of thought, and with the other the enfranchisement of her sex. They were brought by fortune into romantic relations with each other, and their history as lovers, is of most extraordinary interest. The power of passion and the disinterestedness of true and devoted love in such heroic spirit, is portrayed in these masterly pages with fervid eloquence."—Southern Lit. Gaz.
               
               "This is a work at once creditable to the good taste of its publishers, and to the research, industry, and discriminating judgment of its author. Who is not already familiar with its touching, painful, yet fascinating story? Who need be reminded of the genius, the learning, and the fervor of its hero, or of the beauty, devotion and self-sacrificing love of the ill-starred Heloise? Their loves and their misfortunes have found a sympathizing and appreciating memorial in this volume, to which we can hardly give a higher tribute of our approval, than by saying that it is in all respects well worthy of the theme to which it is devoted. It has evidently been a work of much labor, as well as serious and careful study, and will be found to have more than the interest of the most fascinating fiction, while it teaches some of the sternest lessons of the severe realities of actual life."—Evening Post.
               
            
            
               THE FAWN OF THE PALE FACES;

               "The story told in this volume, is full of old revolutionary reminiscences. It is simple, yet attracts the attention of the reader wonderfully. The character of the Indian is faithfully drawn, and the intrigues and vice of the human heart well exposed. The narrative is charming throughout—the tale moral—the scene laid at Hartford, in the seventeenth century."—Courier.

               "There is a naturalness and depth of feeling about the works of this writer that makes them exceedingly interesting, and no person who has read one of them will need any urging to try another. She is not one of those writers that write many books, but seems to wait for the moment of inspiration, and then sits down, with pen in hand, and writes directly from the heart."—Albany Transcript.
               
               "Whoever has read that delightful novel, "The Initials," will not fail to purchase this tale, by the same pen. There is a freshness and simplicity in the style of the author. Human character and manners are depicted, by strokes as profound as they are apparently facile. It is a work of much thought, and of a high degree of literary merit. It will take its place among the standard works of the age."—Southern Literary Messenger.

                  "A beautiful and affecting story, told in a sweet pure style, and swaying the heart by its natural and life-like scenes. It is a story of wilfulness, trial, misery, and of being made 'perfect through suffering' on the part of the heroine Gertrude, the 'Lady-Bird' of the story. Elevated sentiments and pure thoughts are the characteristics of the story."—Albany Knickerbocker.
                  
                  "The authoress of these volumes, if she has not the significant name of Currer Bell, deserves as highly the value of her sex, for her gift in portraying the finest natures, and giving to her readers not only much to charm and interest, but suggestions for earnest thought, which may ripen into the beautiful characters she so skilfully depicts. The present volumes will add to her celebrity."—Journal of Commerce.
                  
                  "This book deserves more than an ordinary notice. We do not often read novels; but when we opened this we found it difficult to lay it down. The characteristics are well drawn, and unexaggerated, so that they seem like people one meets every day, and the interest is sustained to the last, with a great deal of power."—Boston Pilot.

                  "This tale is by the author of 'Grantley Manor,' which alone will secure for it a wide circle of readers. But it has an intrinsic excellence also. The narrative is well sustained throughout. There is no stiffness or flagging in the dialogues, and the sentiments are pure."—Courier and Enquirer.
                  
                  "Ellen Middleton is a work of much interest and ability. The style is admirable, and her practical observations show a clearness and depth of thought rarely found among the younger members of the fair sex."—Boston Atlas.

                  "Grantley Manor is the title of an exceedingly interesting volume, which we have read with more than ordinary pleasure. The style is elegant, the story, which involves a succession of mysteries and cross purposes, is well developed, and the scene and character painting is full of spirit and truth. The authoress is certainly a woman of genius, which she has used to excellent purpose."—Southern Literary Messenger.
                  
                  "Lady Georgiana Fullerton's first appearance as a novelist rendered her famous at once.

                  The clear conception, the forcible delineation, the style, at once elegant and powerful, of Miss Kavanagh's former works, are exhibited in this, as well as deep thought an sound moral reflection. Every thing presented to the reader, whether thought or image is elaborated with the finish of a Flemish painting without its grossness; the person are nicely conceived and consistently sustained, and the principal narrative is relieved by very truthful pictures of every day life and character."—London Spectator.

                  "A work of extraordinary merit, with a far deeper design than merely to amuse, it attempts to solve some of the subtle problems of human nature. Some of the wisest lessons in life are taught in the work, while the artistic skill with which the narrative is managed imparts a vivid interest. The author might be, with a stronger infusion of the poetic element, another Joanna Baillie; and no one will read the work without a high estimate of her dramatic powers and her deep insight."—Evangelist.

                  "The design and spirit of this volume are alike admirable. Miss Kavanagh divide her work into four periods; the first relates the deeds of holy women under the Roman empire; the second tells us of the fruits of faith in the middle ages; the third is devoted to the women of the seventeenth century; and the fourth to those of the eighteenth and present centuries. We have read many of these records of other days, as told by Miss Kavanagh, and we are sure that the influence upon every Christian-minded person cannot but be for good, if he will meditate upon what our holy religion is every day doing. The volume is well worthy a place in every Christian family."—Ban. of the Cross.

                  "I have often thought it a great pity that the sallies of humor, the entertaining or amusing incidents, and the touches of tender pathos, that are so frequently to be met with in the 'Gossip' of the Knickerbocker, should be comparatively lost among the multitudinous leaves of a magazine."—WASHINGTON IRVING.
                  "This will prove one of the pleasantest books of the season, with alternations of healthful mirth and wholesome sadness. The Editor's Table of the Knickerbocker has things quite too good to be forgotten, and it is well thought of to gather them and garner them up in a volume."—N. Y. Evening Post.

                  "A repast of which thousands have partaken with zest, and found intellectual refreshment, invigorating and delightful, therefrom. Mr. Clark's humor is quiet, soothing, irresistible: it diffuses itself through your whole system, and, when you join him in his benignant smile, a glow passes all over you. So with his pathos, it is not mawkish, nor exaggerated, but 'the real tear:' and leaves the reader—if our temperance friends will not pervert our meaning—with a 'drop in his eye' also."—Boston Post.
                  
                  "A very epicurean feast of the richest and daintiest, culled with the most sedulous care and nicest discrimination.

Ah, benedicite!'"—N. Y. Daily Tribune.

                  "That will be a book for the million—for all capable of feeling and enjoying—who can neither resist laughter nor forbid tears that will out, and must have vent, when the secret strings of the heart are touched. 'Old Knick' has many friends and admirers who will thank him for this excellent idea. His 'Knick-Knacks' will go off like hot cakes.

               THE LOFTY AND THE LOWLY;
               OR GOOD IN ALL, AND NONE ALL-GOOD
               By Maria I. McIntosh,
               Author of "Two Lives," "Charms and Counter-Charms," "Evenings at Donaldson Manor," etc., etc.
               2 vols. 12mo. Paper covers, $1; cloth, $1 50.
               
                  Life, in its varied relations at the North and the South, is the theme of this work. In its graphic delineations of character, truthfulness of representation, and stirring realities of life, it will hardly give place to "Uncle Tom's Cabin." The authoress is well known to the public by her many charming works of fiction, and her life has been passed at the North and South. The nobleness of her sentiments, her elevated and candid views, her genuine feelings of humanity, and the elegance and eloquence of her pen, are brought out in these pages with their full brilliancy and effect.
               
                  A FEW CRITICISMS OF THE PRESS.
                  "As to its literary merits, we can honestly commend it as a charming story, and for its moral influence, we think the admirers of Uncle Tom's Cabin will not find their dislike of slavery greatly lessened by its perusal, while they may be persuaded to cherish a kindlier feeling toward those whose lot is cast amid the institutions of the South." Cincinnati Magazine.
                  
                  "It is a book of great interest, written in a candid, truthful spirit—the arrangement of the plot and incidents is skilful, and the work abounds in passages of great pathos and of thrilling interest."—Boston Journal.
                  
                  "A good book, commendable in spirit and creditable in execution—it will make its way in public favor, and win for its accomplished author the commendation of all dis passionate readers."—Daily Times.
                  
                  "Written in a most admirable tone, and with manifest sincerity."—Troy Whig.

                  "A novel of really high merit. The characters are most skilfully drawn out in the course of the story. The death of Guy is one of the most touching things we ever read. The work is one of absorbing interest, and what is still better, the moral taught in its pages is eminently healthy and elevating. We commend the book most cordially."—Com. Adv.
                  
                  "The whole tone and feeling of this book is good and true. The reader does not require to be told that the author is religious; the right principles, the high sense of duty and honor, softened by the influence of a reverent faith, can be explained on no other hypothesis. It is eminently a book to send the reader away from the perusal better and wiser for the lessons hidden under its deeply interesting narrative."—London Guardian.
                  
                  "A well written, spirited and interesting work. It is full of character, sparkling with conversation, and picturesque with paintings of nature. The plot is well conceived and handsomely wrought out. There is a freshness of feeling and tone of healthy sentiment about such novels, that recommend them to public favor."—Albany Spectator.

                  "The 'Dean's Daughter' will doubtless be one of the most successful books of the season. It abounds in all those beauties which have hitherto distinguished Mrs. Gore's novels. The management of the incidents of the story is as clever, the style is as brilliant, the satire as keen, and the conversation as flowing, as in the best of her works."—Daily News.

                  "Mrs. Gore is perhaps the wittiest of modern novelists. Of all the ladies who in later times have taken in hand the weapon of satire, her blade is certainly the most trenchant. A vapid lord or a purse-proud citizen, a money-hunting woman of fashion or a toad-eater, a humbug in short, male or female, and of whatsoever cast or quality he may be, will find his pretensions well castigated in some one or other of her brilliant pages; while scattered about in many places are passages and scenes of infinite tenderness, showing that our authoress is not insensible to the gentler qualities of our nature and is mistress of pathos in no common degree."—Examiner.

                  "We prefer Harry Muir to most of the Scottish Novels that have appeared since Galt's Domestic Stories were published.

                  "This is one of that class of novels to which the reader turns with delight after reading some of the trash that is put forth by the press. It abounds in soul-elevating thoughts, and no person can read it without being made wiser and better thereby. It is full of simple and naïve wisdom, shrewd delineation of character in great variety, and has a Scotch canny-ness and piquancy that rivet the attention even amidst simple incidents. We like it much, and cordially commend it to our readers."—Norwich Evening Courier.

                  "Life, in its varied relations at the North and at the South, is the theme of this work. In its graphic delineations of character, truthfulness of representation, and stirring realities of life, it will hardly give place to "Uncle Tom's Cabin." The authoress is well known to the public by her many charming works of fiction, and her life has been passed at the North and South. The nobleness of her sentiments, her elevated and candid views, her genuine feelings of humanity, and the elegance and eloquence of her pen are brought out in these pages with their full brilliancy and effect."

                  "We like this work exceedingly, and our fair countrywomen will admire it still more than we do. It is written in the true spirit, and evinces extensive observation of society, a clear insight into the evils surrounding and pressing down her sex, and a glorious determination to expose and remove them. Read her work. She will win a willing way to the heart and home of woman, and her mission will be found to be one of beneficence and love. Truly, woman has her work and her reward."—American Spectator.

                  "The previous works of Miss McIntosh, although issued anonymously, have been popular in the best sense of the word. The simple beauty of her narratives, combining pure sentiment with high principle, and noble views of life and its duties, ought to win for them a hearing at every fireside in our land.

                  BASIL;
                  A STORY OF MODERN LIFE.
                  By W. WILKIE COLLINS,
                  Author of "ANTONINA," etc., etc. One vol. 12mo. Paper cover, 50c.; Cloth, 75c.
                  "Basil" is eminently an original work, in plan and execution, and not a mere copy of the modern novel. It is strongly marked by the genius of the author—a genius which is greatly indebted to ripe scholarship and to most laborious painstaking, in whatever it attempts to accomplish: and is therefore, if for nothing else, worthy of recognition. Should this work fail of popularity, it will not be for its unworthiness, but for its unusual excellence, as a work of art. There is nothing meretricious about it."—Albany Evening Journal.
                  
                  "No one who reads this work but will pay his tribute to its excellence. He has given us in prose fiction the poetry of every-day truth, and made a brilliant romance which even in this age of book-making, will live. No reader will ever confound the eloquent writer with "the mob of gentlemen who write at ease."—National Intelligencer.
                  
                  "The interest and beauty of fiction are strikingly blended with the realities of modern life, in this new work of Mr. Collins: and whether we regard the happy manner in which the author has sustained throughout the plot of his tale, or the elegant style in which the publishers, Messrs. Appleton & Co., have presented the volume to the American reader, we equally recommend it."—Boston Times.
