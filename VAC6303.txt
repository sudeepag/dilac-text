               AS SLAVES.
            THESE SKETCHES OF THE LAND OF THEIR BIRTH AND LOVE, ILLUSTRATIVE OF ITS WRONGS AND
               GLORIES, ARE DEDICATED, WITH THE EARNEST PRAYER THAT ERE THIS GENERATION PASS AWAY,
               IT MAY, UNDER THE FOLDS OF ITS OWN "SUNBURST," TAKE ITS PLACE, REGENERATED AND FREE,
               AMONG THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH.
            
               THE AUTHOR.
            
         
         
            
            PREFACE.
            IN the story of "Mona" we have adhered strictly to historic accounts in all that we
               have written descriptive of the religious, intellectual, political, and social status
               of the ancient Irish. We refer our readers to the Abbé McGeoghegan's "History of
               Ireland from its Fabulous and Mythological Times, down to the Year 1798," for the
               correctness of our descriptions.*
               
            
               
               *Also Mooney's and Carey's Histories of Ireland.
            
            Our story opens at that interesting epoch in Irish history when Patricius,†
                commissioned by Pope Celestine as Ambassador to the Court of Tara, and
               invested with the order of the Patricii, which was
               next in honor to the Imperial dignity, landed on the banks of the Boyne, and
               confronted the Druids and their false creed in the presence of the Estates of Tara;
               preaching with such courage and unction of "Christ and Him crucified," in the halls
               of Temora, and on the plains of Magh-Breagh, in the very presence of the idolatries
               of Baal, that many accepted the Christian faith, and the seed was planted which led
               to a rapid extinction of a dark and cruel mythology.
                  
                  †So named from the Roman order of the Patricii.
               
            Ancient customs, religious and civil, are illustrated in the dramatis personæ of the
               story: Mona herself being a Vestal of Nerf Naom—the Moon.
            At this period Ireland, under the Druidical system,—much of it borrowed from Egypt,
               from Etruria, and Persia,—was the seat of learning, literature, science, and the
               arts, and was considered the great school of Western Europe, to which kings and
               nobles sent their sons to be instructed, by the Druids and Bards, in the rules of
               learning, jurisprudence, science, and war.
            England had been conquered by the Romans, and her people were in fact the
               slaves of Rome; and while Ireland was basking in the zenith of national prosperity
               and civilization, they were living in all the ruggedness of untutored nature,
               dressing in skins, painting their half-naked bodies, living in caves or mud huts, and
               dependent for subsistence upon the primitive arts of hunting and fishing, and, like
               other uncivilized peoples, engaged in frequent warfare with each other.
            There are many who are ignorant of the fact that Ireland has a history except as a
               dependency of England: to such we commend the Abbé McGeoghegan's valuable work, that
               they may learn from it all that Ireland was,—that the sneer may die from their lips
               when they learn all that she has lost through the treachery of a base king and the
               cruel and oppressive legislation of a haughty and intolerant government, and wonder,
               as they read, that freedom has survived, with all its divine instincts, in the hearts
               of her brave and unconquered sons.
            The writer hopes, more from her subject than from any excellence of style, that some
               popular interest may be awakened by the story of "Mona."
            "Nora Brady's Vow" will commend itself, we hope, to the reader by the truthfulness of
               its delineations, and as illustrative of incidents of the same character, which are
               not of unfrequent occurrence among us. The devotion and generosity of the Irishwomen
               who live in our midst, to friends and kindred at home,*
                have not only excited wonder and admiration on this side of the Atlantic, but
               were considered of sufficient importance to be made the subject of some statistical
               remarks in the British Parliament a year or so ago.
                  
                  *Ireland, which they always speak of as "home."
               
            Nora Brady is not a fictitious character, although the name is an assumed one; and as
               we have thrown her virtuous and generous acts together for the sake of vindicating
               and doing honor to her countrywomen in the United States, we are sure that she will
               forgive us for "putting her into a book."

                                 fears,—
                              One firm resolve of mighty men is worth a sea of tears."

                  A SUNSET of unusual beauty, and a few bright tints still lingering on the edges
                     of many a drifting cloud, diffused a peculiar and transparent clearness in the
                     atmosphere, and threw out, on the smooth waters of the Suire, successive images
                     of picturesque scenery. Rocks, trees, and overhanging banks, touched here with
                     light and softened there with shadow, with traceries of tangled shrubbery
                     running through it all, were pictured forth with rare and beautiful fidelity;
                     but beyond these fell a sterner gloom, and more solemn shadows, which seemed to
                     chill the very waves in whose calm depths they slumbered like wild and
                     sorrowful dreams in some living human heart. There was a ruin on that shore, a
                     ruin of old, whose gray walls, majestic tower, and mildewed arches had for
                     centuries past stood like a hoary prophet beside those waves, to remind the
                     living of their faded glories, and incite them to a future which should repair
                     the sorrows and losses of the past. And now, as the soft twilight slowly
                        gathered around the old Abbey of
                     Holy-Cross-by-the-Suire, it only required a vivid imagination to people that
                     quiet solitude with its by-gone inmates. The swift flitting of bats through its
                     pillared arcades, the sad cry of the bittern brooding in the rank grass below,
                     and the faint rustling of the ivy clinging to the ruined walls, when blended
                     with the long-ago memories and legends haunting the spot, made a language
                     expressive enough for any lover of the ideal to work his spells with, and drape
                     cloisters and shrines with their ancient splendors, and crowd those broad
                     aisles once more with saint-like processions or prostrate forms. Erected by the
                     piety and munificence of Donald O'Brien, King of Limerick, in the year 1169,
                     the magnificence of its architecture made it a fane worthy of the sacred shrine
                     which inclosed a relic of the TRUE CROSS incased in a reliquary of gold and
                     jewels of inestimable value, and presented by Pope Paschal II. to McMorrogh the
                     predecessor of Donald. Its magnificent altars, dedicated to the Holy Cross, to
                     St. Mary, and St. Benedict, were famed throughout the land, not only for the
                     splendor which surrounded them, but for the multitude and devotion of the
                     worshipers and pilgrims who continually thronged thither; while the austerity
                     and holiness of the monks who, holding the Cistercian rule, filled its
                     cloisters, rendered it one of the most celebrated and sacred monastic
                     establishments in Ireland. But, like incense exhaled from precious flowers,
                     those souls which through succeeding centuries glorified God in their works of
                     holiness and purity, were now fled; the feet of the spoiler had trampled over
                     the place, and unholy hands had desecrated and ruined the shrines; the earth,
                     rich in the dust of bodies which had consecrated themselves to God, was torn up
                     and scattered, in search of perishable treasures; the magnificence of
                     architecture, the costliness and charm of rare sculptured marbles, the rich and
                     gorgeous stained glass of the windows, were all defaced—broken—ruined. And
                     there it stands at this late day, to tell its own tale of woe, appealing to the
                     Lord of Hosts for justice and vengeance on an iniquitous and oppressive system
                     which for centuries has tortured His Spouse the Church with fetters and
                     disfigured her robes with the rust and tears of oppression.
                  The moon now risen poured down a flood of light into the broad nave, slanting
                     her silver beams on the long rows of pillars, leaving the aisles in darkness
                     and shadow. The altar of the HOLY CROSS stood out conspicuous and beautiful in
                     the unclouded radiance. One might almost have imagined that the careful old
                     monks had thrown a cloth of gold over it, to protect from dampness and dust its
                     treasures; but no, it was only the cold, bright moonlight, the faithful witness
                     and tender consoler of its silent woes, which still sought to brighten its deep
                     desolation and throw a beauty around its decay. At a little distance were the
                     broken altars of the Virgin Mother and St. Benedict, near which stood the royal
                     tomb of the O'Brien, with its canopy of marble supported by twisted pillars.
                     Here and there the moonbeams lit them up, gleaming on a rare tracery, or
                     silvering over some sculptured arch, touching here a broken shaft, there the
                     defaced image of saint or cherub, or rippling down over the moss-grown graves
                     like the footprints of the angels who watch the dust of those who sleep in the
                     Lord.
                  Suddenly the silence was broken by a slow footstep, and a man, old and gray,
                     entered the ruin. Arrested by the exquisite and mournful beauty of the scene,
                     he stood a moment, leaning on his staff, to survey it; then, reverently
                     uncovering his head, he knelt, and, folding his hands over his bosom in the
                     form of a cross, appeared to pray de
                     voutly. We cannot say for what or whom he prayed It may have been for the
                     repose of those who slept in peace around him; it may have been for some living
                     tempted soul; or it may have been for his country, for troublous times again
                     threatened it, and well he knew, that aged priest, that one, nor two, nor
                     thousands of victims could close or fill the awful gulf which unsuccessful
                     outbreaks always opened.
                  Ere long the clatter of horses' hoofs was heard on the bridge which spanned the
                     Suire, and soon issuing from the shadow and galloping along the shore, the
                     horseman urged his steed up toward the ruins, where suddenly halting, he lifted
                     his cap from his head, and, wiping the moisture from his brow, he threw back
                     the thick clustering locks that fell over it.
                  "Old Holy Cross!" he murmured, "your gray ruins have not been vain teachers,
                     and once more must I visit that tomb and shrine which first awoke my fairest
                     dreams for the regeneration and freedom of this dear land.—It may be the last
                     time I shall ever look on ye, old relics of the days that are gone; but if I
                     fall in this struggle, let me hope, O Heaven! that the blood which shall be
                     poured out like water, in defense of man's holiest rights, may nurture into
                     full strength and maturity the roots of that glorious tree whose leaves shall
                     sweeten the bitter waters of the woes of my country." There was a tone of deep
                     feeling in his voice, and an earnest enthusiasm in every gesture, as he turned
                     in under the arches of the old abbey, which indicated in his nature the
                     elements of heroic courage, and a spirit which would glory in martyrdom.
                  When he saw the kneeling figure of the priest, he started, then drew back in
                     the shadow of a pillar, where he stood like some gray statue, gazing
                     thoughtfully on the scene. But presently the aged man finished his prayer; he
                     made the sign of the cross on his breast, and, bowing his head reverently for
                     an instant, in honor of the Majesty who once dwelt there, he turned to leave
                     the abbey, when the other stepped forward, and, laying his hand with
                     affectionate freedom on his shoulder, said,—
                  "Father McCarthy, I did not expect to find you here!"
                  "John Halloran!" said the priest, starting. "I am glad to meet you. I have had
                     you in mind this live-long day and have just come down from Glendariff, where I
                     went to seek you. Ease my heart at once by saying that you have abandoned the
                     wild and ruinous scheme—the hopeless plan that we have spoken of before."
                  "Father, I am sorry we have met, if the old dispute is to begin,—the old and
                     useless dispute. Shame on the clergy of Ireland, who oppose this daring effort
                     for the freedom of their flocks and their altars, and lend their influence and
                     hand to the oppressor!" exclaimed the young man, angrily.
                  "Thou, God, knowest how baseless is the charge," said the priest, baring his
                     gray locks, and lifting his hands and eyes toward heaven, as if appealing
                     against such unmerited injustice. "THOU knowest how we have stood for long,
                     sorrowful years between the porch and the altar, bowed down with the woes of
                     the land, and leading the people through the wilderness toward the place of
                     promise. But the people sin by disobedience and revolt; they wait not for the
                     harvest, but pluck the unripe fruits and suffer; they wait not God's time and
                     God's holy will, and long bitter years are added to their exile. John Halloran,
                     I am old—more than seventy years have rolled over my head. I have in that time
                     seen much of men, and I have watched, like an eagle from his eyrie, for the
                     day-dawn; but I tell you I see it not yet. These revolts— these volcanic eruptions of a few burning
                     hearts, which at best only leave their ashes to their country—these uncertain,
                     irresponsive insurrections, which never assume the dignity of
                     revolutions, only rivet the chains more firmly, and put off the day of
                     deliverance into the dim and distant future."
                  "Now, father, what is the use—what is the use of all this? Age and misfortune
                     have cooled your blood and patriotism together, and, near the grave, you have
                     but small care for a future which will roll over your ashes. Oh, my father!"
                     exclaimed John Halloran, with deep pathos, "does not the scene around soften
                     your heart?
                  "Of these ruins I will not speak; but of yonder wretched cabins, thrown
                     together from their fragments, and which scarcely afford a miserable shelter
                     for the human beings who occupy them, of the want and desolation which surround
                     them, I must and will speak. Their wretched inmates, possessed of the dignity
                     of immortal souls, are reduced by the system which oppresses them to a level
                     with the beasts. Where is their activity—where their energy? Crushed out of
                     their lives by a knowledge of the utter inadequacy of their labor, and the
                     hopelessness of their condition.
                  "They have lost almost the noble image of man. Their gaunt, athletic frames are
                     meager and fleshless—their color livid—their features sharpened—while their
                     countenances express the habitual influence of strong, deep passions. Where is
                     the quick intelligence, which only flashes out now and then mingled with the
                     lurking slyness of distrust? Where are the thrift, the industry, the plenty,
                     which should be theirs? Ask the tithe-gatherers, the tax-collectors, the
                     drivers, who, like locusts, devour their substance. The very children are
                     want-stricken and badly clad, while the loveliness of their age is disfigured
                     by squalid poverty and the drapery of extreme want; they are idle and joyless,
                     and loiter about the cabin-door without an aim, while the father, perchance,
                     has gone to seek employment in the English harvest-fields where his hire is
                     paid with a smile of derision, and he is expected to excite laughter by his
                     blunders, who might well command tears by his wretchedness*
                      And these are your children—these are the miserable ones to whom you
                     would have us deny succor! Is it only in this poor hamlet that such things are
                     seen blotting the face of nature? No, oh my God! over all the land the same
                     dismal spectacle is seen: from every cabin is heard the wail of anguish, and
                     wherever thrift and plenty smile, it is for those foreign leeches who add to
                     our burdens and have no right to a foothold on our soil. And can we rest? Must
                     we rest? Shall we desist? No, rather let us perish!" exclaimed the almost
                     frantic man.
                        
                        *Lady Morgan.
                     
                  "John Halloran," said the aged priest, whose bowed form trembled with an
                     emotion he could scarcely control, "think you that these things move you and
                     leave me unscathed? I declare solemnly before Heaven that, had I a thousand
                     lives, I would lay each life down to be trampled out by separate and distinct
                     tortures, if by the sacrifice this dear land of my birth could be delivered.
                     But I am a powerless old man, who can only pray and plead; and it wrings my
                     very soul to see energies thrown away—worse than wasted—which, at the
                        right time, might work wondrous changes; to know how men whom I
                     honor for their worth and unselfishness will fall in the unequal strife without
                     even the honor of a soldier's grave; and how others, the noble descendants of
                     the McCarthy More, the O'Brien, the O'Donoghue, and the O'Neill, will be hunted like felons to suffer a
                     felon's doom. I know ye all, John Halloran. Some are my own kinsmen, some of my
                     flock, and yet, woe's me, I can neither stay their madness nor arrest their
                     folly——"
                  "Father!" said the young man, suddenly interrupting him, while a bright smile
                     burst over his countenance, "ere ten days are over, you will sing Te Deum in your mountain chapel for the deliverance
                     of Ireland. The moment the first blow is struck, the whole country will fly to
                     arms, and our oppressors, unprepared for the overpowering crisis, will be
                     scattered like chaff on the whirlwind. Brian Boroihme and Malachi the brave
                     will be our rallying-words, and, after a few decisive struggles, our land will
                     be all our own. We shall have once more our own laws, our own parliament, our
                     own rulers. The old names will be honored in the land. The Church will lift her
                     head free and rejoicing; and the great possessions, wrested from the old
                     princely sons of the soil by the virgin Queen Elizabeth, by the Jameses, and by
                     that devil's own psalm-singer, Cromwell, will be restored to their
                     descendants——"
                  "Halloran," interrupted Father McCarthy, "your dream is the one which has
                     haunted me for years; but, alas! it is only the gleam of a meteor, the splendor
                     of a rainbow, which fades while we gaze on it. Would to God your sanguine hopes
                     were based on surer foundations! but, alas! boy, the means of the foes against
                     which you contend are almost omniscient. While you plot, they counter-plot;
                     while you scheme, they undermine; and already, by the aid of base informers,
                     the chief leaders of this rebellion*
                      are marked, and predestined to ignominy and death. It will only be the
                     re-enactment of the tragedy of '98. But I will say no more, except this; and
                     listen well, John Halloran, for I am going to knock roughly against the doors
                     of your heart; and if this consideration which I offer fails, then God help
                     you; I will say no more. Up yonder, at Glendariff, is a meek and loving woman,
                     whose cheeks have become worn and thin with watching, and with the anxieties to
                     which the continual perils of her husband give birth. She sits now beside two
                     weeping children, who divide her love and hopes with their absent father. A few
                     months ago, Glendariff was the abode of happiness and peace; now it is the
                     retreat of fear and sorrow. Who is this mother? who this wife? She belongs to
                     one of the old princely septs of the land. She was the sunshine and flower of
                     her old feudal home, and her hand was destined for a rich and powerful
                     nobleman, her equal in birth. A splendid future was before Mary O'More. But she
                     spurned it all,—rank, riches, and splendor,—to wed with one whose worth alone
                     was his nobility, and whose riches consisted of the old farm-house and the few
                     acres where his forefathers had toiled generations before him. John Halloran,
                        you know whom I mean! Have you a right to drag down that
                     high-born, gentle woman into poverty, and, at the best, exile,—to impoverish
                     the children she has borne you, and fix the name of felon's brood on them?"
                        
                        *Rebellion of '48.
                     
                  "Even that I do dare," said John Halloran, in a calm, stern voice;
                     "that—all—everything for the sacred cause of my country. I am one of the
                     people. I glory in having sprung from them, and I, John Halloran, will deliver
                     them, or die. Life—soul—wife—children—and home!" he exclaimed, striking the
                     ruined altar by which he stood with his clinched fist. "Let me only strike a
                     blow for Ireland, let me be remembered among her deliverers, and I would not
                     barter the title it will give me for an imperial diadem, or the most ancient birthright that the archives of time
                     could bestow. My poor Mary! My sweet, saint-like wife! That was a tender chord
                     for you to crash down so rudely on, my father. May the Blessed Mother of God
                     succor and defend her and her babes," he said, in a low, trembling voice. "But
                     I must hasten home. You mean well, my father, but you are behind the times. One
                     grasp of the hand, and your blessing, ere I go." And he threw himself with a
                     simple abandon at the feet of Father
                     McCarthy, adown whose furrowed cheeks warm tears were fast falling.
                  "My child," he said, in a broken voice, while he laid his hand on the head of
                     the kneeling man, "perchance we shall never meet again on earth. Our meeting
                     tonight is not one of chance. You are engaged in a perilous enterprise, and, to
                     my certain knowledge, will pass a terrible crisis in a few days. Let not, then,
                     this hour go by unimproved, but, at the sacred tribunal of penance, make peace
                     between your soul and God. Here, beneath the solemn heavens, above the dust of
                     the holy dead, give me power, by performing sacramental penance with an humble
                     and contrite heart, to absolve you from the guilt of sin, if perchance your
                     conscience is burdened and sore."
                  The appeal was not in vain. It was enough. Like a child, simple yet strong in
                     his faith, the noble but mistaken man, kneeling by the side of the venerable
                     priest of God, who sat on a broken tomb, poured out in whispered words the
                     sincere and earnest confession of his soul. Thus alone in that old ruin,
                     watched over and guarded by unseen angels, we leave them, and wend our way to
                     Glendariff, the home of John Halloran.
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  
                     
                        
                           Oh, the moment was sad when my love and I parted:
                           Savourneen Deelish, Eileen Ogge;
                           As I kissed off her tears, I was nigh broken-hearted:
                           Savourneen Deelish, Eileen Ogge:
                           Wan was her cheek. which hung on my shoulder;
                           Damp was her hand: no marble was colder;
                           I felt in my heart I should ne'er more behold her:
                           Savourneen Deelish, Eileen Ogge.
                        
                     
                  
                  MARY HALLORAN, whose mind had been unusually disturbed that day by vague
                     apprehensions, grew more and more uneasy as the hours wore on, and wandered out
                     to station herself on the side of what, at Glendariff, was called the "Sunset
                     Hill," to watch for the return of her husband. But the brightness faded from
                     the sky, twilight deepened into gloom, and soon the chilly night and the pale
                     moonlight, which threw grotesque, weird-looking shadows around her, warned her
                     in. "I cannot rest," she murmured, with a deep sigh: "this veiled sorrow
                     pursues me everywhere. Oh, why does not John come? While he is near me, the
                     dread and terror stand aloof; when he is absent, they haunt and scourge me."
                     She lingered a few moments at the door, listening intently for the well-known
                     sound of his horse's hoofs on the gravel. But all was silent; and, turning away
                     with a shudder, she entered the house, and, with slow, heavy steps, went up
                     into the children's room to seek some solace in their smiles and caresses. But
                     the little ones were asleep in their cribs, and, leaning over, her tears fell heavy and fast on the golden
                     curls and fair cheeks of Gracie; but when she gazed down on the fine manly face
                     of her boy Desmond, over whose crimson cheeks dark locks of curling hair had
                     strayed, and saw the haughty brow and firm, well-set lips, her tears ceased,
                     and, folding her hands together, she whispered, "God help thee, boy! thy
                     battles will be strong and bitter with life; they may break, but never bend
                     thee." Then she felt, as she watched the holy calm that overspread their
                     features, and knew how dark and stormy was all before them, a wish, half
                     defined,—almost a prayer,—that each little soul, ere day-dawn, could be housed
                     in heaven. She kissed them softly, and, bidding Ellen shade the light from
                     their eyes, went down into the drawing-room, that she might hear the first
                     sound of her husband's footfall when he entered. There was a large oriel window
                     opening down to the lawn,—the only modern addition John Halloran had made to
                     his house when he came of age,—from whence she had always been accustomed,
                     since their marriage, to watch his approach up the road leading to Glendariff.
                     She drew back the heavy curtains, and looked out long and anxiously; but all
                     was lonely and silent, the very shrubs, on which the moon-beams had woven a
                     tissue of silver, being motionless. The heavy drapery fell from the grasp of
                     her slender fingers, and, with an aching heart, she went away, and threw
                     herself with an exhausted air into a low cushioned chair near the fire.
                  A door opened noiselessly, and a light footstep entered. Mrs. Halloran turned
                     her head quickly, hoping it might be her husband.
                  "Oh, is it you, Nora?" she said.
                  "Yes, ma'am; I came in to see if you would have lights."
                  "Oh, Nora, I am so uneasy about Mr. Halloran. No—no—no; do not bring in the
                     lights yet," she said, in an agitated tone.
                  "It's a cup of tea would set you up, ma'am; let me fetch in the tray."
                  "No, dear; not until Mr. Halloran comes," she replied.
                  Nora stood a moment looking at the fragile form and pale countenance of Mrs.
                     Halloran, which seemed whiter and more sunken in the fitful fire-light,
                     surrounded as it was by the dark-crimson cushions against which she leaned, and
                     an expression of bitter sorrow flitted over the girl's handsome face, while a
                     tear stole silently down from the black fringes of her eyes, and fell unheeded.
                     Then she closed the door very softly, and went back to the kitchen, muttering,
                     "It's no use to deny it, but it's an evil heart would put the mildew and tear
                     on such a delicate flower as that, sure. So much for puttin' new wine in ould
                     bottles. Let everybody mate with their equals, high as well as low." Then she
                     gathered up her work and took her seat beside the cheerful fire, with an
                     attempt to look cheerful and unconcerned, and a few efforts to sing blithely,
                     which were sadder than the bitterest tears would have been. The door of the
                     spacious, cheerful kitchen, where Nora reigned supreme, was thrown open, and a
                     broad stream of light flowed out on the sward and shrubbery, setting them all
                     aglow, as if a red sunset were gleaming over Glendariff. The brick floor was
                     sanded in fantastic patterns, and the dressers literally glittered with the
                     well-scoured pewter and copper utensils that covered them. Here and there hung
                     a colored print, neatly framed in carved bog-wood, of the "Annunciation," "St.
                     Agnes," and "St. John the Evangelist," over which were arranged tastefully
                     sprigs of holly and fern. On a little shelf, apart, reposed a handsome
                        prayer-book, and a rosary of coral
                     and silver, her last year's Christmas-gift from Mrs. Halloran, and of which she
                     was specially proud.
                  Nora was a fine specimen of her class. Above the middle height, handsome and
                     well formed, everything about her expressed an innate pride of character and a
                     high degree of self-respect. She had been the plaything and playmate of Mrs.
                     Halloran when they were both children at Fada-Brae Abbey; and, as Mary O'More
                     would never study unless Nora Brady had lessons also, Mrs. O'More, to secure
                     her daughter's attention, and also to benefit the girl, of whom she was fond,
                     directed the governess to indulge her daughter's affectionate whim, until she
                     was sent to France to finish her education. Thus commenced the affection
                     between the nobly-born Mary O'More and Nora Brady. Widely separated by rank,
                     yet loving and grateful, they continued to serve each other in their respective
                     spheres until a mutual dependence was established, which developed many a noble
                     and beautiful trait in each.
                  Nora's service was light enough, and one which she preferred to any other
                     situation at Glendariff, as in it she enjoyed all the benefits of an active
                     life and could contribute very essentially to the comfort of those she served.
                     Nora's kitchen was her parlor, reception, and sitting-room, and its neatness
                     was a marvel to all who were privileged to enter it; for let it not be supposed
                     that the drudgery and cooking for the people employed at Glendariff were
                     performed here. There was another building, apart from the mansion, where all
                     this was done, and where substantial comfort prevailed; for it was one of the
                     cares of John Halloran's life to attend to the well-being of every living thing
                     connected with him, and he was rewarded by increased prosperity and a cheerful
                     service which was becoming rare and uncertain in the down-trodden country.
                  Nora's song gradually ceased, and a deep, thoughtful expression settled on her
                     countenance. Occasionally she went to the door and looked anxiously down the
                     path, but returned each time with a disappointed look to her chair. The red in
                     her cheeks grew deeper, and something like a frown gathered on the smooth,
                     white forehead of Nora, as, giving her head a toss, she broke out with,—
                  "It would be a good thing altogether, I believe, if there wasn't a man to be
                     found; for wherever one is there is trouble, surely. There's the mistress, now,
                     with her beautiful face growing more like a wraith every day, by rayson of the
                     great oneasiness that's on her in respect to the meanderings of Mister
                     Halloran, and no one to the fore but that Donald Dhu to comfort her, that, in
                     place of easing her poor heart, fills it with the afflictions of Job hisself,
                     that's got a leer in the bad eyes of him, enough to pizen a witch. Then, on the
                     back of that, as if it wasn't enough to put a decent girl demented, here comes
                     that ommadawn from Kildare, laving his forge,
                     and the hoofs that wouldn't be amiss if they give him a kick or two, to
                     persuade me, by troth, to marry him, and butthering me up about his new lease
                     and the fine cow. But I won't—if he's got a lease for five hundred
                     years on the ould place, and ten cows, and ten horses, and twenty sheep
                     forenent it. I'll let the born villain into a saicret, before long, that'll
                     make him hop like a lame duck. But whist! It's an ould saying, if them's his
                     feet I hear on the gravel, that talk of the devil (Lord save us!) and he's
                     surely at hand."
                  "A good-even to you, Nora. I've been watching you all the way up from the gate,
                     an' faith it did my heart good to see you looking so happy like, an' the red
                        light shining about you asthore, as
                     it will some better day in glory," said a weary-sounding voice at the door.
                  "Come in, Dennis Byrne, and don't stand there jabbering at the door-sill to
                     disturb Mrs. Halloran," she replied, without looking up, although she was half
                     tempted to do so, and was ready to burst into tears; for there was something so
                     unusually sad in Dennis Byrne's voice, that she felt at once that something had
                     happened.
                  "It's a poor welcome you give me, Nora, after a heavy day's work, an' a sore
                     tramp from Kildare," he said, still leaning against the door.
                  "Come in and rest yourself. No one hinders you," was her ungracious reply.
                  "You saw the sogers go past to-day?" he said, taking a chair near her.
                  "It's like enough I'd leave my ironing and plaiting to run down to the road to
                     stare at sogers! I can't afford to lose the time that some does," she replied,
                     with a toss of her head.
                  "S'pose then, bedad, they come thundering up here to Glendariff and ordered you
                     at the point of their bayonets to sew a button on every man's coat of 'cm?"
                  "And if they did," she replied, while her eyes flashed,—"if they did, I
                        wouldn't. I'd try to make some of 'em wish they'd never h'ard
                     such a thing as a button was invented. But what do you mean, man alive? You
                     look as if you had been dead and buried."
                  "Oh, nothing very particular, only I've been shoeing horses since ten o'clock
                     this morning, with a cocked pistol aimed at my head, and all I got for my pains
                     was curses and hard knocks. An' I'll tell you, Nora bhan asthore, I h'ard some
                     things said about Glendariff an' Mister Halloran that it would be well enough
                     to make him acquainted with."
                  "It's mighty strange, Dennis, they should talk out before you?" said Nora,
                     fixing her black eyes with an anxious expression on his.
                  "Faith, then, it's not so mighty strange, seein' I never let a word of English
                     out of my jaws, but nonplushed 'cm with a little Kerry lingo, that set 'em half
                     wild," he said, while a flash of merriment danced over his face.
                  "Now tell me, Dennis dear, what it all means," said Nora, laying her hand on
                     his shoulder, while tears gathered in her eyes.
                  "Whist, Nora, ma colleen," he whispered; "there's a rebellion afoot, an' Mister
                     Halloran's one of the chiefs of it. And they're going to station sogers at
                     Glendariff, and set spies on him, and take him up to Dublin if they catch
                     him."
                  "And what if he's taken?" gasped Nora.
                  "He'll be hung or transported."
                  "Oh, Jesus!" exclaimed Nora, with a cry of bitter anguish.
                  "Hist, Nora asthore! hist! I hear footsteps on the gravel."
                  "The Holy Virgin grant it may be Mister Halloran!" said Nora. "I expect they'll
                     want lights now, and I'll step in with the candelabra." The massive silver
                     candelabrum, supporting wax candles, stood in a closet all ready. She hastily
                     took it out, and, lighting the trimmed and oiled wicks, went into the
                     drawing-room with it. She soon returned, and, resuming her seat, while a
                     crimson flush dyed her cheeks, she said, "No, it's not Mister Halloran: it's
                     that bad, black Donald, that I'll put some throuble on yet, if he don't keep
                     his dirty hands to hisself."
                  "What's that you're saying, Nora?" asked Dennis Byrne.
                  
                  "Nothing—nothing. Mind your own business, Dennis, man. I said Mister Halloran
                     has not come yet," she replied, bustling over her work-basket.
                  So it was. Mrs. Halloran had heard the footsteps, and sprang toward the door to
                     meet her husband, but, when she saw her dark kinsman, always an unwelcome
                     guest, she drew back with a loud cry of disappointment. He held out his hand,
                     and said,—
                  "I hope, my lady cousin, I am not intruding."
                  "No, no," she said, hurriedly; "I only thought it was John——"
                  "Halloran out, eh? I came up to see him on business. Do you expect him in
                     soon?" he said, with a dark and sinister look.
                  "Every moment. I hope to see him come in every instant," she replied,
                     hurriedly.
                  "Yes, I hope so too. The country is in a very troubled state, and I believe
                     government is on the alert to arrest every one whose conduct is at all
                     suspicious. John is the leading man in his district; and the law expects him,
                     of course, to keep order among his tenants."
                  "Of course—yes, of course. John has always endeavored to keep order among our
                     people. He has made them his friends, Cousin Donald, by promoting in every way
                     their interests and comfort and morals. I don't think we shall have trouble
                     with our people," she said, anxiously.
                  "I hope not. John's Quaker blood ought to preach and plead for peace.
                     By-the-by, Cousin Mary, you know I was in France when you got married, and I'm
                     not well acquainted with Halloran's antecedents. What is the family history?
                     There ought to be some legends connected with an old place like
                     Glendariff."
                  "There are none," she said, quietly. "John's family, as far back as we can
                     trace them, have been Quakers and the proprietors of Glendariff. He, you know,
                     is the last of his name, and the inheritor of their wealth."
                  "But Halloran is a Catholic: that is strange."
                  "Yes, thank God, John is a good and sincere Catholic. He became one a few years
                     before our marriage, at Rome."
                  "Hum—ahem—and you met him——?"
                  "In Dublin. We frequented the same circles"
                  "But—pardon me, my lady cousin, for interrupting you again—a rumor came to me
                     over the water that the beautiful Mary O'More, the last of the lineal
                     descendants of the McCarthy More, was about mating with the Earl of Rathlinn,
                     the wealthiest of our Irish peers."
                  "Mary O'More had enough of the pride of the princes of Munster left in her
                        not to mate with a man who, if famous for his riches and power,
                     was still more notorious for his vices. She preferred the noble and unsullied
                     heart she has chosen, who, if he has no rank to boast of, can show an ancestry
                     without stain or reproach, whose virtues he inherits and whose fair name he
                     honors," exclaimed Mrs. Halloran, rousing herself, and speaking proudly.
                  "Yes," drawled Donald, well named the Black, with an insufferably supercilious
                     air; "yes, I heard he was a clever person. It would be a pity, though——"
                  "What would be a pity?" she inquired, haughtily.
                  "It would be a great pity if Halloran should get mixed up in these
                     secret organizations which are on foot. It would be a pity for this fine old
                     property to be involved."
                  "John Halloran is one who scorns all anticipated pity, being sufficient in his
                     own resources for whatever may befall him. But why should Donald More suggest
                     such things?" she said, with dignity.
                  "Well," he said, "the times suggest them—not I. Every man ought to be on his guard who has
                     landed interests at stake, and children to inherit them."
                  Just then a quick step bounded through the hall, and the next moment Mary
                     Halloran lay sobbing on the bosom of her husband.
                  "Ha, More! I'm glad to see you," he said, supporting his wife in one arm, while
                     he held his hand out to her kinsman. "Mary, darling, you have moped yourself to
                     death, and are nervous. By-and-by we shall be more together; my business is
                     almost completed. But apropos, where is
                     supper? Nora! Nora Brady, let us have tea and a cold fowl, and any other nice
                     thing you may have," said Mr. Halloran, calling to Nora in cheerful tones.
                  "I wonder you are not more careful, Halloran," said Donald More, as John
                     Halloran threw himself on the sofa beside his wife; "outrages are fearfully
                     common—burnings and murders by the score."
                  "It's the old song, and a convenient and most plausible excuse for new
                     exactions—new oppressions," he replied, carelessly. "I know something about
                     these matters. I know how, insulted and trodden on, exasperated and maddened,
                     my poor countrymen sometimes turn like worms and sting the heels that crush
                     them. Then come the outcry and the death-cry together, and the huge hand of
                     oppression, armed with a thousand scourges, falls heavily far and wide. No, I
                     am not afraid; and once it would have been a marvel to hear one of the McCarthy
                     Mores talk of fear."
                  "That's very fine—a very fine sentiment; but I suppose the Mores are
                     degenerating with the rest of mankind; besides, you know, I am a lateral
                     branch, and my mother was an Englishwoman, so I'm sworn in from my birth, and
                     all my natural proclivities are for the Union," said Donald More, laughing
                     sarcastically.
                  Sitting a little back from the others, he had been watching Nora as she came in
                     and out, making eyes at her, and grimacing, which liberties she resented by
                     looks of ineffable scorn on her handsome face; and, finally, as she attempted
                     to reach across to put the tea-urn in its place, he suddenly pinched her
                     cheek.
                  "Ugh!" screamed Nora, and the next instant the tea-urn, with its boiling
                     contents, was toppled over him. He sprang up with a fearful oath. Mrs. Halloran
                     shrieked, and her husband, who, in a mirror opposite, had watched the whole
                     affair, could scarcely control his features or restrain his laughter.
                  "Nora—why, Nora," he said, as she came in with a cloth to wipe up the floor,
                     "that was extremely awkward."
                  "I know it was, sir; an' if a vile bug hadn't stung me on the cheek, it
                     wouldn't have happened at all. I wish St. Patrick himself was here to drive all
                     such venomous creatures away from Glendariff, anyways. Did it hurt you, sir?"
                     she asked, innocently, turning to Donald More, who, half frantic with pain, had
                     thrown himself on the sofa, where he lay groaning vociferously. His reply was
                     full of profanity and fury. Nora shrugged her shoulders, and turned away to
                     conceal the smile that flitted over her face.
                  "Go, Nora, quickly, and tell Mrs. Shea to prepare the south chamber for Mr.
                     More; tell her he is badly scalded. Go, have it done as soon as possible," said
                     Mrs. Halloran, nervously.
                  "I am sorry this accident happened, Donald," said John Halloran.
                  "Accident! I am parboiled. My shoulder—my arm—my thigh! Good God, Halloran! I
                     am almost murdered!" he screamed.
                  
                  "You will feel better soon. Keep quiet. Mrs. Shea has an invaluable remedy for
                     burns——"
                  "Do try, John, to get him up to the south room at once, that something may be
                     done," said Mrs. Halloran, really sorry for him.
                  "Yes—yes—let me get there. I shall go mad if this continues five minutes
                     longer. Help me up, Halloran. There—Diable! I
                     can't walk." But, with the assistance of a stick, and Mr. Halloran's arm, he
                     succeeded in climbing the stairs, where, in a little while, a remedy was
                     applied, which relieved his pains considerably, and a composing draught
                     administered, under the influence of which his irritated nerves were somewhat
                     soothed. Mrs. Shea, sharing in the dislike with which all regarded him,
                     darkened the room, and made her escape as soon as she thought he was asleep.
                     But he heard her go out, and, finding himself alone, gave vent to the
                     revengeful feelings of his dark heart in low, bitter words. "It shall fall on
                     them all,"he said,—"all. I have not dogged John Halloran's steps,
                     day and night, in vain. He robbed me of my first love—the love of my boyhood.
                        She robbed me of the small inheritance, which should be mine,
                     by her inconstancy; and now this vixen—this virago—because I touched her dainty
                     cheek, maims me for life. But vengeance is near at hand." And he fell asleep,
                     to dream of the ruin he would work.
                  It was past midnight, and a deep hush was over Glendariff. All beneath the old
                     roof slept soundly, except John Halloran. He sat watching beside a lone couch,
                     on which reclined his wife. She had refused to retire. A strange, sad
                     presentiment urged her to watch through that night, lest, if she fell asleep,
                     when she awoke she should find him gone; but at last he prevailed on her to lie
                     down and rest, and, folding her hand in his, sat talking low, pleasant words to
                     her, until, quite exhausted with the emotions of the day, a deep slumber stole
                     over her. And now she lay so calm and motionless that it looked like
                     death,—strangely beautiful and solemn. He dashed heavy tears from his eyes as
                     he leaned over her, and his heart almost failed him. He thought, perchance, he
                     might never look on her face again. Alas! long years would roll by ere he would
                     see that sweet face again, except in visions of the night. A pang wrung his
                     heart, and his face grew deadly white. He stooped and kissed her, then took up
                     the small scissors from the work-table and cut one of the long fair curls which
                     lay on her cheek, and placed it carefully and tenderly in his pocket-book;
                     kissed her once more, and, with a noiseless step, left the room to seek his
                     children. Oh, little pebbles of the brook of life and love! how sure and
                     unerring is the aim with which, at moments like this, ye are slung into the
                     forehead of giant nature, bringing him prostrate to a level with your own
                     littleness! How the blow sinks down into his heart, making it heavier than the
                     nether millstone, and as bitter as the waters of Marah! John Halloran could but
                     weep now; there was no help for it. His tears and kisses fell together on their
                     heads. He lifted their soft, dimpled hands to his bearded cheeks, and pressed
                     long, loving kisses on their rosy lips. But it must end. One lingering look and
                     fond caress, and he tore himself from them. Perhaps something whispered that he
                     should never see them thus again; that one of that twain would flit heavenward,
                     and leave only the vision of a shrined angel in his memory.
                  And now he is out on the lawn. The full orbed moon sheds an unspeakable
                     splendor upon the scene, silvering over the antique gables and quaint
                     chimney-stacks of the old house, and throwing tremulous shadows through the
                     foliage on the deep set windows. When should he see it again?
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER III.
                  
                     
                        
                           "What? Thundering to be heard, Old Land?
                           Ho! bravely and boldly done;
                           Now! where are thy children gone?
                           Ay, there, support her, she's weak;
                           See, see how her cold limbs shake.
                           Let her lean on that RUSTED brand!
                           They have treated thee ill, old dame,
                           And thou blushest with rage and shame!
                           Thou'rt astir,—a fearful token
                           That the o'erstrung bow is broken."
                        
                     
                  
                  A GLEAM of sunshine, that flickered through the dense foliage which shadowed
                     the window, fell warm and golden over Mary Halloran's face, and awoke her from
                     her deep but uneasy slumbers. Surprised to find that she had passed the night
                     on her couch instead of the bed, she could not, at first, remember how it was.
                     She passed her hand over her forehead, then glanced around the room with a wild
                     and frightened look; and, when she found it empty, she flew toward the bed and
                     tore back the curtains. But she saw that it had been untouched, and a low cry
                     of anguish escaped her lips. She tottered toward the bell-rope and pulled it,
                     then fell heavily on the couch from which she had risen, her face as white as
                     the cambric pillows on which she leaned.
                  "Did you ring, ma'am?" said Nora, coming in.
                  "Where is Mr. Halloran, Nora?" she asked, as calmly as she could.
                  "It's altogether uncertain, ma'am, if he is not here. Troth and I thought he
                     was snug in his bed yet," replied Nora, endeavoring to conceal her own
                     anxiety.
                  "My husband is not here, Nora: he's gone. Something dreadful has happened. I
                     know and feel it. I have felt it on me these many days," she said, folding her
                     long white hands together, and rocking herself to and fro, while a torrent of
                     tears rolled over her cheeks.
                  "Why, surely, now, it's nothing onusual for a gintleman to be out airly at this
                     season of the year. I've h'ard him say, God save him, that he'd rayther be out
                     when the dew is on the fern-leaves and the birds whistling through the morning
                     air, than to see the grandest show in the kingdom. He'll be in presently, and
                     have to wait for his breakfast, if I don't be stirring."
                  "Nora, is Mr. Halloran's horse in the stable?" she asked.
                  "And how should he be, surely, and Mister Halloran out on the hill-side, or
                     foreninst there at Holy Cross, on his back?" replied Nora, cheeringly.
                  "There is one thing will settle all this doubt. I dread the worst; and yet—my
                     God!—it is necessary for me to know it. If they should be gone, how can I bear
                     it? Help me, O my Father! thou whose ears are never closed to the plaint of thy
                     suffering ones; endow me with strength and fortitude to bear the storms which
                     are gathering about my head 
                        
                           'Jesus, lover of my soul,
                           Let me to thy refuge fly,
                           While the nearer waters roll,
                           While the tempest's wrath is nigh.'"
                        
                     
                  
                  And even then, while her troubled soul poured out its cry for aid, she felt
                     calmer and stronger. An almighty arm was about her, and would bear her up as
                     the bitter floods rolled by now; and
                     in the sorrowful days that were to come, He would be her solace and
                     defense.
                  She went to an old oak cabinet, and, turning the key, opened the door. One
                     glance sufficed to show her that the shelves were empty. "Yes, they are gone,"
                     she murmured; "gone."
                  "And what is it, Maire Bhan asthore," said
                     Nora, who had come close to her and placed her strong arm tenderly and
                     caressingly around her slender, drooping form,—"what is it that's gone, my
                     jewel?"
                  "All gone! Sword, spurs, the green uniform, epaulets, chapeau, and all. Gone
                     with my darling to the wild hills of Tipperary, where the cruel hunters will
                     snare and cage him,—my eagle-heart, whose worst fault is that it would be too
                     near the sun. Oh! oh!"
                  "And what is this, suillish machree?"
                     stooping down to pick up a small twisted note which had fallen unperceived when
                     the door was opened. "It looks like his own writing, surely."
                  "It is—it is!" cried Mrs. Halloran, running her eye rapidly over its contents.
                     The blood mounted to her pale cheeks, and something like exultation lit up her
                     features, but faded rapidly, and she leaned on Nora's faithful bosom cold and
                     shivering. "Let me lie down, Nora dear, and read it to me. I cannot see very
                     clearly. Perhaps I did not read it right," she said, feebly.
                  "Sweet wife" (Nora read), "I have courage to die for my country, but not enough
                     to bear your tears and a mutual farewell. But cheer up. Our separation will be
                     short. When we meet again, the old Sunburst will wave its folds of green and
                     gold over Ireland,—the beacon of her freedom. She will lift up her bowed head
                     and be a nation once more, and our children will be no longer helots, but
                     freemen. Adieu, sweet wife. Kiss the dear ones, and tell Nora I recommend ye
                     all to her loving care."
                  "And so she will lift up her head, alanna," cried Nora, in a transport, "if
                     he's to be the leader, and had a few like hisself to help. It will be done; an'
                     the English, with their red coat sogers, and their black-coat parsons, and
                     their sneaking tithe-men, drivers, and the devil knows what beside, will be
                     hunted off our Irish acres in a jiffy, and have our beautiful country to
                        shinfane, the right owners, by troth."
                  "Nora!" said Mrs. Halloran.
                  "Faith, ma'am, and I can see nothing to be crying afther, at all. If I only
                     knowed where to go and how to go, I'd be off on the wildest Kerry colt I could
                     find to help, only in respect to yourself, suillish
                        machree, I couldn't lave you unprotected. But there is one shall
                     go in my place, please God, and that's Dennis Byrne; and if he's kilt, it'll be
                     the best thing could happen in such a cause. May God and the Blessed Virgin
                     help the right."
                  "Amen!" said Mrs. Halloran, in a low, fervent tone; "we are in our Father's
                     hands. We are under the protection of our blessed and dear Lady. We may
                     suffer,—oh, yes, that we must expect,—but, in the end, peace and rest must
                     come. Go down, dear Nora; and the moment anything happens, let me know."
                  "Yes," said Nora, pausing in the old oak-paneled passage to shake her fist
                     toward a closed door; "and if you hadn't got what you did in good time, you'd
                     be on his track, cross-bred mule that you are; but, thanks to the scalding tay
                     that lathered your shins, it'll be some time before you can do any mischief,
                     black informer that you are." Then, as if relieved, she walked quietly and
                     swiftly down to the kitchen to begin her usual day's labor,—a labor which her
                     cheerful and faithful heart and industrious trious hands made so light that she not
                     unfrequently had more time to herself than any other domestic at
                     Glendariff.
                  No event of importance occurred that day. If a stranger had been passing
                     through the country, he would have lingered on the road to gaze down on the
                     tranquil beauty of Glendariff, and thought it must be the abode of happiness
                     and contentment. He would have known that plenty teemed from those rolling
                     lands, covered with a verdure and luxuriance of vegetation which indicated the
                     fertility of the soil, and those sunny slopes, rich in waving grain, which, as
                     the wind-tide ebbed and flowed over it, swayed and undulated with a motion as
                     graceful and harmonious as the ocean-billow when no storm is on it. In the
                     distance, through a natural vista, his eye would have fallen on the gray ruins
                     of Holy Cross, their desolate grandeur and beautiful decay gilded by the
                     sunbeam, while here and there, through the moss-grown arches, the bright-blue
                     waters of the Suire might be seen rippling on toward the sea, uttering the same
                     mysterious numbers that it sang of old, like Time, hymning the wrongs, the
                     evils, and the sins of men as it rolls solemnly on toward eternity. And then he
                     would have turned away from the view of Glendariff—beautiful in its antique
                     style and picturesque site—from its abundance, from its productive fields—to go
                     past the abodes of poverty, which the natural and rich resources of the land
                     had no blessing for, and see men and women worn down with ineffectual labor,
                     bowed and gloomy on the inadequate returns it would afford them, or
                     characterized by a levity and recklessness which, with the livery of want that
                     they wore, preached bitter homilies by its mockery.
                  As evening wore on, Mrs. Halloran's anxieties increased. She could think of but
                     one thing, and that was the approaching proaching desperate struggle. The very
                     indefinite knowledge she possessed heightened and augmented her terror. When?
                     where? what? were the questions that haunted her. The children shrunk back,
                     rendered timid by her silence and paleness, and Mrs. Shea retired angry and
                     voluble from her because she did not open her lips when she went in to report
                     to her concerning the health of Donald More.
                  "An' it's in purgatory I've got before my time," she complained to Nora, "with
                     that screeching, swearing pagan up-stairs, that was so crazy to get out this
                     morn' that he swears a big oath, and gives a lape, when down he comes flat to
                     the floor, laving me the immortal honor, sure, of picking him up; an' troth if
                     he does it agen, honey, I'll get the pitchfork to toss him in. It was all
                     through your bad doings, Nora Brady, and you ought to nurse him."
                  "Thank you, dear Mistress Shea; I don't look up to any such grandeur as to
                     nurse such a great gentleman as Donald Dhu," said Nora, laughing, as Mrs. Shea
                     flounced out with a bowl of chocolate for the invalid.
                  That night Nora sat silent and sad by the fireside, her fingers busy shifting
                     from one needle to the other the stitches of a stocking, her eyes fixed
                     thoughtfully on the glowing turf, her lips silent. No sound was heard but the
                     chirping of a cricket in some warm corner. Ere long the silence was broken by
                     the echo of heavy, slow footsteps. She thought it might be Dennis Byrne, and
                     tripped out on the lawn to meet him; but it was Father McCarthy.
                  "God save us, your reverence," she said, kneeling for his blessing, which he
                     gave.
                  "And how is Mrs. Halloran, my child?" he asked.
                  "She's poorly enough, sir."
                  "And Mr. Halloran,—where is he?"
                  
                  "We do not know exactly, father: he left home in the night, and it's much
                     comfort she needs, poor thing."
                  "Heaven help the poor child!" said the priest, in a compassionate tone. "Where
                     is she, Nora?"
                  "She's in the room, sir, Mr. Halloran's books and things is in, where he used
                     to read and write, your reverence. Shall I go and tell her?"
                  "No, no; it is not necessary," he replied, hurrying in with a heavy heart, for
                     Mary Halloran was the child of his only sister, and he loved her well.
                  Nora could not sit still or rest: so, throwing the stocking aside, she walked
                     with a quick pace down to the lodge, once inhabited by a porter who kept the
                     gate. But it was dismantled and almost ruined now, with its low stone walls
                     covered with ivy and creepers, and which John Halloran had allowed to stand,
                     because it was a picturesque feature at Glendariff. She went to the broken
                     casement which looked out on the road, and, leaning her arms on the low sill,
                     stood watching for the blacksmith of Kildare. She had not waited long before he
                     came.
                  "Nora asthore," he said, starting at the
                     sound of her voice, "is it waiting for me that you are here? It's no safe place
                     for one like you, dear."
                  "And why isn't it a safe place, Dennis Byrne?"
                  "Because the times is bad."
                  "What is the matter with the times, sure? It seems to me the times is good
                     enough; and if men was as good as the times, we shouldn't have English sogers
                     poking their noses into everybody's business, and kith and kin hounding each
                     other, selling their own flesh and blood like nagur slaves."
                  "Whist, Nora dear! it isn't safe to talk out," he replied, looking furtively
                     about him, and speaking in a whisper. "Is Mr. Halloran up yonder?"
                  "No; and that's what I wanted to spake to you about. Have you heard any news
                     to-day?—but come in; it'll be safe altogether there," she said.
                  "May-be not," he replied; "may-be not. There's sogers lurking about Glendariff.
                     They're watching for Mister Halloran."
                  "They'll have their watching for their trouble, then. He's not here, nor won't
                     be again in a hurry, accordin' to my judgment. But I've got something to say,
                     Dennis, and I might as well say it first as last. It's a dark day when it come
                     to my heart, and a sorrowful one when it comes out. But it's no use; may-be
                     it'll blow over and may-be it won't: anyway, God's will be done. We was to be
                     married in the spring coming. I have fifty pounds and a cow to begin with. You
                     have enough for a poor boy to settle with; and I won't say I looked to the time
                     with sorrow. I loved to think of being in my own cot, and keeping it cheery and
                     thrifty for you, avourneen, and, troth, I had
                     my own dreams of happiness. But they're over now. It cannot be——"
                  "What's that you're saying, Nora Brady, afther promising me these three years?"
                     exclaimed Dennis Byrne, aghast. "Don't be trifling with a fellow in that way,
                     Nora; joke with anything but that, and I'll laugh with you——"
                  "You h'ard every word I said, and I'm just as much in airnest, Dennis, as if it
                     was my dying day. And you may give me up intirely if you like. I can very quick
                     give you back your love-tokens. But my mind's made up, and, what's more, I've
                     taken a vow."
                  "In the name of the Blessed Virgin, woman, what are you talking about?" he
                     asked, half beside himself.
                  "It's aisy enough explaining what I say," she said, laying her hand on his
                     shoulder. "You know, Dennis, as well
                     as I do, what's in the wind, and Mister Halloran's in it, where every true
                     Irishman ought to be; and, if he's helped by them that have rayson enough to
                     fight, it'll be a glorious day for Ould Ireland. I know that, and want it, too,
                     if I am only a poor girl. But mind, Dennis, may-be the rebellion will fail,—God
                     help them that's risked all they have on the chance,—and, if it does, I've made
                     a vow before Heaven, on the cross, never to wed you if you don't help them
                     that's willing to spill their blood for you, and if sorrow and distress and
                     penury come to Glendariff, never to marry until all is right again
                     with them I love. If they suffer, I suffer; if they wander, I wander. And now
                     be off with you; for that is Nora Brady's Vow."
               
               
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "But alas for his country!—her pride is gone by,
                              And that spirit is broken which never would bend;
                              O'er the ruin her children in secret must sigh,
                              For 'tis treason to love her, and death to defend.
                              Unprized are her sons, till they've learned to betray;
                              Undistinguished they live, if they shame not their
                                 sires;
                              And the torch that would light them through dignity's way
                              Must be caught from the pile where their country
                                 expires."
                           
                        
                        MOORE.
                     
                  
                  "NORA BRADY, you have done me a great wrong this day," said Dennis Byrne,
                     grasping her arm, as she turned to leave him, while his heart swelled with
                     indignation and grief. He had loved Nora long and faithfully; early and late
                     had he toiled, that he might surround her with homely domestic comforts when
                     she entered his house as its mistress; and now, when just on the eve of the
                     realization of his bright hopes, to be told that "it could not
                     be," to have all those beautiful dreams so rudely dashed out,—it was
                     almost more than he could endure.
                  "Now, be a man, Dennis darling," said Nora, wiping the tears away from her
                     face. "If I can bear it, you can, surely. I didn't say at all that I didn't
                     love you, or that I was going to play a false game with you, mavourneen. I only want you to be patient, and wait
                     may-be a year, may-be longer, in respect to the great throuble that's come on
                     the two we love, and who has been the best friends we ever had, and that needs
                     our help as much as we ever needed theirs; that is, if things go wrong with
                     them, that would lay down their lives to make 'em right."
                  
                  "I see no rayson yet why we shouldn't marry. I love John Halloran,—ay, the very
                     sod his feet presses,—an' for his sake I'd give up everything but you, Nora;
                     but why we can't sarve him an' his as well when we're man an' wife, as now,
                     bates me out intirely."
                  "That's because you're a pittiogue, Dennis
                     Byrne," said Nora, indignantly. "How do I know what's coming to pass? If
                     poverty comes to Glendariff, or rayther if poverty chases them away from
                     Glendariff, I, for one, shouldn't like to hoard up the gold that I airned in
                     their service; an' who knows but that I shall have to cross the sea? There'll
                     be enough for Norah Brady's hands to do, without having a master to the fore,
                     to bid me here and ordher me there. And let this be the last of it entirely: if
                     you choose to wait for me, wait; if you don't—be off as fast as your two legs
                     can carry you."
                  Dennis, the stout blacksmith of Kildare, was silent for some time. He knew by
                     Nora's manner that her resolution was taken and not to be moved, and, although
                     he felt angry enough at what he considered her unreasonableness, the thought of
                     giving her up was like death. Next to her he loved John Halloran. They had been
                     playmates together; indeed, the same breasts had suckled both in their infancy,
                     for Byrne's mother had the nursing of the young heir of Glendariff until he was
                     weaned, and the boys had grown up together, every year strengthening the tie,
                     which in Ireland is as strong as that of kindred, until manhood separated them;
                     and each in his sphere retained the old love and the old interest, and found
                     many opportunities of serving the other. The friendship of John Halloran had
                     cheered and brightened the humble life of his foster-brother; it had saved him
                     from many an extortion and much injustice; and the consciousness of it gave
                     confidence and energy to his manhood, for he knew that he was his earthly
                     providence dence, and would never let harm, that money or influence could
                     avert, blight his life. He thought of all this now, and the merry sports of
                     "long ago,"—of the days' fishing in the Suire, their wild adventures and long
                     excursions to the Kerry Mountains, and the delicious loitering among the old
                     ruins of Holy Cross. He could not but serve John Halloran, now that dark days
                     threatened him. He felt ashamed of his momentary selfishness, and at last
                     said,—
                  "Nora, mo seact n-anam astig tu
                     *
                      are you; but let it be as you say. You have tould me what you will do,
                     but what I'm to do is what I doesn't know. I don't even know where Misther
                     Halloran is, God save him. I have heard rumors of a rebellion, but where it's
                     to break out it's more than I can tell, an' I wish I did, for, bedad! I'd like
                     to be in the thick of it. But there's one thing, a
                        suillish mahuil agus machree,"†
                      he said, brightening up: "he often tould me, if he got into throuble
                     with the government, as he said from a boy he always intended, and was hunted
                     by the Saxon hounds, that I must seek him beyant the clouds—that is, in a den
                     so high up on Ballyhowry Mountain that the wild craythurs have never made their
                     lair in it. And so good-by, Nora: the moon's up, and I'll run down to Larry
                     Ragan's cabin an' hire the suit and wallet of the old baccah man that's been sick in it these two months, and be off
                     before day. One kiss, Nora darling."
                        
                        *Seven times dearer than my soul.
                     
                        
                        †Light of my eyes and heart.
                     
                  "The Blessed Mother of God have you in her keeping, my cœn-buy deelish," said Nora, as she allowed him to take the
                     farewell kiss he asked, while tears overflowed her eyes. "Good-by, Dennis dear:
                     warm will be the sheda veha when you come
                     back. God's holy angels go with you.
                     But wait one minute! I'd like to forgotten the very thing above all that must
                     be thought of. Here—hide this about you somewhere: it's for Mister Halloran, if
                     you find him where you're going to, and give it to him with Nora Brady's humble
                     service and love, and tell him to have no uneasiness in respect to Mrs.
                     Halloran and the childer, for if I ever lave or forsake them in the dark hour
                     may God forsake me. Now hurry off, Dennis; and don't forget the limp when you
                     get the wallet across your shoulders."
                  "I'll engage you never saw such limping done afore, by a fellow wid sound
                     legs," said Dennis Byrne, laughing, as he deposited the little package she had
                     given him, in the depths of his breast-pocket.
                  "Now go on, and don't be after looking back, alanna, for fear of the black luck," said Nora, pushing him
                     away.
                  Cutting a stout black-thorn by the roadside, Dennis Byrne started on what might
                     have been considered a wild-goose chase, if the results of his journey had not
                     proved that his instincts had guided him aright. Traveling mostly by night, and
                     begging a sup and morsel here and there on the roadside, evading with success
                     the parties of English soldiers that dashed from time to time across his path,
                     keeping his ears open when, two or three times, he was invited to spend the
                     night by the turf fire of some hospitable peasant, and saying but little, he
                     heard that a battle had been fought in Tipperary, and that the patriotic band
                     who dared to strike for freedom and their native land had been defeated and
                     routed. Not daring to ask a question (for he was among strangers), the news
                     quickened his steps, and after many days' wearisome travel he reached the chain
                     of high hills which, lifting their summits to the clouds, and broken into a
                     thousand scenes of the wildest grandeur, whose steep defiles and beetling
                     cliffs were full of sublimity and magnificence, threw their broad shadows over
                     the fruitful valleys of Munster. Following sometimes the steep and rugged
                        balleagh, or forcing his way cautiously
                     along the windings of a narrow wolf-track, he scaled one rocky height after
                     another, deterred neither by their perils nor bleakness from the accomplishment
                     of his faithful purpose. Occasionally he sought the shelter of some sheeling
                     perched high up among the cliffs, and whose poverty-stricken inmates made him
                     welcome to a meal of potatoes and milk, but could give him no information of
                     what was passing below. Up in that wild region they heard but little of what
                     was passing among their fellow-men; nor cared they much, for in the sharp
                     struggle for existence which for evermore saddened their life, in the grasp and
                     clutch for the barest means to avert starvation and bitter want, they had no
                     time to spare on the concerns of others, or to waste in dreams which their
                     life-long shadow had made idle and profitless to them. They bore with sullen
                     patience the evils of their lot, and endured the sweat and labor entailed by
                     Adam on his race, without, many, many times, the reward of the bread
                     promised.
                  It was late in the afternoon when Dennis Byrne, at the imminent peril of life
                     and limb, reached the cave, high up on one of the highest peaks of the
                     Ballyhowry Mountains, which John Halloran and himself had discovered years ago.
                     But it was lonely. No living creature had disturbed the stones which they had
                     piled up at its entrance. And it was now that the stout heart of the blacksmith
                     of Kildare failed him, and the fruitlessness of his toils over-whelmed him; and
                     he sat down on a moss-grown rock and wept like a child. Relieved by this
                     outburst of tears, he sought a more sheltered place, for it was bitterly
                        cold, and, taking a crust from his
                     wallet, moistened it with whisky and ate it, after which he cleared away the
                     great stones one by one from the entrance of the cave, and gathered moss and
                     dead fern to make himself a lair to sleep in that night. At length, his
                     arrangements being completed, he threw himself down to rest, which he had never
                     in his life of toil needed more than he did then. He cast his eyes abroad: the
                     last gleam of sunlight had fled away like gold-plumaged birds from the crags
                     and peaks of the neighboring mountains, and the gray mist like a silent flood
                     had risen from the valley, and enveloped him until he almost imagined himself
                     to be the lone inhabitant of some desolate island. He felt awed by the deep
                     unbroken silence and dreary solitude of his situation, and, drawing his
                     well-worn rosary out of his pocket, he knelt down and devoutly recited it,
                     after which he crept into the cavern, and was soon sleeping calmly and
                     heavily.
                  He might have slept two or three hours,—he could not tell,—when he was suddenly
                     awakened by something falling heavily upon him. Starting up with a wild cry, he
                     grappled with the intruder, who was a man, and who seemed powerful enough in
                     frame, but from some cause or other feeble and helpless.
                  "Who are you at all?" cried Dennis, while a cold moisture started to his lips.
                     "If you're a friend, spake; if you're a foe, bedad, it'll not be long before
                     you find your broken bones in the glen below!" But a stifled groan was his only
                     response: then there was a dead silence, and the man lay limp and heavy on his
                     arm, and his low, quick breathing gradually ceased.
                  "Christ defend us! the poor soul is dead; and I'd rayther it'ud be a wild wolf
                     than a dead man, to spend the night with," exclaimed Dennis, while the cold
                     drops rolled over his face; but now a faint moan reassured him, and he dragged
                     the stranger out into the cold, keen air. A dark cloud which had obscured the
                     moon sailed slowly away, and her clear, bright rays fell full on the white,
                     upturned face which Dennis Byrne supported on his shoulder. He looked down on
                     it for an instant in wild amaze; he pushed back the matted hair from the bold
                     forehead, and exclaimed,—
                  "Holy St. Patrick! but it's him hisself!" Then he laid the head of John
                     Halloran down on a rude pillow which he made of his cloak, moving it as gently
                     and as tenderly with his great rough hands and awkward limbs as if he had been
                     tending an infant, and got out his flask and poured a few drops of potheen between the lips of the exhausted man, and
                     unbuckled his stock: all of which seemed to revive him. Soon he opened his eyes
                     and looked around him, then into the face of Byrne, whom he recognized at once,
                     and grasped his hand.
                  "True—true; faithful to the last," he said, in a faint voice. "How are they at
                     Glendariff?"
                  "Well and safe, your honor; but what's this—and this? What's the throuble,
                     sir?" said Dennis, pointing to some black stains on Mr. Halloran's
                     shirt-bosom.
                  "I was wounded, Dennis: not badly. Loss of blood, though, has weakened me. I
                     wish I might have died; for to survive the ruin of all I planned and hoped for,
                     is more than I can bear. All is lost. At Ballingarry a few desperate hearts
                     periled their all in the chances of battle. They expected aid from dastards,
                     who promised but failed to come to their succor; and all was lost. Of these
                     noble and glorious men, some are prisoners of our foes, and will meet the doom
                     of felons; others, like myself, are hiding until the hour arrives for us to fly
                     into an exile of poverty and obscurity."
                  "But surely your honor will return to Glendariff? Sure, sir, Mrs. Halloran's crazy with sorrow in
                     respect to you, and Nora's put me off intirely," said Dennis, scarcely
                     comprehending all his meaning.
                  "I fear I shall never see Glendariff again. I must fly to France or America:
                     not to shun death or danger, but ignominy. I shall find means to send for my
                     family. Of course they will be stripped of everything. Oh, my God! my poor Mary
                     and the little ones! But, Dennis, you must go back, man; you must hasten back
                     and stand by them all. I charge you to protect them until I can bring them to
                     me, wherever I may go."
                  "I think it 'ud be better intirely for me to stand by your honor's self," said
                     Byrne, while his broad chest heaved with emotion.
                  "That cannot be, my friend. I know your faithfulness; and, in leaving you with
                     those who are dearer to me than life, I shall feel that they have not only a
                     friend, but a protector," said John Halloran.
                  "I will stay; I will do anything your honor wishes; an'it's little I'm able to
                     do, but I'll endeavor to do it right. But let it all alone now, sir, and go to
                     sleep. When the sun rises I will call you. There's a snug bed of heather within
                     our old nest, and your honor can make yourself aisy in respect to any one's
                     comin', seein' that I'm goin' to watch till morn."
                  Heart-broken, and enfeebled by loss of blood, John Halloran, thankful for an
                     hour's repose, crept into the cave, and was soon asleep. The next morning he
                     awoke refreshed and strengthened. Dennis had kindled a fire of fagots in a
                     sheltered corner, and made such preparations as his wallet afforded, for
                     breakfast.
                  "What is that you have on, Dennis? I think it will help me in my escape to the
                     coast,—that beggar's gown and bag. Can you spare it?"
                  "Your honor's welcome to it intirely, only it 'ud be a disgrace to see
                     such-like rags on your shoulders, sir. And it's a narrow chance I'm afeared
                     your honor'll have, for the whole country's swarming with red-coats," said
                     Dennis Byrne.
                  "I have friends a little lower down on the mountain. That wild son of old
                     Sheehan's, whose life I saved some years ago, is at home. I saw him yesterday,
                     and he has promised to get me off as soon as his vessel drops down from the
                     north."
                  "An' he's engaged in the free trade, sir, is he?"
                  "Yes. He's a smuggler," said John Halloran.
                  "Here's good luck to him, then, and to all that's up for their rights," said
                     Byrne, "and may he get your honor safe away till the outcry is over."
                  "I'll trust him. I should not have chosen him; but I trust him," was the short
                     response.
                  "And where is your honor going to?"
                  "I scarcely know. I wish to go to America; but they shall know at home, whether
                     it be in France or the United States. I am without a shilling; and
                     circumstances must guide me. I am like a piece of drift-wood, and God alone
                     knows where or how I may be stranded."
                  "Your honor'll pardon me, an' poor Nora too," said Dennis, fumbling in his
                     pocket, "but she sent this to your honor, with her humble service and love, and
                     hopes it may help you, sir."
                  "And what is it?" said John Halloran, holding the little package neatly sewed
                     up in brown silk in his hand, and turning it over and over with a troubled
                     curiosity. Then he opened it, and found, neatly folded within, fifty pounds in
                     notes and gold. "I cannot take it!" he exclaimed, while tears
                     gushed from his eyes.
                  "And surely it 'ud break poor Nora's heart to think you scorned it, sir. She has no use for it
                     surely, for we're not thinking of ourselves until the dark days are gone by,
                     an' troth she knows it's safer in your honor's hands than in her own. Anyway,
                     I'll lave it here, sir, if you won't take it; for I wouldn't dare show my face
                     at Glendariff if I fetched it back. Why, it 'ud never do, your honor."
                  "Oh, Heaven! Well," said Mr. Halloran, with deep emotion, "tell Nora I thank
                     her for her loan. I won't think but that I can return it to her, one of these
                     days, tenfold. But it is time for us to part, Dennis. You must hasten back with
                     my sore heart's best love to them all. Put a kiss on Grace's little head for
                     me, and tell Desmond to be a man and take care of his mother and sister.
                     Perhaps even now my poor Mary has heard that I am killed or taken, and the
                     shock has broken her heart. But you must get there as fast as you can, and tell
                     them I am safe and well; and give this to my wife," said John Halloran,
                     severing one of the thick brown curls from his forehead with his knife. "Give
                     my love, too, to Nora, and tell her to stay by them,—that it comforts me to
                     know she is there."
                  "But the gown an' wallet, your honor?" said Dennis, in a choking voice, while
                     he pretended to undo the fastenings of his beggar garb to hide his tears.
                  "No: I do not need it. I fear it is a disguise I could not counterfeit well.
                     Good-by, faithful friend. I hoped a few days ago that we should deliver you and
                     your brethren from the yoke which binds ye; but all hope is wrecked. Oh, God! O
                     my country! when thy own sons forsake thee, and turn their eyes coldly on thy
                     misery, what is left but despair? Oh, recreants to all sacred rights! Oh,
                     helots, who wear your chains in inglorious rest, would that I could rouse you!
                     would that I could kindle the flame in your cold hearts that is consuming mine,
                     that the death-blow might be given to the foe and the oppressor! But it is
                     vain: my wishes—my wild hopes—my prayers—all are vain. Farewell, my
                     friend."
                  Dennis Byrne wrung the offered hand of the broken-hearted man. Awed by the
                     outburst of his grief, he could not speak, but turned and walked swiftly away,
                     to carry he poor comfort his tidings would afford to the lonely and sorrowful
                     hearts at Glendariff.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER V.
                  
                     
                        
                           "But now, too great for fetters grown,
                           Too proud to bend the slavish knee,
                           Loved Erin mocks the tyrant's thrall,
                           And firmly vows she will be free.
                        
                        
                           "But mark yon treacherous, stealthy knave
                           That bends beneath his country's ban:
                           Shall HE dash out a nation's hope,
                           The anti-Irish Irishman?"
                        
                     
                  
                  ONE bright sunny morning, just four weeks after Dennis Byrne left Glendariff,
                     he returned, footsore and weary enough. Parting with John Halloran under the
                     gloomy circumstances of their last interview had been the saddest trial which
                     had ever wrung the stout heart of the blacksmith of Kildare, and, almost
                     unmanned, his tears now and then fell in torrents, sprinkling the wild rocky
                     paths he was descending. Once he met a cowherd searching for a stray heifer,
                     and not long after, in a narrow gorge, came abreast of two or three shy,
                     sullen-looking men, wearing a look of terror on their countenances, who, having
                     been into the valley to buy meal and potatoes, had heard and seen enough to
                     make them fly back to their mountain sheelings, perfectly satisfied to forego
                     the necessaries they were in pursuit of, for the agreeable certainty of knowing
                     that they had escaped hanging and quartering. Dennis soon discovered that their
                     alarm was not groundless; for as he approached nearer to the lowlands he
                     perceived detachments of English soldiers galloping in every direction tion
                     over the country; he saw that they were stationed at the farm-houses and at the
                     cross-roads, and knew that, unless the providence of God delivered him, he
                     should have a narrow escape, if indeed he did not really fall into their hands.
                     But danger and peril always what the edge of an Irishman's wit; his love of
                     adventure imparts a zest to the most unequal rencontre, while all the chivalry and will of his nature are
                     roused to defeat the purposes of those who would trample on him; and, when he
                     finds that mere physical strength cannot serve him, his keen wit, like a
                     legion, is ready to grapple with an army of difficulties. Dennis Byrne's
                     disguise was perfect, and his limp inimitable, although it added a heavy weight
                     to every mile; while with the vacant, simple look he assumed, and a brogue
                     which was absolutely terrible, he succeeded in passing unharmed more than one
                     Saxon cordon, who were engaged in torturing
                     and tormenting the harmless peasantry with an abuse of authority of which the
                     Vandals of a remoter age might have been ashamed. Whenever he spied them in the
                     distance, he began to sing, with a voice which indicated a pair of lungs as
                     tough and strong as his own great bellows in the smithy at Kildare, some wild
                     Gaelic song, which, to those who were near enough to hear the words, was about
                     as intelligible as the clatter of a mill-wheel, until they surrounded him with
                     curses and questions not a few; when, by his half-witted answers, his rough
                     Connaught brogue, assumed for the occasion, and his idiotic expressions of
                     wonder, he not only secured the freedom of the road, but succeeded in learning
                     much that he wished to know, and on several occasions absolutely received as
                     many shillings as blows.
                  He learned that the principal chiefs in the late outbreak had been arrested and
                     imprisoned: it was believed and hoped they would be hung, certainly
                     transported. He heard John Halloran's
                     name loaded with imprecations and curses, as one who had escaped; they feared
                     he had got safe out of the country; if not, such means were provided for his
                     arrest as must certainly prove effectual in his capture.
                  At last Dennis found himself within the Park-gate at Glendariff. As he
                     approached the house, he saw at once how it was. Sentinels in the uniform of
                     the 4th regiment of Highlanders were stationed here and there about the mansion
                     and grounds; and if at first he felt surprised at the circumstance of no guard
                     being placed at the lodge, he understood it now; but he thanked God fervently
                     that the hunted fugitive was far away, and not likely to be led unwarily into
                     this well-contrived ambuscade. As to himself, "he didn't care a snap if they
                     took him prisoner; it was just what he wanted, unless they sent him up to
                     Dublin, bedad! which would put another face intirely on the matter."
                  The shutters were all closed, and only the kitchen-door was open. Through this
                     he saw Nora flitting around as usual; perhaps more heavily and silently, for no
                     wild melody, trilled out with the gladness of a pure and honest heart, now kept
                     time to the motion of her busy hands. Limping up toward the kitchen, thinking
                     at the moment only of Nora, he was suddenly grasped by the arm on one side,
                     while from the other a bayonet presented before him glittered in his eyes. He
                     turned, and found himself in the custody of two soldiers, who demanded the
                     countersign.
                  "De what? My granny used to know all de signs o' de wedder; but I niver was
                     wise dat way," said Dennis, dropping the corners of his eyes and his mouth
                     together.
                  "What be your business, and where be you from last?" asked the old soldier,
                     gruffly.
                  "An' surely yer honor's scaret me wits out ov me intirely. I almost forgot
                     whedder I was ever born or not," exclaimed Dennis, the picture of a fool.
                  "Come, ye hirplin' gaberlunzie, to Captain Saunders: he's the chiel that'll
                     make ye glow'r. Hech, sirs! but ye'll tell him where ye come frae last," said
                     the Scotchman, laying his hand on Dennis Byrne's ragged collar and leading him
                     into John Halloran's library, where Captain Saunders with one or two of his
                     officers was at breakfast. He was a man past middle age, with the harsh
                     physiognomy of his nation;*
                      his hair was crisp and gray, cut as close to his head as a
                     Covenanter's, while his small, keen gray eyes were almost hidden by the shaggy,
                     black brows which overhung them.
                  
                     
                     *It is said that the Scotch officers and soldiers, greatly to their honor,
                        at this period in Ireland, behaved like men from whose bosom humanity had
                        not taken flight.
                  
                  "Now, I rede ye, speak the truth," whispered the sergeant to Dennis, after he
                     had paused for an instant, bolt upright, to make a military salute to his
                     commanding officer.
                  "Who are you?" asked Captain Saunders, after hearing his subordinate's
                     report.
                  "Only a poor innocent baccah man, beggin'
                     here an' there a crust an' a bone, yer honor," replied Dennis, composedly.
                  "And do you know the premises you are on? That I could imprison you, transport
                     you, for daring to put your foot on these grounds without authority? Oh, you
                     are a douse laddie, my ragged freend!" said Captain Saunders.
                  "Christ pardon an' save uz, an' where am I at all, thin? yer worship axes me;
                     an' surely it's I ought to be axin' you where I be, seein' you're here, an' I,
                     a poor baccah lad, wid his staff an' bag, jest from de hills of Tipperary,"
                     replied Dennis.
                  
                  "The devil you are!" exclaimed the captain, excited by this piece of news; "and
                     pray what were you after in that Gehenna?"
                  "Is dat a Shanghai, sir? My grannie had lots o' hins, but I niver h'ard her
                     mintion any sich breed as dat," said Dennis, looking perfectly innocent, while
                     the young officers, angry, but amused, endeavored to suppress a laugh.
                  "I say, rascal, what business had ye in Tipperary?" roared Captain
                     Saunders.
                  "I dunno, yer honor. I h'ard I was born dare; but, bein' a poor orphin, I can't
                     swear to de fact, and be rayson of me beravement, for I was a destitute orphin,
                     yer honor, I had to take de wallet on me shoulder, and ax de hospitality of me
                     neighbors an' the counthry peoples; but, save us, sirs! I'm druv off me ould
                     bate intirely by de sogering an' fighting dat's goin' on, sure. Betune de
                     sogers an' de rebels, I bin almost murthered intirely; de sogers takin' me for
                     a rebel, an' de rebels takin' me for a divil of a informer; an', yer honor, I
                     was glad to git out of it intirely," said Dennis, with an emphasis and strength
                     of brogue which was deafening even to Scotch ears.
                  "Gude's sake, mon, ye deserve hanging for the thud
                     *
                      and claver ye make. Can't ye speak the Queen's English?" exclaimed
                     Captain Saunders, about the corners of whose eyes might be seen an incipient
                     wrinkle of mirth.
                  
                     
                     *Confused noise.
                  
                  "Lord's sake, sir! Can yer honor spake in de grand ould Celtic diction, dat I
                     bin used to all my born days? If you can do dat, sir, I'm at your sarvice from
                     mornin' till night: me tongue gets on de right groove den, sir, an' runs like a
                     stame-carridge; but de English is a furrin' lingo to me, an' my tongue goes
                     blunderin' over de brogue of it, till I don't 'zactly know what I says
                     myself."
                  "No; and I'm glad I don't, you pawkey," said
                     Captain Saunders. "Here, Jock Hazel, search this fellow. He's more knave than
                     fool, in my opinion."
                  And without ceremony they proceeded to search the person of Dennis. They tore
                     away the shreds of lining from his ragged hat, looked under the borrowed and
                     rusty old wig he wore, emptied his wallet, and poked carefully among the bones
                     and crusts which were scattered on the floor. They divested him of his coat,
                     shoes, and stockings; in fact, the inquisition extended from his head to his
                     heels, leaving none of his tattered garments unexplored. But of course they
                     found nothing, except the dark, glossy curl of John Halloran's hair, which
                     Captain Saunders held carefully, yet cautiously, between his forefinger and
                     thumb, while the investigation proceeded. Concluding their fruitless search,
                     they gave him permission to put on his clothes; when Captain Saunders
                     said,—
                  "I am not yet satisfied, you vagabond, but that you're a rebel."
                  "Me!—ullalu—Chorp an
                        daoul! Me!" shouted Dennis, with a wild look of assumed
                     terror.
                  "Yes; and you are my prisoner, until I am satisfied that you are a leal subject
                     of her majesty's. If you attempt to leave the grounds of this—eh—ah—Glendariff,
                     you'll find a bullet in your head before you know what you're after."
                  "An' may I stay, yer honor, undher yer lordship's purtiction?" exclaimed
                     Dennis, apparently overjoyed; "an' can I have a little clane straw to slape on,
                     an' a sup to ate? An' will yer honor be afther givin' a poor, disolate orphin
                     dat bit o' hair betune yer fingers?"
                  "For what? Whose hair is it? I suspect, if this hair could talk it would tell tales. It is strangely
                     like the hair of that portrait in the drawing-room, Donald," said Captain
                     Saunders, addressing one of the officers.
                  "Dher chorp agus manim!"*
                      exclaimed Dennis; "an' thin yer honor's eyes desave you intirely; for
                     dat hair belonged to a cousin's husband of me own, dat died wid de small-pox
                     last Whi'suntide."
                  
                     
                     *By my soul and body.
                  
                  In an instant the dark curl was lying at Dennis Byrne's feet, while, half wild
                     with the dread of contagion, Captain Saunders vociferously ordered him out of
                     the house, and called for brandy, camphor, and vinegar. Glad to escape, Dennis
                     snatched up the precious hair, and, again thrusting it into his bosom, was led
                     under guard to the kitchen, where Nora, with her back to the door, was bending
                     over some fine article of dress she was ironing.
                  "Mistress," said the soldier, "here's a fellow you'll be gude enough to take
                     care of: he's a sonsie-looking chiel, an' nae doot he'll have your wits in a
                     creel afore night."
                  Poor Dennis! This was the most anxious moment of all. Suppose Nora should turn
                     suddenly and exhibit an emotion which would betray all? But, brave Nora, she
                     was not one to break down in that way. She raised herself up, and looked at
                     both; she recognized her sweet-heart at a glance, but, except the quickened and
                     joyous throbbing at her heart, she was quite calm.
                  "And what is it I'm to do with him?" she asked, scornfully.
                  "He's to be fed and housed,—that's the order, lassie. He's a prisoner," said
                     the Scotchman, laughing.
                  "It's well for them that's made so many beggars to have 'em fed. It's an ould
                     game, well understood in Ireland, robbing Peter to pay Paul. What do you want?"
                     she said, turning her eyes full on Dennis Byrne.
                  "Why, ma'am," he whimpered, "I'm a poor orphin from Tipperary hills, an' 'ud
                     like a bowl o' stirabout, an' a rasher, an' a mug o' ale or whisky, an' a could
                     fowl, if you has de likes of it by you."
                  "I shall have to set the table for the gentleman from Tipperary," she said,
                     with a light, merry laugh. "Perhaps yer honor'll take a bit of venison, and
                     some bottled sherry?"
                  "Anything your ladyship plazes!"
                  "If I was a man, I'd shake you to smithereens," said Nora, bustling around, while Sergeant Hazel,
                     with a laugh, wished her good luck of the bargain he had brought her, and went
                     away. Neither of them uttered a word until he was out of hearing; for he was
                     too good a soldier to go out of sight.
                  "Nora dear!"
                  "Thanks be to God, Dennis Byrne, that you're back in safety."
                  Both spoke in Irish. "Did you see him, Dennis?"
                  "I did. I saw him, and think he is safe."
                  "Oh, thanks be to God!" exclaimed Nora, while tears flowed over her cheeks.
                     "Now tell me about it, dear." He told her. "Oh, how glad this news will make
                     the broken heart in there! Dennis, she's been drooping like a flower when the
                     first bitter wind from the Reek blows on it; but, oh, Dennis Byrne, there's
                     worse news for you to hear yet!"
                  "What?" he asked, while his cheek paled.
                  "The lady and her children are poor,—so poor,—so very poor, Dennis. You and I,
                     with our strong arms and stout hearts, is richer than they," said Nora, with a
                     short sob. "Glendariff is theirs no longer."
                  "Not theirs? Whose then, in the name of the world, is it?"
                  
                  "And who but Donald Dhu More, the vile informer, that's a disgrace to his
                     blood, his name, and his country,—who but he is master now at Glendariff? He
                     wasn't like a hound at Mister Halloran's heels for nothing."
                  "I wish I could put my heel on the murdering villain's neck! for, by my soul,
                     I'd scorn to touch him with my hand," said Dennis, bitterly.
                  All this time, and it was not long, Nora was getting a meal together for the
                     beggar-man, and the soldier from his post watched them narrowly.
                  "When you put that plate down beside me, a suillish
                        mahuil agus machree,
                     *
                      take up the lock of hair I'll put down. It's his. Take it to Mrs.
                     Halloran, and give it to her with his love, and tell her he's safe, and by this
                     time is across the sea."
                        
                        *Light of my eyes and heart.
                     
                  Nora did as she was directed, with great dexterity, and thrust it into her
                     pocket just as Sergeant Hazel came into the kitchen, ostensibly for a drink of
                     water, but in reality to see what was going on.
                  "An' now, you pittiogue," broke out Nora,
                     "there's a dinner for a king; and if you're a good Christian you'll thank God
                     for it. And you're welcome in His holy name. Could you stop a minit, sir?" she
                     said to the sergeant. "I must run up and see what Mrs. Halloran wants: may-be
                     it's a dish of tay, poor lady: she didn't ate a morsel to-day, by rayson of the
                     headache that's racking her, laving the heart-ache out of the bargain; an'
                     there's heaps of silver laying about on the dressers, spoons and the like, that
                     it would be easy to slip in a wallet like this."
                  Dennis Byrne's honest, handsome face flushed crimson. He could pretend to be a
                     fool, a rebel, and a wandering beggar; but, when it came to thief,
                     he could scarcely hold his peace. But he did, right manfully, and Nora, with a
                     mischievous twinkle in her eyes, ran up to cheer Mrs. Halloran with the tidings
                     she had to impart.
                  She was lying on her couch,—the same low couch that her husband had left her
                     sleeping on, the night of his departure. She was very pale and still. She had
                     shed but few tears, and exhibited scarcely any emotion. Father McCarthy had
                     seen her every day; but even he could not rouse her from the passive heaviness
                     of her grief. The delicate bloom had waned and faded entirely from her
                     beautiful face, her eyes had grown larger and brighter, and her fingers were
                     ever in motion, tapping on the back of a book, or writhing and twisting around
                     each other, or tearing to shreds, scraps of paper and the flowers that little
                     Gracie brought her every day. She never spoke unless some one addressed her,
                     but lay, the live-long day, silent, prostrated, and hopeless. Whenever the
                     little children came in and hung caressingly around her, she would kiss them
                     gently and send them away; and the innocent ones, awed into silence by her
                     strange mood, would slip away with noiseless steps, glad to go from the
                     darkened room out into the air and sunshine.
                  "How are you feeling now, maire ban
                     asthore,—my own dear loving lady?" said Nora, kneeling down beside
                     her, and taking up the long, slender hand to caress.
                  "Well,—well enough," she said, without unclosing her eyes.
                  "I have news,—good news," whispered Nora.
                  Mrs. Halloran started up, and, pushing back the long curls from her face, gazed
                     wildly at Nora, then, letting her hand fall heavily on the girl's shoulder,
                     whispered, "Is it real, or am I dreaming? I have had so many dreams like
                     this."
                  "It is no dream, asthore, but awake you are; and don't for the world's sake cry out, for fear them
                     that's on the watch will suspect us. Dennis Byrne's come back. He saw
                        him: he is well, and is by this time over the say."
                  "Escaped! Alive! Well!" gasped Mrs. Halloran. "My God, I thank thee. But is
                     there no message—no——"
                  "There is," said Nora, interrupting her while she took out the crisp, glossy
                     curl of hair. "He sent this to you with his heart's love; an' that is all I
                     know. We was watched all the time, an' it's all I could learn."
                  Mrs. Halloran laid the curl in the palm of her hand, and gazed fondly and
                     dreamily on it, then pressed it to her lips, her forehead, her bosom. "Oh,
                     John! my John! my husband!" she whispered; "my noble John!" Then a tear like a
                     single, heavy rain-drop fell on the dark hair, where it lay like a gem.
                  "Yes," said Nora, who saw that tear, and hoped it was the harbinger of others;
                     "for such a one as he to go wandering in a strange land,—may-be sick, and
                     anywise lonesome an' homeless!"
                  "Oh, my husband! why cannot I be with you in poverty and exile?" Then tears
                     began to flow more freely. "Where is he, Nora Brady?"
                  "I don't know, ma'am, only that Dennis Byrne seen him on Ballyhowry Mountain,
                     where he came to hide."
                  "Hide! John Halloran, the noblest and best of God's creatures, skulking like a
                     hunted beast!" cried Mrs. Halloran, while torrents of tears drenched her
                     cheeks.
                  Nora was satisfied. "The tears will do you good, dear lady," she said, "and in
                     a little while I will send poor Gracie and Desmond up. The childer's lost their
                     smiles and color, and goes moping around like orphans."
                  "Yes, send them up,—poor little ones!" said Mrs. Halloran. "But one word, Nora:
                     where is my cousin Donald?"
                  "Faith, ma'am, he's been away these four days. Mrs. Shea says he has gone to
                     Dublin; anywise, it's a good riddance."
                  "He's safe—my husband! my heart's own love,—safe!" said Mrs. Halloran, clasping
                     her hands together. "Angels of God guard and guide him! This news gives me
                     life. I defy all now, and, trusting in the providence of my Father in heaven,
                     I, His creature, will bear all in His holy name."
                  Ere long the sound of little feet outside and a timid knock on the door were
                     heard. Mrs. Halloran went with feeble steps to open it, and found the two
                     children standing, with a half-frightened look, on the threshold. She stooped
                     and kissed them tenderly, and, folding the little soft hands in hers, led them
                     to the couch, where, leaning against her pillows almost exhausted, she gathered
                     them to her bosom in a long, tender embrace. Desmond was a noble child. He was
                     now eight years old. His eyes were large and blue, his forehead bold and broad,
                     surmounted by a coronal of short, crisp, curling hair. His nose harmonized with
                     his other features, while his mouth, without losing the sweetness of childhood,
                     wore an expression of firmness and sweetness truly remarkable. Gracie was five
                     summers old. Her brown hair was smoothly braided back from her round, childish
                     forehead; her eyes were blue, and full of thought and gentleness, and her
                     complexion very fair and pure. But there was a deep, tranquil thoughtfulness in
                     the child's countenance, a tender grace and a calm repose in every movement,
                     which had gained for her throughout the demesne the sobriquet of "Little Lady." Her father used to call her
                        "Little Poet;" for not only would the fair and beautiful in
                     nature call forth sweet responses from the child's soul, but her language often
                     expressed the most exquisite ideas. A
                     bright star, a rainbow, a rich sunset, the singing of birds, the rustling of
                     leaves, and the odor of flowers, were the quiet raptures of a life which was
                     full of heaven.
                  Mrs. Halloran, while holding them in that warm embrace, spoke cheeringly to
                     them, asked them a thousand questions, which dispelled their timidity and soon
                     won them to smiles.
                  "But, mother," said Desmond, "where is my father? And what are these grim, ugly
                     soldiers doing at Glendariff? If I was a man, mother, I'd let them know what it
                     was to stay where they were not wanted. Why does not father come home?"
                  "He has gone a long journey, my boy. He has just sent his love to you; but you
                     must tell no one."
                  "Not tell that my father sent his love?—Oh, mother!"
                  "No, Desmond: you must not speak to any one except myself. Come always and talk
                     to me about him."
                  "Would they kill him, if I did?"
                  "They might. They are watching and waiting here for him, to put
                     him in prison, because he loved his country too well; but he is safe and far
                     away from them; but they must not know it yet."
                  "Mother! That is the reason they called me a little rebel the other day," cried
                     the boy, while indignant tears forced their way into his eyes.
                  "Yes. Now you will be careful, for dear father's sake, both of you?"
                  "Yes, mother."
                  "Yes, mamma," said soft-voiced little Gracie; "but I shall never, never see my
                     papa again."
                  "Child, do not say so," said Mrs. Halloran, holding her off, and looking
                     eagerly and anxiously to see if there were any signs of illness in her face;
                     but she could see none, and, kissing her tenderly, she sent them away until
                     evening. After that the child used to come every day to talk, in a low voice,
                     about her father, asking a thousand questions, while her quivering lips and
                     flushed cheeks betrayed how often her heart was full almost to agony.
                  Thus some weeks passed away, Dennis quite satisfied to be a prisoner of war at
                     Glendariff, and Mrs. Halloran and Nora thankful to have him near them. The
                     officers and soldiers were civil enough; and, except that they were rigorous in
                     all that appertained to their duty, they certainly inflicted no gratuitous
                     insults on the family. A message came to Mrs. Halloran one day,—Captain
                     Saunders's compliments, and a request that she would meet him in the
                     drawing-room on business. Agitated and excited, she scarcely knew why,—for she
                     imagined that she had drained the cup of her bitterest sorrows in the
                     separation from her husband,—she wrapped her shawl about her and went down. The
                     rugged Scotchman arose and saluted her with blunt courtesy, and wheeled a
                     large, softly cushioned chair nearer the fire for her use. He "hoped she was
                     well."
                  "Thank you, I am quite well," she replied, courteously.
                  "Madam," he said, in his broad Scotch accent, which we leave to the imagination
                     of the reader, "I hope—ahem—that what I have to say will not be quite
                     unexpected. At any rate, it is painful; but you understand that I am vowed to
                     military obedience and the like, and therefore am only the medium of those in
                     authority."
                  "Does it concern my husband, sir?" she broke in. "If it does, for God's sake
                     let me hear it, without a waste of words. Has Mr. Halloran fallen into the
                     hands of the government?"
                  "I fear—that is—ahem—I believe not, madam. There is a rumor that he has
                     escaped."
                  
                  "Thank God!" she ejaculated.
                  "But his estate, madam,—you know that in these unfortunate cases estates are
                     generally——"
                  "Confiscated, of course," she said, quietly.
                  "But here is a letter, madam, for you. It came from Dublin with my official
                     papers to-day, and will probably explain the thing more to your satisfaction
                     than I could do."Mrs. Halloran tore open the letter, and read:—
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 "MY DEAR COUSIN:—
                              
                              "The government, as a reward for services rendered, has been
                                 pleased to bestow on me a grant of the Glendariff estate. Do not,
                                 however, allow this to alter any of your plans, or cause you to
                                 leave until it is perfectly convenient. If I can serve you, command
                                 me.
                              
                                 "Your affectionate kinsman,
                                 DONALD MORE."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  "I understand the matter fully, now, sir," she said, calmly, but deadly pale.
                     "Mr. More is now the master of John Halloran's possessions."
                  "He is, madam."
                  "I presume he has been engaged in the honorable occupation of discovering and
                     denouncing from time to time those brave men who have proved how well they
                     loved their country by sacrificing everything for it. He has, Judas-like, sold
                     his honor, his kindred, his country, for gold; and, base as he is, England,
                     still more base, rewards him with honors and possessions. In short, Donald More
                     is an informer!" she said, with withering scorn.
                  Captain Saunders shrugged his shoulders, then handed her the official
                     documents, which corroborated all that her kinsman had written.
                  "Will you please to write, sir, and say that I shall leave Glendariff in two
                     days?"
                  "Madam," said the officer, touched with profound respect for grief borne with
                     such submissive dignity, "do not go. Make some arrangement with this man. He is
                     your kinsman."
                  "Never, sir! No consideration, although I am next to houseless, would induce me
                     to remain. There is a fragment of land on which stand a few scattered ruins,
                     bequeathed to me by ancestors, which cannot be alienated, to which I shall
                     retire. I thank you now for the consideration you have shown toward me and
                     mine. A different person might have added much bitterness to my sorrows.
                     Adieu!" said Mrs. Halloran, rising from the chair and retiring with dignity
                     from the apartment. Here her courage failed her, and for a few moments a storm
                     of indignation and grief shook her to the soul. When it passed away, she rang
                     for Nora, then, opening her cabinet and bureau, she began to wrap her jewels
                     and valuables in separate parcels.
                  "I am here, ma'am. Can I do anything for you?" said Nora, coming in. "But what
                     in the world's name are you afther, Mrs. Halloran?"
                  "Nora, listen, my friend: we are to leave Glendariff; it is ours no
                     longer."
                  "Sold, ma'am?" said Nora, choking back her tears.
                  "Sold! Yes. Sold for John Halloran's life; the purchase-money is paid in his
                     exile and the ruin of his family. My cousin, Donald More, is now master of
                     Glendariff," she said, bitterly.
                  "The black, murthering informer! May St. Patrick's curse rest on him!" cried
                     Nora. "It's just what I thought he'd do, so I did. I knowed he was
                     false-hearted to the core; and now he's robbed what's worse than the widdy, for whin a woman lays her
                     husband in a quiet grave, knowing his soul to be in the hands of a merciful
                     God, she knows that what's done is right an' best, an' not like he was druv out
                     into the wide world, without home or friends, in a strange land, laving his
                     wife an' children disolate an' broken-hearted, with a traitor to the fore to
                     rob an' rack-rent and prosecute his orphans. Ochone!" cried Nora, wringing her
                     hands. "It's a hard trial, maire ban asthore,
                     my darling, but there's a God above us, an' he hears me now," she said,
                     snatching Mrs. Halloran's crucifix from the oratory, and holding it up toward
                     heaven, "and the Blessed Virgin hears me say, on the cross of her dear Son,
                     that I'll spend the rest of my life for them that's been all to me, nor think
                     of me own until they come to their rights ag'in. Now rest aisy, Mary asthore:
                     you're not frindless; and what Nora Brady says, that she'll do."
                  "Nora! Nora! Why did you do it?" exclaimed Mrs. Halloran. "I cannot permit it.
                     Your life and happiness shall not be wasted because mine are. We have a home,—a
                     poor one, it is true,—where, by the sale of my jewels, we can live. The old
                     Abbey lands will shelter us and give us food. You shall come with me,—you and
                     Dennis Byrne."
                  "Dennis Byrne! of course Dennis will stay there; he can farm and do the likes;
                     but for me! I'm going to look for Mister Halloran the minit we hear he gets to
                     Ameriky, an' work—work my fingers off till there's a home there ready to bring
                     ye all together once more.—That's what I'm going to do; for
                     Ireland's no longer a place for the Irish, an' you an' the childer shall not
                     stay here like outcasts. When I do all I want to do, if I'm not too ould, an'
                     Dennis Byrne does not change his mind, we'll go before the priest."
                  "Let us begin to get ready to leave Glendariff. Tell Dennis and Mrs.
                     Shea——"
                  "Mrs. Shea, madam! Mrs. Shea will stay to keep house for the born villain
                     that's coming," cried Nora. "Oh, it was beautiful, sure, to see what cronies
                     they got to be, an' how polished she was with the sogers! Mrs. Shea,
                     indeed!"
                  "Well! well!" said Mrs. Halloran, wearily; "let us prepare to go."
                  "Of course we must, ma'am. I wish it was to-night, since Glendariff's no longer
                     in the family. My pride's up; an' if I only had Donald More here now, I'd make
                     his hair rise on his head with the harangue I'd give him."
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  
                     
                        
                           "I'm biddin' you a long farewell,
                           My Mary kind and true;
                           But I'll not forget YOU, darling,
                           In the land I'm going to,
                           They say there's bread and work for all,
                           And the sun shines always there;
                           But I'll not forget Old Ireland,
                           Were it fifty times as fair."
                        
                     
                  
                  THE next day a police-constable, attended by four subordinate officials, made
                     his appearance at Glendariff. "He had been sent down from Dublin," he informed
                     Captain Saunders, "by Donald More, Esq., to protect the property, and see that
                     nothing except Mrs. Halloran's personal effects were removed from
                     the house."
                  "You've come on a braw errand," said Captain Saunders, with bitter irony, "an'
                     one weel suited to such a hoodie craw. There na mickle to fear for yer
                     thrapple, as there's only a desolate ladye and twa bairnies to spend your valor
                     on. Yes, yes, your documents are all correct. You will have perfect indeemnity
                     for any audacity you may commit; but, I rede ye, no insult to the ladye. None
                     of us," and a burning spot glowed on the cheeks of the honest old
                     Scotchman,—"none of us were sent here to interfere with her."
                  The brutal countenance of the man expressed merely a blank and passing look of
                     amazement and annoyance. He evidently had not expected such a reception, and
                     could he have understood the meaning of that the old officer said, he would
                     have sent up to Dublin no favorable report of his loyalty. As it was, the cool
                     irony of his tone, and the uncourteous reception he gave him, stung him in such
                     a manner that, had he been with his equals or his inferiors, he would have
                     given vent to the rage which he now thought it most prudent to suppress.
                  "It's the law, captain; it's not ME, sir. It's the law. They might all go to
                     the devil, sir, headlong, if the law'd let 'em, an' I'd not put a jack-straw in
                     their way," he replied, sullenly. "But somebody must see this Mistress
                     Halloran, and read these documents to her."
                  "Come with me," said the old soldier, rising from his chair, and striding
                     through the hall toward the drawing-room, which he had seen Mrs. Halloran
                     enter, with her children, a short time before. He tapped lightly on the door,
                     which was opened by Desmond, who sprang back, and stood scowling at him, while
                     the veins in his forehead swelled out, and his clinched fists were extended
                     forward. Captain Saunders laid his large, brawny hand gently on the boy's head,
                     and passed in. Mrs. Halloran arose, with her accustomed grace and courtesy, to
                     receive him, although the appearance of a stranger with him evidently agitated
                     her. She was every instant expecting news from her husband, and if this was the
                     messenger who had come to tell her he was taken, she must die. So she thought;
                     and Captain Saunders, who read her fears in her pale, anxious countenance,
                     hastened to relieve them, by saying,—
                  "Do not be alarmed, madam. This gentleman, who is of the law, has only come
                     down from Dublin on a mere legal formula, which, I believe, is usual on such
                     occasions; and I, thinkin', perhaps, as you have—no, ahem—no friend near ye, took the liberty of breaking the
                     business to you."
                  "Thank you, from my soul, sir," replied Mrs. Halloran, with a grateful look,
                     and inexpressibly relieved. "What is your business with me, sir?"
                  "I was sent down, ma'am, from Dublin, by Donald More, Esq."
                  "To drive me from the shelter of my own roof," she said, in a calm but bitter
                     tone. "It were a needless precaution, however. I shall leave, as I intended, in
                     the morning. It being his, even though unjustly, would be sufficient to drive
                     me from it, if I had no other shelter than those ruins below us, or the
                     fastnesses of the hills."
                  "Madam, this relates to the graith and effects belonging to yoursel'. Look over
                     the in—the precious document: hand it to Mrs. Halloran, sir," said Captain
                     Saunders.
                  "I don't know that it will be strictly accordin' to law, sir."
                  "It will. Mrs. Halloran, glance over it. It's nae a fletterin' document, I'll
                     admit; but may-be the sooner it's ower the better," said Captain Saunders,
                     passing the unfolded parchment from the constable's hands to hers.
                  Her eyes ran rapidly over it. A red spot was soon kindled on each pale cheek,
                     her lips were firmly compressed, and he saw, by the fluttering of the lace on
                     her bosom, how wildly her heart was throbbing, and knew how sharp and deep the
                     blow had struck home. He pitied her. He thought of his own fair daughters in
                     the quiet vale of Kinloch; and had he dared, could he have done it without
                     disloyalty, he would have made her wrongs his own. After she had read it to the
                     last word, she refolded the parchment, handed it back to the man, and, turning
                     to Captain Saunders, said,—
                  "The treachery of friends and kinsmen is harder to bear than injuries received
                     from strangers. My personal effects are not numerous, and, if my necessities
                     were not so great, I would make Donald More a free gift of them, along with the
                     rest I brought John Halloran, still the noblest and best of men, though now
                     outlawed and called rebel, for that which, had it been successful, would have
                     ranked him among the world's best heroes. I brought him but little, except my
                     love and an undying trust in the purity of his character. That no
                     tyranny can rob me of. Have no fears, therefore, for yourself and your
                     employer. I shall give you a list of the effects belonging to me;
                        he will know whether it is correct, and if I am entitled to
                     them. When you receive his reply, they can be forwarded to me."
                  "But see here, madam; look at this clause. It will save you trouble, and me
                     time," said the official. "Here: it reads, 'Mrs. Halloran knows what articles
                     to remove, and will retain only such articles as she is entitled to by
                     possession prior to her marriage with John Halloran.'"
                  "That is clear enough, madam; and, if an old soldier may advise you, take
                     advantage of it, without giving yourself mair trouble."
                  "Thank you. That will do," she said, bowing to the police-constable. Then her
                     face drooped down in her long, slender hand, and she was silent and lost in
                     thought. The official left the drawing-room, and the closing door roused her.
                     "Pardon me," she said to the old officer, who had been regarding her with deep
                     interest; "these things come on me like tempests to an uncaged bird. I have had
                     but few cares, and but little to think of except my own happiness, since my
                     marriage with John Halloran. But there is one question I must ask, Captain
                     Saunders. I presume, sir, on your goodness and unexpected friendship, to beg
                     you, as a last favor, to tell me if
                     any news has come of the—of—John Halloran, my husband."
                  "Madam, I do not know," said Captain Saunders, speaking with the broad accent
                     which made his phraseology almost unintelligible whenever he was excited by any
                     unusual emotion, "that what I have to tell will involve any principle of duty,
                     under existing circumstances. Rumor has made public all I know,
                     and, as our plans are all frustrated regarding him, it will do no harm for you
                     to know that he is either in France or on his way to America."
                  "Thank God!" she exclaimed, fervently; "thank God! Oh, sir, if you knew John
                     Halloran, you would not grudge him his liberty."
                  "Madam, whatever I may feel for you, I have no sympathy with rebels," outspoke
                     the Scotchman.
                  "That's what he called me! that's what he called me, mamma! How dare you call
                        my father a rebel, you base English soldier? He's a thousand
                     times better than you are; and if he was here, he'd thrash you away from
                     Glendariff," most unexpectedly shouted Desmond.
                  "Desmond, my boy!" exclaimed Mrs. Halloran, drawing him, flushed and
                     struggling, to her bosom.
                  "You are a bold little rebel," said Captain Saunders, laughing, and trying to
                     lay his hand on the brown, curly head, which still lifted itself defiantly
                     toward him. "It would be safe to get you out of the country, before you begin
                     to give our gracious queen trouble. Madam, I must leave you. I wish you well;
                     and if my presence at Glendariff has in any way inconvenienced or distressed
                     you, I hope that the fact of its being involuntary on my part will excuse
                     me."
                  Mrs. Halloran frankly held out her hand, saying, "I only thank the kind
                     Providence that led you hither. You have been a friend and protector in these
                     sore trials. Had another person been sent to Glendariff, my misery might have
                     been aggravated. But I must say farewell. In the morning I shall leave this
                     place forever."
                  It did not require much time and labor to select and pack the effects Mary
                     Halloran intended to have removed to Fada-Brae Abbey. Some antique pieces of
                     furniture, beds, and household linen, a few odd old silver vessels of the time
                     of Cormac, her husband's portrait, and three or four copper utensils for
                     kitchen use, all of which had belonged to her mother, or herself, before her
                     marriage, and most of which had descended through many generations to her
                     possession, she took. Her jewels and rich clothing, which she never expected to
                     adorn herself with again, she reserved for such contingencies as poverty might
                     disclose, to turn, as occasion might require, into the available means of
                     living. The rest, those rich and beautiful things which the exquisite and
                     elegant taste of John Halloran had gathered around her, and which were, every
                     one, consecrated by some cherished association, she left, or rather abandoned,
                     because in the ruined place she was going to she knew there was scarcely a
                     habitable room, and that everything superfluous would embarrass and
                     inconvenience her. "He will scarcely sell or send them away," she thought, as
                     she wandered through the house that night, lingering beside each precious
                     memento of brighter days: "here they are safe, and I shall love to come in
                     fancy, and people these rooms again with the familiar faces which have always
                     been here, and think of everything being as he left it and as I
                     saw it last."
                  Mrs. Shea, as Nora had predicted, remained at Glendariff, and it was difficult
                     to discover whether it was from motives of self-interest or really, as she
                     said, "to kape her eyes on her master's property, that that thief of the world, Donald Dhu, had got his
                     clutch on, but wouldn't hould it long, if dhrames was to be believed. So cheer up, Mistress Halloran,
                     honey, an' don't let a could thought of me come into yer gintle heart. God
                     knows, I'd rayther go; but if I do, who'll take care of yer own till ye come
                     back again?"
                  Mrs. Shea wept abundantly, and exhibited the most genuine emotions of grief,
                     which were quite satisfactory to all except Nora Brady, who said nothing, but
                     looked sideways, and turned the end of her pretty retroussé nose a little more toward the zenith than nature
                     intended. The baccah man, with his snuff-colored wig and ragged garments, had
                     suddenly disappeared; and when the cars came up from Kildare to take Mrs.
                     Halloran's effects to the distant glen of Agerlow, one of them was driven by a
                     stout, handsome young fellow, whom Nora called "Cousin Dennis," and who was
                     recognized by Captain Saunders's orderly as the blacksmith who had shod his
                     horse a few weeks before.
                  It is no wonder they did not recognize him as the lame beggar who had been
                     limping so many days about Glendariff, whose barbarous phraseology and idiotic
                     speeches made them entirely unsuspicious of his being any other than just what
                     he appeared, a harmless simpleton. It would be impossible to convey in mere
                     words the bitter anguish that surged through Mary Halloran's soul when she saw
                     the last glimpse of her home. It had been her Eden, but now, driven by
                     inexorable circumstances beyond its gates, the world appeared to her, as it had
                     done to our common mother, Eve, ages ago, when, driven from Paradise, she went
                     forth to a pilgrimage of bitterness and tears. In that hour of farewell, in
                     that little space of time, more earth-ties were broken and torn asunder than
                     sometimes happen in a long lifetime. The weight of years had seemed to fall
                     suddenly on her, and the world stood revealed in its bare mockery to her gaze.
                        Human hopes had been dashed like frail crystal vases to the
                     earth, and broken; human joys had sung their brief summer song, and fled. And
                     it is well, O merciful God, when the bleak tempests of life tear away from this
                     mortal existence its illusory charms; for even when the shadow is darkest, when
                     we falter and stumble in the gloom, we can see, through the clouds above us,
                     glimpses of that light which never fades, and which is Hope's beacon, smiling
                     and luring us to the land of eternal repose.
                  She said but little as they journeyed along. The struggle was a silent and
                     bitter one; but gradually the recollection of a merciful and overruling
                     Providence, the tender love of the Holy Virgin, and thoughts of these sorrows
                     being, like life, transitory, soothed her mind. Then came back the memory of
                     her little ones, and the devotion of Nora, to cheer her. These were deathless:
                     such love and such principles flowed only from God, and she felt that, even in
                     her desolation, there were rills of gladness, and a staff on which her weakness
                     might lean, which would blossom like the prophet's rod. And the mourner lifted
                     up her head, not rejoicing, but peaceful, and resigned to the will of her
                     Father in heaven.
                  Situated on a beautiful and picturesque hill-side which overhung the glen of
                     Agerlow, the ruins of the old feudal castle and abbey of Fada-Brae presented an
                     imposing spectacle from a distance. Had it been on the Rhine, painters,
                     tourists, and poets would have immortalized it; but here it was scarcely known
                     beyond the obscurity of the valley it overlooked, and the sketch-books of a few
                     antiquarians who had visited it more by chance than intention. And yet its
                     architectural beauties, some of which
                     remained intact, were wonderful, and vindicated eloquently the civilization and
                     perfection of science in the early ages of Ireland. There were the graceful
                     arches, the crusted marbles, the stupendous buttresses, the fantastic
                     gargoyles, the stained glass, which are only imitated in this our day, the
                     splendid architrave, the massive pillars, the groined roof, the rich
                     sculpture,—which time had mildewed, but not erased,—had broken and made ruins
                     of, but not destroyed the fragments, each one of which told a proud tale of
                     other days. And now to the ruined halls of their ancestors the last descendants
                     of the princely McCarthy Mores had come, seeking refuge and shelter. The fox
                     had made his hole, and the cony his burrow, and the owl her nest, in the
                     long-deserted ruins. There was scarcely a portion of them sheltered from the
                     weather. But in the old cloisters, once the holy retreat of saintly men, some
                     small apartments were discovered by Nora and Dennis, which in a short time were
                     rendered habitable, and in a few days Mrs. Halloran was comfortably situated,
                     and things around her began to wear a home-like and pleasant aspect. Dennis
                     exchanged some old silver for a cow and a few necessary farming-implements,
                     while Nora, after attending to Mrs. Halloran's comfort, arranged her kitchen
                     with the same faultless neatness that had always reigned in the one at
                     Glendariff, and privately instructed Ellen, the children's nurse, in the
                     mystery of cooking and getting up linen. As Nora was beginning to prepare for
                     her flight beyond the sea in her search after John Halloran, she was impatient,
                     in the single devotion of her honest heart, to commence her toils in the
                     far-off land she was going to, for which she would receive gold that would
                     purchase comforts, and perhaps a home, for those she loved. One day Dennis
                     Byrne came up from the market town with a letter for Mrs. Halloran. It was a
                     thick, heavy letter, but the direction was in Father McCarthy's handwriting.
                     Nora saw that, but, filled with a strange hope, she laid down her work and ran
                     in with it to Mrs. Halloran, who tore off the envelope, and found within a note
                     from Father McCarthy, and a letter from her husband. With a cry of joy, she
                     opened and read it. It was from Boston. He had arrived there in safety, and,
                     except that he was fatigued with the voyage, he was well, and expected to
                     obtain employment, which would enable him to provide a home, in the land of his
                     exile, for his family; but his movements were undecided, and he besought her to
                     remain in quiet and hope until she heard from him again. And then followed an
                     account of his adventures after Dennis Byrne had left him on Ballyhowry
                     Mountain; how, in the disguise of an old woman, he had got on board the
                     smuggler's craft, and had narrowly escaped an English cruiser in the Channel,
                     and been almost shipwrecked on the coast of France, after which his progress
                     was comparatively unobstructed by dangers or delays until he reached in safety
                     the shores of America. Then came a thousand expressions of endearment and
                     anxious solicitude; questions, and words of undying love, and messages of
                     affection to all, especially to his "little dove" Gracie, whom, he said, he
                     would give all the world just to fold one moment to his bosom. He thought of
                     Desmond, he said, as of a young eaglet, who would protect the nestlings at
                     home, who would be a brave, good boy until his father came back. He was ever
                     before him, with his flashing eyes and proud bearing, and it comforted him to
                     know that the boy had in him all the elements of strength necessary to the
                     formation of a great and good character. Nora and Dennis were named with
                     affection, and many were the grateful
                     messages that came to them; then followed words of cheer and full of hope. John
                     Halloran was throughout the letter. His goodness, his nobleness of soul, his
                     kind thoughts for all, were perceptible in every word, until the family at
                     Fada-Brae thought almost that he had been in their midst.
                  Father McCarthy's note informed Mrs. Halloran of his increasing infirmities,
                     and of a bad cold, which had confined him to his bed. Her sorrows weighed
                     heavily on him in his old age, but he trusted the letter he sent her would
                     cheer and comfort her. As soon as he could get about, she would see him; and
                     any letters she might wish to send to her husband she could inclose to him.
                  That night, as Mrs. Halloran was sitting alone by her sleeping children, Nora
                     came in quietly, and said she would like to speak to her, if it would not
                     interrupt her. Since the change in Mrs. Halloran's fortunes, instead of
                     behaving with greater familiarity, Nora had treated her with almost scrupulous
                     ceremony, and had impressed it on the minds of Dennis and Ellen that they must
                     never show, by word, or look, or act, their consciousness of the down fall of
                     the family, but must make up by their respect what was wanting in the rest of
                     the world toward her.
                  "To be sure, Nora dear," replied Mrs. Halloran. "Come in. I feel almost happy
                     to-night. Oh, Nora, God has been very good to me," said she, holding out her
                     hand, while her eyes filled with tears. Nora took the hand and folded it to her
                     bosom, then kissed it, and laid it tenderly down where it was resting when she
                     came in.
                  "Sit down, dear Nora; sit here, and tell me all you have to say."
                  "This will do, suillish machree," she said,
                     kneeling beside Mrs. Halloran, and laying her hand on hers. "I feel easier so;
                     for I can look right into the face of you."
                  "Well, as you please. Yours is like sunshine to me, Nora, always.
                     But what is the matter?—what do you wish?" said Mary Halloran, smoothing her
                     hand over the glossy black braids on Nora's forehead.
                  "Well, alanna! I'm thinking, now, that, if you can spare me, I'd better
                     go."
                  "Go! Nora Brady! Would you leave me?" exclaimed Mrs. Halloran.
                  "Let me tell you, mavourneen, how it is. It's
                     not for myself or my own interests that I'd be goin', but then as Misther
                     Halloran is gone over the seas to Amerikey, an' they say, he can never come
                     back again, and as the fine ould property's gone out of the family, and
                     although this is a grand and ancient place, it is poor, and will not support
                     the wants of a lady and two childer, that are highborn like yersel', I thought,
                     as I'm young an' strong, I'd better cross over to Amerikey too, and airn enough
                     to bring you there, where, please God, we'll all be together once more; an' if
                     we never see Ould Ireland again, we can be true to her in our hearts, and pray
                     for them that's left in it." Here tears gathered and flashed in Nora's fine
                     black eyes, while Mrs. Halloran, comprehending at once all her unselfish
                     devotion, fell forward on her neck weeping
                  "How can I spare you, Nora? Yet how to refuse you I cannot tell," at last said
                     Mrs. Halloran.
                  "Spare me, madam! Why, there's Ellen I've been drilling an' teaching until she
                     bates myself out entirely, and a faithful, good, quite girl she
                     is, and handy at everything; an' Dennis—why, Dennis can do anything he sets his
                     hands to, sure, an' willing enough he is now for me to go. Then, madam, there's
                     Misther Halloran, he might want some better friend by him than strangers if
                     he's sick or in trouble, an' I know I could do many a thing for him, if so be
                     he hasn't got a start yet—God save him."
                  
                  Mary Halloran was silent and thoughtful. Nora's last argument had almost
                     persuaded her. Still, she felt so dependent on her, and had been so accustomed
                     to seeing her about her, that, in view of the great uncertainty of the success
                     of her plan, she could not at once consent to it.
                  "America is a country of great extent, Nora. Suppose my husband should have
                     left Boston: you'd find yourself in a strange country, friendless and
                     unprotected," she suggested.
                  "Surely, ma'am, you ought to know by this time that I've a tongue in my head
                     and wits sharp enough to find him," said Nora, quickly.
                  "But it takes money!"
                  "Troth an' I know that; an' it's enough I've got to take me there, an' a little
                     over," she said.
                  "Nora, dear, you undertake a great deal. Do not let your affection for me and
                     mine mislead you. I confess, it would comfort me to know that you were near my
                     husband; but to send you forth into the wide, cold world—across the perilous
                     ocean—away from the shelter of my home, and from one who loves the earth you
                     tread on,—I cannot do it, Nora, even for John Halloran's sake."
                  "Then, ma'am, I must go without your consent, because I know, an' God knows,
                     that it will be well in the end. I am ready to go away in the morning."
                  "Oh, Nora! oh, Nora Brady! can I ever requite your love?" said Mrs. Halloran,
                     in a broken voice. "Since you will, may Heaven bless you; may good angels guide
                     and guard you. Go, and should you find my husband, give my heart's best love to
                     him. But I must write; there are some jewels I must send him to purchase
                     comforts with. Oh that I might go with you!"
                  That day week, Nora Brady was on her way, in the fine packet-ship "Fidelia," to
                     Boston.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  
                     
                        
                           "Her heart with love teeming, her eyes with smiles beaming,
                           What mortal could injure a blossom so rare?
                           Oh, Nora—dear Nora—the pride of Kildare!"
                        
                     
                  
                  NOTWITHSTANDING Nora's noble purpose,—the principle of right which governed
                     her, and the strong will which animated her impulses and
                     actions,—notwithstanding the bright and almost romantic hopes which had
                     impelled her to brave the perils of the deep and unknown trials in a strange
                     land, there were times when her heart almost failed her,—when memory led her
                     back to the sweet glen and the sunny braes of Agerlow, to deserted Glendariff,
                     and the fond hearts she had left behind her, and tears fell fast and warm. At
                     such times a decade of her rosary was her best comfort; her next was to go
                     among the poor emigrants who crowded the steerage of the "Fidelia," many of
                     whom were old and white-haired, to whom it had been a grievous trial to leave
                     the sod where their fathers slept in hope, to go away to die and be laid among
                     strangers. There were little children, also, who were sick and pining for fresh
                     air and nutritious food, to whom the pent-up atmosphere of the steerage was a
                     slow poison, and the undulating motion of the ship incomprehensible and
                     terrifying. Nora Brady was not one to stand idle in such scenes as these
                     wasting time and energies over the inevitable past and in vague fears for the
                     future. Her stores were abundant, and, had they been less so, she would have shared them with those
                     who needed aid. In the effort to cheer and strengthen others, she often
                     scattered the clouds which were gathering over her own heart, and filled it
                     with sunshine. She inspired the desponding with courage; she brought smiles to
                     the countenances of the old emigrants by singing the sweet, merry songs of
                     "home" to them. Her busy hands were never idle. She cleansed the
                     sleeping-places of the sick, and prepared food for those who were unable to
                     prepare it for themselves. The little ones hailed her coming with outstretched
                     hands or clamorous shouts; and in all that band of poor, heart-weary exiles
                     there was not one whom Nora Brady had not, in some way, served. And yet, if any
                     one had told her that her conduct was extraordinary, that she was performing
                     great and meritorious acts, she would have wondered how the performance of
                     apparent duties deserved remark or eulogy. God had endowed this noble creature
                     with the best instincts of humanity, which, nurtured by a living faith, made
                     her what she was. Yet Nora was not a saint. Nora was not highly educated. She
                     was ignorant of all those accomplishments so valued by the world: yet was Nora
                     a true heroine.
                  One afternoon a sad, listless feeling came over her, and, stealing away from
                     the group which surrounded her, she sought a retired and sheltered part of the
                     deck; and, seating herself on a coil of rope, she looked wistfully back,
                     through her tears, toward her own beautiful isle,—the land of her birth and
                     love. The sun was setting, and far and near, over the crisp waves, shed a glory
                     of crimson and gold. In the silent and far distance a few white sails were
                     hovering like sea-birds, while all around the horizon, wherever she turned her
                     eyes, the heavens seemed bowed to the verge of the mighty sea. All else of the
                     world, except those broad, rolling billows, seemed curtained away from her
                     sight forever. The solemn and glorious deep above her, the restless and
                     fathomless sea beneath her, the wall of sunlit cloud and dim shadows around
                     her, it is not strange that an inexpressible feeling of awe possessed her.
                  "Holy Mother," thought Nora, "perhaps we've lost the way. How can it be that we
                     can ever find a country beyond there, where the sky itsel' is hangin' down like
                     a great wall? But surely I'm losin' the wits I was born with. The same curtain
                     is between me an' the dear ould land I left, and I cannot see it, though I know
                     it is there. An' so I reckon it is with heaven,—oh, I know it. We cannot see
                     it, but we know it's up there beyond our sight; that many stand on its bright
                     shore to wait and watch for our comin' to welcome us to our home. Heaven is a
                     beautiful thought! This life's a dim, stormy sea at best, an' it's a pleasant
                     thing to know there's a happy lan' beyond, where tears will be wiped from our
                     eyes forever." Then the rosary was slipped out, and a decade dropped for a
                     happy death, after which she returned to the group she had left with a cheerful
                     countenance and lighter heart.
                  A stress of rough weather occurred, which continued some days, and the hearts
                     of the bravest of those poor landsmen grew timid and fearful amidst the terrors
                     of the deep. The tossing of the ship, the straining of cordage, the wild
                     shrieks of the wind, kept them in fear of instant death while the storm
                     continued. Nora needed comfort now, for she was deadly sick and terrified
                     beyond measure,—not at the fear of death, but at the unearthly uproar and
                     frightful sounds which surrounded the ship. But at last the tempest lulled, the
                     clouds drifted away in huge masses, the wild surges, weary of their own fury,
                     grew calmer and more gentle, and at last the sun burst forth in all his
                     splendor, and, like an Eastern king throwing his jeweled robe over a rebellious chieftain, in
                     token of forgiveness for some dark revolt, now spread a mantle of sparkling
                     gold far and wide over the waves. Nora, pale and weak, crept from her berth,
                     and, throwing her cloak about her, slipped away from the others, and, seeking
                     her old place on deck, sat down to think of home, and have a good cry to
                     herself. A fear was on her heart that she should never again see those she
                     loved; that her search for Mr. Halloran would prove fruitless; that perhaps she
                     would sicken and die in the strange land she was going to. The inadequacy of
                     her resources to cope with the difficulties which lay in her way, now, for the
                     first time, presented itself. She could not see the hand which led her, or
                     penetrate the dim mist of the future, any more than she could see beyond the
                     horizon; and, feeling discouraged and out of heart, she thought the best thing
                     for her to do, if Mr. Halloran was not in Boston, would be to return home in
                     the "Fidelia."
                  Just then Nora was startled by a wild and agonized shriek, and, rushing
                     forward, saw a woman standing on the deck, with her eyes and arms uplifted,
                     almost frantic with terror. Several of the sailors ran to the spot, and those
                     of the emigrants who were on deck hastily joined the group. Looking up, she saw
                     a boy, some eight years old, clinging to the main-mast, above the last
                     cross-tree. To that dizzy height he had clambered, until now, in attempting to
                     return, he grew sick and giddy, and looked down with a wild and frightened
                     countenance. There was a clamor and shouting from the crowd below, which
                     bewildered and frightened the child still more, who every moment grew whiter
                     and weaker. Suddenly the captain of the ship appeared among the excited people.
                     He saw at a glance what was the matter, and, commanding instant silence,
                     inquired to whom the boy belonged, and what was his name.
                  "He is mine, sir, an' we calls him Patsy," said the poor mother, wringing her
                     hands.
                  "Don't look down, Patsy; look up," shouted the captain; "hold tight and look
                     aloft. Don't look down again, but feel your way with your feet. That's right.
                     Look up, and tell me how many stars you see through the sunshine. That's it.
                     Look aloft—look aloft, you young monkey, for your life!"
                  And so, cheering him and watching his perilous descent, keeping his keen eye
                     fixed on every movement, the captain stood brave and hopeful, while the silence
                     and suspense of those around him were so deep and intense that the very
                     shifting of the child's hands and feet on the ropes could be distinctly heard.
                     Lower and lower glanced the bare feet among the black and weather-stained
                     cordage, while the boy's hands, strained and bleeding, clung like the talons of
                     a bird to the tarred ropes, until he was just over their heads, or perhaps a
                     fathom higher.
                  "Fetch me some brandy and water and a rope-end," said the captain to his
                     steward.
                  They were brought immediately, and by this time the ambitious Patsy was almost
                     on deck. His mother was rushing forward, when the captain told her kindly to
                     stand aside for a moment. He grasped the unfortunate Patsy by his shoulder,
                     and, after making him swallow a few mouthfuls of brandy, laid the rope-end over
                     him seven or eight times, while the boy capered and danced like something
                     frantic.
                  "Now, Patsy, my dear, your circulation is restored, and you can go to your
                     mother. I don't think you'll attempt shortly to clamber up to the ship's
                     sky-scraper, my lad,—a place that no old sailor likes to go to unless there's a
                     dead calm."
                  Laughter and tears and congratulations mingled together gether over the still frightened child, who,
                     from that moment, became the darling of every sailor on board, and who, by the
                     time the ship reached Boston, was as expert and agile in climbing and going
                     aloft as a monkey.
                  This incident brought Nora's smiles back. It had been a good thing for her,
                     those warning words, "Look aloft; if you look down you'll fall." She determined
                     from that hour to "lock up" always; no matter how great the danger
                     and how dreary the storm, to "look aloft." And when the incorrigible Patsy told
                     her "how dizzy and sick he had felt on the main-mast, and how his fingers were
                     just slipping from their hold when the captain shouted to him to look up, and
                     how, as soon as he did look up, he felt strong and steady," she understood more
                     fully the necessity there was for evermore looking up.
                  At last the "Fidelia" was safely moored at her dock in Boston harbor, and Nora
                     felt truly that she was a stranger in a strange land. Friends were waiting on
                     the pier for many on board. The poorest emigrants had a welcome from kinsmen
                     who had sent out for them and now waited to receive them; but, in all the
                     crowd, no one thought of her; no eye met hers with a smile and tear; no rough,
                     honest hand grasped hers and bade her welcome. In all those ten thousand
                     dwellings no hearth-stone held a warm place for Nora. Not in all that city, or
                     in all the broad land, was there greeting or welcome for the stranger. It was
                     hard to bear; but Nora looked up, and was comforted. Her chest and other things
                     were gathered around her. The steward, who was a countryman of her own, knew of
                     some respectable people, friends of his, who took boarders, to whose house he
                     would conduct her as soon as he put himself in shore trim.
                  Thomas McGinnis and his wife received her most kindly, and she felt at once
                     that she had found friends. With a few boarders, a small grocery, and two cows,
                     they not only lived comfortably, but had saved money and purchased property,
                     affording another proof that, with equal opportunities, the Irish are as
                     thrifty as any people under the sun. Nora soon inquired if Thomas McGinnis had
                     heard of Mr. Halloran. That was the burden of her heart; and if "she could get
                     a single trace of him, she should feel that her efforts in behalf of those she
                     loved at home were not to be unavailing." So she said after she had told the
                     good man and his wife her story, or as much of it as it was necessary for them
                     to know. But no one there had heard of him, although, as Mr. McGinnis remarked,
                     "he might be there fifty times and he none the wiser. But I know of a place,
                     Miss Brady," he said, "where you'd be likely to hear something of the gentleman
                     you're seekin'."
                  "An' where is that, sir?" asked Nora, leaning forward, and speaking
                     earnestly.
                  "Why, bedad, it's at the 'Pilot' Office, where they get news from every part of
                     the known world, especially from the old land at home. There's nothing worth
                     knowing turns up, miss, that you don't see in the 'Pilot;' and Mr. Donahoe's a
                     man that's not ashamed of his country or his religion, but stands up boldly for
                     the interests of both; and as for Mr. Halloran, if he's been to Boston,
                        he'll be sure to know it. Our boy Willie's learnin' the art of
                     printin' at the 'Pilot' Office, and it 'ud be right handy for you to go and ask
                     a few questions yourself."
                  "When can I go?" asked Nora, full of hope.
                  "To-morrow, when Willie goes to work," replied honest Thomas McGinnis.
                  "And it'll be a good time, Miss Brady, dear, to be inquiring for the situation
                     you was speaking of," added his wife. "Many's the poor girl Mr. Donahoe's
                        befriended in that way. He's got
                     the warm side left for his countrymen, sure, an' never thinks of trouble when
                     he can do 'em a good turn."
                  With a light heart, Nora, neatly and becomingly attired, accompanied Willie
                     McGinnis to his place of business. When they arrived there, the town-clock
                     struck, and the boy, finding himself a half-hour behind the time, ushered her
                     into the handsome and spacious book-store of the "Pilot" Buildings, and ran
                     with all the speed he could to the printing-room. Nora felt abashed and
                     embarrassed at being so suddenly left to depend on her own resources, and stood
                     half frightened and undetermined whether to stay or go away and beg the favor
                     of Mr. McGinnis or his wife to come with her on the morrow. A number of persons
                     were passing in and out, and the clerks were occupied in packing books to be
                     sent away, or waiting on customers. At last one of the clerks observed her, and
                     asked her, politely, what she would have.
                  "I am waiting to see Mr. Donahoe, sir," she said, modestly.
                  "He is not in at present," replied the gentleman. "He is in another part of the
                     building, very busy with workmen who are putting up a new steam-power press.
                     Can you wait a little while?"
                  "If you please, sir."
                  "Sit down, then, and I'll tell him when he comes in," said the clerk, as he
                     hurried away to attend to his duties. Nora thanked him, and sat down; but one
                     hour passed, two, three; it was nearly twelve o'clock, and she still waited.
                     Every one who came in, she thought, must certainly be the publisher; but,
                     disappointed, she would watch them transact some light business, look over the
                     elegantly bound books, make purchases, and—go away. Fairly disheartened, she
                     felt that a good fit of crying would do her more good than anything else. She
                     did not know the way home, or she would have gone away. No one seemed to
                     observe her, or at least no one spoke to her, and she had just formed the
                     desperate resolution to address one of the clerks, when a quick, friendly voice
                     near her said, "Do you wish to see any one, my good girl?"
                  "I have been waiting to see Mr. Donahoe," she said, rising.
                  "I am he. What do you want?"
                  Nora, like most of her sex, was a physiognomist, and it only required a glance
                     at the friendly face before her, to feel reassured.
                  "I am very busy, and in a great hurry," he replied; "but tell me your
                     business."
                  And Nora Brady told her story. With tears in her eyes which she could not keep
                     back, and a low voice, whose sweetness was enriched by the slight brogue of her
                     speech, she opened her heart. The active, busy publisher, who even in
                     Yankee-land is noted for his energy and enterprise, was at first restless, and
                     looked at his watch; then he leaned forward and listened with deeper attention;
                     but when she mentioned the name of John Halloran he drew a chair beside her and
                     sat down, folding his arms, while the most eager interest was depicted on his
                     countenance. At last she brought her narrative to a close, by asking her hearer
                     "if he knew Mr. Halloran, or had heard of his being in Boston."
                  "You're a good girl, Nora Brady," said the publisher. "Of course I know John
                     Halloran, and have seen him too. He is my friend. He was my guest."
                  "Oh, then, sir, may God bless you for that word! I've got many things to tell
                     him in regard to them he's left behind him, and some jewels Mrs. Halloran sent
                     him, in case his money give out,"
                     exclaimed Nora, clasping her hands together. "And where is he now, your
                     honor?"
                  "I fear I cannot tell you that. Mr. Halloran left Boston two weeks ago. He went
                     to New York and remained there a few days, then left for the South."
                  Poor Nora! What a sudden darkness came over her faithful heart just at the very
                     instant that she thought all was brightest! Gone! Wandering! And she here with
                     messages from home for him, and means to aid him. "Why," thought Nora,—full of
                     rebellion to this trial, but only for a moment,—"why could not God, who knows
                     all things, keep him here?"
                  "Because, Nora, God designed to bring light out of darkness. It is His way. He
                     brings up the precious ore of holy virtues from the depths of the human heart
                     with hard blows. The gems most precious to Him are those which are cleansed
                     with tears. His ways are past finding out, Nora Brady; but they are all right:
                     so look up, and be comforted."
                  Thus whispered her guardian angel, who loved well the humble and pure-minded
                     one he was commissioned to guard and guide.
                  "Don't be distressed," said the publisher, after a moment's thought; "I will
                     put a line in the 'Pilot' next week, informing Mr. Halloran that letters have
                     arrived for him at this office. You must send me the letters. If he sees the
                     notice, we shall soon get some tidings of him. You're a good girl, Nora; and if
                     I can serve you I will."
                  "The Blessed Virgin have care of your soul, sir, and a thousand thanks for your
                     kindness to a stranger, but I should like to get a situation."
                  "What can you do?"
                  "I can turn my hand to anything, sir," she said, quietly; "but at home I mostly
                     cooked, an' got up linen."
                  "Very well. Persons very frequently come here to inquire about help, and I will
                     keep you in mind. Now you had better go. But where did you say you say
                     stopped?"
                  "With Willie McGinnis's mother, sir; the boy that's at work here."
                  "Do you know the way home?"
                  "I'm afraid not, sir: it's a long way."
                  "Stephen, send Willie McGinnis here," said the publisher to a porter who was
                     passing by at the moment. "Here, lad," he continued, when the boy, flushed and
                     expectant, came in; "go home with this young woman to show her the way, then
                     make a holiday for yourself the rest of the day."
                  Every morning Nora hoped that before night she should hear something from the
                     "Pilot" Office. She listened with strained and anxious ears, as evening closed
                     in, for Willie's footsteps; but day after day passed, and no message came, and
                     she began to think she was forgotten. She was sitting silent and sad one
                     evening in Mrs. McGinnis's snug little parlor, when Willie ran in, and,
                     throwing a slip of paper in her lap, hurried back to his supper. She turned it
                     toward the firelight, and read, "Nora Brady will hear of a respectable
                     situation by applying at Mrs. Sydney's, No. 62 Washington Place. No news of Mr.
                     Halloran"
                  "I dare not write home an' tell that," thought Nora, with a sigh. "No
                        news from Mr. Halloran! Oh, my Blessed Mother! for the sake of that
                     broken-hearted mother, an' the little ones belongin' to her, help me in this
                     strait."
                  Nora, guided by Mrs. McGinnis, who had to pass the place on her way to market,
                     went to Mrs. Sydney's as directed. It was a large, handsomely constructed
                     house, but wore a look of faded gentility which impressed every one with the
                     idea that its inmates had known better days. Mrs. Sydney sent for Nora to come into her
                     sitting-room, and received her kindly but with a scrutinizing glance. The lady
                     herself was old, and had a care-worn expression of countenance, and she was
                     dressed in mourning which had once been handsome, but was now rusty. Everything
                     was scrupulously clean and tidy everywhere.
                  "I suppose you bring recommendations?"
                  "Here is one, ma'am, from the only place I ever lived at," replied Nora,
                     handing her Mrs. Halloran's recommendation.
                  "Really, this speaks well for you, young woman," said the old lady, looking up
                     with a pleasant smile. "I should like to engage you; but before I do I must
                     give you to understand fully how you will be situated. Sit down there and
                     listen. In the first place, I have a negro cook, who will keep you in hot
                     water; besides which, I am compelled to take a few boarders, for I am not rich,
                     and you would have to accommodate yourself to their humors."
                  "I will endeavor to do right, ma'am; an' if, after doin' my part, it don't
                     suit, I can go away," said Nora, half terrified at the prospect.
                  "Of course you're a Papist?"
                  "A what, ma'am?" asked Nora, amazed, for she had never heard the word
                     before.
                  "A Romanist—a Catholic?"
                  "Oh, yes, ma'am, a Catholic surely," she replied, earnestly.
                  "Well, no need to be riled. We're all su'thing or other, and it's right, I
                     guess. I'm a Universalist, but never take it on myself to promulge my doctrines
                     to them that holds others. Only I've had helps that called themselves
                     Catholics, and said they confessed to the priest, and went to mass, and all
                     that, when, come to find out, they didn't go at all, but shindied round here
                     and there, visiting and frolicking, and neglecting my work; and I've come to
                     this p'int, that there's nothing worse in natur' than a bad Catholic. They're a
                     disgrace to their religion, and give them that's outside a mighty poor opinion
                     of it, too."
                  Nora listened with surprise and mortification, but said nothing.
                  "Now, I want you to tell me honestly, do you go to
                        confession?—do you go to your duties regular? for, you see, if
                     I've had bad ones, I've had good ones too, and I know the difference."
                  "It would seem like praisin' myself, ma'am, and, faith, I never had such
                     questions put to me before, because there was no need," replied Nora, with a
                     bewildered look; "but surely there's no power in the world could make me
                     neglect my religion."
                  "I hope not. It can't be a religion that's worth much, to be neglected and
                     scandalized by them that belongs to it. But, anyways, I want to tell you, if
                     you are a good faithful girl, you may go to confession every week, and fast
                     whenever you like, and go to mass on Sundays, and say your beads, and pray to
                     images, if it does you any good, whenever you choose——"
                  "I only go to confession once a month, ma'am, and never pray to images at all,"
                     interrupted Nora, quickly, while a merry smile dawned on her face, in spite of
                     her efforts to control it.
                  "La suz! Not pray to images! Well, it's none of my business if you did. But
                     there's another bother in your way. One of my lodgers is a very odd-tempered
                     old bachelor,—very rich and as stingy,—my!—He'll be forever
                     quarreling about his wood, and be in a snarl about his candle-ends, and scraps
                     of paper. I can promise you skrimmages enough with him, Nora, my girl."
                  
                  "And then, ma'am, he may have his skrimmagin' to hisself entirely, for I'd
                     scorn to waste or rack what didn't belong to me. Is that all, ma'am?"
                  "No. I keep only two helps,—Phillis and a white help; and there's work enough
                     to be done. She does the cooking and washing, and the other cleans house and
                     irons. I give her eight dollars per month; the other gets the same. Now, what
                     say you?"
                  "I can only try it, ma'am. I don't mind work. I've been used to it all my life.
                     I suppose I should find trials everywhere and in every situation: so, if you
                     please, I'll come in the morning, if that'll suit."
                  "In the morning, of course. Be here by six o'clock. I think we shall get on;
                     for, Nora, you look as if I shall be able to respect you. Your dress, so plain
                     and neat, everything so clean and tidy about you and suitable to a young woman
                     who has to earn her living, makes me think you have a great deal of
                     self-respect; and it's a good thing for everybody to have."
                  "In her new home, Nora Brady found that Mrs. Sydney had not exaggerated the
                     difficulties of the situation. In the first place, Mrs. Sydney herself was in a
                     continual fuss about Nora's religious practices, and her going to confession,
                     so that really, if she had been a bad Catholic, she could scarcely have fared
                     worse. Mrs. Sydney knew that her interest depended considerably on Nora's
                     religious sincerity and steady morals, and she determined that she should not
                        lapse into indifference through her neglect. It is the fashion
                     of that region to have an "eye to the main chance" in every particular and
                     phase of life, and Mrs. Sydney was like the rest: therefore she cherished
                     genuine piety in her help, after her own ideas. Then Mrs. Sydney was dreadfully
                     afraid of her black cook, Phillis, and would have inspired Nora with the same
                     terror, only Nora soon discovered that Phillis, with the keen instincts of her
                     class, knew very well who to show her airs to and who not. She was one of the
                     rescued-from-bondage ones, and had been made quite a heroine of, when she first
                     arrived at Boston, by the "Equal Rights and Southern Transportation Company,"
                     which not only tickled her vanity and self-love, but inspired her with an idea
                     that her friends, after all, were only poor white folks, to put themselves down
                     so with niggers; so she ate and drank at their expense, let them show her off,
                     and dress her, while she laughed in her sleeve, and was not much astonished to
                     find herself suddenly dropped when their ends were accomplished. She had been
                     in Mrs. Sydney's kitchen ever since, and presumed no little on having heard it
                     said so often that "all races were equal," and the black man as good as the
                     white. The insolence of the coarse and ignorant black woman, who regarded Nora
                     with no favor, because she saw at once how widely they differed, was a sore
                     trial; but after the high-spirited Irish girl had thrown out a few flashes from
                     her handsome black eyes, and told her, in a quiet but very firm way, not to
                     interfere with her, and had on several occasions helped her through no slight
                     difficulties in cooking, she behaved somewhat better. Nora did not waste; and
                     Phillis did. Nora was neat and tidy; Phillis was slovenly and careless. Nora
                     was even-tempered and cheerful; Phillis was like a volcano. Nora was close to
                     the interests of her employer; Phillis was wasteful and extravagant. Thus
                     between two beings so adverse in race, color, and morals there could be no
                     harmony or comfort. But Phillis could find no grounds of complaint against
                     Nora, and was annoyed and angry to discover that she felt, in spite of herself,
                     a degree of respect for her which she had not felt for any white person before, since she left "Ole
                     Virginny." Then came the old lodger,—one of the merchant princes of Boston,—who
                     snarled and scolded if his candles and fire were lit in good time, and stormed
                     and swore if they were not,—who split and counted out his own wood, and
                     measured the waste of his candles by sticking pins at regular distances in the
                     one he used. Nora had many a hearty cry to herself, but she had too much
                     self-respect to rebel against Mrs. Sydney's arrangements or authority, to
                     quarrel with one so much her inferior as the cook, or dispute with Mr. Mallow
                     about the disposal of his own goods. She knew that all positions have their
                     peculiar trials, and that wherever one goes he shall find the cross, and that
                     it was not by shifting and changing homes that she could win respectability or
                     confidence. Nora knew that human nature is the same everywhere, and, if she
                     fled from these disagreeable trials at Mrs. Sydney's, where really she found
                     much genuine, true kind-heartedness, she might fare worse elsewhere.
                  Several times she had inquired for news at the "Pilot" Office. She had written
                     hopefully and cheeringly to Mrs. Halloran, once, but told Dennis Byrne, in her
                     letter to him, how she was troubled, and inclosed two months' wages, which she
                     charged him to "use for the comfort of those he had the care of, but not for
                     the world let them know how it came." As yet she had received no reply, and the
                     light began to fade from her eye, and the crimson from her cheek. "Hope
                     deferred," blending with sometimes a feeling of home-sickness, gave poor Nora
                     many a thrae in her heart, and on two or
                     three occasions she thought she was dying, she felt so oppressed and heavy.
                  One evening, the eve of a great festival, she had asked permission and gone to
                     confession. It was bitterly cold. Snow lay deep in the streets, and a drizzling
                     mist of frozen snow and rain, lashed by an easterly wind which roared savagely
                     in from the bay, almost blinded those who encountered it. There were but few
                     persons abroad that evening. All who had homes were either there, or hastening
                     toward them. Nora drew her cloak closely about her, and, pulling her thick veil
                     over her face to protect it from the sleet, hurried homeward as rapidly as she
                     could through the banks and drifts of snow which were every instant
                     accumulating on the sidewalk. Her foot struck against something, and she
                     stooped down and picked up a tolerably large package, wrapped carefully, but
                     wet and muddy.
                  A furious blast of wind came howling up the street, a chimney fell not far off,
                     a quantity of slates from a roof came clattering down over her head, but fell
                     clear of her, and in the confusion and fright of the moment she thrust it into
                     her pocket, soaking wet as it was, and, nerving herself for a desperate
                     struggle with the storm, she at last succeeded in reaching home, faint and
                     exhausted with the cold. Forgetting entirely the bundle she found in the snow,
                     she changed her dress, and, as soon as her strength returned, she went about
                     her usual business, with no other concern than a fear that she should not be
                     able to get to church in the morning.
                  When she opened the door of Mr. Mallow's apartment, to go in and light his
                     fire, a scene presented itself to her which caused her to start back and pause.
                     Two candles were burning, one on the mantel, one on the floor. Everything in
                     the room was in the wildest disorder. Clothing was strewed here and there,
                     papers were scattered in every direction, his wardrobe-doors wide open, and the
                     bedclothes tossed in a heap together in the middle of the bed, while he sat
                     upright in his leather-backed chair,
                     as rigid and motionless as if he were dead. There was a strange glare in his
                     eyes, and Nora feared that he had become suddenly deranged.
                  "Are you ill, sir?" she asked, timidly.
                  "No," he growled.
                  "And what has tossed your room up, sir, so dreadful?" she asked.
                  "Be silent, girl! Is it any of your business? Let the room be. I tossed
                     it."
                  "Shall I light your fire, sir? it is very cold; and you have two candles
                     burning away."
                  "Two candles! I am mad! I am ruined! Put them out. I haven't a farthing to buy
                     another! No; I'll freeze."
                  "I'm afraid you're ill, sir," said Nora, extinguishing the candle on the floor.
                     "Let me call Mrs. Sydney."
                  "Call the police! send for the police! I've been robbed and am ruined," he
                     growled.
                  "Robbed, sir! Ruined, sir! Lord save an' defend us, but surely you're
                     mistaken," exclaimed Nora.
                  "Robbed, sir!" said the excited old man, mimicking her. "Ruined, sir! Yes,
                     robbed of ten thousand dollars. Now go away."
                  "God save us, an' surely that's a heavy loss," said Nora, with such genuine
                     pity and commiseration in her voice that he called her back.
                  "I believe you are sorry. Well, keep it all to yourself. I don't wish it spoken
                     of to any one in the house, for Mrs. Sydney would go off in a fit of fantods,
                     and by six o'clock to-morrow it would be in every paper in Boston, and
                     telegraphed from Maine to Georgia. The rogues put upon their guard would
                     escape, and I be left to resign myself to the loss as I best might. So hold
                     your tongue, if you can."
                  "I will, sir, if it will be any comfort to you," said Nora.
                  "I believe you. I trust you, because you have never wasted my candles or wood,
                     nor opened my wardrobe, nor inspected my pockets. Aha! I have a way of finding
                     these things out, but you're an honest girl, Nora; but it remains to be proved
                     whether or not you can hold your tongue."
                  "Thank you, sir," said Nora, leaving the strange old man to go down to arrange
                     the tea-table. "It's no wonder he's crazy. Ten thousand dollars! It's a great
                     sum, surely; an' I hope in my heart he'll find it ag'in."
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER VIII.
                  
                     
                        
                           "Sweet it would be once more to see
                           The earth where my fathers rest,
                           And to find a grave by the sounding wave
                           In homeland of the lovely west."
                        
                     
                  
                  MR. MALLOW'S heavy loss was kept a profound secret from Mrs. Sydney and her
                     family, who only observed that he had suddenly become more silent and
                     disagreeable than usual, and that his cheeks looked more sallow, while,
                     notwithstanding all his attempts to steady it, his hand shook nervously
                     whenever he lifted his cup or tumbler to his lips. But, well acquainted with
                     the peculiarities of his rasping, unhappy temper, they supposed that he had
                     failed in some speculation, or had met with something in his extensive
                     business-operations to annoy him. But the detective police of Boston and Nora
                     Brady knew all about it. He engaged the skillful services of the detectives to
                     ferret out the misguided and criminal person who had robbed him. He furnished
                     them with a circumstantial description of the notes or bills and the wallet
                     which contained them. He supposed he was robbed between his place of business
                     and home. He was certain of having put the wallet in his breast-pocket before
                     he left his counting-room, and he had missed it the moment he reached his room.
                     This was all the information he could give them; but they had managed with
                     success more obscure and intricate cases than this, and, incited to
                     extraordinary efforts by the prospect of a liberal reward, their expectations
                     were sanguine.
                  Toward Nora Brady the strange old man's manner was fitful, but kind. He
                     frequently called her "a good honest girl," but steadily refused the necessary
                     comforts of lights or fire; while she, really sympathizing with him and feeling
                     sorry for his isolated loneliness, strove in every way she could to make him
                     comfortable; all of which sunk quietly down like soft dews into his sterile
                     heart, warming it with more human feeling than it had ever known before. When
                     Monday morning came, Nora was up with the dawn. She had an unusual number of
                     clothes to wash that week, and she wished to begin early, to avoid neglecting
                     her other work. Having gathered the household linen, and the few pieces
                     belonging to Mrs. Sydney, together, she unlocked the closet to take out some
                     articles belonging to herself to do up, when she observed, for the first time,
                     the soiled and muddy appearance of the nice mousselaine
                        de laine dress she had worn to confession the evening of the
                     storm. Mrs. Halloran had given it to her for a birthday-gift some months
                     before, and she felt pained to see it so soiled and, as she feared, ruined.
                  "Agh!" said Nora, taking it down from the peg on which it hung. "It is easy
                     enough to get the mud out with soap an' water, but my fear is that the
                     beautiful blue flowers an' these roses will come out along with it. But it
                     can't stay so; that's certain; an', to give it a chance, I'll shake it well,
                     then rub it between my two hands to see if I can clean it that way."
                  So, with the dress in her hand, she went round to the window, through which the
                     first red sunbeams were stealing; and, rubbing the dry mud off quite easily,
                     she gave it one good shake, when something fell with a heavy thud
                     to the floor, and, turning quickly, she looked down and saw the package she had picked up in the snow.
                     Nora laughed a low, merry laugh at her own forgetfulness, for she had never
                     thought of it until that moment, and took it up to examine it. "It's an ould
                     thing, anyway," she said, turning it over; "an ould, greasy, ragged budget, an'
                     if there's thread an' needles an' some snuff or tobacco in it, it's about as
                     much as it's worth. What in the world it is I don't know, an', faith, I'm
                     afeard to handle it; there's no tellin' the fingers that tied it up so tight,
                     or what disease was in 'em. Anyway, if it's anything worth having, it's none of
                     mine, an' I must see to that at once."
                  By this time Nora had unfastened the numerous strips of red tape which were
                     wrapped around it, and unclasped the steel fastenings; then it fell open in her
                     hands. A mortal paleness overspread her face, and she sank trembling in a chair
                     beside her, exclaiming, "Merciful God, defend me!" And well she might be
                     terror-stricken at first, for it was stuffed with bank-bills of various
                     denominations,—some old, some new, but all of high value. She touched them with
                     her fingers, lifting their edges carefully. "One thousand, two thousand, three,
                     four, five, six thousand! more—more and more!" she murmured, gazing with a
                     half-stupefied look on the treasure. There was a dimness in her sight, and a
                     strange singing in her ears. "Ho! lucky Nora! Now are your labors ended. You
                     have found a great treasure; your trials are past; you need toil no longer; you
                     can buy another Glendariff for those you so dearly love; and, best of all, you
                     can marry Dennis. Close up that wallet, you silly child; it is yours; you found
                     it; no one claims it. Use its contents and purchase happiness." Thus sang the
                     Tempter of her soul to poor bewildered Nora, who sat trembling and numb, still
                     gazing down on the bills, when suddenly a movement of her hand caused a
                     memorandum-leaf to move aside, and she saw, in almost effaced gilt letters, but
                     still very legible, the name of "STEADFAST MALLOW." In an instant the cloud
                     fled, and all was clear. A bright, happy smile flashed over her face, and,
                     falling on her knees, she thanked God in all the earnest simplicity of her
                     heart for the discovery. "I knew, my heavenly Father, that it was none of mine;
                     an' I wouldn't have held it an hour longer in my possession. I would have taken
                     it to the dear soggarth,
                     *
                      thy faithful servant, to be restored to its lawful owner, only thou
                     hast shown me what to do, for which I thank thee for ever an' ever." Then she
                     rose to her feet, and, holding the precious wallet close to her breast, as if
                     she feared it would fly away, ran with light and joyous steps down to Mr.
                     Mallow's door, where for an instant she hesitated; but, hearing a movement
                     within, she knew he was up, and knocked.
                  
                     
                     *Priest.
                  
                  "What now, Nora Brady?" he said, gruffly, as he opened the door.
                  "Oh, sir, here it is! Take it, in the name of God! I found it in the street the
                     night of the storm, and forgot all about it," she exclaimed, thrusting the
                     wallet into the astonished old man's hands, as he stood pale and trembling on
                     the threshold of his door. "It is yours, sir; your name is in it."
                  "Eh—mine—street—name!" he gasped out, while he clutched the wallet, and looked
                     wildly at Nora.
                  "You must have dropped it, sir, that night in the snow. I was coming from
                     church, an' stumbled against something, an' picked it up, an' it was this. But
                     faith, sir, the storm got so wild at that minute, and a chimney fell not far
                     off, an' the tiles come clatterin' over an' around me, so that it scared the
                     life out of me. I poked it down into
                     my pocket and run for my life, sir; an' by the time I got home, what with being
                     half frozen, an' out of breath, an' the scare I had, I never thought of the
                     thing again till this morn'. I took out my dress to wash to-day, an' shook it,
                     when out tumbled your wallet; an', when I opened it, sir, I declare to my old
                     shoes, I was half kilt with the fright to see such a power of money in the
                     hands of a poor girl like me; an' I'm as glad, Mr. Mallow, that you've got it
                     all safe again as if it was my own," said Nora, rapidly.
                  "Stop, stop. Go away until I count it. Of course it's mine, Nora Brady; but
                     it'll be a bad thing for you if a cent of it is missing," he said, while his
                     teeth chattered with cold, and his whole frame quivered with excitement. "I'll
                     ring for you presently."
                  Over and over again the old man counted the bills. He lit a candle; for the
                     light was dim in his room. Excited and confused, he put on two pairs of
                     spectacles, and turned the notes first on one side, then on the other. He
                     scrutinized the wallet inside and out; the mud-splotches still clinging to it,
                     and the stains of the sloppy place in which it had fallen. Then he counted the
                     money all over again.
                  "It's all here; every note. Not even a small gold piece gone. She's an honest
                     girl,—an honest, good girl. But she'll want a great reward, I'll warrant; more
                     than she'll get, that's certain."
                  He then rang his bell, which Nora answered directly, for some undefined fears
                     and uneasiness had begun to possess her mind.
                  "It's all right, Nora Brady. It's all here, just precisely as I put it in
                     myself the day I lost it. You are an honest girl. Some might suspect you; but I
                     don't, because you never wasted my wood and candles. Now tell me, what do you
                     expect me to give you?"
                  "Give me, sir? Nothing," she said.
                  "But of course you expect some reward?"
                  "Faith, then, sir, I'm paid enough to think it's with the right owner. You
                     dropped it, an' I picked it up; so it's yours, an' not mine; an' I'm only sorry
                     I didn't think of it at first, though to be sure I never dreamed what it was.
                     If I had, it would have saved you a deal of trouble, an' you might have had a
                     fire and candles all these cold nights that you've been without," said Nora,
                     with simplicity.
                  "And you wish no reward?" he asked.
                  "I wouldn't take a cent, sir, by way of being paid for doin' my duty, to save
                     me from beggin'. It wouldn't seem right; an' I won't do it."
                  "You're a fool, Nora,—a perfect fool. But remember, from this day, old miser
                     Mallow, as I am called, is your friend; and if at any time I can help you, I
                     will, so help me God!" said the old man, with quivering lips.
                  "Thank you, sir. A time may come for that. But breakfast's almost ready," she
                     said, going away.
                  "Halloo! come back here, you wild Irish jade,—come back."
                  "My work is all behind hand this morning: please to say quick what you want,"
                     she said, turning back.
                  "Leave me to speak of this matter to Mrs. Sydney. I don't like my affairs
                     gossiped about. If you were to tell it, some would believe you and some
                     wouldn't: so it's best to come from me, as I believe every word you have said.
                     And, mind, you may light me a fire to-night," he said.
                  "And a candle, sir!" said Nora, turning away with a light-hearted laugh.
                  After breakfast, Mr. Mallow had a long private conversation with Mrs. Sydney in
                     the parlor; and that same day,
                     without taking a human being into his confidence, he deposited five hundred
                     dollars in the Trenton Bank to the credit of Nora Brady. He paid the detectives
                     for the trouble and expense they had been at, and silenced their inquiries by
                     informing them that he had mislaid his wallet and unexpectedly found it. They
                     thought, as he was a very rich old man, such eccentric freaks were not only
                     allowable, but diverting, and gave themselves no further concern in the affair,
                     except to record the case as being disposed of.
                  Mrs. Sydney only spoke more gently and kindly to Nora after that long
                     conference with Mr. Mallow, and would frequently lay down her knitting and
                     sewing to take a long, earnest look at her, as she flitted around, through her
                     spectacles, which, whenever Nora observed it, always warmed the blushes on her
                     cheeks, because she could not imagine why she had so suddenly become an object
                     of such particular interest to the old lady, to whom she was becoming attached.
                     She was gradually winning friends. Her obliging disposition, her practical
                     piety, yes, the practical piety and virtue of an humble domestic, caused those
                     who lived in daily intercourse with her—persons who rejected the most essential
                     truths of religion; of whom some were transcendentalists, and others were
                     bitter and bigoted in their errors—to look with an eye of interest and respect
                     towards the old creed whose precepts her life illustrated with so much
                     simplicity and faith. Even Phillis, sticking her arms akimbo, and holding her
                     turbaned head back with a sagacious and patronizing air, allowed "she was a
                     good gal, an' not so good either that she was goin' to 'low anybody to trample
                     on her. She's done got me under, honey, an' how she's done it dis child's
                     onable to 'spress; case, you see, honey, she's sorter kind in her ways, an' a
                     sorter proud like; and, as to work, ki! she outwork me any day. I reckon she's
                     a good gal, if she are a Cafolic." Thus spoke the oracle of the kitchen.
                  "Dear suz," says Mrs. Sydney, "it's nothing that she pleases me; but to think
                     she's got around and made friends with such a high shiftless body as Phillis,
                     and such a tight person as Mr. Mallow, is beyond my comprehension. But she's a
                     good girl. She practices her religion, and is never ashamed to own up to being
                     a Catholic, and can always give a reasonable answer when she is asked questions
                     about her faith."
                  And Mrs. Sydney placed unlimited confidence in her. The poor old lady, who had
                     always borne her troubles and the annoyances of her position with patience now
                     obtained some rest, body and mind; for Nora could be trusted in every
                     particular; and the girl would have been quite happy but for those sad memories
                     of home, which came ever, like cold soughs of wind, over the hopeful and genial
                     world of her heart. It would have cheered her had she received a letter, or
                     even heard where Mr. Halloran was; but several months rolled by,
                     and she had not heard a word either from Ireland or of him. She had made other
                     remittances to Dennis for the general fund; and the thought that she was at
                     least aiding to keep away the wolf from the door of those she loved, gave her a
                     degree of happiness; then, when the shadows darkened around her, her firm and
                     loving trust in God would brighten the clouds, until the rainbow, Hope, shone
                     out, cheering her with visions of brighter and better days.
                  Mrs. McGinnis, her friend, had been ill, and, as frequently as she could
                     arrange her business so as to leave nothing undone, she had got permission to
                     go and help to nurse and watch with her; and every time she went, Mrs. Sydney
                     would place some little delicacy in her hand to tempt the appetite of her sick friend. One
                     night she was returning home from her mission of kindness, attended by Thomas
                     McGinnis, when, as they were passing through an obscure street, they saw three
                     or four men standing on a door-step, talking loudly and earnestly, while others
                     were passing in and out, men and women together.
                  "Is anything amiss, friends, with the widow Blake?" asked McGinnis.
                  "Och, the widdy's safe enough; but it's a gintleman that was passing, an' fell
                     down in a fit, an' we think he's dying," replied one of the men.
                  "An' have they brought a doctor yet?" asked Thomas.
                  "Two or three's gone for the docther, but there's none come yet; an', bedad,
                     it's my opinion that he'll die before one comes."
                  "Has any one brought a priest?"
                  "One of the boys went for his reverence; but it's likely he's not a Catholic,
                     but a pagan, like the rest of the people in Ameriky; for it bates Bannagher
                     itsel' to tell what they b'lieve and what they doesn't."
                  "Thrue enough for you; but there's no telling who the grace of God is with, and
                     who it isn't, in a dying hour. Anyway, I hope his reverence will come. I will
                     go for Dr. Bryant, if you will go in, Miss Brady, and sit with widow Blake,
                     who's a dacent, hard-working crayther as ever broke bread."
                  "Of course I'll wait, Mr. McGinnis, and see if I can be of some use, too,"
                     replied Nora, going into the house, and entering a small room which
                     communicated with another by an old-fashioned, narrow door. Two or three women
                     were sitting around, taking snuff, and suggesting to each other a thousand
                     infallible remedies for the sick person's relief, which in their own experience
                     had worked miracles. Mrs. Blake now bustled in to get the vinegar-cruet, and in
                     her hurry almost stumbled over Nora, who said, with a modest air, "I came with
                     Mr. McGinnis, ma'am. He is gone for the doctor, and I shall be glad if I can
                     help you at all."
                  "Well, I don't know about help,—poor gintleman! he's dying, I think. I wish to
                     God we could find his friends," said kind-hearted, fat Mrs. Blake, in a
                     distracted manner. "But come in, honey, an' see what you think."
                  Nora followed her with a timid step into the small, dingy room. On a bed in the
                     corner the sick man lay; but she could not see his face, or even his person,
                     because there were two or three women grouped around him, attracted by that
                     strange fascination which the appearance of death always presents to the
                     living. The atmosphere of the room was stifling from the heat of the stove and
                     the number of breaths in it, and Nora quietly opened the door and raised the
                     window a little way, then resumed her seat. A dip candle burned in a tin
                     candlestick, on a table which stood in a recess beside the chimney, and the
                     flickering shadows it cast on the wall, with the quick, gasping sobs of the
                     unconscious man, filled Nora's heart with a nameless terror; a weakness and
                     trembling came over her, and a strong desire, which is common under such
                     circumstances, took possession of her, to look on the sufferer's face. She
                     approached the bed and quietly waited until one of the women moved away, then
                     looked down on the white, convulsed features before her. Was she dreaming? Was
                     she bereft of her senses and subject to an illusion, that John Halloran's name
                     was blended with the low, sharp cry that burst from her lips? She flew across
                     the room, snatched up the candlestick and brought it to the bedside, and,
                     holding it close to the face of the dying man, scanned his features, and gently
                        lifted the dark, clustering
                     masses of hair back from his temples and forehead. "It is his blessed self,
                     thanks be to God!" she exclaimed, bursting into tears: "it is my poor master,
                     Mr. Halloran!"
                  At that moment McGinnis returned with Dr. Bryant, who was soon followed by a
                     clergyman; and words cannot paint the amazement of the whole party when they
                     learned that the unconscious man before them was the noble, the brave, the
                     beloved John Halloran, whom they had all loved without having ever seen. The
                     physician ordered the room to be cleared, and requested the clergyman and
                     Thomas McGinnis to remain and assist him. As to Nora, she knelt quietly in a
                     corner of the next room, pouring out her soul to God, and pleading earnestly
                     for the restoration of the stricken man, who was one of that band about whom
                     the tenacious fibers of her heart's warm love had been clinging for years.
                  And she felt that her Father in heaven would succor him.
                  She would now claim help from Mr. Mallow.
                  And she thanked God, and felt comforted that in the publisher who had so kindly
                     assisted her Mr. Halloran had a friend.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IX.
                  
                     
                        
                           "Oh, blessed be that warning, my child, thy sleep adorning,
                           For I know that the angels are whispering to thee;
                           And while they are keeping bright watch o'er thy sleeping,
                           Oh, pray to them sweetly, my baby, with me,
                           And say thou wouldst rather they'd watch o'er thy father;
                           For I know that the angels are whispering to thee."
                        
                     
                  
                  THE rich autumnal glories, the burnished shadows of golden sunlight, were over.
                     The thrush had sung her last song on the moss-covered turrets of the ruined
                     abbey of Fada-Brae, and a wild, cold wind had swept down from the Galties, like
                     an "army with banners," and torn away the few withered leaves which had been
                     left clinging, like human hopes to earthly promises, to the bare and gnarled
                     branches overhead. For two months no letter had come from Nora Brady, and,
                     heart-sick with anxiety, Mrs. Halloran had almost ceased hoping to hear from
                     her husband. Innumerable fears assailed her, and her imagination was filled
                     with anticipations of some terrible disaster having befallen him,—of
                     loneliness, illness, and perhaps death, in the land of the stranger. It is true
                     that the roads had been almost impassable for weeks, and there was no way of
                     sending to Buttevant unless Dennis Byrne walked there; and that was impossible,
                     on account of the frequent storms, the swollen streams, and the piled-up
                     snow-drifts. Many of her old friends and neighbors around Glendariff,
                     Protestants and Catholics, had made a day's journey to see her during the fine
                     autumnal weather, and had cheered her somewhat by their hearty sympathy and the
                        on-dits
                      of amusing or interesting news
                     which they imparted. They all knew Mary Halloran's poverty; but, not daring to
                     offer pecuniary assistance, which they were well assured her pride would
                     reject, their generous Celtic hearts suggested many modes of aiding her without
                     offending her sensitive delicacy; and many a hamper of game, wine and
                     delicacies of various kinds, found their way mysteriously into her larder,
                     which caused Dennis the full exercise of his ingenuity and imagination to
                     account for, by telling her plausible tales of wonderful purchases when he went
                     to Buttevant with butter and eggs; and it was edifying to observe his patience
                     when she gently reproved him for his extravagance.
                  "You know, Dennis, that we are poor, quite poor, now, and we must live
                     according to our means," said Mrs. Halloran, on one occasion. "It is no
                     disgrace to be poor, since our Lord Himself chose a life of poverty while He
                     was on earth; but it is disgraceful to go beyond our means and get others into
                     difficulties to support our pride."
                  "Bad scran, then, ma'am, to all the difficulties I'll ever bring any body into
                     by my extravagance. It's all ped for, sure; and it 'ud be a mortal shame for a
                     lady born and raised like yoursel' to suffer for delicacies and the like, that
                     you've been used to from your cradle. My things fetch a great price at
                     Buttevant and other places. Faith! and there's no butter sells like the Brae
                     butter, afther all."
                  "Thank you kindly, Dennis, for thinking of me; but we can do with less and more
                     common food. Do not purchase any more game or wine: we have enough to last a
                     year already," she said, with a half smile on her sad countenance.
                  "She'll have to know it afore long," said poor Dennis, as Mrs. Halloran went
                     away, while a puzzled expression settled on his countenance. "The blight is on
                     the potatoes: they're rotted black in the ground everywhere, and I've been
                     buying everything, until there's but little of my own left; and as to sellin'
                     off the ould McCarthy More siller and jewels, the few that's left, why, agra!
                     it's not to be done at all; for, as sure as God rules, they'll come to their
                     rights again." And between him and Ellen there was as much state kept up around
                     the wreck of Mary Halloran's fallen fortunes as if she had been a captive
                     queen. She was tended with a watchfulness and care, and all her wishes
                     anticipated with a fidelity, which can find no parallel under the sun,
                        out of Ireland. Dennis generally circulated around the table at
                     meal-time with an antique silver salver in his hand, and Ellen was as
                     scrupulous about the courses at dinner as if there had been a banquet, instead
                     of the too frequently poor meal of bread, cheese, and tea. The children were
                     daily drilled into the importance of using their silver forks and table-napkins
                     properly, and were in a fair way to believe that it was a much better thing to
                     be poor gentry than rich parvenues. They were never allowed to do anything for themselves
                     when either of their faithful guardians was present.
                  "It's not becomin', sir, or miss," Dennis would say, "for one of the ould stock
                     like yoursel' to be lettin' yoursel' down to do such a thing when there's
                     servants to the fore. Ye come of the ould princes of Munster, an' it's no use
                     to try and make yoursels like common people; because it ain't in human natur'
                     to do it. You might as well attempt to wash Major O'Grady's nagur coachman
                     white in the Suire. What God made us we is, an' not all divil informers, with
                     the English to help, can unmake it."
                  "And it's a true word ye've spoken, Denny," Ellen would chime in; "an' it's
                     just as hard to make a silk purse
                     out of a pig's ear, as it is to make real gentry out of them that hasn't got
                     the ould drop in their blood."
                  And through those sad, dim days when desolate winter lay around them, and the
                     vacant places in the household made a winter within, the star of hope waxed
                     dimmer in Mary Halloran's heart, and her steps grew feeble and slow, while
                     smiles became strangers to the face which had once seemed to be created for
                     them. The children, with their games and pictures, a pet rabbit, and a white
                     dove which a lady had brought to little Gracie, were quite happy. The heaven
                     abiding in the breasts of little children, makes all places alike to them, if
                     they have those with them whom they love. Ancestral homes, magnificent
                     furniture, and the appliances of wealth are but small things to these little
                     ones whom Jesus loved: they value them as lightly and wear the insignia of
                     wealth as loosely as should Christians of an older growth, who are directed to
                     little children as to their best example. The bright free air, the blue sky,
                     the glory of sunlight, the song of birds, the fragrance of flowers, enter
                     largely into the world of a child's happiness; and these Mary Halloran's
                     children had in precious abundance at Fada-Brae. Ere the winter set in, they
                     had lived out on the brae-side in the fresh air and sunshine, gazing down into
                     the beautiful glen below them, or beyond at the wild chain of mountains that
                     inclosed the valley, and in their glee wishing for wings to fly whithersoever
                     they pleased. Desmond brought into the closed-up dwelling them free glad spirit
                     that had made the hill-sides re-echo with his glee, and, like a winter flower,
                     cheered the silent ones around him. But Gracie was drooping. She was wasting.
                     The rose-tint faded from her cheeks, and she often complained of feeling tired;
                     but that was all: there was no fever or pain; and Mrs. Halloran hoped that it
                     was only the in-door confinement which affected her. One morning Desmond and
                     herself had been playing together, when she suddenly became silent, and sat
                     down in her little chair, and, folding her beautiful hands together, became
                     motionless and abstracted. It was her way whenever a new idea or thought was
                     suggested to her which she could not exactly solve. Her mother observed
                     her,—for, uneasy concerning her, she watched every movement,—but did not speak;
                     she only wondered what puzzled the "little lady," for she well knew that she
                     would come presently with her difficulties to her. While she sat thus, with her
                     blue eyes cast down in reverie, her dove flew down and nestled in her arms. She
                     kissed the gentle creature's head, and smoothed the snowy wings with her hands,
                     which were scarcely less white, and said,—
                  "Birdie, where do the flowers go to when winter comes? Tell me, Birdie. But, ah
                     me! what a pity you cannot talk, beautiful white Birdie! I shall have to ask my
                     mamma."
                  "What is it, little daughter?" said Mrs. Halloran.
                  "Mamma, can you tell me where the flowers hide themselves when the frost and
                     snows come? They don't die, for they come back in the very same places, in the
                     spring, that they were before: so they must creep away and hide—the cunning
                     little things!—in the earth." And she laughed at her own conceit.
                  "No; only the leaves die, dear one. The root, which holds the true life of the
                     flower, remains in the earth; and when the warm sunshine and the soft spring
                     rains come, it opens its bosom and sends forth the leaf and the flower again,"
                     said Mrs. Halloran, caressing the beautiful head which leaned on her bosom.
                  "And, mamma, would the flowers come out if the roots were not buried in the
                     earth? It seems cruel to leave the
                     poor roots out in the frozen earth all the winter."
                  "They must be buried in the earth, to bring forth flowers," said Mrs.
                     Halloran.
                  "Is that the reason," she asked, suddenly, "they laid Mary Flynn's little child
                     in the churchyard, mamma?"
                  "Little children who are laid in the earth, Gracie darling, are like the roots:
                     only their souls, which is the flower, bloom in heaven. They could not see God
                     without passing through death and the grave. Heaven is their spring and eternal
                     summer; God is their sunshine; and the earth holds their bodies until the great
                     day comes for all the world to be judged: then, little darling, those dear
                     innocent ones who sleep in the dust will arise, filled with new life and
                     brightness, never to know death again."
                  "And will they have wings like Birdie, mamma?"
                  "Yes,—soft, white wings, like Birdie."
                  "I wish I might be planted in the earth, mamma,—that I might awake in
                     heaven,—that I might have wings like my dear dove."
                  "My child!"
                  "Mamma, I would ask my heavenly Father to let me fly back again and watch
                     around my dear, dear papa, who is so far away. Oh, I know I shall never, never
                     see him again!" she said, while she threw herself on her mother's breast,
                     weeping.
                  "Oh, yes; we shall surely see him again. You must not think so; for it would
                     grieve him, because you are the dearest little birdie of his heart: so come,
                     let us sing something he used to love," said Mrs. Halloran, with a feeling of
                     indefinite dread in her heart as she uncovered her harp and ran her fingers
                     over the strings. The child leaned against her, and the entrancing music lured
                     her away from her strange mood, and, lifting up her sweet, tiny voice, she sang
                     smilingly the strains that used to ring through the happy home at Glendariff.
                     But the next day the "little lady" drooped, and often, leaning against her
                     mother, complained of being very tired: then day by day the bloom faded out of
                     her cheeks, and her footsteps became faltering and uncertain, and at last she
                     reclined on the lounge near the fire all the time, or sat in her little
                     cushioned chair beside her mother, silently caressing her white dove or
                     whispering to her doll. One morning Mrs. Halloran observed her leaning back on
                     the lounge, very pale. Alarmed, she caught her up to her bosom, and, folding
                     her arms about her, said,—
                  "What ails my darling? Tell me what hurts you."
                  "Only my head,—a little; and I feel so tired," she said, faintly.
                  "Only her head! Oh, Heaven!" said Mrs. Halloran, wildly. "Dennis! Ellen!
                     Desmond! come, some of you, instantly."
                  Dennis happened to be in the dining-room at the moment, and ran in.
                  "Gracie is very ill, Dennis; I fear the child is very ill; and I must have a
                     physician immediately," said Mrs. Halloran.
                  "I'll go right off at once, ma'am, for Dr. Ward. It's only a step from here to
                     his house; an' if he's not there I'll go over for Father Hanlon, who is as good
                     a doctor as any in the country. There's nothing like the soggarth, after all, for the sick," exclaimed
                     Dennis, hurrying away on his sad errand, heedless of the three miles of broken
                     and unfrequented road between Fada-Brae and Dr. Ward's place. The snow-drifts
                     and the steep slippery paths were nothing to that warm and generous heart: he
                     had loved the child from her babyhood, and was scarcely less distressed than
                     the mother at the idea of her being in danger.
                  
                  The doctor came toward evening; he examined the child's pulse, and looked at
                     her tongue; he talked cheeringly and in pleasant tones to her; but she was
                     languid and silent, making no complaint, except that her "head hurt her a
                     little,—not much."
                  "I fear," said the medical man, "that a slow fever is coming on; but in this
                     early stage there are many efficacious remedies for it. There's not much the
                     matter now, but I will leave some medicine, Mrs. Halloran, and call again
                     to-morrow. We'll have you well, pretty one, by the time the cuckoo sings."
                     Gracie smiled one of her quiet smiles, and held out her beautiful hand when the
                     doctor said good-by.
                  Now, fully aroused to a sense of the child's danger, and her maternal instincts
                     ever on the watch for the slightest change, other sorrows were forgotten. The
                     doctor came again and again; he changed the medicines, he alternated the
                     nourishment; but she faded and drooped, she wasted and grew paler every day.
                     With her mother's hand in hers, she would lie quiet for hours together.
                     Sometimes she would start with a happy smile from her fitful slumbers, saying,
                     "I thought papa was here." "I thought I had wings like Birdie's." Desmond,
                     anxious and sorrowful, crept in and out, and spoke in low, whispered tones,
                     when he brought her toys and pictures, hoping to interest her as of old; and if
                     he could win a single smile from her he was quite consoled and happy. Ellen
                     would sit down and tell her, over and over again, the fairy-tales she used to
                     hear with such delight, and saw in the kindling eyes and flushed checks of "her
                     baby," as she used to call her, a bright promise of her growing better. But
                     Dennis could find no comfort. Twenty times a day would he creep in and look at
                     her, then go out with noiseless steps, and say, "Inagh! sure she's fadin' like
                     a snowdrop drop. Ochone! but it'll be the heaviest news of all to Misther
                     Halloran! Glory to God! but surely our 'little lady' will be the fairest angel
                     of them all."
                  Father Hanlon came frequently to visit and comfort Mrs. Halloran; he spoke
                     words of consolation and sympathy to her; but in his heart he rejoiced that
                     another soul was about to be housed from life's tempests and evils, that
                     another one of the elect was about to pass away into eternal possessions; for
                     surely of the predestined are little children who die in their innocence.
                  Mrs. Halloran never left her side for an instant: day and night she watched
                     her, slumbering sometimes during the broken sleep of Gracie, but starting up at
                     the slightest movement. Her restless hands were ever busied about her, changing
                     her position, smoothing her pillow, with a thousand other nameless little cares
                     which maternal love suggested. She could not bear that any other one should
                     nurse her, so jealous was she of every moment that she lingered. But amidst it
                     all there was an unacknowledged hope that her ceaseless care and tender nursing
                     would bring her through; for the doctor still assured her there was not much
                     the matter.
                  "Open the window, mamma, by my bed," she asked, one evening.
                  The window was opened, and in flowed a gold and crimson flood of sunset. The
                     sky, like a "sea of fire," glowed behind the ragged and wild cliffs of the
                     Galties, and above, in the blue, silent depths, a few splendid cloudspots
                     floated. The child looked out long and thoughtfully; then, turning her full,
                     beautiful eyes on her mother's face, she said,—
                  "When I die, and go away up there, and have wings like Birdie's, can I see you
                     every day through these windows?"
                  
                  "Die! Oh, my child, why talk of dying? Do you wish to die?"
                  "Yes, ma'am."
                  "And not afraid, my own?"
                  "No, ma'am,—not afraid."
                  Then, as if an angel had whispered it, Mary Halloran knew that her child was
                     surely passing away from her; and, leaning her head down on the pillow, she
                     wept in silence. She already felt the glow from the fiery furnace into which
                     her bereaved heart was to be cast; she already tasted the bitterness of the cup
                     she was to drink.
                  The next day she sat watching and weeping. The child lay still, but breathing
                     quick and low. A footstep sounded on the threshold. She started, looked up, and
                     her kinsman, Donald More, stood before her,—the destroyer of her peace, the
                     spoiler of her home.
                  "I could not find the servants: so you must pardon me, Cousin Mary, for
                     announcing myself so unceremoniously," he said, with an easy air.
                  "Why come you here at all?" said Mrs. Halloran, rising, and standing between
                     the sick child and the unwelcome intruder.
                  "I came to inquire after my kinswoman's health," he said, with an air of
                     effrontery. "I hope I find you well."
                  "Insolent!" she murmured, while the blood, receding from her face, left it very
                     white; but she thought of the dying child, and the storm was calmed.
                  "This is no place for you, Donald More," she said, calmly. "I pray you go away.
                     Your being here disturbs me."
                  "I am sorry to hear that, Mary. I came with far other intentions. I wish to be
                     your friend and your children's friend."
                  "Friend!" she said, with bitter scorn depicted in every feature. "You do not
                     understand the meaning of the word. We do not need your friendship, even if you
                     did; nor could I accept it for myself or them. All I ask is that you go
                     away."
                  "I came on an errand which deserves a better reception, Mary. I know you
                     despise me and regard me as the enemy of your household; but I only did my
                     duty, and government chose to reward me with a grant of the Glendariff estate.
                     I had reasons for not refusing. It is far better for it to be in my possession
                     than in a stranger's; and now I promise, before God, that, on certain
                     conditions, it shall return to your branch of the family again."
                  "And what may be those conditions? But speak softly: my child is ill."
                  "Well, listen. I have made up my mind never to marry—WHY, ma belle cousine knows; and I have come to the
                     determination, with your consent, to adopt Desmond, provided I can prevail on
                     him to give up the superstitions and follies of the Romish Church and adopt the
                     Protestant Creed."
                  Donald More had lost all caste. Protestants spoke coldly to him, and avoided
                     him; the Catholic gentry absolutely cut him with every mark of contempt; while
                     the lower classes regarded him with distrust and hatred: for all alike in
                     Ireland detest the informer; and for the sake of recovering a
                     position he had fallen on this plan, knowing well that an act of justice to
                     John Halloran's family would be the best recommendation he could offer. He was
                     so full of it, and so sanguine of success, that he was scarcely prepared for
                     what followed.
                  "You have said your say, Donald More; now listen to mine," said Mrs. Halloran,
                     while her fragile form dilated with indignation. "Child of mine shall never be your heir. There lies one, dying.
                     Rather would I consign them both to the grave, than accede to your base
                     proposal. Let them be beggared, my God! or return to Thee, if Thou willest it;
                     but through all preserve to them the gift of Faith. No, Mr. More: it is out of
                     your power to serve me or mine."
                  "You will think better of it, Mary!"
                  "I am defenseless, sir. I refuse your proposal decidedly. I have told you that
                     your presence is painful and unwelcome. Shall I have to tell you more
                     emphatically that you are an intruder?" she replied.
                  "Don't trouble yourself, Mary. It is the way of women to get into the heroics.
                     I shall go away presently, but will return in a few weeks to know the result of
                     your considerations on the subject. One thing you cannot refuse
                     me: I must kiss that child. She is one of the few things I have ever loved,
                     Mary,—little, dainty lady," he said, while the nearest approach to tenderness
                     he had in his nature gathered on his features.
                  "Do not touch her, I beseech you, sir," said Mrs. Halloran, leaning over the
                     child. "Do not touch her. You might awaken and terrify her."
                  But the whispering had awakened her: she looked around with a bright, eager
                     expression, then lifted her eyes to her mother's, saying, "I thought he was
                     here."
                  "Who, darling?"
                  "My papa! Cousin Donald, how do you do?" she said, reaching out her dainty and
                     beautiful little hand. "Bring my papa back, Cousin Donald, and take my mamma to
                     Glendariff."
                  "Why, Gracie, little lady, what ails you?"
                  "Nothing much; only I am so tired waiting for papa to come, it makes my head
                     hurt me. I'm afraid I shall go away before he comes, for you know I'm going
                     far, far away; but do you find him, Cousin Donald, and bring him to mamma and
                     Desmond."
                  "I'll try, Gracie; but make haste and be well," he whispered, leaning over her.
                     "When I come again, I shall bring some beautiful French toys and pictures."
                  "Bring papa, and give my best love to him," she said, leaning back exhausted on
                     the pillow. "Good-by, Cousin Donald; I am so tired." And then
                     again a portentous slumber stole over her senses.
                  "Do not come again, Donald More," said the agitated mother, going to the door
                     with him. "There can be nothing in common between us. A wide gulf separates us.
                     I will receive no favors from you; nor should John Halloran's children accept
                     the slightest gift."
                  "Time, I hope, will soften your feelings," he said. "Farewell."
                  Inexpressibly relieved by his absence, Mrs. Halloran returned to the bedside of
                     the little one, who from that hour seemed to sink, or, rather, like some fair
                     thing cradled on a wave, to float gently away, without pain or suffering,
                     toward eternity.
                  The next day Dennis brought a letter from Buttevant, which Mrs. Halloran tore
                     open with eager expectation; but her face flushed up, and, throwing the letter
                     from her, she sat for a few moments bewildered, trembling, and undecided. The
                     letter was from her kinsman, begging her acceptance of a fifty-pound bill on
                     the Bank of Ireland, which he inclosed. In a little while her determination was
                     formed. She inclosed letter and bill together in an envelope, and, directing it
                     to Donald More, Esq., of Gelendariff, handed it to Dennis Byrne, who had been
                     waiting in hopes that the letter contained news from America.
                  "Dennis," she said, "if you wish to do me a service, go instantly with this to
                     Buttevant and return it to the
                     post-office. My cousin Donald has bad the audacity to write to me. Yesterday he
                     was here. I wish to return his letter without loss of time."
                  "Here, my lady? Why, then, it's a mortal sin I wasn't to the fore to welcome
                     him," said Dennis; "for I declare to my sowl it would have been the greatest
                     pleasure I ever had, to put him at a brisker pace from Fada-Brae than he came
                     to it."
                  "Be on the watch, then, Dennis; for he threatens to come again. But go
                     now."
                  "Let him," said stout Dennis: "I declare to my sins I wouldn't desire better
                     fun. But I'm going, my lady, after I hear how Miss Gracie is."
                  "She is very weak,—oh, very weak, Dennis."
                  "Thanks be to God, she'll go to heaven without much pain; an' I pray His holy
                     name that the angels will welcome her with their sweetest songs,—inagh! But
                     it'll be a hard blow on Misther Halloran," murmured Dennis, while he lingered a
                     moment to look at the child, dashing off, as he did so, the tears that fell
                     from his eyes.
                  That evening, Mrs. Gray, the Protestant rector's wife, who lived in the
                     neighborhood, and who had been very kind in her attentions to Mrs. Halloran,
                     drove up to Fada-Brae, and brought some beautiful clusters of grapes and
                     flowers from her hothouse to the invalid. She was a gentle, kindly woman, and
                     Mrs. Halloran was always glad to see her. Gracie was awake, and smiled when she
                     saw the beautiful present, and, holding out her little, wasted hand, touched
                     the fruit and flowers with the tips of her fingers, in the same dainty way she
                     had always done when she saw anything beautiful which pleased her.
                  "Taste one, my darling," said her mother.
                  "No, dear—but yes,—to please you, mamma."
                  They pressed a grape between her lips; but it seemed to sicken her; and she
                     said, "I would rather look at them." Then they laid them where she could see
                     them, and her innate love for the beautiful found a quiet joy in the sight.
                  Father Hanlon came in, and brought her a picture of our Lord blessing little
                     children. She looked at it long and earnestly, then gazed into his face with
                     one of her earnest expressions, and held out her hand.
                  "You see, my dear, how Jesus loved little children. Their angels see the face
                     of His Father in heaven; and He is always glad when they are gathered into His
                     bosom."
                  "I love Him," she said, folding her attenuated hands together on her bosom,
                     with a holy expression. Just then, Birdie, her dove, flew into the room, and
                     perched on the cornice of the bedstead, where he sat, arching his white,
                     graceful neck, and, while he looked down with his soft gray eyes on her, began
                     a low cooing. She lifted her eyes, and a bright smile flitted over her face;
                     and, while they gazed with looks of love at each other, a deep slumber stole
                     over her.
                  Mrs. Gray offered to sit up and relieve Mrs. Halloran; but she thanked her,
                     saying she would be glad of her company, but she could not leave the child.
                     Father Hanlon sprinkled the dying one with holy water and benediction together,
                     and, laying his hand on Mrs. Halloran's head, lifted his eyes to heaven and
                     besought God to strengthen and comfort her when the dark hour came—that hour so
                     dark and bitter to a loving mother's heart,—and went away to visit a poor woman
                     of the neighborhood who was dying.
                  The child's dreams, or visions, were pleasant and peaceful: angel arms pillowed
                     her sinking head, and ever and anon far-off music stole around her; but she
                     alone, led by bright-winged ones through the shadowy vale, heard it. They
                     thought—those who watched her—that
                     it was so, from the radiant smiles that flitted at times over her countenance
                     and the few whispered words that fell from her lips. Her hand, folded in her
                     mother's, began to grow cold. Mrs. Gray brought the candle to the bedside, and
                     it was clear that death was creeping apace through her frame; but her breath
                     was still low and soft.
                  "Is this death?" asked Mrs. Halloran, with trembling lips.
                  "I fear so," was the reply.
                  "Then, my merciful God," she exclaimed, throwing herself on her knees, "spare
                     her the wild agony and bitter struggle. O angels! bear her gently away and
                     shield her from wild affright. Oh, my child! would that I might bear thee
                     through the dark waters on my bosom, and place thee in the hands of Him who
                     gave thee!"
                  The dove, startled perhaps by the light, fluttered down and nestled close to
                     the bosom of the child, within her arms, while faint and more low came up her
                     breath. Dennis and Ellen, hearing the slight stir, came in, and knelt sobbing
                     near the bed.
                  "She is passing away very sweetly, my friend," said Mrs. Gray. "Let us not
                     disturb her. It would be sinful to break in on such rest."
                  At that moment the child stretched out her arms; a slight shiver passed over
                     her frame; then truly she slept that sleep which shall know no waking until the
                     Resurrection morn dawns on the weary earth.
                  For long weeks Mrs. Halloran lay unconscious and hovering on the verge of the
                     grave. She knew not when the little coffin-lid was closed down on that clear
                     face which was fairer than Parian marble, or when the white shrouded form was
                     borne away and laid beneath the mould. Nor did she know of those long, loving
                     letters which had come—all of them at once—from her husband and Nora, telling
                     her of his safety and prosperity and of her happiness and hopes; nor of how the
                     boy Desmond, grown as gentle as a girl, had watched her day after day, and how
                     Ellen's tender care and Dennis Byrne's indefatigable efforts and unceasing
                     attentions left nothing undone. Of all this, with the kind attentions of her
                     friends around the neighborhood, she heard when, after long and weary months,
                     she had been restored to life and increasing strength, and when, amid
                     fast-falling tears, she used to talk unceasingly of the one that was gone, and
                     loved to hear of the slightest thing connected or associated with her. She
                     grieved much that the dove had flown away. Ellen told her that the last time
                     she saw it it was nestled on the dead child's bosom; since then no one had seen
                     it; and when at last, shrinking and with feeble steps, she visited the little
                     grave, she found that some friendly heart had caused to be erected over it a
                     costly and exquisitely-carved marble tomb, on which hung a garland of
                     half-withered flowers. Over the tomb was a sculptured cross, from which a dove
                     was rising toward heaven; but no one could tell who had paid this last touching
                     tribute to the sorrows of the Halloran family.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER X.
                  
                     
                        
                           "Pain's furnace-heat within me quivers,
                           God's breath upon the flames doth blow,
                           And all my heart in anguish shivers
                           And trembles at the fiery glow;
                           And yet I whisper, 'As God will,'
                           And in His hottest fire hold still."
                        
                     
                  
                  IT was a long night,—that night on which Nora Brady had so unexpectedly found
                     Mr. Halloran. She thought it would never end; and yet she feared that when it
                     passed away another and a deeper change might fall on him, and that with the
                     night-shadows his spirit would pass away. She watched and prayed alternately.
                     The anguish that the absent would have felt, had they been present, or could
                     they even have known it, was accumulated and mingled with her own grief; and,
                     while tears flowed in silent torrents over her face, her heart could only find
                     language in these words:—"If possible, my God, let this cup pass away from
                     them."
                  When Thomas McGinnis went away, a little after midnight, she had sent a message
                     by him to the friendly publisher in Franklin Street, stating how and where Mr.
                     Halloran was to be found. She had never forgotten the first day she called at
                     the "Pilot" Office, or the heaviness and gloom that oppressed her then, or the
                     kind words which had greeted her, or the sudden sunshine which had burst around
                     her when, after making her inquiries, the good publisher had exclaimed, "John
                     Halloran! He is my friend; he was my guest." And now she did not doubt for an
                     instant that he would come the moment he received her message, and make every
                     arrangement necessary for Mr. Halloran's removal to a better and more
                     comfortable place, and for any exigency that might occur during his illness.
                     This thought comforted her greatly; and, beseeching Thomas McGinnis to lose no
                     time in the morning in delivering the message, she resumed her post near the
                     bed of the sufferer. It was near day-dawn, and the doctor and clergyman stood
                     together at the bedside, conversing in a low tone about the condition of the
                     patient, while Nora leaned eagerly forward to hear their opinion.
                  "He is decidedly no worse," said Dr. Bryant; "and that is something, in an
                     attack like this."
                  "And you think he may get over it?"
                  "Well, I hope so; yes, I think so."
                  "God grant it!" said Father Nugent, while he looked at his watch. "I shall have
                     to go away in a short time: it is nearly five o'clock, and that is my hour to
                     be at the altar. I shall return, however, as soon as I can. If any sudden
                     change occurs, I must know it immediately."
                  "I have no patients very ill at present," replied Dr. Bryant, "and therefore I
                     can remain here until about ten o'clock. Some time during the day my patient
                     must be removed to more comfortable quarters."
                  "Yes: no doubt his remaining here would embarrass these poor people
                     considerably, who have neither the time nor the means to render him such
                     attentions as are absolutely necessary. If no better place can be found,
                     doctor, my house and its poor accommodations are at your service. My own room
                     shall be prepared, as soon as I get home, for Mr. Halloran's reception, if you
                     think it will do."
                  "Do? Why, sir, it is the very thing; and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for the
                     suggestion. Perhaps in a day or two something may occur which will put us in
                     communication with Mr. Halloran's friends."
                  "I beg your honor's pardon," said Nora, unable any longer to keep silent, and
                     leaning eagerly forward, "but Mr. Halloran has a friend in Boston who will be
                     broken-hearted intirely to hear of his illness; an' it's Mr. Donahoe, your
                     reverence, at the 'Pilot' Office."
                  "Alas!" said Father Nugent; "how unfortunate! Mr. Donahoe left the city last
                     evening for New York, and will be away several days; besides which, he lives at
                     a hotel, which I fancy would not do very well for a sick person to go to. But,
                     my child, why is it that you are so deeply interested in this unfortunate
                     gentleman?"
                  "Och, your reverence!" said Nora, while tears fell like rain-drops from her
                     eyes, "sure I was born an' bred with Mrs. Halloran; an' after the great
                     downfall of the family she was so heart-broke at bein' separated from Mr.
                     Halloran, who was hunted intirely out of Ireland, that I come to Ameriky to
                     find him an'—an' do what I could for them at home, God save 'em. But I had
                     begun to give up all expectation of ever layin' my two eyes on him again, when,
                     sirs, the Blessed Virgin brought me to the widow Blake's this night, right to
                     him. An' it's sorrowful tidin's to hear that his best friend is gone; but, your
                     reverence, I brought over with me some of the ould McCarthy More diamonds, that
                     Mrs. Halloran sent, thinkin' may-be he'd be at a deshort for means in a strange country; an' they'll pay all his
                     expenses out-an'-out."
                  "I am glad to hear all this, my dear child. God will bless your fidelity Come
                     to my house and nurse Mr. Halloran: let a familiar home-face be the first his
                     eyes fall on when he recovers."
                  "If your reverence an' his honor there don't think I'm takin' too much on
                     myself, I'll beg you not to move Mr. Halloran away until I see the good lady I
                     live with, an' tell her, and an ould gentleman there that has promised to help
                     me if I ever was in trouble, all that has happened. The lady I am at service
                     with, sirs, has a fine airy room, that I think Mr. Halloran might have; she
                     takes a few lodgers, and it is a quite,
                     *
                      nice place; so, without throwin' Mrs Sydney out of a help, I might
                      nurse him jest as well, an' have her to help."
                  
                     
                     *Quiet.
                  
                  Both gentlemen knew Mrs. Sydney, and thought Nora's plan was a sensible one;
                     while they could not help admiring and respecting the nice sense of honor and
                     self-respect which seemed to govern her in every particular. But Father Nugent
                     could not remain another moment; and Nora, wishing to have matters arranged as
                     early and speedily as possible, also hurried homeward.
                  Mrs. Sydney was sitting in the dining room, with a worried, anxious expression
                     on her countenance; but the moment she caught a glimpse of Nora's face the
                     cloud passed away, and, smiling, she greeted her with "La suz! child! where in
                     the world have you been? I've been in a perfect snarl about you. You'll be
                     sick, sitting up so of nights, an' may-be get some dreadful disease
                     yourself."
                  "I am very sorry, ma'am, you had any oneasiness about me; but I could not come
                     any earlier. Do you think Mr. Mallow is stirrin' yet?" said Nora, with a
                     nervous air.
                  "Up! He's been up this hour, and was down here about ten minutes ago, to
                     inquire if you had come home. He's in an awful humor. I declare, I shouldn't
                     wonder if a mad dog had bit him some time or other," said Mrs. Sydney,
                     sharply.
                  
                  "Might I go up, ma'am, an' ask him to come down here? I want to spake to ye
                     both about something that's happened," said Nora.
                  "Lord's sake, child, you haven't gone and got married?" exclaimed Mrs. Sydney,
                     looking over her spectacles at Nora with widely-rounded eyes.
                  "Married!" said Nora, with a low, merry laugh which she could not repress. "No,
                     indeed, ma'am,—not married, or likely to be."
                  "Well,—yes: go up to Mr. Mallow's room. But it is at your own risk."
                  When Nora opened Mr. Mallow's door, he looked up quickly, and gave an
                     indescribable grunt, which said, as plainly as grunt could express, "It's well
                     you've come."
                  "Good-morning, sir. I hope you are well?" said Nora, curtsying.
                  "Humph!"
                  "Mrs. Sydney wishes to see you, sir, for a little while."
                  "I sha'n't come. I'm busy. Breakfast-time will do."
                  "Sir, may I speak to you?"
                  "Yes. What do you want?"
                  "I want you, if you plase, to come to Mrs. Sydney: it's to ye both I'm after
                     spaking to."
                  "And what in the mischief, Nora Brady, do you want to talk about? Has Ireland
                     gone to the bottom of the sea, and do you wish me to fish it up? All women are
                     alike, though. Go away. I don't know whether I shall come or not."
                  "Sir, I'm proud enough, in my poor way, an' if it was for mysel' I'd scorn to
                     be throublin' you; but it's for them I love better nor mysel'; an', if you
                     haven't forgot it, you said once if I ever was in throuble and wanted help
                     you'd lend it, so help you God! But at the same time, sir, I want you to know
                     beforehand that it's not money I'm afther."
                  "So you're in trouble. What is it? I always keep my word, Nora Brady," he said,
                     pushing back the morning paper and taking off his spectacles.
                  "Yes, sir; I'm bothered enough, God knows: an' it was about that I wanted to
                     see you and Mrs. Sydney together; for I have found Mr. Halloran, and shall have
                     to go away!"
                  "Found Mr. Halloran! Go away! Begone down with you! I'm coming instantly."
                  And when the three were together, Nora told them all about it, speaking as
                     little as possible of herself,—of her sacrifices, her trials, her anxieties,
                     hopes, and fears, up to the present moment. As to Mrs. Sydney, she made no
                     secret of wiping her eyes. Mr. Mallow was only affected with a sudden violent
                     cold in his head. He, odd in everything, had always felt the deepest interest
                     in the history of ill-fated Ireland, and, by way of obtaining the most reliable
                     news concerning her ever-agitated and gloomy affairs, had for many years been a
                     subscriber to a leading Dublin newspaper. He therefore knew all about John
                     Halloran, and how like a martyr he had immolated his affections and fortunes on
                     the sacred altar of his country; and he had learned from the same source that
                     the nobility and worth of his character were without reproach. So it was with
                     no ordinary emotion that this eccentric but true-hearted old man
                     exclaimed,—
                  "And you are sure it is John Halloran, the Irish patriot, who is lying ill,
                     insensible, at the house of a poor widow who lives in an alley?"
                  "Yes, sir; an' the crature's been as kind as if he was her own kith and kin.
                     But she's very poor; an' the doctor says it's not a fit place for Mr. Halloran
                     to be in, because it's close an' smoky; an' I thought of the nice front room
                     up-stairs that's been empty these two months, an' says I. 'May-be Mrs. Sydney will let Mr.
                     Halloran be moved into it; then there'll be no need for me to go away to nurse
                     him;' an' there's no fear of losin' anything, ma'am, for he has enough an' to
                     spare for all his expenses."
                  "Don't speak, ma'am!" said Mr. Mallow, blowing his nose vociferously. "Don't,
                     madam; for I must have my say out. Nora Brady, it's my solemn opinion that you
                     only want a pair of wings—to be a perfect wild goose. You are a heroine; and
                     that's next door to being a lunatic. You are a miserable, shiftless body,
                     taking care of everybody but yourself; and now, to crown all, you want to give
                     yourself and us some horrible disease—ship-fever, may-be—by bringing a sick man
                     into the house. But—"
                  "An' then, sir, I hope God an' Mr. Mallow will pardon me for demaning myself to
                     ask a favor for the like of him," said Nora, with an indignation she could not
                     control. "I may be a wild goose, but I've only done what I thought was right by
                     them I was beholden to for whatever good fortune I ever had since I was born;
                     an' I hope when I'm judged it won't turn the scales of God's mercy ag'in me.
                     An' surely there's no need of goin' on my two knees to get a place for such a
                     one as John Halloran of Glendariff; for Father Nugent hissel is havin' a room
                     prepared in his own house for him, where I shall go to nurse him. Ma'am, you've
                     been very kind to me, a poor stranger in your house, an' I'm sorry to take you
                     at such a deshort; but it's my duty, an' I
                     can't help it. An' it's no ship-fever that's on him at all, only a sug that
                     took him in the head last night, an' deadened his brain like; an', if it was,
                     it couldn't be caught from a better person; for he's a gentleman an' a
                     Christian out-an'-out."
                  "Nora Brady, you are like a torpedo. Your tongue goes like a coffee-mill; and,
                     now that you've ground me to powder, I will go on and finish what I was saying
                     when you were rude enough to interrupt me. I was going to observe, when you
                     broke out, that, no matter what ailed Mr. Halloran, he should come. If every
                     boarder left the house on account of his being here, he should stay, and
                        I would make good all losses to Mrs. Sydney,—partly for his
                     sake, partly for yours. Go away!" exclaimed Mr. Mallow.
                  "I beg your pardon, sir. I was too hasty," said Nora, ashamed.
                  "Oh, never mind. A young lady who has money in bank, and who has independence
                     enough to earn her own living, may be allowed a few airs."
                  "What do you mean, sir? I haven't a cent to call my own on this earth, an'
                     never wanted it worse," said Nora, with a sigh.
                  "You are not telling the truth, Nora. You have at this moment, in the Trenton
                     Bank, five hundred dollars."
                  "An' where, in the name o' my ould shoes, did it come from, sir? Faith, an' I
                     think you might find something else to joke about," said Nora, puzzled and
                     worried.
                  "Ah! I lost ten thousand dollars one fine night, and it was returned to me
                     every cent. Did you think I should forget it? No, child. I went that very day
                     and deposited five hundred dollars in the Trenton Bank for you; and there
                     you'll find it, subject to your order. You can get any or all of it at any
                     moment, or let it remain where it is. It is yours, to give away, send away, or
                     throw away,—the latter of which I expect you will do. Madam, give the silly
                     child an answer about the room. If the boarders should object to a sick
                     person's coming, let there be an
                     exodus forthwith, and I will make up all deficiencies."
                  "Go, Nora, child, and get the room ready as quick as you can. Mind now and
                     slick everything up nice. I'll attend to breakfast," said Mrs. Sydney, who had
                     listened with no little interest to what had been passing.
                  "After breakfast, Nora Brady, I'll charter an omnibus and call here for a small
                     bed, pillows, and other things, yourself included, to bring Mr. Halloran home
                     at once. Begone now. I want no thanks,—not yet, at least."
                  Then Nora began to see sunlight breaking through the clouds. Mr. Halloran had
                     been removed to Mrs. Sydney's without any ill effects: he was surrounded by
                     every comfort, and no attention was wanting that his situation required. His
                     symptoms gradually assumed a more favorable type, and, although he had not yet
                     recovered his faculties, there was very little doubt but that the disease would
                     finally yield to remedial agents. But two of Mrs. Sydney's boarders went
                     away,—two young gentlemen who were so devoted to the violin and clarionet that
                     they could not endure the interdict which Dr. Bryant laid on the indulgence of
                     their musical propensities. While Nora attended to her work, Mrs. Sydney
                     watched in the sick-room, and from the time it was finished—generally about
                     noon—Nora went in and remained; for Phillis, with an air of condescension, had
                     offered to get tea every evening "while de poor gal had such constant nussin'
                     to do." Thus relieved, Nora would sit watching every symptom and almost every
                     breath of the sick man. To the moment, she gave him his medicine, and regulated
                     the temperature and light of the apartment with instinctive judgment. When
                     there was nothing else for her hands to do, she would sit beside the fire,
                     gazing down into the embers, while her imagination, like a prophet, foretold
                     many beautiful and happy things. She saw under grand old trees a stately home,
                     where were once more united all that she loved on earth. She heard the sound of
                     Mary Halloran's harp, and the clear, wild cadences of her sweet voice, ringing
                     down through the magnificent woods, as she sang strains of the land of their
                     birth. She saw John Halloran, his fine face, thoughtful and noble, walking with
                     a stately step through those handsome halls and lofty rooms, and heard his kind
                     voice speaking gently and cheeringly to all. Then floating up through the
                     vision came sweet, flute-like tones. Little children were at play, and Gracie's
                     gentle tones mingled softly with Desmond's merry laughter. Dream-tones indeed
                     of the one who was gone, which would never more be heard on earth, for far
                     away, beside the shining water which flows from the throne of God, her voice
                     was blending sweetly with the angel melodies that make glad the celestial City.
                     Then came a softer spell,—the twilight hour, the day's toil over, and a quiet
                     stroll with Dennis Byrne through the old woods; and many a heart-felt word and
                     bright anticipation seemed to be whispered in her ears, while ever and anon
                     their thoughts fled back to "Holy Ireland" and lingered lovingly amid the
                     scenes and beside the graves they loved. The entrance of Dr. Bryant or Mr.
                     Mallow, or perhaps the crumbling of a coal, or a low moan from the invalid,
                     dispersed the rainbows of her fancy, leaving only to her aching heart the stern
                     and sad reality.
                  One evening Nora was standing by the bedside, looking down with a sorrowful
                     heart on the pale, motionless features of Mr. Halloran. He seemed to be
                     sleeping, and sighed heavily, then, opening his eyes, looked around him. Almost
                     breathless, Nora sank quietly down on her knees; and, turning his head, he
                     said, faintly, "Home,
                     
                     Nora." Then a soft slumber stole over him, his breathing became
                     regular, and a gentle moisture appeared on his skin. When Dr. Bryant came, he
                     pronounced him out of danger. Little by little, when his consciousness was
                     fully restored, they told him all. The first wish he expressed was to see a
                     clergyman and receive the sacraments; after which he was more calm and
                     composed, and talked with Nora, whose presence he could scarcely realize. He
                     looked at her, and followed her with his eyes about the room, as if he were not
                     quite convinced that she was not a figment of the dream-land he had been
                     sojourning in so many days, and might melt away as that had done. But ere long
                     he heard how it was; and, when he was strong enough to bear it, she told him
                     all that had befallen his family since he left home. It was almost too much for
                     him to bear. The treachery of Donald More roused within him a stern, bitter
                     feeling of wrath, which yielded only to a softer emotion when he heard of his
                     shorn lambs seeking refuge among the forsaken ruins of Fada Brae.
                  "But I will be still, Nora. I will, by the help of God, bear it in patience,
                     leaving the wretch who has robbed my children to His avenging justice. I have
                        them all left to me,—I shall ere long have them with me,—my
                     Mary, Desmond, and my gentle little darling Gracie. Why, then, should I repine?
                     Such treasures are of inestimable price, and, possessing them, I am not poor.
                     Do you know that the only thing I can remember during my illness was Gracie?
                     Arrayed in white, and looking like an angel, the child was ever around me: she
                     seemed to guide me, and to brighten the gloom of the terrible darkness into
                     which I was plunged. Sometimes a white dove would flutter down on my breast;
                     then it would not be a dove, but her. Truly it is a strange, deep love I have
                     for the little, quiet one, to brighten up such dark hours when all else was
                     forgotten."
                  "It was strange, sir; but you always thought of the little lady more, by reason
                     of her always hanging about you and following you about wherever you went,
                     surely," said Nora.
                  They did not know that the fair little daisy of Glendariff had been beaten down
                     by the death-storm to the silent dust. God help thee, John Halloran, when thou
                     hearest the tale! No letters had come yet; and he could not conceal his
                     uneasiness. Nora, hiding her own anxiety, said all that was cheering, and used
                     every argument she could think of to convince him that it was not time for the
                     letters to come, and that without fail a budget would arrive by the next ship.
                     He tried to hope for the best, although not convinced.
                  One morning Mr. Mallow came in as usual, and, in his own peculiar and abrupt
                     way, inquired if Mr. Halloran had made any business arrangements, or had
                     anything in view, either professionally or in a mercantile way, for the future.
                     Mr. Halloran replied in the negative. His next inquiry was,—
                  "Do you know anything about book-keeping and commercial life?"
                  "But little, practically," said Mr. Halloran, half amused. "My father in his
                     early life was an eminent merchant of Dublin, and became a gentleman farmer at
                     the old place in Munster when he retired from business. As you may imagine, he
                     was a great utilitarian, and, among my other acquirements, insisted on my going
                     through a course of commercial studies with his old book-keeper, who was then
                     head of the house he had retired from."
                  "Have you forgotten it all?"
                  "No, no; I think not, sir. I have the unfortunate faculty of retaining with singular tenacity all
                     disagreeable experiences," replied Mr. Halloran. "But may I be allowed to ask
                     you why you are so particularly interested in this matter?"
                  "Yes, of course. My chief book-keeper has resigned; he is going to California;
                     and if you will have the place you are welcome to it, that is, provided you
                     think yourself fully capable of keeping my accounts in order."
                  "This is a providence, Mr. Mallow,—one of God's merciful providences; and,
                     after thanking Him from the depths of my soul, I thank you, sir, who have been
                     His willing instrument. I was only this day wondering what I should do to
                     support my family. It will suit me in every particular."
                  "But the salary,—the salary. That's the thing. It's only eighteen hundred
                     dollars; and I won't give a cent more," said Mr. Mallow.
                  "That sounds princely, sir, to a man without a dollar. It is quite enough."
                  "It is settled, then? Well, rest a few days longer. I will attend to the books
                     myself until you are stronger. Now, there's another thing. A year or so ago I
                     bought a very pretty piece of property near the city, with good, substantial
                     improvements on it; but, sir, it is going to wreck for want of some one to take
                     care of it. The cottage looks dilapidated, and everything is tangled and wild
                     around it. Now, if you choose, you can have it at a mere nominal rent, just for
                     the sake of having it kept in order, because by-and-by they'll be running a
                     railroad through it, or building a town there, and won't give half as much for
                     it if it goes to wreck as if it was in good repair."
                  "It is the very thing I should have chosen,—a residence somewhere in a rural
                     district. I have been accustomed tomed to the country nearly all my life. Sir,
                     you are loading me with favors."
                  "Not at all. Don't thank me. A book-keeper is indispensable to me; so is a good
                     tenant. Good-morning." And, pulling his hat down over his eyes, Mr. Mallow went
                     out.
                  A few days afterward Mrs. Sydney came to the laundry, where Nora was busy, and
                     told her that Mr. Mallow wished to speak to her. Wiping her hands, tying on a
                     clean apron, and smoothing her hair, she followed Mrs. Sydney up into her own
                     private sitting-room, looking blooming and handsome, but modest and unconscious
                     of her beauty.
                  "Did you want me, sir?"
                  "Yes. Sit down there."
                  "No; I thank you, sir. I'm very busy, and I'd rather stand."
                  "Stand, then. Do you ever think of marrying, Nora?"
                  "Troth, sir, an' I think it's a quare thing for you to be asking me," said
                     Nora, reddening.
                  "How would you like to be a rich man's wife, Nora,—to become a fine lady and
                     drive in your own carriage?"
                  "Troth, sir, an' it would depend intirely on who the rich man was, whether I'd
                     have him, or not. As to being a fine lady, I think I'm content to be jest what
                     God made me,—an honest girl; an' as He's give me good broad feet of me own, an'
                     health to make good use of 'em, I'm well satisfied to be without a
                     carriage."
                  "And may-be a rich widow one of these days," went on Mr. Mallow.
                  "Indeed, sir, I've no time to be foolin' here in such nonsense as this. Is it
                     all you want, Mr. Mallow, to be makin' fun of me?"
                  "No; not at all. I want a wife, Nora Brady, and should like to marry you, if you'll consent,
                     because you are a good, noble, virtuous girl, who deserves all the comfort and
                     happiness that money can buy. If you will marry me, become my companion and
                     nurse, I will leave you the whole fortune which I have grown old in scraping
                     together. I am old, I am ill favored, I am cross; but you would not be plagued
                     with me many years, child; and I know you would be all that God requires to me
                     while I live. Say, will you become the wife of the old millionaire, Steadfast
                     Mallow?"
                  "Sir, I'm only a poor girl," stammered Nora; "but I wouldn't marry you if you
                     had a hundred million pounds sterling. You're old enough for my
                     great-grandfather; an'—an'—well, I'm as good as married already to Dennis Byrne
                     in Ireland, an' wouldn't break my troth to him to save my own life. But, sir, I
                     beg your pardon for my plain spaking; I——" And Nora burst into tears, and
                     turned to leave the room.
                  "Stop, Nora. I might have known you were not a bale of merchandise, to be
                     bought with money, and I don't know but it's all for the best for me; for I'm a
                     very cross-grained, jealous-minded old screw, and am not worthy of a good wife.
                     I wanted a good nurse, and somebody belonging to me to leave my money to when I
                     died. But it's my first and last attempt at matrimony. Some of these days, when
                     I get many years older, and require help like a child, I shall come and live
                     with you and that Dennis—what's-his-name, and expect to be well taken care
                     of—eh?"
                  "You'll be very welcome, Mr. Mallow," said Nora, blushing. "You've been a great
                     friend to us all, an' we'll be proud to return some of your kindness, sir. May
                     I go now? Thank you, sir."
                  "I declare to my ould shoes," said Nora, as she ran from the room, "if the ould
                     gentleman hasn't been as crazy as a June bug ever since he lost that money.
                     Marry him, indeed! He'd better think of his grave an' the other world, an' of
                     the good his riches could do in this, instead of tryin' to turn a poor girl's
                     head with 'em."
                  Nora evidently thought it was one of Mr. Mallow's queer freaks, and troubled
                     herself no more about what had been the bitterest disappointment of the
                     singular old man's life.
                  In a day or two, sure enough, the letters came, and the reason of their
                     detention was explained. Father McCarthy, to whom they had nearly all been
                     inclosed for him to forward, had been called to Dublin by the archbishop on
                     some ecclesiastical business, and had been seized with a sudden and violent
                     illness, which had detained him there many weeks. Thus the letters from America
                     to Fada-Brae accumulated in his letter-box, along with the letters from
                     Fada-Brae to America. John Halloran at last opened the one containing the
                     account of the death of his child. He knew now that his bright little
                     song-bird, the fair blossom of his heart, had fled heavenward. He knew that by
                     this time the dust of the grave had gathered on that round, blue-veined brow
                     that his lips had lingered on in that last farewell, and that the heavy mould
                     had given forth its violets and shamrocks above the deep cell of that silent
                     cloister where she slumbered. Other trials had lacerated and wounded the
                     surface of his heart, but this struck down like a barbed arrow into its vital
                     tenderness. They would have comforted him,—Father Nugent, Dr. Bryant, poor
                     Nora, who so much needed comfort herself; but, in a low, choking voice, he only
                     desired to be alone. Then he wrestled with his agony. He stretched out his
                     arms, as if by the power of his love and will he would bring his fair
                     spirit-child back to his bosom. He knew now that she had been with him in the strange
                     darkness he had passed through; and, as he called to mind the tender, beautiful
                     face, the ineffable joy and sweetness that brightened it, his tears began to
                     flow. They heard him walking to and fro, all day and all night; but no one saw
                     the workings of this great agony of his life, nor for many days would he admit
                     any one except Father Nugent, to witness his faltering and falling along this
                     newly-found Via Dolorosa. But at last the tempest was stilled,—thanks be to
                     God, such tempests last not forever!—the clouds were reft away, and through the
                     vista of Faith he saw his angel child in a truer and more real life than this,
                     cleansed from all earthly defilements, and for ever and evermore a dweller
                     among the fair sons of God. But still like a mourner his heart lingered beside
                     the little earth-garb that the fair spirit had inhabited; still the chill and
                     gloom and loneliness of the grave and the long separation crucified its
                     instincts; and, while the soul cried out, "Thou hast done a good thing, my God,
                     in gathering home this child from the pollution of earth," NATURE, rebelling,
                     still murmured, "My God, Thou hast struck me a heavy blow! Couldst Thou not
                     have spared me?"
                  And from that day a change came over John Halloran. Many a gray hair shone out
                     amid the clustering brown locks over his temples; he felt more like a wayfarer
                     than a traveler on earth; and it became the aim of his life to think and act as
                     one who was honored by the dignity of being the parent of an angel, to whose
                     fair home his soul aspired, and who, he believed, often and often came and
                     ministered to him, and who he hoped would be with him in the last struggle of
                     life, to conduct him to the regions of eternal life. These thoughts were the
                     companions of his inner life. Outwardly he was calm and gentle, giving a quiet
                     and persevering attention to business ness, occupying himself with plans for
                     the future, directing the workmen who were repairing the "Brae Cottage," and,
                     aided by Nora, selecting furniture and making every necessary arrangement for
                     the reception of his family. None saw or intruded on his solitary moments: they
                     only knew that a heavy and bitter trial had fallen on him in the loss of his
                     little blue-eyed daughter, and their sympathy was none the less deep for being
                     unspoken.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XI.
                  CONCLUSION.
                  
                     
                        
                           "But there are hours of lonely musing,
                           Such as in evening silence come,
                           When, soft as birds their pinions closing,
                           The heart's best feelings gather home.
                           Then in our souls there seems to languish
                           A tender grief that is not woe,
                           And thoughts that once wrung tears of anguish
                           Now cause some melting tears to flow."
                        
                     
                  
                  THE hawthorn hedge-rows were white with blossoms, and on the brae-side violets
                     opened their blue eyes under the tangled fern, while daisies, in fair
                     constellations, gleamed here and there above the springing grass. The note of
                     the cuckoo was heard ringing at intervals through the air, as, attended by her
                     little brownie, she flitted from tree to tree. Down into the
                     valley rushed a mountain-brook, making wild music as it leaped in frothy
                     cascades over its rocky bed, then winding gently and brightly away, like a
                     thread of silver, through the fertile and picturesque vale, while here and
                     there small plantations of willows which grew along its banks threw their long,
                     green tresses right lovingly into its laughing waters. High up, in the blue,
                     silent depths of heaven, fleecy clouds, with the golden sunshine on them,
                     floated softly away, and wreathed themselves like coronals or hung in gleaming
                     draperies on the summits and around the peaks of the distant mountains, while
                     the balmy westerly winds gently unfolded the timid leaves and blossoms. Earth
                     would have worn that day the likeness of Eden, but that in the golden sunlight
                     the decay of Time and the triumphs of Death told another tale. Amid the spring
                     verdure, touched here and there with sunlit halos, the gray old ruins of
                     Fada-Brae looked grand and beautiful. The clinging mosses, no longer brown,
                     looked like draperies of velvet festooned from turret and tower, so rich and
                     green was the tint they wore; while the ivy, with its dark, glistening leaves,
                     garlanded, like deathless memories, the silent cloisters below. Amid them lay
                     the dead of ages,—mitered abbots, monks, princes, and knights. The tombs were
                     all more or less dilapidated,—at least, those of an ancient date,—and some were
                     quite despoiled of the stone or marble effigies which had decorated them, and
                     which now lay grimly on the earth, almost over-grown by the rank grass of the
                     place. It had been for centuries the burial-place of the McCarthy Mores, though
                     but few of their number had been laid there since Ireland had become an English
                     province,—those who could afford it having gone abroad and lived and died in
                     the Catholic countries of Europe, preferring exile to a sight of the grievances
                     and oppressions which they could not remove, and which each year became more
                     hopeless.
                  Mrs. Halloran's parents were slumbering there, and near them was a little
                     grave, around which clusters of violets were planted like a garland, that,
                     being in full bloom, sent out their spicy odors like incense on the air.
                     Planted by a mother's hand, and watered by such tears as only mothers shed,
                     they were precious memorials of the little sleeper below. The marble cross at
                     the head of the grave, with its elaborate carving and soaring dove, now
                     gleaming brightly in the sunshine, spoke not to the heart as did those flowers,
                     those living types of the life of
                     the soul and the resurrection of the body. Mrs. Halloran and Desmond had spent
                     the morning there, talking of the last spring they were all at Glendariff
                     together, and of the "little lady" now so sweetly sleeping at their feet; of
                     how she used to watch the unfolding of her favorite flowers and listen daily
                     for the notes of the birds she best loved. Her little wise sayings were
                     repeated, and her quiet laugh remembered, with a sad smile; then the questions
                     she used to ask, so full of deep meaning, were suggested, as if by an angel, to
                     lead the grief-worn heart of that mourning mother from the dust to the eternal
                     heavens, where, in a truer, a fuller, a more blissful life, the child of her
                     bosom was cared for more tenderly and surrounded by a more ineffable love than
                     even her yearning heart could conceive of. "No: she is not here,"
                     said Mary Halloran, laying her hand on the little mound. "It is only the little
                     earth-garb that we were used to see her in,—the veil our angel wore, and which,
                     of the dust, belongs to the dust, yet still beloved because it was hers, and
                     because every atom will again be gathered together and fashioned anew to
                     receive for eternity the glorified being which, although living, we no longer
                     see." Thus murmured the bereaved mother, with her eyes fixed on the blue,
                     bright distance which rolled like ocean-waves, though silently, between her and
                     the heavenly country where her child awaited her; thus she sought to comfort
                     herself, and consecrate the crown of thorns which so deeply pierced her.
                  It was growing toward noon; and, calling Desmond, who was trying to decipher an
                     inscription on an old tomb, they started homeward. They had not gone far when
                     they saw Dennis Byrne coming toward them. Mrs. Halloran instantly apprehended a
                     visit from her cousin, Donald More; but, to her great relief, Dennis informed
                     her that Major O'Grady from Glendariff had come over to spend the day. He was
                     her husband's best friend; and she thought instantly that he had perhaps
                     received later intelligence from him than she had, and quickened her pace.
                  "I am glad to see you, madam," said the major, meeting her at the door: "upon
                     my soul, I'm delighted to see the roses blooming on your cheeks this fine
                     morning; and Master Desmond, too. Faith, madam, you'll have a grown-up son
                     before you know where you are."
                  "I am glad to see you, major: you are truly welcome. But allow me to offer you
                     some refreshments," said Mrs. Halloran.
                  "Thank you heartily for the welcome, but the refreshments I decline, if you
                     please. I breakfasted at a late hour in the valley, and do not wish to spoil my
                     appetite for dinner. When did you hear from Halloran?"
                  "About two weeks ago."
                  "And how was he?"
                  "He had been ill, but was quite recovered, and thinks that but for the nursing
                     and care of Nora Brady he must have died. It's a long story, major, but Nora
                     has laid us all under a heavy debt of gratitude,—God bless her! and the end of
                     it is that John is well and doing well."
                  "That's fine news altogether. Nora Brady's a noble creature, and deserves just
                     such a husband as that fine fellow Dennis Byrne will make her. In France they
                     would be pensioned by government for their fidelity. I was afraid the little
                     girl's death would be a heavy blow to John."
                  "It was," said Mrs. Halloran, while her eyes overflowed.
                  "Well, it's natural, I suppose, for people to grieve; but I don't think it's right. No one could do
                     for that gentle, little lamb what her Father in heaven will do. Just think of
                     her being an angel! Why, by this and that, I think it's glorious,—too glorious
                     a thing to shed tears about." And, by way of illustrating his precept, the
                     major shed tears himself.
                  "How are our friends around—the old neighborhood?" inquired Mrs. Halloran,
                     after a pause; for she dared trust herself no further on this theme.
                  "Around Glendariff? Pretty well,—at least all that you are interested about;
                     and those who knew I was coming sent a thousand messages of love and
                     condolence, which you must receive on my credit, dear lady, for I have
                     forgotten them all."
                  "I am glad to be remembered," said Mrs. Halloran, smiling.
                  "I forgot them because I had other and more important affairs to think over and
                     talk over when I saw you; and—hang it all, it's no use to be beating around the
                     bush any longer. I came on business which I don't know how to let out for the
                     life of me. I'm the very worst diplomat in the world. I don't know
                     how it will affect you; but tell me, do you ever go off into hysterics, or
                     faintings, or the like? for I tell you plainly, if you should give ever so
                     small a shriek, I should be off like a rocket."
                  "I believe I have grown too strong in my powers of endurance for any such
                     demonstrations, major. But I feel excessively anxious to hear what this matter
                     is, which you have so strangely preluded."
                  "Well, it's no more nor less than this: your cousin, Donald More,—hold on,
                     now,—the base scoundrel, is dead."
                  "Dead!"
                  "Yes. He was thrown from his horse one night, coming from Kildare, and was so
                     injured that he died in a few days."
                  "Then let all animosities be buried with him. We shall tread lightly over his
                     ashes; and may God forgive him, even as I do!" said Mrs. Halloran, feeling much
                     shocked at the news.
                  "He sent for me, and I was about declining the invitation,—for I despised the
                     fellow most heartily, and expected no good from him,—when something impelled me
                     to go; and go I did. I saw that he was hastening at a rapid pace to answer to a
                     just Judge for the deeds done in the body: so I softened a little, and spoke to
                     him like a Christian.
                  "'I thank you for coming,' he said, in a husky voice, after I had taken my seat
                     by the bedside. 'You are the friend of those to whom I wish to make
                     restitution. I mean John Halloran's family. Mary was my first love: I had hoped
                     to win her; but she preferred another, and from that day I lived only for
                     revenge. I hated John Halloran. But time grows short. You all know the events
                     which have transpired within the last year or two, and how my revenge has been
                     attained and gratified. But I am dying, and cannot say all that I wish. A few
                     months ago I saw Mary, and I saw her child, the only thing on earth that I
                     loved, dying. Mary was haughty and agitated, and told me in plain language that
                     I was unwelcome, and that she scorned me too much to receive the slightest
                     favor or kindness from me. It cut deep, sir; it stung me almost to frenzy. But
                     the child turned her angel face toward me, and smiled while she held out her
                     wasted hand to welcome me. And her words were sweet and trusting ones. I have
                     never forgotten that moment. That bright little face has come to me in my
                     dreams, and stood out from the twilight beside side me; it has pursued me everywhere, and down
                     in my heart I have heard her whispers stealing, just as they did that day. If I
                     had lived, my cursed pride would have helped me through; but I am dying; and
                     though I don't believe in the fables of Christianity, and am not actuated by
                     any noble moral motive in the act, I wish to be forgotten entirely—to have my
                     memory blotted away from the earth—rather than have the curses of generations
                     spit on my grave for what men consider a criminal injustice. I therefore have
                     left to you, as the best and oldest friend of Mary Halloran and her son, to
                     hold in trust for them until Desmond is of age, the estates of Glendariff, with
                     all lands, properties, and moneys appertaining thereto. The documents are all
                     legally drawn up, and we only awaited your coming to sign them. Call Lawyer
                     Dushane in,' he said to a gentleman who was in the room. 'A glass of water,
                     major: I am sinking very fast.' And gad, madam, he got so white, and gasped so,
                     that I thought he'd be off before he got the papers signed; but he rallied, and
                     when they all came up, the lawyer, the attorney, and the apothecary, with the
                     papers, he was able to write his name as steadily as he ever did in his
                     life,—then watched us as we signed ours. I said but little, egad; for,
                     altogether, it put me out of breath. I was dumbfounded, nonplused to an
                     entirety, I assure you, and so rejoiced that I was afraid I might say or do
                     something unbecoming the occasion. Then, I declare to you, I thought of the
                     poor wretch's soul for the first time; for he was so calm and deliberate, and
                     talked away so evenly, that I didn't see why I should bother about it, if he
                     didn't.
                  "'Mr. More,' I said, 'you have done an act which God and man will approve. I
                     thought, sir, the old honorable blood in your veins was only under an eclipse;
                     and I'm glad from my soul, sir, for the sake of the royal and honorable name
                     you bear, that you have wiped this stigma away. But, sir, you will be in a few
                     hours before the face of an almighty and terrible God, who will judge you not
                     as man judges. Let me beseech you, then, to make your peace with Him while you
                     may."
                  "'Do you remember where I was educated, major?' he said, with a ghastly smile
                     of derision. 'There, sir, is the apostle of my creed.' And I followed the
                     glance of his eye, and saw on the mantel-piece a marble bust of Voltaire, whose
                     sardonic countenance, in which was blended the scorn of Lucifer and the leer of
                     Belial, could only find its likeness in the lowest cell of perdition.
                  "'You jest, Mr. More. I will not believe that you really entertain opinions so
                     unworthy of an immortal soul,—opinions so daring and perilous, in a moment like
                     this."
                  "'Have you been tonsured, major? Upon my honor, his reverence over there at
                     Kildare couldn't preach a better sermon. But have done. Like an Epicurean have
                     I lived; and amid roses and wine let me die. Ho! wine—the old Tokay, and the
                     crusted port! fetch it up, quick! Never mind the cobwebs on their necks,—the
                     black brave fellows.' Then he began to toss, and writhe, and utter such peals
                     of frantic laughter that I slipped from the room. They told me that at the
                     last, when the terrors and bitterness of death seized him, the most frightful
                     visions haunted him; but at length, exhausted and powerless, he cursed God, and
                     died. Such was the death of an infidel."
                  "This news is horrible, major," said Mrs. Halloran, who was leaning back, very
                     pale, in her chair. "Oh, the loss of a soul is a most terrible consideration!
                     Poor, miserable Donald! Why did you forsake God and scorn the truth in your
                     early manhood? Dear, sir, I feel much overcome. Will you allow me to retire for
                     a little while?"
                  
                  "Yes: go, my dear child, and lie down; and don't forget that Glendariff is once
                     more yours. And if you should hear Dennis Byrne give a yell, don't be alarmed;
                     for I'm going to step out and tell the news to the rascal."
                  Dennis didn't exactly yell; he only sprang some four or five feet up in the
                     air, and danced a jig, interspersed with such a variety of remarkable pirouettes, and at short intervals such a hearty
                     huzza, that the old major had much ado to keep himself from falling down with
                     laughter at his antics, in which Ellen and the negro coachman heartily joined,
                     without comprehending in the least what possessed him. At last he stopped, and,
                     wiping the perspiration from his heated face, seized Ellen and kissed her,
                     shook hands with the major, and flew at the grinning negro, whom he sprawled on
                     the grass.
                  "I believe now, your honor, that the divil's out of me intirely," he said,
                     quietly; "an' I beg your honor's pardon for cutting up such a shindy; but I
                     couldn't help it. There, Mr. Snow, I declare to man I didn't intend the laste
                     harm in the world, only you stood in the way of it, an' caught it. Come into
                     the kitchen, Ellen, an' hear what I've got to tell you; an', bedad, if you
                     don't fly up the chimbly I shall be glad. Major O'Grady, be plased to excuse my
                     niglect, sir; but walk into the drawin'-room and be sated, and have some
                     refreshments."
                  "No, I thank you, Byrne. I'm going over to the old cloisters for a little
                     while. I shall be ready for dinner when I get back. See that I'm not kept
                     waiting."
                  The major wished to visit the "little lady's" grave; for he, in common with all
                     who had ever known her, loved the strange, old-timed little one; he wished also
                     to look at that tombstone, made of the finest Italian marble, and carved by a
                     master-hand, which had cost almost its weight in gold, and whose history he
                     alone knew, and had sworn to a dying man never to reveal, lest it should be
                     torn away and cast in scorn from the sacred spot where he had planted it.
                  In a few weeks Mary Halloran and Desmond, with Dennis to protect them, were on
                     the broad seas, on their way to Boston, where a fair and beautiful home and
                     loving and friendly hearts awaited their coming. In one of the state-rooms of
                     the ship, so carefully guarded that Mrs. Halloran herself kept the key, was a
                     large case, so heavy that it took six stout sailors to lift it in. Dennis Byrne
                     had given out mysterious hints about its containing the old silver, gold, and
                     jewels of the family, and the tars troubled themselves no more about it, except
                     to say, every now and then, "that it was a wonder to see a lady, who had such
                     piles of gold and silver, look so miserable and pale as Mrs. Halloran did." The
                     captain was in the secret; for the freight of that mysterious case had added
                     one hundred and fifty pounds to the profits of the voyage. It was a shell
                     within a shell. The outer one was of oak, banded with iron; within was another
                     of lead, which contained one of rosewood, which held a small, fragile, withered
                     form, which was once a living, breathing, loving child. It was the body of
                     little Gracie, which her father had directed to be brought to him, that it
                     might be laid where he could sometimes go and weep beside it. In the hold of
                     the ship, with their other effects, were the marble head and footstone,
                     carefully packed and stowed away.
                  Nora Brady's vow was not broken. She accomplished much toward its fulfillment;
                     and God, blessing her earnest endeavor, provided for the rest. Her day-dreams
                     turned to real, substantial things; she saw those she loved, reunited and
                     happy,—which was reward enough she thought. But the most acceptable and
                        beautiful virtue of the human
                     heart, after charity, is gratitude; and it is one which God sees fit, in His
                     divine providence, to reward many times, even on earth. In the course of a year
                     Nora saw another little Gracie lying on Mary Halloran's breast; she saw Dennis
                     Byrne set up in a thriving business by Mr. Halloran, who, in the receipt of
                     abundant supplies from Ireland, was enabled to establish him on a capital
                     basis, which gave him an opportunity to develop his resources and capacities
                     for business without embarrassment; and, as the year closed in, Nora became the
                     wife of her long-tried and faithful lover. She drew two hundred dollars, all
                     that was left of Mr. Mallow's gift, and furnished neatly and substantially a
                     small house, where she lived in happiness and comfort,—content with her
                     station, and serving God with a cheerful and willing heart. And, after years
                     had passed away and Nora's children gathered around her, they removed to a
                     larger and handsomer house,—a house which we have been in before, but which,
                     with its modern repairs and elegant improvements, we can scarcely recognize.
                     Mr. Mallow had claimed the promise she made him when she refused to be his
                     wife, not only for himself but for Mrs. Sydney, who, old and infirm, could no
                     longer help herself. With Nora Byrne they found a safe and happy asylum for
                     their declining days; and it is said that, after applying a portion of his
                     wealth to the establishment of a "poor man's bank," Mr. Mallow intended to
                     divide the rest between Nora's children. Need we say that the bond between the
                     Hallorans and the Byrnes grew stronger with time, and that the troubled days of
                     the past were often spoken of between them with deep emotion? When the
                     anniversary of Gracei's death, or rather her birth into immortal life, came
                     round, it was Mr. Halloran's way to gather Nora's children and his own and take
                     them out to the little grave; and, while they wreathed the tomb and grave with
                     flowers, he would tell them, in tender yet cheerful accents, the brief but
                     beautiful history of her life, and of its holy passing away. Ellen remained at
                     home, and, at Mrs. Halloran's request, was installed as housekeeper at
                     Glendariff, to take care of and show the place; for it had become a place of
                     pilgrimage for strangers,—indeed, for all who had heard its history and who
                     dared to go to the verge of treason and do honor to John Halloran. And if you
                     wish to know how Nora prospers, go to the large and substantial new warehouse
                     on the right hand side of —— dock, and ask the portly, prosperous merchant
                     within, how he gets on. You can easily find the place; for over the door is
                     written, in large black letters, Byrne & Co.; and the Co. is good Thomas
                     McGinnis.
                  Desmond is of age, and has gone to take possession of his estate. There was, at
                     first, a formidable array of objections interposed by the ever-active and
                     argus-eyed government officials regarding the matter, and the affair was
                     carried before the courts, and referred finally to the decision of the Lord
                     Lieutenant, who, being more liberal than his predecessor, and wishing to
                     conciliate the Catholic gentry and people of Ireland, allowed the young heir to
                     enter on the full possession of his estate, its immunities and privileges.
                     While the affair was pending, he was the guest of Major O'Grady, whose
                     beautiful daughter Florence, it is whispered, will, in a year or so, be
                     mistress of Glendariff.
                  Influential friends at home, who had never ceased to interest themselves to
                     obtain permission for John Halloran to return to Ireland, at length met with a
                     questionable success; but the pardon was so trammeled with conditions which
                     would have embarrassed and annoyed him on all occasions when he might have
                     aided his countrymen, at least by
                     his advice, and which the slightest public interest in passing events would
                     have been construed into treason, that he rejected it with indignation, and
                     besought his friends, as they honored him, never to make another attempt of the
                     kind in his behalf. A good citizen, whose position and influence rank
                     high,—prosperous and honored,—his adopted country feels proud of his virtues
                     and talents, and respects the Faith which he illustrates so nobly in his
                     life.
                  The widow Blake was not forgotten by our exiles in their prosperity, but
                     received kindly and generous aid from them in her undertakings, which led to
                     substantial comfort,—for which she never ceased to thank God, and always
                     referred to the night Mr. Halloran fell insensible on her steps, as the most
                     fortunate day of her life.
                  And when, in the quiet twilight hour, John Halloran and his wife often talked,
                     in low, tender tones, over the troubled past, they never failed to refer to
                     Nora Brady's Vow as the cause of their restored happiness.
                  NOTE.—In alluding to the outbreak of '48, I deem it proper, as nearly all the
                     participators in it are living, to state that John Halloran is a PURELY
                     FICTITIOUS PERSONAGE, and the event and its results are only introduced to
                     throw out, in stronger relief, the virtues of Nora Brady's character, who is a
                     real and living person, and only one of a thousand of her class, whose
                     sacrifices for the well-being of friends at home are noble and heroic. Many
                     cases of the kind have come under my own eye,—two in my own family,—which are
                     as deserving of immortality as were the acts of the brave daughter of the
                     exiles of Siberia.

                        —MOORE.
                     
                  
                  IT is a tale of Erin—of Erin in her pride and the glory of her strength,—of the
                     bright dawn of the day-star of her salvation,—of her sages and learning,—of her
                     apostles and martyrs—that we tell. Let us leave the Present, with its fetters
                     and gyves, its tears and lamentations,—let us turn our eyes away from those
                     scenes whose glories, so faded by ruin and devastation, mar the fair face of
                     Nature, and look far away through the dim ages of the Past,—from the twilight
                     and shadow, toward the morning light of a happier day.
                  A scene full of splendor and repose, which lay like a jeweled crown thrown off
                     by a tired monarch, sparkled and glowed in the sunset. Stretching away toward
                     the south and west from the beauteous valley, mountains whose sides were
                     covered with a luxuriant growth of white-thorn and fir, and a thick undergrowth
                     of heath, whose purple flowers stirred beneath the south wind like the ripples
                     of a summer sea, lifted their summits to the clouds. Through a narrow valley,
                     or rather gorge, of the Tore
                     Mountain, whose rocky sides, overgrown by flaunting vines and rich mosses,
                     presented uncouth outlines to the eye, the red and golden light of the setting
                     sun flowed in on a lough*
                      whose gently-ebbing waves were crowned by two isles of matchless
                     beauty. Around their shores, through reeds and willows, the waters, tinted with
                     crimson and sapphire and burnished with gold, broke with a gentle murmur,
                     scattering long lines of foam like circlets of gems on the sands. There was
                     then no lofty Abbey of Innisfallin, no massive towers amid the groves of its
                     sister isle. There was then no stronghold on the crags and rocks beyond; for
                     the clans of the Kenmares and Herberts, at this early period, had not conquered
                     the territory over which they afterward reigned. A low rippling murmur broke on
                     the hushed stillness of the scene, and, glancing through a rich growth of
                     arbutus and fern, a bright stream threaded its way from its mountain-tarn, down
                     over rocks and mosses, now flashing in tides of splendor in the sunshine, now
                     lost in shadow, and ever singing in silvery notes, until, obstructed by masses
                     of granite and accelerated in its progress by a steeper declivity, it dashed, a
                     wild and splendid cascade, into the lough below. Here lingered the sunbeams,
                     multiplied by prismatic lights into a thousand glowing shades,—every drop of
                     spray a living gem, every bubble of foam an embodied rainbow,—until it looked
                     as if some spirit of eld had, in a moment of poesy, crushed diamonds and pearls
                     and rubies and scattered the precious dust over the foaming waters.
                  
                     
                     *One of the Killarney lakes.
                  
                  On an overhanging rock a wild deer poised its feet, and, looking out of its
                     great soft eyes with timid glances, stooped to drink,—the only sign of life in
                     the whole fair scene. But, suddenly starting, it threw back its head, nerved
                     its slender legs for a perilous leap, and disappeared amid the shadows of the
                     overhanging trees of the cliff beyond. A sound of oars, dashing rapidly in the
                     waters of the lough, disturbed the quiet repose, and in another instant a
                     curragh, rowed by a single boatman, shot round Innisfallin's Isle. Two youths
                     of noble aspect, and richly appareled, sat in the stern, and looked with eager
                     curiosity toward the shore. One was slender and graceful, with a complexion of
                     olive, and hair of raven blackness, which was confined under a fillet of gold,
                     that sat like a coronet over his broad, polished forehead. He was arrayed in a
                     silken tunic, and robes of Tyrian purple embroidered with gold. He held in one
                     hand an unstrung bow, richly ornamented, while he shaded his eyes with the
                     other from the slanting sunbeams. His companion was a perfect contrast in form
                     and feature. Heavily but not ungracefully built, his light flowing hair, his
                     large blue eyes, ruddy complexion, and less aquiline but singularly handsome
                     features, announced his Saxon origin. Suddenly the oarsman paused and left his
                     oars in rest, while the curragh slowly drifted on the tide toward the middle of
                     the lough.
                  "Lay on thy oars and speed us to yon shore, serf!" exclaimed the dark one, with
                     flashing eyes.
                  "I may not, noble," replied the man, pointing toward a grove which, gloomy and
                     almost impenetrable, receded from the eastern shore of the lough. Then he bowed
                     his head low upon his breast in an attitude of adoration. The strangers turned
                     their eyes in the direction he indicated, and beheld a long and solemn
                     procession of men crowned with wreaths of oak, and arrayed in white tunics,
                     over which flowed ample robes of splendid and gorgeous dyes, with jeweled
                     clasps, and broidery of gems, which flashed back the sunlight as brightly as did the spray
                     which spanned the distant waterfall.
                  They were led by one of tall and noble stature, but bowed with age. His white
                     hair flowed back from a face already paled by the last shadows of life, while
                     over his breast his beard hung like drifts of snow. His eyes, black, piercing,
                     and brilliant, gazed with a rapt and seer-like expression toward the west. He
                     carried, folded on his bosom, something wrapped in a cloth of gold, which he
                     regarded with reverence and awe. In solemn and measured tones they chanted
                     lofty strains, which, blending together in their different parts, formed a
                     wondrous melody, which was wafted in sonorous and mournful cadences across the
                     waters of the lough, and repeated in weird echoes among the glens and rocky
                     clefts of the mountains.
                  When at last they came in full view of the setting sun, which through the
                     distant and narrow gorge looked like a deity on an altar of flame, they bowed
                     their heads in adoration, while their white-haired leader stretched out his
                     hands and, with impassioned words and gestures, addressed the object of their
                     worship. And while he stood thus—his rapt countenance still uplifted—the light
                     faded, soft shadows of purple and gold floated over the scene, and in silence
                     the procession returned toward the grove.
                  "Dius Fidius!" exclaimed the dark stranger, with enthusisam: "that was solemn
                     and grand! Dost thou know, Sir Saxon, who those are?"
                  "The Druids!" replied the young Saxon, while a scornful smile wreathed his
                     handsome mouth: "those are the Druids and bards of Munster, under the
                     Arch-Druid Semo, famed throughout Western Europe for his wisdom and
                     learning."
                  "He is also much reverenced in Gaul,—so much so," said the youth, "that my
                     father, the Lord Count of Bretagne, has sent me hither to learn the science of
                     letters under him."
                  "I wish his fame had been confined to Gaul, then, and not traveled also to
                     Germany: then my father, a palatine of the Empire, and of old Roman blood,
                     would not have sent me hither to learn wisdom from Semo. I wished to study in
                     Rome!"
                  "Rome!" exclaimed the other, with scorn: "what are the schools of Rome and
                     Greece? They know but little of the lore of the Egyptians and Phœnicians, still
                     less of the Etrurians; and who cares for modern learning? Not I! So, hearing of
                     the high repute of the Druids and bards of Erin, I have come hither to study
                     jurisprudence and literature."
                  "Bah!" said the Saxon: "I have no taste for solitude and study. Give me spear
                     and helm, sword and banner, to slay and burn and conquer. Then the arena—the
                     games—for me! I was at Rome once with my father; but even Rome, under the new
                     sect of a Nazarene called Christ, is not as it used to be under Diocletian,
                     Maximinus, and Julian,—when the beasts of the amphitheater—beasts from the
                     jungles and deserts of Africa and Ind, fierce, burning, ravenous demons—fought,
                     not with their kind, but with men, in noble and stirring contest.
                     Bah! those emperors of the olden time knew how to find sport for the
                     people!"
                  "By Prometheus!" said the other, laughing, "we must endeavor to be content in
                     this our exile. This is a fair land,—this island school of Europe; and we can
                     only pray the gods to give us fire from heaven for our brains, while we are
                     chained to the rock."
                  "I like thy spirit, sir stranger. Thy name?" said the Saxon, as the prow of the
                     curragh shot up on the yielding sands of the shore.
                  
                  "Clotaire of Bretagne," he replied, modestly.
                  "I am Ulric of Heidelberg," said the other, proudly, as they clasped hands.
                     "Canst thou conduct us to Semo?" he continued, turning to the boatman. "We will
                     reward thee generously."
                  "I demand no reward, nobles. It is my business to see ye safely to your
                     journey's end," replied the man.
                  "This is a strange land, by Thor!" exclaimed the Saxon, stamping his foot. "We
                     are not beggars; we are nobles, with well-filled purses."
                  "All that may be; but ye are also guests," replied the man.
                  "Whose guests? Thine?" asked the Saxon, scornfully.
                  "The guests of Erin, nobles," was the reply.
                  "Per Apollo! Of all the countries I have visited, I have found nothing like
                     this. It is a fine place for poor travelers, which we are not,"
                     replied Ulric of Heidelberg, standing still. "Here have I journeyed from Tuscar
                     to Gougane-Barra, nor spent a coin. At every resting-place I find an inn and
                     refreshments and servants and guides, and, what I care least of all for,
                     volumes and treatises on the arts and sciences,*
                      all at my service; and when, like an honest man, I take my purse from
                     my girdle to pay the reckoning, I am told that one of the most sacred laws of
                     Erin is the law of hospitality, and that it would cost that man who should
                     transgress it, his life. I am tired of it. I can't believe in such national
                     perfectibility as it assumes. Here," he said, haughtily, while he snatched a
                     heavy purse from the folds of his girdle; "take this gold, or I'll hurl it into
                     the depths of yonder lake."
                  
                     
                     *Abbé McGeoghegan's "History of Ireland."
                  
                  But the man folded his arms on his breast, and, smiling, replied, "There is no
                     law against that, noble."
                  "Well, if I cannot break a law, it will be no pleasure to do it: so I'll keep
                     my gold. It must be a rich country, forsooth, where a peasant refuses
                     gold!"
                  "It is a rich country, sir noble. Throughout the broad land are prosperity and
                     plenty. As to gold, we turn it up with our plowshares when we break the soil,"
                     replied the peasant, courteously but proudly.
                  "And do the peasants of Erin also speak the language of Rome?—or perhaps thou
                     art the descendant of some old Roman legionary, who helped to conquer this
                     isle, and speak the language for the love thou hast for his fatherland," asked
                     Ulric, with less scorn in his tone and manner.
                  "Know, O noble," replied the man, drawing himself up proudly, "that
                        this soil—this land—has never been polluted by the
                     footsteps of Roman legions. They were driven from the frontiers of Erin, ere
                     they crossed them, by the kings and chiefs of Tara, who swept down with their
                     brave septs, like torrents from the reeks, on their flying cohorts. They
                     conquered the barbarous hordes of Britain,—an ignoble conquest,—but their
                     eagles found no perch and their legions no resting-place on our sacred shores.
                     But pardon me, nobles. I am just what I seem,—a peasant; but, living with wise
                     and learned men, and being the attendant on the teachers of the school, on the
                        Betagh land which I helped to cultivate,
                     I—well, I was neither deaf nor blind."
                  "So, so, Clotaire! This is a strange country, and a most strange people," said
                     Ulric of Heidelberg,—"where learning and science are held in such esteem by all
                     classes. But ho, here!" he cried out to the guide, who was leading the way.
                     "Answer me! Is this thy vaunted land filled with priests and bards who do
                     nothing but chant, and sing, and
                     worship the sun and moon? Have ye no warriors?—no armies?—no triumphs?"
                  "My time is almost spent, nobles; neither does it become one in my station to
                     hold argument with such as ye are. Ask Semo; ask the bards: they will tell ye
                     the tale of Erin's glories and Erin's heroes!" replied the man, speeding
                     swiftly toward the grove, whither the two followed at a rapid pace.*
                     
                  
                     
                     *All references made in the course of this tale to the customs, habits,
                        and conquests of the ancient Irish, to their religion and its rites, are

                  CHAPTER II.
                  THE TEMPLE.
                  "WHERE in Pluto's name is our guide? This gloom is impenetrable; and, to tell
                     thee the truth, Sir Clotaire of Bretagne, I do not think it safe for us, who
                     are strangers and almost unarmed, to venture farther into this dismal wood,"
                     said Ulric of Heidelberg to his companion.
                  "We are as safe here, Sir Saxon, as if the broad sunlight shone on us. This is
                     one of the sacred groves of which I have heard, in the midst of which is a
                     temple where the Druids perform their mysterious rites, and where the sages
                     instruct youth in the sciences. But let us hail our guide. Ho! ho, there!—Ho!"
                     shouted the young Frank.
                  "I am here, nobles," said the man, who was only a few steps in advance of them,
                     but who was so concealed by the gloomy shadows of coming night, which crept
                     through the great trees like dark-robed spirits, that they did not see him.
                  "Per Hercules! I did not know but that the earth had opened and swallowed thee.
                     This gloom is like Tartarus," said Ulric, while the red blood tingled in his
                     cheeks. Just at that moment strains of choral music swept past them, modulated
                     into a thousand softened echoes and cadences by the sweet south wind, which
                     breathed at intervals through the leafy and silent aisles. They paused,
                     awe-struck and amazed. A louder and more solemn strain of melody—a rolling
                     anthem of adoration tion—burst
                     through the grove, making the very leaves tremulous with its harmonious
                     vibrations, while here and there, flitting like white fawns through the
                     thickets, were veiled figures, graceful and agile, who sang wild-bird-like
                     songs as they fled along. Then all was silent and motionless.
                  "Behold!" whispered the guide, pointing upward through an opening in the trees.
                     "The Vestals are engaged in the rites of Nerf, known in Greece as Athena, but
                     worshiped in Erin as the goddess of wisdom and purity."
                  The strangers lifted their eyes, and saw through the open space above them a
                     purple vista stretching far up into the silent depths of heaven, from which the
                     last soft beam of twilight had faded, in the midst of which hung the crescent
                     moon, like a silver bark floating to bright but unknown shores, while the
                     evening star, an opal-crowned spirit, followed, guarding its way through the
                     deep,—images of purity and wisdom deified and worshiped in those earlier ages
                     by nations who, dwelling in the shadow of darkness, understood nothing clearly
                     of the existence of a first cause.
                  "It is a sacred hour," said the man, reverently. "We must approach in
                     silence."
                  The Saxon looked scornful and impatient. Clotaire threw back his fine head with
                     a light smile, and the group pursued their way. After treading narrow and
                     intricate paths, they made an abrupt turn, and came in full view of a majestic
                     and spacious marble temple, through whose windows of stained glass—stained in
                     Tyrian dyes which far exceeded the imitations of these later ages—floods of
                     crimson, green, purple, and golden light were streaming out on the shadows in
                     such prodigal splendor that the old trees looked as if they were draped with
                     rainbows. Running along the front was a spacious colonnade, supported by light
                     pillars, with carved base and cornice, into which the wide folding doors of the
                     principal entrance opened. Above rose stately arches, splendid sculptures, and
                     lofty turrets, all blending together in one grand architectural harmony.
                     Walking to and fro the length of the tesselated marble floor of the colonnade
                     was a noble-looking man, clad in flowing garments embroidered and clasped with
                     gems. The fire of youth was in his large blue eyes, and the glow of life's
                     spring-time on his cheeks, while a consciousness of innate superiority lent an
                     imposing dignity to his aspect. His sandaled feet glistened as he walked, the
                     straps of his sandals being wrought with precious stones, and the square cap,
                     which declared his order, sat on his brow like a diadem.
                  "He is one of the princes of Munster," said their guide, in a low tone of
                     voice, "who, being instructed by the Druids, has become a Bard."
                  Just then, seeing two strangers approaching, he stepped forward, and, holding
                     out his hand, received them courteously.
                  "Bear witness, nobles," said the guide, "that I have conducted ye hither
                     without bribe or reward, that I may return. This, noble strangers, is Abaris,
                     prince and Bard of Munster."
                  "And we," said Clotaire of Bretagne, "are two strangers from Western Europe,
                     who have come hither in the pursuit of knowledge. We have letters to Semo, the
                     sage and Arch-Druid of Erin, from our fathers,—one of whom is a palatine of the
                     great German Empire, the other, myself, a son of the Lord Count of Bretagne.
                     For our guide we can safely say that he has performed the task assigned him in
                     good faith and courtesy."
                  "It is well. He knows well how sacred are the laws of hospitality. But, noble
                     sirs, while I bid ye welcome, I am
                     sorry to inform ye that Semo is now engaged in the sacred rites of the temple.
                     A number of Druids from other provinces have met him here to consult together
                     in matters of high import; and, it being one of the festivals of Tienne, he will not be at liberty to give ye audience until to-morrow,"
                     replied the bard, with grave dignity. "But follow me. We have an apartment for
                     strangers, where ye can partake of refreshments and rest, which ye must need
                     after so long a journey."
                  He conducted them through lofty passages, through spacious halls of marble,
                     where the groined ceilings were fretted with silver and checkered with
                     azure,—where silken draperies swept around sculptured pillars in voluminous and
                     gorgeous folds,—where the arches, which spanned deep niches in the wall, were
                     heavy with carvings of grotesque foliage, and filled with parchment volumes,
                     and rolls of Egyptian and Etrurian manuscripts. In more than one apartment
                     through which they passed, they noticed high and finely-chiseled statues of the
                     chaste Nerf, before which, on tripods of silver, burned fires, which were
                     tended by the neophytes of the temple, clad in robes of white and crowned with
                     garlands of ivy. The way seemed intricate and interminable; but, as they went
                     on, they noticed that they were winding around a circular corridor, which
                     appeared to surround an inner temple; for, as if afar off yet quite near, and
                     only muffled by the intervention of thick walls, they again heard those
                     wondrous strains of music, while from small loop-holes, high up near the
                     ceiling, sharp rays of light from within streamed across. Silently and
                     reverently the bard conducted his guests along until they reached an arched
                     doorway set deep in the marble wall, which he opened, and ushered them in.
                  "Here rest, most welcome strangers. Here are refreshments freshments; here are
                     couches; here is a harp; here are books. But pardon my absence. My post of duty
                     is where ye found me. More strangers might arrive,—for men of all nations seek
                     our sages to hear from them lessons of wisdom,—and it would be a gross
                     violation of our rules for me to be absent longer than necessary," said the
                     bard.
                  "Thanks, noble Abaris, for the time already bestowed on us. There is only one
                     more favor. Be pleased to take with thee our letters of introduction to Semo,"
                     said Clotaire of Bretagne, handing him a letter written on vellum and fastened
                     with threads of gold.
                  "And mine," said Ulric the Saxon, impatient and hungry. Abaris took both, and,
                     bowing his head, folded the letters to his heart, and was gone.
                  "Now, Clotaire, let us be merry. There are fowls and meats of which I know not
                     the names; here are venison, salads, white bread and wines,—oh, glorious,
                     generous wines! See how they sparkle and dance as the light gleams through
                     them. And, per Bacchus! the service is of gold. This Druid temple is no bad
                     quarters, after all!" exclaimed Ulric of Heidelberg, skipping around the table
                     and inspecting every dish with the greedy eye of a gourmand.
                  
                  "This is more like the Epicureanism of Greece, than the abstemiousness for
                     which the Druids are celebrated. We only want garlands of roses and music to
                     make us fancy we are in Athens," laughed the young Frank, filling his goblet
                     with sparkling wine. "Let us eat, drink, and be merry."
                  After satisfying the first cravings of hunger and thirst, he threw himself back
                     on his couch and surveyed the apartment. It was lofty and beautiful. The floor
                     was tesselated with marble of various colors, and spread here and there with soft Persian mats of brilliant
                     dyes. Couches filled up with soft silken cushions invited repose; and silver
                     lamps, whose flames threw up fragrant odors, hung suspended by links of silver
                     from the ceiling.
                  "Look! look! Sir Saxon! look!" exclaimed Clotaire, starting up, and laying his
                     hand on his companion's arm, as he was in the act of lifting another goblet,
                     overflowing with wine, to his lips, while he pointed to a luminous sentence
                     which had appeared to start out suddenly in letters of fire on the marble
                     wall.
                  
                     "THE WISE MAN SAYETH, TOUCH NOT WINE.
                     "BE GOVERNED NOT BY SENSUALITY, BUT BY THY NOBLE SELF."
                  
                  "By Apollo! this is sham hospitality!" exclaimed the Saxon noble. "I thought we
                     were invited to partake of these viands and refreshments?"
                  "I am thankful for the warning," said Clotaire. "I am refreshed, and shall eat
                     and drink no more."
                  "And I shall drink another goblet of this delicious wine. By Bacchus! there is
                     nothing in all Rhineland like it!" exclaimed Ulric of Heidelberg, drinking
                     another draught. "Now I am so far from sleep that I feel like a young giant. I
                     could fight a dragon, if I could only find one! Come, Sir Clotaire! let us
                     explore beyond this, and not be mewed up like two refractory damsels on a
                     holiday. These casements open—yes! let us see—on a narrow parapet; a goat could
                     scarcely stand on it; but I shall go and follow it whithersoever it leads
                     me."
                  "Sir Saxon! thou wouldst not be guilty of this breach of hospitality! What
                     right have we to scale the walls of those who have received us in good faith,
                     or explore their dwellings uninvited?" exclaimed Clotaire, in an indignant
                     tone.
                  But, heated with wine, and heedless as he was bold, Ulric stepped forth from
                     the window, out on the parapet, and, with the agility and swiftness of a cat,
                     glided out of sight, while the other, shocked and indignant, turned away, and
                     once more lay down upon his couch.—The soft, subdued light, the solitude and
                     perfect stillness around him, soothed his senses, and a deep slumber stole over
                     him. A fair dream opened to his vision; his mother, still in the bloom of a
                     stately beauty, was beside him; his father, in courtly attire, with a coronet
                     on his brow, held out his hand with a proud look of joy toward him; he threw
                     out his arm to clasp his mother, who was the idol of his life,—when, lo! a
                     crash, a jar, aroused him, with a sense of something terrible. He sprang up.
                     The casements had been dashed rudely open, and on the floor, ghastly and
                     trembling, lay Ulric of Heidelberg.
                  "Ha! hast thou been wounded? hast thou been attacked? What means this, Sir
                     Saxon? Rouse thee, rouse thee, and lie not there trembling like a craven,
                     instead of a true knight," exclaimed the impetuous and noble Frank.
                  "This is an accursed place! Let us go hence," he replied, through his
                     chattering teeth.
                  "Explain; but first rise up, and swallow some wine. I thought from thy valiant
                     talk that there was nothing within the space of humanity that could alarm
                     thee," said Clotaire, handing him wine.
                  "I defy every human power, Sir Frank; but there are terrible ones who belong to
                     another and a blacker world, the princes of the realms of hell, whom I fear,"
                     he replied, with white lips.
                  "Hast thou met one of these?" inquired Clotaire, incredulously.
                  "Listen. I have known an age of horror since I left thee," said the Saxon,
                     speaking in a low tone. "It was to
                     gratify a foolish whim which seized me at the moment; but the cool night-winds,
                     and the difficulties which beset my progress, exhilarated and excited me: so on
                     I went. Clambering, hanging sometimes by my nails, swinging by boughs, and
                     creeping where a bird could scarcely stand, I got along, until suddenly a steep
                     wall arrested my progress. It was covered with ivy of so old a growth that the
                     branches were like cables. As I could not go on, I vowed to go up; and up I
                     climbed,—up—up,—until a brilliant stream of light, pouring from an opening high
                     up under the eaves, almost blinded me. But my eyes, soon accustomed to the
                     glare, looked through, and could distinguish within and below; and, as sure as
                     thou livest, it was the interior of the accursed Druid temple into which I
                     gazed; and then——"
                  "Hast thou so far forgotten the honor of a noble, Sir Saxon, as to play the
                     spy?" asked Clotaire, with a withering look of scorn.
                  "Ha! spy!" he exclaimed, touching the hilt of his dagger. "Unsay the word, Sir
                     Clotaire of Bretagne!"
                  "Let thy own words disprove the charge, Sir Ulric of Hiedelberg. Go on," said
                     the other, coolly.
                  "That I am no spy, then, be sure. Had I known there was an opening in the wall,
                     had I even known that it was the wall of their temple I was scaling, I had not
                     seen what I did. But, once up,—hanging by vines at a dizzy height from the
                     ground, my brain fevered with wine, and the spirit of adventure rampant within
                     me—I looked down for a moment; but, Sir Frank, it was a moment so full of
                     horror that it is burnt in my brain forever. I saw a throne of gold and gems.
                     It was surrounded by lamps so studded with opals that the light streamed out
                     like sunbeams through them. White and crimson draperies of tissue covered with
                     stars of precious stones hung around it. On it was seated a terrible ONE of
                     gigantic proportions, draped in cloth of gold. His face was grand and
                     beautiful, but there was a faded glory and a curse in every lineament. Instead
                     of a diadem of gems on his brow, there was a coronal of small white flames.
                     Yes,—as I live,—flames! No jewels ever flickered and twined and writhed as they
                     did. Then he lifted his hand, and I saw a glistening serpent, with eyes of
                     flame, twining around his arm, and from the throat of the serpent issued low,
                     sweet melodies. At the signal, a screen slid back, and Semo, followed by two
                     others, older than himself, came into this awful presence, and, prostrating
                     themselves, touched the pavement with their foreheads, paying him who sat on
                     the throne homage, who uttered words I could not hear. Then there came a crash
                     and sudden darkness, and wild music wailing up on the air, and a sound of
                     lamentation. Half dead with fright, I returned with all the swiftness I
                     could."
                  "Sir Ulric of Heidelberg, thou art sufficiently punished for thy levity. Thy
                     head was dizzy with climbing, and, heated with wine, the light blinded and
                     bewildered thee, and thou hast seen—a vision," said Clotaire, laughing.
                  "It was no vision,—no phantasy!" replied the other, sullenly, while he
                     swallowed another draught of wine. "I only wish I was safely back at
                     Heidelberg; for, believe me, it is little that will be battered into my brains,
                     after what I have seen."
                  "Let us hope for the best," replied the gay Clotaire. "Lie down and sleep until
                     morning, and, my honor on it, the bright sunshine will disperse these
                     extraordinary phantoms from thy affrighted brain. There are soft pillows and a
                     wide couch. Let us sleep."
                  "Sleep who can!" muttered Ulric. "I shall watch. By Pluto! I feel afraid for the first time in my
                     life." But, notwithstanding all, he had scarcely touched the pillows, on which
                     he had heavily thrown himself, when his nasal organs announced, in no gentle or
                     musical tones, that he was sleeping profoundly.
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  SEMO.
                  "NOBLES, day is far up in the hills!"
                  "Pardon, O bard, the sluggishness of weary travelers," exclaimed Clotaire, who,
                     starting from his couch, saw Abaris standing beside him.
                  "Nay, gentle sir, it is I who should ask pardon, for rousing thee so rudely
                     from sleep. I was loath to do it; but Semo sends ye greeting, and is waiting in
                     the grove without, to give ye audience," replied the bard, courteously.
                  "Methinks the wines of Erin give one strange dreams, sir bard," yawned the
                     Saxon, stretching his limbs, while he shook off his slumbers.
                  "Our wines are generous. If used temperately, they invigorate and strengthen;
                     if abused, they take revenge by filling the soul with phantoms from Tartarus,"
                     replied Abaris, gravely.
                  "It was the wine, then," began Ulric; but, silenced by a sign from Clotaire, he
                     adroitly added, "In Rhineland, one may drink up a vintage without feeling
                     dizzy. But I am ready to accompany thee."
                  Beneath an old oak-tree, whose roots had forced their way out of the earth in
                     grotesque shapes, and were so covered with rich mosses that they looked as if
                     they were draped with velvet, walked Semo, the Arch-Druid. Grave, solemn, and
                     stately in his bearing, full of the dignity of learning and wisdom, and a rapt
                     enthusiast in the doctrines trines
                     of a dark mythology, his appearance was imposing in the extreme.
                  "Welcome, young lords of Heidelberg and Bretagne,—thrice welcome. Come near me;
                     for the cloud of age gathers over my vision, and the voice of mortals is like a
                     far-off echo," he said, extending his hand, which the strangers touched with
                     their lips, as they bowed the knee before him,—an act of reverence which his
                     age and position demanded. "I knew the father of each of ye. I was the guest of
                     the Lord Count of Bretagne, and also of the noble palatine of the Rhine, Count
                     of Heidelberg, when I last journeyed toward the ruins of Tyre and the broken
                     altars of Egypt. Their sons are welcome."
                  "We are here to learn wisdom in the schools of Erin," replied Clotaire, "and
                     are commended to the auspices of Semo, because his fame as a sage and
                     philosopher is known throughout Europe."
                  "Ay! so well is Semo known, not only for the wisdom of his age, but for the
                     glorious achievements of his youth, that his name is written in letters of gold
                     on a marble tablet in the hall of my ancestors at Heidelberg," said Ulric, with
                     a proud air, while he reverently bowed his head.
                  "It is ever so," said the old Druid, leaning on his staff. "The Rusga-Catha
                     *
                      sounds sweeter in the ears of impetuous youth than the soft lays of
                     Latona or the rapt strains of Apollo. The helm and shield, the war-horse and
                     braying trumpet, are in his dreams of glory. In the Leabhar-Gabhaltus*
                      he reads the scroll of destiny. But Time, like a torrent flowing down
                     from some cloud-capped hill, sweeps all away together in an inexorable current.
                     Of the Danaans, who first peopled this isle, and who were conquered by our
                     forefathers the Phœnicians, a brave and fearless nation, what is left? A few
                     broken tombs and ruined temples mark the path of the victorious invaders, while
                     the vanquished lie forgotten beneath the waves of the sea and the sands of the
                     shore. Fame is silent above their ashes. Their destiny is over. There is only
                     one aim worthy of man,—virtue! TIENNE, from whose glory ages cannot shear one
                     ray, is the governing principle of Wisdom and Perfection, in the pursuit of
                     which, man, enlightened by holy sciences, can only become a pure being, a
                     suitable companion for Deity."
                  
                     
                     *War-song.
                  
                  
                     
                     *Book of conquests.
                  
                  "Tell me, O sage!" said the Saxon youth, eagerly, and perhaps rudely, "has Erin
                     no heroes? no cohorts? no battalions? no chiefs and warlike sons? Is the broad
                     land filled with long-bearded sages and rambling bards?"
                  "Thy youth, O Saxon, must plead for thy ignorance," replied Semo. "While Erin,
                     which is known throughout the world as the Sacred Isle, bows the
                     knee to Sheanchus, the old and first cause,
                     while the altars of sacrifice smoke with offerings to TIENNE and NERF, while
                     the Druids in their sequestered temples keep alive the sacred fires of Religion
                     and learning, her heroes, attended by their bards, who record on the deathless
                     pages of Leabhar-Gabhaltus their deeds of valor, perform acts of prowess which
                     would not shame the walls of Troy, nor lay their spears in rest until the proud
                     invader is driven off or the aggressor subdued. Come hither, Abaris, and sing
                     the glories of Tuathal and Fion the Brave," said the old Druid, with kindling
                     eye.
                  The young bard swept his fingers over the strings of his harp, throwing out a
                     gush of wild, warlike strains on the air. The stirring notes floated like
                     banners over their heads, and the willing echoes sounded like the muffled tramp
                     of hosts marching to battle, while in tones of exquisite clearness and volume, modulated to
                     softness or rising in grandeur, he chanted the deeds of Tuathal, who was not
                     only terrible in war, but wise in council. "The princes and chiefs of Tara
                     assemble. The septs come thronging down from their fastnesses in the hills and
                     their strongholds in the valleys. They hear that the proud Roman, arrogant and
                     flushed with conquest, threatens their wave-washed shores with invasion. He has
                     boasted that the Eagle shall perch over the 'Sunburst,'*
                      and that this gem of the seas shall be plucked from its possessors, to
                     glitter in the imperial diadem, her heroes and princes be chained to Roman
                     chariots, while her maids and matrons shall be torn from their firesides and
                     sold into slavery. Roused to frenzy, they grasp the spear and buckle on the
                     sword. Their arrow-points glitter in the sunlight, and every bow is strung.
                     They rush with wild war-cries on the sleeping legions of Imperial Rome, who fly
                     at the onset, leaving rich spoils in the hands of the victors." This was the
                     burden of the song of Abaris, draped in poesy which we cannot imitate, and
                     filled with eloquence so stirring that Ulrie of Heidelberg grasped his dagger,
                     and, with flashing eyes, threw his fine muscular form into an attitude of
                     attack, while Clotaire listened breathless and eager until the bard closed his
                     song with the wild and romantic story of Fion Mac
                        Cumhall.
                  
                     
                     *The banner of Ireland.
                  
                  Semo waved his hand, and Abaris, gathering his mantle over his arm, retired
                     within the recesses of the sacred grove.
                  "He belongs to a race of royal heroes," said the Druid,—"heroes who bequeath
                     with their jewels and swords a dauntless spirit to their sons. Erin has her
                     priests and bards, but her defenses are the true and loyal hearts of an
                     unconquered race, who ever rush on the invader, like avenging deities."
                  "Pardon me," said the Saxon, with humility, "if, proud of my fatherland, I
                     deemed it without a peer in the art of war. Let those who will, seclude
                     themselves among the volumes and parchments of old, learning mysteries and
                     systems which will neither give strength to the sinews nor valor to the heart:
                     as for me, lead me, O Semo, to some of the warlike princes of Erin, where I may
                     practice all those glorious exercises which the valiant love."
                  "And thou?" said the sage, turning toward Clotaire of Bretagne.
                  "Think not meanly of me, O Semo, if, according to my father's wishes, I desire
                     to learn the arts of legislation and the science of jurisprudence among a
                     people whose code of laws is the admiration of nations. I wish the province
                     over which I shall one day reign to be prosperous and happy: hence it is my
                     first wish to submit myself to the wise government of the schools, that I may
                     learn the art of governing with equity," said the young Count of Bretagne,
                     looking down with a blush.
                  "Nay, thou hast no cause to blush for thy choice. I know thy people of old.
                     They are our ancient allies; and I can, declare that a dastard or a craven
                     heart are monsters unknown in Gaul! In thy choice is no lack of true courage.
                     He who would legislate wisely must learn the surest and happiest method of
                     applying laws to the necessities of his people. Ye shall each, under competent
                     teachers, be gratified. But not at once. I am on my way to the assembling of
                     the Estates of Tara, whither it is my desire that ye accompany me. When we
                     return, I shall be able to decide on the course to be pursued for both of ye.
                     But come; last night ye were guests, to-day pupils," said Semo, leading the way toward the
                     cloisters of the temple.
                  In silence the strangers followed him, when, opening a low arched door,
                     overhung densely with vines, he invited them to enter. They found themselves in
                     a lofty, oblong hall, on each side of which were stalls, or alcoves, in each of
                     which sat a youth, poring over volumes of parchment by the light of tapers; for
                     every ray of daylight was jealously excluded from this abode of learning. Each
                     one arose, saluted Semo, and, bowing courteously to the strangers, resumed his
                     studies. The venerable Druid then led them through a narrow door into a hall of
                     gray stone, lit but dimly by the few sun-rays that could force their way
                     through the impenetrable foliage without, when the wind shook the leaves. Two
                     long tables of oak extended from one end of the hall to the other. They were
                     spread with wooden bowls, small willow baskets of cresses, loaves of brown
                     bread, and huge flagons of frothing milk. While they stood near the upper end
                     of the hall, the door opened, and the youths of the schools, preceded by two
                     bards, came in, and, after offering the strangers seats of honor, sat down and
                     began their meal in silence, while one, more advanced in learning than the
                     rest, read an Etruscan manuscript aloud, which, being recently found beneath
                     some Italian ruin, in a sealed vase, described the voyage of the Phœnicians and
                     their discovery of Ireland. Clotaire modestly partook of the plain fare spread
                     before him, and could scarcely disguise his astonishment to see the Arch-Druid,
                     seated at the lower end of the table, listening with interest to the narrative
                     of the adventures of these hardy mariners over the midnight seas. But Ulric of
                     Heidelberg indignantly crumbled the brown bread on the trencher, and pushed
                     back with a look of contempt the crisp water-cresses, while his eyes wandered
                     up and down in search of wine. Not one word of the precious manuscript did he
                     hear, and he was fain, when the gnawings of hunger became insupportable, to
                     swallow a bowlful of milk.
                  In a few hours afterward they were, with Semo and a party of Druids and bards,
                     in the saddle, on their way up toward the Shannon, where between wild and
                     craggy headlands it dashes out into the Atlantic.
                  "Hist! Sir Clotaire of Bretagne! how dost thou feel after thy breakfast of
                     cresses and black bread? There is no serf in thy province but fares
                     better."
                  "Feel? Better than thou, Sir Ulric, after thy ill humors at the student's fare!
                     By Apollo! but the milk thou didst drink was not long in turning to curds in
                     such a proud stomach!" replied Clotaire, laughing.
                  "Sir bard," said Ulric, turning with a sullen look to Abaris, who at that
                     moment reined up his steed close by, "pardon a stranger, but tell me, is
                     abstemiousness a rule of obligation in the schools of Erin?"
                  "Abstemiousness the most rigid. The human mind progresses but slowly without
                     temperance and moderation. The greatest enemy to intellectual excellence is
                     sensuality. But be of good cheer. Thou wilt soon learn to enjoy the brown bread
                     and frothing milk, the sweet fish from our loughs, the mutton from our
                     hill-sides."
                  "Mutton! oh!" ejaculated Ulric, with watering mouth.
                  "Sometimes, on high festivals of TIENNE and NAOM NERF, the rule is somewhat
                     relaxed: wine and game and white bread are allowed. We always fare
                     alike," replied Abaris, laughing.
                  "I hope there are many of these festivals, sir bard; for, to confess the truth,
                     I have been used to spiced boars' meat, venison, fowls, pastries, and wines,
                     from my boyhood hood up: hence this
                     sort of fare will inevitably cause my death," said the Saxon, moodily.
                  "Let some less ignoble foe do that, Count Ulric; and see that thy death-wound
                     is not in thy back," exclaimed Clotaire, with disgust.
                  "Count of Bretagne, dost thou dare insinuate that I would fly from a foe?"
                     cried Ulric, fiercely, as he wheeled his horse around so suddenly that the
                     noble animal fell back on his haunches.
                  "I mean that he who is afraid of black bread will surely be afraid of a
                     stronger foe," cried Clotaire, laughing gayly.
                  "Semo sends for the stranger called Ulric," said an attendant, running between
                     the two.
                  "Let it lie there for the present!" exclaimed the Saxon, throwing his gauntlet
                     to the earth, while he grew white with rage; "but remember——"
                  "Let mine keep it company!" replied Clotaire, chafing, as he dashed his down
                     beside it. "We will abide our time. Friends or foes, as ye choose, Sir Ulric of
                     Heidelberg. My levity is my misfortune," he continued, turning to Abaris, who
                     had been an interested spectator of the scene, which developed leading traits
                     in the characters of those who had been confided to his care.
                  "Moderation in words is no less excellent than moderation in our appetite. But
                     spur thy horse after me toward yonder steep. Below it lies a scene of blue
                     hills, bright loughs, wild cascades, rocks, glens, woods, and waving fields,—a
                     picture so beautiful that earth has not its equal, while far beyond spreads out
                     the ocean, like a dream of heaven."
               
               
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  MONA.
                  IT was a soft, dewy spring morn. There was a glory in the thin haze that hung
                     like draperies of silver tissue over wave and shore. There was brightness on
                     the treetops, and dashes of light on the sharp cliffs that reared their high
                     and grotesque outlines over the rushing river, that swept with a wild and
                     sonorous song toward the sea. The brightness was over all. It nestled down like
                     white-winged birds into quiet, mossy glens, flashed athwart the solitary places
                     on the hill-sides, and shot far back into caverns where sea-birds reared their
                     young. Flower and shrub and heath filled the air with sweetness, while the
                     winds, riding down on the crested waves, sounded like an army with banners.
                     High up on a rocky promontory, which hung beetling and hoary over the estuary,
                     stood a marble temple, with noble porticoes, lofty pillars, and statues of fine
                     proportions, which gleamed out clear and distinct against the deep blue of the
                     sky. It was one of the temples of NERF, where, at stated periods, her
                     mysterious rites were celebrated by Druids and vestals,—vestals of the moon,
                     who, like the Roman vestals of a later time, bound themselves by vows of the
                     most sacred character to the observances of the service of the temple. The
                     midnight rites were over, and the vestals were at liberty to wander through the
                     sacred groves, or visit the caves where the sacred fires were kept burning.
                  
                  In a cavern which was almost inaccessible, and which seemed detached from the
                     mainland, so far did it hang over the eddying and whirling tide, two vestals
                     were reposing on the moss-grown rocks,—resting, after their fatiguing and
                     perilous ascent. Their robes of white and silver, girdled about the waist by a
                     zone of gems, flowed loosely around them. One was veiled, and, with her
                     forehead leaning on her hand, was silent. The other, panting and flushed, threw
                     back her veil for air. Far back in a sheltered niche, on a tripod of silver,
                     burned the sacred flame, strong and bright, but fitfully, as the wind, in
                     gentle eddies, sighed past it.
                  "The flame needs no feeding to-day, Dairene," said the unveiled one, bending
                     over it. And never shone a vestal fire on a lovelier face. An exquisite
                     regularity of features filled with expression, a complexion whose stainless
                     purity blended with the hue of the rose, eyes large, dark, and radiant, and
                     hair as black as the raven's wing, flowing in glossy waves far below her
                     waist,—with neck, arms, and hands of the most statuesque form,—combined to make
                     her a creature of rare and matchless loveliness. "And as this flame trembles
                     and seems as if it would fly if it were not bound by unchangeable laws, so I
                     feel ofttimes a yearning wish to escape toward something high and pure and
                     holy,—only, Dairene, I know not how. Canst thou tell me?"
                  "What is higher or better, Mona, than the pursuit of virtue? And what
                        holier state canst thou wish than the service of NERF NAOM?"
                     replied Dairene, lifting her veil and disclosing an old but sad face. "It is a
                     novelty, child, thou art seeking. But beware: vestals should avoid all that is
                     foreign to their vocation."
                  "But oh, Dairene, I am so weary!" cried Mona, throwing herself at Dairene's
                     feet and leaning her cheek on her knees.
                  "Weary, Mona? Weary of what, child?"
                  "Of—of—I know not what," she replied, with a gush of tears.
                  "A vestal of Nerf—one who will in a few days be admitted into the inner shrine
                     of the temple—shedding tears and complaining of weariness! Why, child, thou
                     hast done nothing to-day but put fresh garlands on the statues. A child might
                     have done that, and not been weary," exclaimed Dairene, in undisguised
                     amazement.
                  "Didst thou know my mother, Dairene?" abruptly asked Mona.
                  "Know her? Yes: she was my sister. But talk not of her, Mona: never more
                     breathe her name. She was a vestal of the temple," said Dairene, with quivering
                     lip.
                  "A vestal! How? Oh, dear Dairene, tell me all," besought Mona.
                  "It is too horrible for thee to hear, child. And, more-over, if Semo should
                     know that I ever spoke to thee of thy mother——Hush, child! I fear to
                     speak."
                  "Nay, Dairene, Semo can never know it. Tell me. If thou dost not, I will ask
                     Semo," said Mona, with a firm and resolute tone and manner.
                  "NERF NAOM! Ask Semo! Child, such a question would be death. But, if thou wilt
                     hear the story, listen," said Dairene, pale and agitated.
                  "Thanks, dear Dairene," said Mona, gently, while she wound her arm caressingly
                     around her. "Now go on."
                  "Thy mother," whispered Dairene, "was a vestal of yonder temple. She broke her
                     vows. She disappeared,—no one knew when or how. It was only known that she went
                     in to keep vigils before the shrine, and never was seen afterward: then
                     horrible things were whispered, and all was mystery. But one bright morn a
                     little babe was brought and laid among the lotus-flowers and roses which we had gathered and thrown in
                     heaps on the floor of the vestibule of the temple, to make garlands for the
                     statues. None knew whence it came; but I, more curious than the rest, found in
                     a corner of the robe that was folded about the little one the name of 'Ioline,' traced in blood. Searching along the
                     embroidered margin, I discovered another clue in these words:—'This night
                        I die.' I knew all then. She was the solitary flower of my life; I
                     had loved her,—oh, Mona, thou canst never conceive the love I bore that
                     faithless one; but, child, she had stained the honor of her caste, she had
                     polluted the dignity of the temple, and had Semo ordered me to she a the the
                     knife in her heart I should have done it,—yes, O Ioline, I must have done
                     it,—and died.
                  "That night the Druids wanted a spotless victim for the rites, and the babe,
                     they said, was a waif which had been sent by the gods. Messengers came and
                     lifted it from the couch where it was sleeping, and bore it away. I heard its
                     frightened wail as they rushed through the long, cold passages with it. Then I
                     folded up my heart like a withered thing, watered neither with tears nor
                     feeling, and thrust it far back under the shrine of memory; for I was a vestal
                     of Nerf, and what were these weak human emotions to me?
                  "But the child was spared. It was said that when Semo was about to plunge the
                     sacrificial knife in its throat it stretched out its hands to him, and smiled.
                     He sent it away, and offered a young lamb in its stead."
                  "What became of the babe, then?" asked Mona, whiter than the lilies on her
                     bosom.
                  "It was reared in the temple. She is now a vestal of Nerf."
                  "And the child's mother?" said Mona, shivering.
                  "Nothing certain was ever heard. We only know that, if a vestal of Nerf
                     violates her vows, a horrible fate awaits her," said Dairene, sadly.
                  "And I am the child of that mother who perished in mystery?"
                  "Thou art! thou art!—child of my loved and lost Ioline!"
                  Mona bowed her head on her knees, while her black tresses fell like a mourning
                     veil around her, and wept bitterly. Dairene, silent and sad, looked out over
                     the foaming estuary toward the bright ocean, where thousands of white-winged
                     sea-birds were glancing in the sunshine or skimming the rolling billow. The
                     spray that dashed up against the cliffs was not colder or more briny than the
                     tears that dripped over her faded cheeks.
                  "I dreamed of her last vigil. I thought at first it was Nerf Naom; but now I
                     know it was my mother," said Mona, at last.
                  "How canst thou tell?" asked Dairene.
                  "Was she not tall and slender as the mountain-ash? Did not her hair, brown and
                     soft, fall, waving over a brow of snow, to her very feet? Were not her eyes
                     large and black, like those of a timid fawn? And her voice—oh, Dairene! was
                     there a voice in all Erin like it? Oh, I know—I know it was my mother!"
                     exclaimed Mona, clasping her hands.
                  "Tell me thy dream," said Dairene, mournfully.
                  "It was three nights ago. The horns of the moon tapered toward the zenith, and
                     I was crowned with poppies, and conducted by the vestals to the anteroom of the
                     inner shrine, to keep vigils preparatory to my initiation. All was silent and
                     solemn. The statues of LATONA and NERF, as the pale moonlight shone down
                     through the narrow windows on them, seemed full of life: their heads bent
                     toward me, their arms were opened as if to embrace me. A great awe fell on me,—an awe like that
                     which comes with a shadow and touches the heart with ice. While I sat thus,
                     silent and breathless, low, sweet music stole on my ears: the soft strains
                     filled the air like the fanning of beautiful wings. It was nothing earthly,
                     Dairene. Then the door—that door studded with pearls and emeralds—of the inner
                     shrine, where none but the initiated enter, opened noiselessly, and a pale and
                     beautiful one, draped in white and silver tissue, came out and glided toward
                     me. There was no sound of rustling robes; but whenever her feet touched the
                     floor it looked as if she trod in moonlit water. Almost dead with fright, I
                     could not remove my eyes from hers, as she approached me; but, when she stooped
                     over and kissed my forehead with lips like those corals which are brought from
                     Indian seas, a warm thrill coursed down to my heart, filling it with ineffable
                     calm.
                  "'Follow me, Mona,' said the white-robed one. 'Follow me, child of my
                     bosom.'
                  "She took my hand and raised me up. Then out of the temple, on—over the crags,
                     through the forests, along over strange moors, through fairy raths, along steep
                     hillsides and deep glens and dreary wilds, we sped, until we came to a sea,—a
                     leaden sea, whose waters rolled in great sullen billows and floated up without
                     a sound on the shore. Beyond, we could see dark clouds, through which flashed
                     incessantly lurid and ghastly lights, hanging low down along the horizon, which
                     chased each other with solemn murmurs, like ghosts of the mighty slain.
                     On—on—on toward the leaden sea we sped.
                  "'I dare not go with thee, strange and loving one,' I said, shrinking back.
                  "'Fear not,' said the white-robed one, gathering me close to her bosom. 'Those
                     billows, which seem so terrible, will not harm thee.'
                  "Then on we sped again,—over the dark sea,—gliding with a swift and easy
                     motion, like a sea-bird when it floats on the wind-tide, until we reached the
                     shore over which hung the gloomy clouds. It was a shore of solemn twilight,
                     where lotus-flowers nodded to the waves and the long rank sedges moaned to the
                     sighing winds. All was silent; only now and then a voice of lamentation,
                     swelling on the air, reached our ears. Then I saw processions, and groups, and
                     solitary ones,—sages, kings, philosophers, and poets, all earth-born,—glide
                     past; and the only sound they uttered was a wailing cry of 'How long? how
                     long?' Pale lights flickered over the shore while they passed onward, still
                     crying, 'How long? how long?'"
                  "Mona, thy dream, if dream it was, is strange and mysterious," said
                     Dairene.
                  "We paused not long on this darksome shore, but sped away over heights
                     precipitous and grand, above which the clouds were tipped with gold,—through
                     vales of beauty and flowers, where strange and glorious beings wandered, who,
                     turning to salute us as we passed, inquired if we were earth-born,
                     then went on their way, also sighing, 'How long? how long?'
                  "'For what are they sighing?' I asked.
                  "'For deliverance, which will come to them through ONE ye know not of.'
                  "Then on we sped, until a deep, broad gulf lay before us. No eye could fathom
                     its depths; we could only hear the roar of sluggish waters far below; but
                     beyond it, resting on its marge, was a rim of light, so glorious and splendid
                     that no mortal eye could bear its rays. Above it hung a rack of wild, black
                     clouds, so heavy and motionless that I thought they were a range of bleak
                     granite hills.
                  "'It is the dawn,' said my guide,—'the dawn of deliverance.'
                  
                  "Then, gathering me again to her bosom, we sped over the abyss, under the
                     barrier of cloud, into a region so full of light and loveliness, where
                     creatures of such perfect and glorious beauty were passing to and fro to the
                     sound of harmonies indescribable, that I fell prostrate, adoring and loving the
                     source of such mystic splendor. And yet we were only on the suburbs of this
                     celestial land. There our journey ended, my guide had whispered. While, filled
                     with silent ecstasy, I lay with my forehead to the earth, I heard one say,
                     'Arise!' I lifted my head, and, lo! coming toward me I beheld ONE of marvelous
                     and divine majesty, whose eyes, filled with pity and tenderness, looked on me.
                     He seemed to be a royal personage, or perhaps the ruler of the land; for, as he
                     passed along, all bowed, and paid him homage, with songs of adoration which I
                     could not understand. And yet, O Dairene, instead of a jeweled crown He wore a
                        coronal of wounds, from which shot forth celestial glories,
                     while from His outspread hands dropped blood like a fountain, which seemed to
                     fall in showers of gold to the earth, making the waste places glad and the
                     barren spots to rejoice. And I saw that His feet had been pierced; and, as the
                     wind lifted His robe, I saw an open wound in His left side, through which I saw
                     a vision of multitudes who had sought shelter there. He plucked a palm-branch
                     and laid it in my hands. Then the vision faded. Methought I was in a cavern,
                     into which the sea was dashing with a horrible roar. I was pursued by phantoms
                     arrayed like Druids, who led on wolf-dogs to devour me. I looked toward the
                     temple. It was blazing; while NERF NAOM descended from her pedestal and seized
                     a burning brand and rushed toward me, leading on my foes; but the waves kept
                     them at bay. When, filled with anguish and terror, I awoke, I was lying on the
                     broad marble step of the pedestal on which stands the statue of Latona, with
                     the bright sunshine around me."
                  Mona ceased speaking, and covered her face with her veil.
                  "Strange things have happened in the temple, Mona, even in my day," said
                     Dairene,—"things so strange and terrible in their auguries that I dare not
                     speak of them. But it is no harm to tell legends. The older vestals talk of
                     them; and it is even said that Semo trembles when they are told; but I don't
                     know."
                  "What are those legends, Dairene?" asked Mona, in a voice of deep interest.
                  "I will tell thee one,—the one which is recorded in the Sheancus-More.*
                      Once, when the Baal-fire was blazing upon the plains of Tara, and the
                     high mysteries of TIENNE were being celebrated with great pomp and splendor,
                     when the Druids, and bards, and kings, and princes, and nobles, all in their
                     magnificent robes, marched into the sacred grove to assist in the solemnities,
                     a sudden darkness overspread the earth; the sacred fire was extinguished, the
                     ground shook, and there was a sound in the air like the roaring of wind and
                     wave. Priests and people fled together in wild affright to the open plains,
                     expecting every instant the destruction of Nature. But at last the darkness
                     dispersed, Nature once more smiled serenely; and the multitude, still pale and
                     trembling with an unknown horror, resumed each one his station and duty. After
                     consultation in the great hall of Tara with the Druids, the king directed the
                     Arch-Druid to go to the temple and consult the oracle and ascertain the meaning
                     of this elemental disturbance.
                  
                     
                     *Psalter of Tara.
                  
                  "It was done; and, while the multitude without were waiting in breathless anxiety and awe for the
                     answer, the Arch-Druid appeared on the portico of the temple. His face was
                     whiter than his hair, and his voice, usually loud and sweet, was piping and
                     tremulous, as he imparted to the assembly the decree of the oracle.
                  "'In the country of the Jews,' he began, 'they are putting to death the Son of
                     God, their king, who came to reign over them and bring salvation to the
                     nations.'
                  "Then a cry of horror filled the air; the people beat their breasts and tore
                     their hair when the Deicide was announced to them. They felt that a malediction
                     was over the earth. The King of Ulster, in his rage, rushed through the sacred
                     grove, hewing and hacking the trees, and rallying his knights of the Red Branch
                     around him, to march to the kingdom of the Jews and avenge the death of a
                        God.*
                     
                  
                     
                     *Carey.
                  
                  "But, while marshaling his knights in order and denouncing the Jews, an old
                     wound in his head opened, and he fell dead."
                  "A glorious death! But, Dairene, who is God? And why should Jesus Christ His
                     Son die? Is not a God powerful and mighty? Does it mean TIENNE, Dairene?" asked
                     Mona, anxiously.
                  "I can tell thee no more, Mona. That is the legend; but I have heard," she
                     whispered, looking fearfully around her, "that since then the oracles have been
                     dumb."
                  "Let us go, Dairene! This is a fearful thing. He must be a mighty one to whose
                     power the oracles submit," said Mona, going toward the mouth of the cave, and
                     shading her eyes with her hands as she looked in the direction of the temple.
                     "I see a cavalcade winding up the steep leading to the temple."
                  "It is Semo. Come away!" cried Dairene, gathering her veil around her.
               
               
                  CHAPTER V.
                  THE ALTAR AT MIDNIGHT.
                  THE day before the cavalcade of Druids and bards arrived at the temple of Nerf,
                     toward sunset, Ulric of Heidelberg and Clotaire of Bretagne, apparently on
                     friendly terms, had wandered away from the halting-place, arm in arm, as the
                     others thought, to explore the fair and romantic scenes which stretched out on
                     every side around them. But, heedless of gold-tinted trees, or of purple rocks
                     where rich vines flaunted their gay yellow flowers, they followed in silence a
                     narrow wolf-track, which led them down into a deep and narrow glen, where,
                     throwing off their embroidered togas and drawing their keen Saracen blades,
                     they prepared for deadly conflict. After a few passes, the lithe and graceful
                     Clotaire, who was accomplished in the use of arms, gained such an anvantage
                     over the blundering Saxon, who plunged and beat the earth and air like a wild
                     bull, that, after inflicting a flesh-wound on his thigh, he, by a skillful
                     sleight of hand, disarmed him, and, pressing him back against the rocks, held
                     him completely at his mercy.
                  "Thou art fairly vanquished," said Clotaire. "In good faith, and according to
                     the laws of chivalry."
                  "Vanquished? Yes! As to fairness, if the sun had not slanted into my eyes and
                     blinded me, thou wouldst have naught to boast of," replied Ulric, sullenly.
                  "It is thy right, sir count, to claim another trial, if thou art not satisfied. I am at thy service,"
                     said the other, proudly.
                  "To give thee another advantage to boast over? It is, methinks, no proof of
                     chivalry to offer fight to a wounded man!"
                  "Nay, Count of Heidelberg, I am no boaster. I forgot thy scratch. Here; take
                     thy cimetar, and let us be friends," said Clotaire, holding out his hand.
                  "Thou hast vanquished twice, sir count. Thou wilt forget my disgrace more
                     readily than I; but I accept thy gage," was the Saxon's reply to the noble and
                     chivalrous forbearance of his adversary.
                  Ere they reached the temple the following day, the young Count of Heidelberg
                     had apparently forgotten the quarrel and encounter of the evening before; while
                     Clotaire, in his frank and joyous nature, rejoiced that the animosity which he
                     had provoked by his sarcasms was so short-lived. Indeed, he frequently
                     reproached himself for his levity, and behaved with more courtesy to his
                     companion, nor meddled again with his peculiarities. But deep down in that
                     Saxon heart, like a bolt that has sped into a burning crater, glowed the insult
                     which he had not the courage either to forgive or to avenge; and he only, with
                     crafty pretense, bided his time, to inflict a deadly blow on the head of him
                     who had stung him. But he evinced no outward signs of his jealous hatred, and
                     those who merely looked on the surface thought they beheld in the intercourse
                     of the two a renewal of the friendship of Castor and Pollux.
                  "There is good news for us to-day, sir count," said Ulric to Clotaire, who was
                     loitering along the picturesque shore. "I have been seeking thee in every
                     direction for an hour past."
                  "News from home?" said Clotaire, eagerly, lifting his bright, expectant
                     face.
                  "If the winds could talk, we might have news from home. No. But it will please
                     thee—even thee—well to hear it," replied Ulric.
                  "Had I wine, I would offer a libation beforehand for it," said Clotaire,
                     laughing. "As it is, I will pour water on the sands in token of my thanksgiving
                     to the gods for good tidings." And he dipped his hand in a small pool at his
                     feet, and, with a graceful gesture, threw the clear water from the hollow of
                     his hand on the earth. "Now for thy news."
                  "Thou dost know that Abaris, the bard, is of the royal house of this province
                     of Munster. The stronghold on yonder height belongs to his father, and is
                     governed by his brother, the royal heir, who sends us greeting, and an
                     invitation to a wolf-hunt and feast to-day."
                  "I will not quarrel with thy news; for, in sooth, it stirs up the blood in my
                     veins to hear of a hunt once more," exclaimed Clotaire, with flashing eyes.
                     "But Semo! what sayeth Semo?"
                  "Intent on the rites of the temple, he consents to our going under the
                     protection of Abaris, who, you know, is not a Druid, but as gallant a bard as
                     ever touched harp or falchion. But here he comes in search of us."
                  "We must speed without delay to Innistore, nobles," said Abaris. "The Clana Doagha
                     *
                      are assembled, and wait our coming: the beagles are unleashed, and the
                      wolf-dogs howl to be on the scent of the quarry," said the noble bard.
                  
                     
                     *The Knights of Munster.
                  
                  "But our weapons? We have no weapons, noble Abaris," said Clotaire.
                  "Weapons? Targe, shield, and spear are in the halls of Innistore. Our steeds
                     paw the earth and champ their bits
                     beyond the temple walls. They snuff the chase, and are impatient to be
                     gone."
                  And with fleet steps the three sprang up the steep rocky paths leading to the
                     temple, and, almost breathless with eagerness and haste, leaped into their
                     saddles, and coursed like the winds toward the stronghold of Innistore.
                  Under the massive arch of the great portal of Innistore stood the noble and
                     handsome Prince of Munster, waiting to be the first to offer welcome greeting
                     to his stranger guests. A knight of the Golden Collar,—an order conferred only
                     on those of royal descent,—he wore his honors bravely. His large blue eyes and
                     yellow hair, his cheeks glowing with health and manly exercises, his broad
                     shoulders and fine athletic figure and noble air, made him a fine type of the
                     higher classes of his countrymen. His finely-proportioned limbs were covered
                     closely with purple cloth. A braccon, or
                     vest, of saffron-colored silk, fastened with large emeralds set in gold,
                     covered his breast; while the close sleeves of a flowing mantle of some fine
                     and glossy fabric gave him all the advantages he could desire in the use of his
                     arms. Over the whole was thrown a fallung, or
                     cloak, of ample dimensions, which, after he had received his guests, was taken
                     away by an attendant. Arm in arm with the young Count of Bretagne, and followed
                     by Abaris and the Saxon, he led the way into the great hall of Innistore, where
                     tables loaded with viands of every description, and wines from every clime
                     flashing in the light, were spread beneath banners and other trophies of
                     victories of the past. Knights and squires and mail-clad men were standing in
                     gay groups through the hall: there was an animated hum of voices, the inspiring
                     music of harps, the rattle and ring of arms, and a general hum of expectancy
                     and pleasure. But there was a hush when the prince entered with his guests,—a
                     hush which lasted only long enough for him to introduce them to the company;
                     then uprose such a clamor of greeting and welcome that, alarmed, Ulric of
                     Heidelberg, with his eyes fixed on the great smoking rounds of venison, laid
                     his hand on the hilt of his dagger, while Clotaire, overjoyed to be once more
                     among his peers in age and rank, gave himself up to the excitement of the hour,
                     and won his way to every heart by his frank and noble demeanor.
                  After the feast began the chase, over hill and dale, over moor and brae, until
                     the echoes rang with the shouts of the hunters and the baying of their
                     hounds.
                  As the sounds grew fainter in the distance, the vestals of the temple, released
                     from their tasks, sought the shade and shelter of the sacred grove, to enjoy an
                     hour of relaxation in innocent sports and converse. Far down, where the wood
                     skirted the shore, Mona, pensive and alone, was wandering. Her mood was
                     mystical and dreamy; and, to avoid the merriment and light-hearted jests of her
                     companions the vestals, she had stolen away, and ran she knew not whither,
                     until, reaching a little knoll, she saw through a narrow vista the distant
                     ocean gleaming in the sunshine. All was silent there, except those sweet sounds
                     which tranquillize the soul in solitude. The moan of the ocean, the chirp of
                     birds over their new-made nests, the soft rustling of leaves as the wind stole
                     through the branches, made low, sweet music; and Mona, tired and spent, threw
                     herself down on the budding moss, where, yielding to the influence of the
                     scene, a tranquil but unutterable sadness stole over her. Her dream haunted
                     her; Dairene's legend troubled her: she felt that she was on the eve of some
                     wonderful event, which threw its shadow over her soul. Suddenly there was a
                        crashing of branches near her,
                     and, starting round, she beheld a savage wolf, with red eyeballs and frothing
                     mouth, fixing himself couchant for a spring
                     toward her. With a wild cry of alarm, she sprang up, and, leaning backward
                     against a tree, clasped her hands on her breast, defenseless, and fearing to
                     breathe or move, lest she should feel those deadly fangs fastening in her
                     throat. Her veil was thrown back, and her hair, bursting the gemmed fillet that
                     confined it, fell in wild disorder around her. Her face was white and ghastly,
                     yet, with its expression of deadly anguish, was surpassingly beautiful. The
                     wolf glared on her, sure of his prey. She closed her eyes. He leaped toward
                     her; but, ere he reached her, a spear, aimed with unerring skill, had
                     penetrated the side of his head and cleft his skull. Mona fell senseless to the
                     earth, and her deliverer, rushing forward, lifted her in his arms and bore her
                     rapidly along until he reached a thread-like tarn that rippled down over the
                     rocks into the mossy pool blow.
                  Never before had Clotaire of Bretagne seen loveliness so rare and perfect;
                     never before had the sight of woman inspired him with such tenderness. He
                     touched her face lightly and reverently, as he threw back her hair to lave her
                     forehead. He could not tell why, but to gaze on those beautiful and motionless
                     features made him feel almost guilty of sacrilege. He held his hand under the
                     waterfall, and was in the act of sprinkling Mona's face again, when a hand was
                     laid heavily on his shoulder, and a voice, in accents of alarm, whispered,—
                  "Fly! My brother Abaris approaches! She is a vestal of Nerf."
                  It was the Prince of Munster who spoke the warning. Ulric of Heidelberg was
                     with him, gazing down with a rude and triumphant expression on the insenible
                     Mona.
                  "I may not leave her thus, be she what she may," cried Clotaire, gathering the
                     folds of her veil over her face. "I have just rescued her from the fangs of a
                     ferocious wolf."
                  "This is madness, sir count. It would destroy her to be found thus. Ha! she
                     revives!"
                  Mona opened her eyes, and, finding herself leaning on the bosom of a stranger
                     and surrounded by knights, she uttered a low cry, and, covering her face with
                     her hands, sprang away, and was soon lost to view in the overhanging gloom of
                     the woods. By this time the wolf-dogs had found the carcass of the savage beast
                     they had been chasing all day, which, with loud yelping and deep-mouthed cries,
                     they tore and tossed. On Mona sped,—up the cliffs, along the narrow footpaths
                     skirting the sea, until she reached a range of high overhanging rocks which
                     jutted out, a picturesque headland, into the frothing surges. Drenched with
                     spray, on she went, over the jagged rocks and slippery ways, until the startled
                     sea-birds flew shrieking and circling around her,—until the wild weird
                     commotion of the surf beating on the cliffs and rushing up into the narrow
                     caverns which indented the shore shut out the echo of the deep-mouthed baying
                     of the dogs and the shouts of the hunters. Then she paused, gasping, panting,
                     and trembling, and looked eagerly around for a place of shelter, when she
                     espied near her a narrow opening, which seemed to lead far back into a deep and
                     irregular cavern. Into it she crept, and, to her great joy, saw, far back, a
                     lamp burning in a niche, which threw a pale light around. Going toward it, she
                     discovered a nook in the wall of the cavern, heaped up with dried leaves and
                     moss, on which she threw herself, exhausted and fainting, and soon a soft
                     slumber stole over her. She did not know how long she had slept, when she was aroused by voices speaking
                     near her in low, muffled tones. Scarcely breathing, she listened.
                  "It is nearly midnight, and they are not here yet."
                  "If the tide is not too high, they will surely come."
                  Then Mona heard no more for an instant or two, for the wind roared through the
                     cavern, filling it with spray. Then, as it subsided, she heard the words
                     "sacrifice," "polluted," and "death;" and, folding her hands over her bosom,
                     she thought of her mother, and prepared to die, feeling assured that those who
                     were speaking were emissaries of the Druids, who had tracked her hither for
                     terrible and mysterious purposes. They spoke again.
                  "I will wait a few moments longer. Arrange the altar-stone, and place the
                     tapers on it. I will uncover the crucifix and sacred vessels."
                  "Oh," thought Mona, wringing her hands, "what horrible fate awaits me? I dare
                     not speak. All is mystery! Oh, hapless Mona! Oh, faithless vestal!"
                  "I hear them coming! Hark! one,—two,—three! There are four of them," said
                     one.
                  "Welcome, my children!" said the other, who now came forward a little, in full
                     view of the trembling Mona, who saw, as she crouched farther back, that he was
                     a venerable stranger, of noble and benign aspect; and while those who
                     approached him—a woman, a youth, and two men, all closely muffled—knelt at his
                     feet, he spread his hands over them, saying, "May He whom ye have to adore be
                     thy reward!"
                  "The holy names be glorified forever!" said one of the men; "but we had danger
                     and death to grapple with on our way. The Druids and people are out searching
                     for one of the vestals of yonder temple, who, it is feared, has been lured off
                     by a demon. Some say they saw a Banshee shee flying over the rocks at sunset;
                     but we, who cared little for the clamor, pretended to join the search for the
                     protection of our lives, and finally reached here in safety, thanks be to the
                     Father, to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost!" continued the man, reverently
                     crossing himself.
                  "Awful words! What mean they?" gasped Mona, shuddering. "Oh that day-dawn would
                     come, that I might return to Dairene!"
                  "We have brought our son Cormac to receive the waters of baptism, which thou,
                     holy Finian,*
                     hast promised he shall receive to-night," said the woman.
                  
                     
                     *St. Finian, one of the precursors of St. Patrick.
                  
                  "Dost thou believe, Cormac, in God the Father, Creator of heaven and earth?"
                     said the venerable man, turning to the youth who stood modestly before him.
                  "I believe," was the response.
                  "Dost thou believe in Jesus Christ, His divine Son, who, coequal with the
                     Father, was born for our redemption and died for our salvation, and who, rising
                     from the dead, ascended into heaven, where, at the right hand of the Father, He
                     liveth to make intercession for us?"
                  "I believe," answered the lad, earnestly.
                  "Dost thou believe in the HOLY GHOST, the Lord and Giver of Life, who
                     proceedeth from the FATHER and the SON, who together with the Father and the
                     Son is adored and glorified,—the third person of the adorable Trinity?"
                  "I believe."
                  "It is well, O beloved son, that our God has in his infinite mercy blessed thee
                     with the gift of faith! When the holy mysteries are celebrated, and the others
                     receive the bread of eternal life, I will pour on thy head the sacred waters of
                     regeneration, which will make thee one with us in the household of Faith," said
                     the holy man, turning toward the
                     rude altar, which was now arranged in order for the celebration of the holy
                     mysteries. On it, and leaning against the dark-gray walls of the cave, was an
                     ivory crucifix, before which stood a chalice and paten of gold, covered with a
                     rich veil of silk fringed with pearls, and four lighted tapers of wax, whose
                     sharp rays falling on the ivory Christ revealed all the awful beauty of its
                     chiseled agony.
                  "It is He!" whispered Mona. "It is He! Those outstretched hands,—those
                     wounds,—that awful crown! O UNKNOWN! O lovely and sorrowful One, save me!"
                  Then, silent and awe-struck, the poor vestal folded her hands over her bosom,
                     and watched with eager, burning eyes the celebration of the divine mysteries.
                     From her niche she saw it all, but could hear nothing; for the tide was up, and
                     the surf was foaming through the abysses and rents below, with a deafening
                     roar. When the holy Finian, adoring, elevated the stainless Host, beneath whose
                     mystic veil the humanity, the divinity, and the unmeasurable love of a God are
                     hidden,—when those present bowed their heads to the rocky pavement to pay Him
                     homage,—a sense of the presence of a mighty power overshadowed Mona's heart.
                     Her dream, and all that Dairene had told her,—the legend,—the holy name of
                     God,—the death of Jesus Christ,—all seemed blended together with this midnight
                     mystery. She could not define her sensations: the Spirit of God was breathing
                     over the darkened waters of her soul, but she knew not what it was: she only
                     felt that henceforth the temple, the sacred fires, NERF, and the Druids were
                     less than nothing to her,—that there was a higher and a diviner Truth, which
                     she must find,—that the Deliverer of whom she had dreamed, and the Christ of
                     whom she had heard, were one and the same being, whom not to know was eternal
                     loss.
                  "They will leave me here in darkness, and will perhaps never return again; or I
                     may be discovered by the emissaries of Semo and die in my ignorance," whispered
                     Mona, as she saw the venerable Finian turning to leave the altar. "O life! what
                     art thou, compared to the joys of the celestial realms of the Deliverer? Rather
                     lose all—life itself—than such glorious hope!" And, obeying the supernatural
                     impulse that governed her, she glided forward, downcast and trembling, and fell
                     at the feet of Finian, imploring his compassion.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  THE VESTAL OF CHRIST.
                  "SHE is a vestal!—one of the vestals of NERF!" exclaimed one of the men,
                     starting back with a look of horror.
                  "Who art thou, and what dost thou here, poor child?" asked the good Finian, in
                     a gentle and compassionate voice.
                  "I am Mona the vestal. I was pursued by a ferocious wolf, and fell into the
                     hands of strange men, from whom I escaped and fled hither for safety," she
                     replied, meekly.
                  "She will betray us to the Druids! Let her perish, O Finian! Better that one
                     pagan should die than that scores of Christians be destroyed," exclaimed the
                     man.
                  "Better, O my son, that a score of Christians receive the crown of martyrdom
                        than that one soul should perish," replied the saintly Finian,
                     pointing to the crucifix. "Remember Him who, betrayed by one of His own
                     household, insulted and abused by His foes, expired in cruel torments on the
                     ignominious cross for the love of us, who knew Him not. Let us imitate His
                     divine example, and count all things—even life itself—as nothing for His dear
                     sake! We will protect thee, trembling one, and return thee in safety to thy
                     home."
                  "I have no home. All that I have seen and heard to-night makes me an outcast
                     from yon temple which was my home. But who are ye, who would
                     suffer death for me so willingly?" said Mona, amazed at the noble sentiments
                     she had heard.
                  "We are Christians," replied Finian.
                  "What is that? Do ye worship Tienne and Nerf?"
                  "We worship ONE who is mightier and holier than Tienne,—God, the Creator of
                     heaven and earth. Tienne is only the element of His power, the creation of His
                     hands, who, if He so willed it, could be darkened and hurled away from the face
                     of the heavens forever. Nerf is one of His lesser creations, subject also to
                     Him, who is the Supreme Lord of all!"
                  "A mighty God!" whispered Mona, with awe. "A mighty God! And He whom ye were
                     adoring, whose bowed head and outstretched arms and wounded side bespeak some
                     great sorrow,—who is He?"
                  "The Son of God, who, to save mortals from the wrath of perdition which their
                     dark ingratitude and sins merited, took on Himself the form of man, and tasted
                     of suffering and death for their deliverance. A man of sorrows, and afflicted
                     with griefs, He became our brother, making all who believe co-heirs with Him of
                     the kingdom of heaven."
                  "The Deliverer! Oh, noble,—oh, generous,—oh, divine act! Cannot I also believe
                     and adore Him?" she asked, eagerly.
                  "Not if thou dost worship false deities and place faith in demons; for such are
                     the oracles on whose revelations thy priests rely. Our God is a jealous God,
                     and will have no other gods before Him," replied Finian.
                  "I spurn all that is false, O holy man! Why should I worship the untrue? Let me
                     do homage only to the true and living God," said Mona, with simplicity and
                     earnestness.
                  "Thou art ignorant, poor child, of the dreadful doom that awaits thee if it is discovered by the
                     Druids that thou hast forsaken the worship of the temple to become a Christian.
                     Torments, and a slow, lingering death by fire, amid diabolical rites, would be
                     the penalty of thy offense. What sayest thou now?" asked the good Finian, while
                     all listened breathless for her answer.
                  "I could but die," said Mona, while her dark eyes brightened, and a smile lit
                     up her face like a glory,—"I could but die for the love of Him who died for
                     me."
                  "Blessed art thou, O child, in thus receiving from Almighty God the
                     supernatural gift of faith! Blessed art thou in being willing to suffer stripes
                     and death for the love of Jesus Christ!" cried the holy Finian, spreading his
                     hands over Mona's head. "To-morrow seek me here; and, after instructing thee, I
                     will give thee Holy Baptism, without which no man shall see God.
                     Afterward thou shalt learn all the mysteries of our holy faith,—a faith whose
                     fruition is immortal life and an eternal perfection of bliss."
                  "I know not how to thank thee. A new world opens around me, through which I
                     see, dimly, fair visions like those I beheld in my dream," said Mona, in a low
                     and gentle tone. "But whither shall I go? Except the temple, I have no home on
                     earth. Shall I abide here?"
                  "Here, poor child? On this barren and deserted rock?" asked Finian.
                  "I fear not solitude. Except this, I have no shelter on earth."
                  "We come hither at stated times to celebrate the holy mysteries and administer
                     the divine rites of our faith; otherwise it is lone and deserted."
                  "Lady," said the mother of the boy who was to receive baptism, "I am a poor
                     fisherman's wife, used to hardship and danger, and, if thou wilt, can remain
                     here with thee. My son shall bring us provisions and keep guard about us until
                     a better place is provided for one so gentle and fair."
                  "Thanks, mother," said Mona, humbly kissing the rough hand of Lena, the
                     fisherman's wife; "thanks!"
                  "Thy wit is ever ready, Lena," said her husband. "I, like the pagan I used to
                     be, was for throwing the dark eyed maiden over the cliffs into the sea, fearing
                     for our lives; but thou—ah, thou dost know how to be a Christian indeed. Thou
                     wilt bring blessings on my poor roof."
                  "Silence, Stephen!" she said, with a smile: "thou dost forget the orphan sons
                     of him who was thy foe, who now live, fed and cherished beside thy hearth! It
                     is true, father: they were left bare and homeless, and Stephen brought them in
                     his arms, wrapped in his fallung, and, in the
                     name of Christ, bade me be a mother to them."
                  "God's blessing be on ye both, my children! Go on: emulate the virtues of the
                     saints, and in this holy strife keep the soul's eye fixed singly on Christ
                     Jesus, who will be your exceeding great reward. Take care, good Lena, of this
                     the wandering lamb of His fold, who sighs to enter the peaceful pastures of
                     which He is the Shepherd. It was a happy thought, and a courageous one, to
                     remain with the maiden. Now, Cormac, art thou ready to receive holy
                     baptism?"
                  "Yes, father, I am ready," replied the boy, coming forward.
                  Then all gathered around the saintly man, while he administered the sacrament
                     of baptism to the youth, explaining, as he proceeded, every part of the
                     solemnity, until it was over and Cormac was declared to be a son of the Church.
                     "These life-giving waters have erased the stain of the fall; thy soul, purified
                     and regenerated now, is clothed in a
                     white garment, which see, O son, that thou carry unspotted to the judgment-seat
                     of Christ." Then the little band knelt down, while he gave them his blessing,
                     after which they dispersed, leaving Mona and Lena alone in the cavern.
                  "Rest thee, lady," said Lena, shaking up the moss and spreading her gray cloak
                     over it. "Try and sleep. I will watch beside thee till morning."
                  But, like a tremulous lily swayed to and fro by a soft wind, Mona's soul, full
                     of new and holy thoughts, could not rest: there was no repose for it. One
                     moment, like the flower, it was lifted upward, then in its weakness and sweet
                     humility bowed earthward; now it turned to the shadow, now to the sunshine, but
                     all the time diffusing fragrance which floated upward to its newly-discovered
                     Lord in praise and thanksgiving.
                  "What is baptism, Lena, and what the stain of which the holy man spake?"
                  "Gentle lady, I am poor and unlearned, and fear I cannot in my humble language
                     make plain my meaning," replied Lena, with humility.
                  "Thou art not so ignorant, O Christian, as I! Until this hour I have been in
                     darkness. Then tell me what I ask, concerning that stain which only the waters
                     of baptism can erase," said Mona, gently.
                  "That stain, noble lady, means the pollution of our natural state. When the
                     great God created heaven and earth, He created man, a pure being, in His own
                     image and likeness, and also a woman, unsullied and innocent, a companion for
                     the man. The delights of the new earth were theirs,—communion with God and
                     companionship with angels. They daily walked with the fair sons of God, and
                     held the scepter of dominion over the realms in which He placed them. But the
                     great foe of God and man—the devil—gained entrance into that kingdom of peace,
                     and tempted those favored ones, the father and mother of our race, to an act of
                     disobedience; and, transgressing the law of their Creator, they fell from their
                     pure state, brought sin and death into the world, and closed the celestial
                     gates of heaven. Driven from the glorious home of their innocence, the guilty
                     pair wandered forth into a bleak and barren world, repentant, and practicing
                     the works of penance in labors and suffering. But all creation groaned and
                     travailed for deliverance. The race of man, which had multiplied on the earth,
                     walked in the shadow of death and withered under the malediction of the Most
                     High, until, moved to pity, He so loved the world as to give his only begotten
                     Son to die for our salvation. He came,—Jesus the Deliverer. He opened a
                     fountain of living waters, in which the soul may be cleansed from the pollution
                     of the fall. He instituted a Divine faith and Divine sacraments. He died for
                     our salvation, and, rising again from the dead, ascended to heaven, where He
                     liveth to make intercession for us; and as He entered into His heavenly kingdom
                     He left wide open the celestial gates for all to enter in who believe."
                  "I believe!" said Mona, with clasped hands, while the remembrance
                     of her dream in the temple flashed over her. "Canst thou pour
                     these purifying waters over me?"
                  "Not I,—oh, no, lady! It is only those who have Divine authority to administer
                     the holy sacraments who can do it. In case thou wert dying, and no help at
                     hand, then it would be lawful; but not now."
                  "Dost thou know," said Mona, laying her small white hand on Lena's cheek, where
                     it lay like a snow-flake,—"dost thou know that I feel within me a new life,—a
                     something grand and beautiful, which rises up, and up, and up, until, lost in
                     starry realms, I hear strains of delicious cious music, and see forms of light, like white
                     birds with the sunshine on their wings, flash by me? What is it?"
                  "It is thy soul aspiring after immortality. But hark! What sounds are those,
                     lady?" said Lena, starting up, and creeping toward the mouth of the cave,
                     whither Mona followed her. Looking down along the shore, they saw crowds of
                     men, who held aloft blazing torches, hurrying to and fro, peering among the
                     crevices and rocks, and skirting the border of the woods, in search of
                     something lost. Loud shouts mingled with the wild howl of the unleashed
                     beagles, who coursed up and down, tearing and tossing the sands, in search of
                     the trail, which at a certain point the surf had washed out. As they came
                     nearer, she heard them shouting, "Mona! Mona! Mona! where art thou?" and saw
                     Semo, his white hair floating on the wind, almost frantic, directing the search
                     here and there.
                  "They seek me!" said Mona, sadly.
                  "And should they find thee, lady, what wouldst thou say?"
                  "I would say, I am no longer a vestal of Nerf, but a vestal of Christ," she
                     replied, firmly. "But see!—see!—they come nearer: they will find their way into
                     the cavern. I cannot die without baptism. Behold! they turn their footsteps
                     hither. Quick! quick, Lena!" she cried, in tones of anguish.
                  "O God! if it be for Thy glory and our salvation, save us, Thy weak servants,
                     in this hour of peril, and forgive the meanest of Thy little ones if, in the
                     moment of tribulation and death, she pours the waters of regeneration on this
                     child, who wishes to belong to Thy kingdom," said the holy woman, lifting her
                     eyes to heaven. Then, stooping down, she scooped up a handful of water from a
                     hollow in the rock, and was about pouring it on Mona's head, who knelt, meekly
                     and pale, at her feet, when suddenly the clamor ceased, the beagles were off on
                     a false scent, and, coursing down into the woods, were followed by Semo and the
                     yeomen of the temple, and the shore was left dark and lonely, with no sound to
                     disturb the solitude but the eternal moan of the restless sea.
                  The next day was dark and lowering. A fine rain driven by easterly winds added
                     to the chilly and gloomy aspect without. Within the temple all was silent and
                     dismal. In a lofty apartment, lighted only by the sacred fires burning with
                     blue and flickering gleams on their silver tripods, sat Semo, in a chair of
                     gray stone, beneath a canopy of black marble elaborately carved in foliage
                     interspersed with faces of unearthly grotesqueness. His head was sunk on his
                     bosom, while his dark robe, on which were embroidered in gold and jewels the
                     signs of the zodiac, was folded over the lower part of his face, leaving
                     visible only his broad forehead and deep-set eyes, which gleamed out from the
                     shadow of his brow like living coals. Before him stood the young Counts of
                     Bretagne and Heidelberg, with Abaris the bard.
                  "Clotaire of Bretagne, if thou wert not a stranger who came hither in good
                     faith to study in our schools,—if thou hadst any other plea than ignorance of
                     the sacred laws of Erin,—this day would be thy last," said Semo, slowly. "But I
                     believe thy story, albeit it differs in a degree from some accounts I have
                     heard," he continued, glancing toward the Saxon. "I have watched thee closely
                     the few days we have been together, and, from unmistakable signs, I
                        know that a lie is not in thee. But let not this lesson go
                     unheeded. Thy ignorance of the laws of our religion, which make it death to
                     touch a vestal of Nerf, and the act itself, which, apart from the offense, was
                     noble and chivalrous, acquit thee."
                  
                  "Venerable sage," said Clotaire, bending on one knee, "I am grateful for thy
                     clemency. But pardon me if, scorning all mean shifts and crooked ways, I ask
                     thee what is perhaps a rude question."
                  Semo nodded his head in reply.
                  "Are the vestals of Nerf vowed for life to the service of the temple?"
                  "Why askest thou, stranger?" replied Semo, looking down to hide a fierce light
                     which was kindled in his eyes.
                  "Because, if they are not, and can be released from their vows, I would pay a
                     royal ransom for Mona," he said, eagerly.
                  "Thou wouldst buy her? There are slaves in Erin, but they come from
                     Britain,—from Gaul,—from Rome. No native of the land has ever been in bonds,"
                     he replied, in suppressed tones.
                  "Enslave Mona! I would wed her!" exclaimed the noble youth.
                  "Thou wilt never wed Mona. Forget her, Count of Bretagne, forget her; or it may
                     not go well with thee."
                  Just then a wail rang wildly through the marble hall, and Dairene rushed in,
                     tearing her hair, frantic in all her gestures, and fell sobbing at the feet of
                     Semo.
                  "Why this anguish, Dairene?" he asked, in a cold and severe tone.
                  "Mona! Mona! the light of my heart is no more! she has fallen from the cliffs
                     into the sea! Here is her veil, which a fisherman found hanging on the rock
                     from which she fell! Oh, child of my age! thou art lost to me forever!"
                  "Thou hast forgotten the presence of strangers. Cover thy face, Dairene,
                     return, and hang the shrine and statues with cypress and poppies," said Semo,
                     coldly; but his lips quivered, and a shudder, scarcely perceptible, passed over
                     him; for Mona, whose life he had saved from the sacrificial knife, had been the
                     only human joy of his existence: he delighted in her as in a fair and fragrant
                     flower, which, strengthening and growing in brightness and splendor under his
                     fostering care, he had offered spotless and fresh to his deities.
                  "Ye can retire. Be ready to start ere dawn to-morrow, toward Tara," he said,
                     calmly.
                  As they left the apartment, a door at the upper end was opened by a feeble
                     hand, and a Druid, arrayed in his sacerdotal robes, entered. He was older and
                     more bowed than Semo, and there was an expression of blended fear and horror on
                     his countenance as he tottered toward him.
                  "Aged Moriat, what brings thee hither? Thy limbs are weak and faltering with
                     the weight of years. I would have come to thee," said Semo, stretching out his
                     hands, and leading him to his own chair.
                  "I may not tarry, O Semo. Strange marvels have come to pass. Calamities
                     threaten the land! The oracles but rarely reply to our invocations: they have
                     by some mightier Power been almost silenced. But to-day, when I offered
                     sacrifice to Tienne, there came a sound like the rushing of mighty wings, and
                     the sacred fires were suddenly extinguished. A heap of blackened ashes was all
                     that remained of the victim and the glowing coals on which it lay, while a
                     voice issued from the shrine,—it sounded like a wail from Tartarus,—crying,
                     'Never more! Henceforth we are chained in silence. Behold, the King enters His
                     inheritance to rule over those He has ransomed with a price. Never more!—never
                     more!'"
                  "It is an evil omen," cried Semo, wringing his hands. "Our power is departing
                     from us. Cormac gave us the first
                     blow. The second we received in the grove of Tara, when the King of the Jews
                     was crucified in Palestine, filling the earth with blackness and horror, as if
                     a God had died. The third is at hand! Woe for the priests and bards, woe for
                     the temples and shrines, of Erin!" And, covering his face with his robes, he
                     wept.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  TARA.
                  A PARTY of weary travelers was winding slowly and cautiously through a dark and
                     narrow gorge, whose outlet was concealed from view, either by an abrupt turn or
                     by the heavy mist which obscured the day-dawn. Not a word was spoken. Some sat
                     upright in their saddles, enjoying such fitful repose as only extreme fatigue
                     invites; others gazed on the blank mist which surrounded them, with a dreamy
                     and abstracted air. The very horses looked sullen and hungry, as their hoofs
                     rung on the loose pebbles and rocks which obstructed the path. An aged man rode
                     in their midst; his voluminous robes were wrapped closely around him, almost
                     concealing his face,—while his bowed head and his silent and majestic air
                     invested him with an aspect of great dignity. It was Semo, the Arch-Druid, with
                     a party of Druids, bards, and brehons, on their way to Tara, for the twofold
                     purpose of assisting at the grand festival of Baal and of being present as
                     peers of Erin at the assembly of the Estates of the nation. The two foreign
                     nobles, Clotaire of Gaul and Ulric of Germany, under the escort of Abaris the
                     bard, who had been appointed by Semo as their Mentor and associate, rode
                     together. The German wore a dissatisfied and hungry expression on his handsome
                     features, while he of Bretagne, somewhat moody, indulged in sad, fruitless
                     thoughts, which did little honor to his powers of self-control and good sense;
                     for he still cherished wild love-visions of Mona the vestal.
                  
                  "Noble Abaris," he said, at last, in a low tone, to the princely bard, "cannot
                     we spur on a little faster, thou and I? I can bear many evils with patience,
                     provided I have two things which are essential to my existence,—sunshine and
                     air. This horrible mist suffocates me."
                  "It weighs heavily on me also. Methought thou wert sleeping off some of the
                     weariness of incessant travel. But follow me. We have only to gallop to the
                     summit of the nearest hill to meet the morning in its glory," said Abaris,
                     cheeringly.
                  "Hill! Where shall we find such a landmark in a sea of vapor like this?"
                  "We, who know where those landmarks lie, can find them in the darkest midnight.
                     Follow me," replied Abaris, reining up his steed, which, obeying the signal,
                     shot forward, like an arrow from a bow, and was lost to view in the mist.
                     Pursuing the sound of his horse's feet, Clotaire followed him. For several
                     minutes they galloped on in silence over a level country; at last he found that
                     he was on rising ground, which his jaded horse ascended with difficulty.
                     Guiding him slowly up, cheered by the voice of his companion, who was still
                     unseen, he ascended by slow degrees the narrow and rugged mountain-path, until
                     he reached the summit, where he found Abaris, standing with folded hands and
                     bowed head, looking toward the east, where a golden halo, glimmering through
                     the white vapor, announced the rising sun. Clotaire dismounted, and leaned
                     against a gray rock, waiting patiently until his orisons were over.
                  "It is brighter here; but this cloudy barrier still shuts out the view," he
                     said.
                  "Be patient! I already feel the breath of the southwest on my cheek. It is
                     moving like a spirit through the earth-cloud, which is rippling and flowing
                     away like a shaded river toward a sun-bright sea. It will soon be lifted
                     heavenward, where, burnished with glory, it will canopy the path way of the
                     sun. Like the spirits of the just, who shake the dust from their robes to enter
                     into a more glorious life, it leaves this ignoble earth to bathe in heavenly
                     mysteries," said the bard, in a rapt tone.
                  "How sayest thou, Abaris? Is there another life than this, into which the just
                     pass after death? If so, what becomes of those who, while living, stain the
                     earth with their crimes?" inquired Clotaire, earnestly.
                  "They also pass into another life; but it is in the form of some ignoble brute
                     or poor insect,*
                      where they remain, enduring all the evils incident to its state, yet
                     filled with a keen and immortal intelligence which makes their punishment more
                     horrible. Thus their souls are transmigrated through progressive grades, until
                     they develop a repentance and purity and wisdom to which they were strangers on
                     earth, when they are released. Thus thou dost perceive that rewards await the
                     just, and punishments the wicked," said Abaris, fervently.
                  
                     
                     *The doctrine of Metempsychosis was one of the dogmas of the faith of the
                        Druids.
                  
                  "What is the code which must be adopted to procure the immortal life of
                     reward?" asked Clotaire, with interest.
                  "The general laws of this grand code are benevolence, tenderness, forgiveness
                     of injuries, and love of enemies. It is full of benignity and gentleness. It
                     forbids sensuality, love of pleasure, and attachment to worldly objects."
                  "And suppose these laws are transgressed,—for nature must be perfect to
                     practice them: is there no atonement?"
                  "None. We make our own destiny, whether for good or evil. But thou wilt know
                     more in proper time. The mysteries of religion must be taught in the solemn
                        gloom and silence of the temples.
                     Wilt thou listen? for the spirit of song is on me. Hear the plaint of the blind
                     and aged Oisin," said Abaris, uncovering his small, gold-strung harp, which he
                     always carried with him. He swept his hands over the keys, and to a plaintive
                     and murmuring accompaniment which was interspersed with notes expressive of
                     deep feeling, he sang, in clear and softly-modulated tones, the Lament of
                        Oisin:*
                     
                     
                        
                           "I behold, O Sun, thy beams no more,
                           Whether thy yellow hair flows out
                           On the light eastern clouds, or thou
                           Tremblest at the gates of the west.
                           Thou art not like me! Thy years will have no end,
                           Neither shalt thou sleep in the clouds,
                           Careless of the voice of the morning!
                           Exult then, O Sun,
                           In the strength of thy youth!
                           Age is dark and unlovely;
                           It is like the glimmering of the moon
                           Through the mists of the hills,
                           When thy eyes flash through broken clouds."
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     *From Barron Harrold's translation of Irish poetry.
                  
                  Then, in more stirring strains, the bard, lifting up his voice from the soft
                     recitative, sang the following anthem, while his eyes, flashing with the spirit
                     of song, gazed toward the reddening east. 
                        
                           "Whence are thy beams, O Sun,
                           Thy everlasting light?
                           Thou comest forth in awful beauty,
                           And the stars hide their heads in the sky;
                           The moon, cold and pale,
                           Sinks in the western waves;
                           But thou,—thyself,—who can be
                           The companion of thy course?
                           The oaks of the mountain fall;
                           The mountains themselves decay with years;
                           The ocean sinks, and grows again;
                           The moon herself is lost in heaven;
                           But thou art forever the same,
                           Rejoicing in the brightness of thy course.
                           When the world is dark with tempests,
                           When thunders roll, and lightning flies,
                           Thou lookest in thy beauty from the clouds
                           And laughest at the storm."*
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     *The same.
                  
                  And while the young bard's voice rang in silvery notes, floating out on the air
                     like a spirit-song, the wind freshened, and lifted the gray mist upward, where,
                     meeting the sun-rays, it brightened and glowed like flaming banners in the
                     zenith. Far below them, Clotaire of Bretagne beheld a scene of rich and
                     picturesque beauty spread out. Rath and glen, brae and knoll, all dappled with
                     the snowy hawthorn and tinted with edges of light, lough and winding river,
                     rolling lands rich with growing harvests, hoary forests, distant plains dotted
                     with cots and villages, the lofty Betagh-houses and their rich pastures and
                     roaming herds, distant crags and purple hill-sides, where proudly uprose the
                     chieftain towers and lordly strongholds, while here and there, rising like gray
                     Titans amid the landscape, stood the high towers of the Druids, where, like the
                     Egyptians and Chaldees of old, they studied the mystery of the planets and
                     exercised some of the most awful and secret rites of their pagan creed,—all,
                     bathed in undulating shadows or gleaming with crimson and gold, greeted the
                     stranger's eyes.
                  "Dius Fidius!" he exclaimed, shading his eyes with his hand, while he gazed
                     delightedly down:—"this is worth a world-wide travel to behold. But ha! on this
                     side I see a splendid city, filled with palaces of marble, over which
                     innumerable banners, whose blazonry I cannot distinguish, are unfolding to the
                     winds. Beyond, on the height of a
                     gentle eminence, I see a magnificent palace, whose splendid pillars and
                     majestic arches, whose noble porticoes and turrets of fretted marble, whose
                     lofty statues and gleaming fountains, strike me with wonder, as the dark forest
                     throws out the whole in the broad sunlight! Noble bard, do I look on Tara?"
                  "Thou art right, noble stranger. This is the city, that the palace of Tara,"
                     replied the bard, proudly. "There dwells Laogare, monarch of all Ireland, and
                     within its halls of legislation, every third year, the four provincial kings,
                     the princes, the nobles, the chieftains, the Druids, the bards, the brehons,
                     the ollahms, the commanders of battalions, and the master-artisans, meet to
                     deliberate on the affairs of the nation, repair abuses, and dispense justice.
                     It is called the 'Assembly of the Estates of Tara.'"
                  "And that palace to the right?"
                  "That," replied Abaris, with a smile, "is one of the wonders of the world,
                     which fills every foreigner with amazement. It is the Griannan-na-Nienghean, where the wives, daughters, and sisters of
                     the princes, knights, and chiefs of Tara regulate, in deliberative council, all
                     the affairs appertaining to their sex and rank."
                  "Women!" almost shouted Clotaire. "And are their decisions laws?"
                  "Their decisions are laws."
                  "Dost thou know, sir bard, that this thing, which is indeed a novelty,
                     increases my veneration for Erin? Where religion, learning, heroism, and women
                     are so highly esteemed, the people must needs be refined, intelligent, and
                     patriotic. But now pardon me, for I shall ask thee perchance a rude question;
                     but it is suggested by thy own noble and lofty qualities, to an imitation of
                     which I shall aspire."
                  "Thou art my pupil. All that I know thou mayest command," replied Abaris, well
                     pleased with the frank and courteous manner of Clotaire.
                  "Are not thy talents, thy eloquence, thy bravery, wasted in the occupations of
                     what seems to me a useless order? Why not leave music to women and troubadours,
                     as we of Gaul do, and buckle on the sword and shield of thy fathers, that thy
                     name may become glorious?" asked Clotaire, earnestly; for he had learned to
                     love the gentle bard, as well as admire his elevated character.
                  "Know, O noble stranger," replied Abaris, speaking with grave eloquence, "that
                     I would not exchange my bardic character for the most powerful throne in
                     Europe. Our functions are sublime and holy, and it is by no ordinary labor that
                     we attain to the highest dignities of our order. We are trained to arms; and,
                     though not bearing arms in the field, we excite the chieftains and soldiers to
                     valor by singing the glories of their fathers. Our persons are held sacred by
                     contending armies, who consider any injury inflicted on us a sacrilege. During
                     an engagement we animate the troops with the Rusga-Catha, and when we give the
                     sign of truce the fierce might of battle ceases, to listen to the voice of our
                     negotiations. We march with our chiefs at the heads of armies, our only arms
                     the harp, our only defense the white robes of our order. While the battle
                     rages, we stand apart, and watch in security every action of our chiefs, and
                     not only record their noble deeds, but also any dastardly act they may be
                     guilty of. Another of our important functions is, with pomp and pageant, and
                     with all the ceremony of lamentation, to bury the dead. If a prince or a chief
                     falls in battle, we utter his fame, and inscribe it in psalters for posterity.
                     The Druids perform the sacred rites, the Seanachai recites his funeral song, which is sung over his grave
                     by a Recaraide, who sustains tains his voice by striking the keys of his
                     harp, while the symphonies of the solemn ceremony are performed by minstrels,
                     who chant in chorus at intervals, in which they are joined responsively by
                     attending bards. Then we soothe the tumultuous passions of the living, and
                     impress on their minds a reverence and imitation of the virtues of the
                     dead,—their excellence and heroism.
                  "He to whom the bards refuse those last offices is deemed accursed, and his
                     spirit wanders, in darkness and gloom, through woods, morass, and fen, where
                     the piping winds blend their lament, and the Banshee's moan in terrific sounds
                     together. For these accursed ones the probation of transmigration of spirits is
                        denied."*
                     
                  
                     
                     *For a full description of the order of bards, see Mooney's very agreeable
                        and instructive "History of Ireland."
                  
                  "Pardon me, noble Abaris," said Clotaire, reverently. "Thy vocation is indeed
                     enviable. Thy order is indeed the genius of enlightened government,—a mighty
                     magician, who swayeth the minds of men at will. Brute force and brute triumphs
                     are admirable; but those who conquer and subdue without arms are worthy of all
                     honor."
                  "Our functions do not disqualify us for the highest honors in the gift of the
                     nation," continued Abaris. "The greatest and wisest of Erin's legislators and
                     kings was Eochaidh, a bard, whose reign
                     constitutes the most memorable epoch in our history. Being a prince of profound
                     learning, and wishing to unite his reverence for his order with his royal
                     dignities, he assumed the name of OLLAHM FODHLA.†
                      But let us drop these grave matters, and divert ourselves with the
                      scenes below."
                  
                     
                     †Learned Doctor.
                  
                  "By Pallas! those throngs of mortals, who in every direction are moving toward
                     Tara, with banners of green and gold, which gleam in the sunlight, only a
                     degree brighter than the robes they wear, remind me of the great tournament I
                     once saw at Paris," exclaimed the enthusiastic young noble.
                  "It is not only a fair pageant," said Abaris, proudly, while his cheeks glowed
                     and his eyes flashed, "but in all the scene you behold evidences of a nation's
                     glory and prosperity. But we linger here too long; let us hasten away to rejoin
                     Semo, who is even now approaching the south gate of the city."
                  "Shall we, Ulric of Heidelberg and I, reside with Semo at Tara?" inquired the
                     young count, anxiously.
                  "Nay, noble stranger: Semo will spend his time between the council-chamber and
                     the temple. Thou and Count Ulric will be the guests of my father, the King of
                     Munster."
                  "And thyself, Abaris:—we shall not be separated, I hope?"
                  "I belong to the temple also. My duties will leave me no time for social
                     pleasures," he replied, gravely.
                  "I shall not be so churlish as to refuse the proffered hospitality of thy
                     house, for I, like all my countrymen, am fond of the courtesies and refinements
                     of life; but—but—pardon my forwardness—are there no daughters belonging to thy
                     father's household?"
                  "I have five sisters, sir count, who are called the crown-jewels of Munster,
                     because they are as good as they are fair, and a mother whose matronly virtues
                     are the glory of her family," said the bard, with tender pride. "Of my five
                     sisters two only are at home. One is the consort of the King of Ulster; one—the
                     youngest and loveliest—is a vestal of Nerf; one is lady of honor to the Queen
                     of Laogare. Under the auspices of my mother and the two maidens who remain with
                     her, thou wilt see not only the
                     beautiful maids of Erin, but the customs and manners of our highest classes.
                     Now for a gallop over the plains of Magh-Breagh toward Tara."
                  When Semo, with his cortege, reached the gates of the city, he was met by a
                     courier from the monarch, who handed him a vellum billet, and informed him that
                     one of the royal chariots, with an escort of honor, awaited his pleasure. He
                     opened the note, which contained only a few words, and without a remark entered
                     the chariot, and was driven rapidly off toward the palace of Tara.
                  In a lofty chamber, whose walls were incrusted with Italian marble and
                     gold,—where the light flowed in through glass windows which were stained in
                     gorgeous dyes,—where chairs and couches of carved oak, inlaid with silver and
                     pearl and covered with the richest stuffs,—where from the slender pillars hung
                     draperies from the looms of Egypt and Ind,—where, under shaded arches, set far
                     back, like sacred things, were heaps of old Etruscan and Phœnician
                     manuscripts,—where stood a table covered with charts, treaties, and Milesian
                     books of law, with implements of writing in gold and silver,—where in a place
                     of honor, stood a harp studded with jewels,—was the monarch Laogare. He was a
                     tall, majestic-looking personage, who wore his kingly robes with a royal air,
                     and whose countenance indicated intelligence, frankness, and wisdom, with an
                     occasional flash in his eyes which also told of an ardent and impetuous
                     temperament. His usual expression was cheerful, dignified, and unclouded; but
                     when Semo the Arch-Druid entered his cabinet, his countenance wore a flushed
                     and troubled look. He stepped forward, and, after saluting the aged Druid, led
                     him to a seat beside his own. An attendant entered with refreshments; but
                     Semo—rigid in all the observances of his order—partook only of a thin cake of
                     wheaten bread and a goblet of water, then, turning to the king, awaited in
                     grave silence the opening of the business which had brought him hither with
                     such unusual speed.
                  "Thou wilt pardon me, venerable Semo," said the monarch, "that, having matters
                     of grave import weighting on my mind,—matters which threaten the ancient
                     institution of Erin with danger,—I have thus hastily sought thy counsel."
                  "Whatever bodes evil to Erin, O king, bodes it also to me; and whatever
                     threatens her monarch touches the soul of mine honor," said Semo, slowly.
                  "But this foe aims directly at thy order. It would overthrow the power of the
                     temple, and crush the dogmas which we inherit from our forefathers the
                     Phœnicians."
                  A shudder passed over Semo, which shook his robes; but, commanding himself, he
                     replied, in calm, firm tones,—
                  "I am old and calm! Speak out, royal Laogare; speak out; and if this evil can
                     be remedied by my counsels, they are thine. If they are powerless, let the
                        Rusga Catha ring through Tara, and the
                     foes of Erin be swept away by her chiefs, like chaff before the whirlwind."
                  "Know, then, that one who called himself Patricius has landed in Drogh-heda,
                     where the Boyne falls into the sea, and is preaching his strange doctrines with
                     such fervor that not only the people, but many of the nobles, have been
                     converted to his novel creed. He declares that the religion taught by the
                     Druids is vile and idolatrous, while the God whom he worships is powerful and
                     alone worthy of the homage of mankind."
                  Just then the door opened, and the arch-poet of Laogare entered, with alarm and
                     trepidation depicted on every feature. Not heeding the presence of Semo, in his
                     impetuous haste, he knelt before Laogare, exclaiming,—
                  
                  "Royal sir, Sesgnon, the Lord of West-Meath, with all his family, has embraced
                     the doctrines of the audacious stranger Patricius, who preaches an atonement
                     through a crucified God, and pours libations in his honor on the heads of all
                     who receive his word."
                  "Sesgnon! sayest thou Sesgnon is a traitor to the religion of his fathers?
                     Sesgnon, the bravest and most honored of our chiefs? Send hither the Grand
                     Master of the Knights of Tara. But hold, Dubtach! where hath this infidel, this
                     stirrer-up of sedition, concealed himself?" cried the indignant monarch.
                  "He scorns all concealment, royal Laogare, and is even now encamped at Firta-Fir-Tiec, on the banks of the Boyne, with his
                     disciples," replied Dubtach.
                  "Summon the Knights of Tara and the Red Branch to the rescue!" cried the
                     monarch, more than ever enraged. "I will in person lead them out to destroy
                     this man, who beards us on our very throne."
                  "Monarch," said Semo, rising, "think not that I have traveled from the mouth of
                     the Shannon to Tara without learning something of this man. A native of Gaul,
                     he was in early youth sold by pirates to one Milcho, who appointed him to the
                     care of his herds. After serving his seven years, he returned to the continent,
                     from thence to Rome, where, by his address and great art he secured friends,
                     who advanced his interests and fortunes at court. He returns to Erin as the
                     ambassador of Celestine, the sovereign of Rome, endowed with munificent gifts
                     and a patent of nobility, which gives him a rank next to emperors. Hence we
                     must be cautious. What we would withhold from the man must be conceded to the
                     ambassador. The vengeance of our outraged and insulted order could and should
                     easily crush the man, were he not invested with the robes of an imperial envoy.
                     Let us wait. He has as yet only seduced men by false doctrines; but should he
                     encroach a hair's breadth beyond the limits of his functions, let the gods be
                     avenged."
                  "Speak on, venerable Semo: thy words are full of wisdom," said Laogare.
                  "Two days hence," continued the Arch-Druid, "the Baal-fire will be kindled on
                     the plains of Magh-Breagh. Send a proclamation to Patricins, warning him that
                     all fires must be extinguished, according to the ancient laws, on that day, and
                     no spark kindled except the Baal-fire, from which alone it will be lawful for
                     him, as well as the natives of Erin, to rekindle the blaze on his hearthstone.
                     Then summon him to appear with his credentials, the following day, in the hall
                     of Tara, where, before the assembled power and wisdom of Erin, he can declare
                     his mission."
                  "Go, Dubtach, with two of the knights of Tara, and courteously give greeting to
                     the stranger Patricius, inform him of our customs, and invite his attendance
                     before the congress of Tara," said Laogare, throwing himself back, with a
                     wearied look, in his chair. Semo, gathering up his robes, glided out, to be
                     present at the rites of the temple, where they were waiting for him, and
                     Dubtach, the bard, withdrew to fulfill the commands of the monarch.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER VIII.
                  THE BAAL-FIRE.
                  THROUGH the gate of a broad marble court, Abaris, the bard, conducted his
                     guests toward the vestibule of the royal palace of his father, the provincial
                     King of Munster. Here he, in his father's name, welcomed them in courteous and
                     affable terms, after which he spoke a few words of greeting to the numerous
                     attendants who thronged with reverential affection around him.
                  "We will now seek my mother and sisters, noble sirs," he said, inviting them,
                     with a graceful gesture, to enter. Passing through an oblong hall, paneled with
                     oak, they entered an apartment in the form of a peristyle, surrounded by
                     slender pillars of polished marble. In the midst of the marble floor, whose
                     inlaid pattern of colored stones vied with the painter's skill, was a fountain,
                     which threw up toward the fretted ceiling two tiny jets of water, which,
                     issuing from the throats of serpents whose scales were of gold, descended again
                     in crystal gems over the mosses and flowers and winged myths which were
                     arranged about the marge of its artificial basin. The products of Ind and
                     Greece, statuary from the sculptors of the Cyclades, vases of silver and
                     porphyry from Egypt, loaded with spices or rich flowers, hangings of silk,
                     mirrors of steel, lamps of gold on pedestals of alabaster, enriched the
                        scene.*
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     *It must be remembered that Ireland, at this period, was the seat of
                        civilization, learning, luxury, and refinement.
                  
                  The royal matron of Munster, hearing of her son's arrival with two strangers,
                     hastened to welcome them. Indescribably tender and respectful was the demeanor
                     of Abaris toward his mother, while hers to him was full of maternal pride,
                     deference for his bardic character, and a deep, quiet air of love. She was a
                     stately matron, who yet retained the brightness and freshness of youth,
                     chastened by a dignified and graceful demeanor in fine keeping with her age and
                     station. She received the two foreign nobles, the friends of her son, the
                     guests of the nation, with a welcome so kind and cheering that it at once
                     placed them on the footing of friends. Won by the elegant grace of Clotaire,
                     and not chilled by the sullen courtesy of Ulric, she went out, and returned
                     with her daughters Eileen and Eva, to whom she made the strangers known with
                     words of commendation, after which she led the way to the eating-hall, where a
                     table was ready spread with every delicacy and substantial dish which the
                     culinary art of the day had introduced. Here Ulric of Heidelberg grew unctuous
                     and bland, and convinced Clotaire,—who generally observed his movements,
                     because he mistrusted his character,—by the dexterity with which he disposed of
                     the viands, that his vaunted heroism was all bombast, and his ruling passion
                     gluttony.
                  Conversation and music whiled the hours away until evening, when they went,
                     with the King of Munster, to pay their court at Tara to the Queen of Laogare,
                     after which they witnessed the midnight procession which opened the Bealtin
                     mysteries. The next morning the mother of Abaris invited them to accompany
                     herself and daughters to the opening of the council of the ladies at the
                        Griannan-na-Nienghean, where they were
                     dazzled by the beauty and splendor of the fair members of the council; from
                     thence to the sacred grove, where the Druids and vestals performed solemn ceremonies in view
                     of the people; after which they proceeded, in chariots, to the plains of
                     Magh-Breagh, to witness the games and races of the Athletæ.
                  Thus, in a continual whirl of pleasant novelty, two days of the great festival
                     sped by. But amid the pomps and pageants, the splendors and pleasures, of the
                     scene, the thoughts of Clotaire wore one sad hue; his heart was shaded by its
                     first grief; he had loved and lost in the same hour. As lightning sometimes
                     impresses surrounding objects on the flesh of the victim it has stricken, so
                     Mona's image, her wild, tender eyes, her splendid beauty, were indelibly
                     stamped on his memory. In every scene, in sunshine and shadow, it walked with
                     his inner life, and through its medium he saw all exterior things.
                  "Wilt thou accompany us to the procession of the vestals of Nerf to-night?"
                     asked Eileen.
                  "By all means," quickly replied Ulric. "Count Clotaire would rather lose his
                     spurs than the sight of the pageant."
                  "It is very solemn and beautiful," replied Eileen, not perceiving the covert
                     sneer, "though the vestals are all veiled, and we can only imagine the
                     loveliness and youth they have vowed to Nerf."
                  "Are those vestals never seen unveiled, Count Clotaire?" urged Ulric, with a
                     malicious sneer.
                  "It depends entirely on circumstances, I presume, Count Ulric. Thou art aware
                     that there are sometimes imperative circumstances which will not even allow the
                     chastisement of insolence. Inexorable events may also tear off the drapery from
                     the vestal's brow," he replied, pointedly.
                  "Are the vestals of noble birth, or are they chosen from the people?" inquired
                     Ulric, turning to Eileen, to hide his confusion.
                  "Some are of noble birth,—a few of royal parentage. Many are the daughters of
                     the people. We have a sister who is a vestal of Nerf Naom."
                  "A sister! It seems to my rude understanding that there are only three things
                     in Erin to which all pay undivided homage,—religion, learning, and
                     hospitality."
                  "Yes, we pay homage to these; but they are not, believe me, the only objects of
                     our veneration," she replied, smiling. "But tell me," she continued, as the
                     Count of Bretagne led her sister to the harp; "what is this mystery about the
                     vestal?"
                  "Only a little amour of the Count of Bretagne's, of which he is ashamed. He
                     managed to see one of the vestals of Munster without her veil, and became
                     desperately enamored of her charms. Unfortunately for him, she disappeared, and
                     he has been wearing the cypress ever since," he replied, in a low, sarcastic
                     tone.
                  An expression of horror shaded Eileen's face as she glanced toward Clotaire,
                     who, all unconscious, stood beside her sister, turning over the music as she
                     played; and, after a few remarks on indifferent subjects, she left the room to
                     seek her mother, to whom she imparted the news she had just heard. Ere long a
                     messenger came with a courteous apology to the two nobles, and a request to the
                     Lady Eva to attend her mother, who was going to the palace of Tara on a visit
                     to the queen. Chagrined and disappointed, Ulric cursed his stupidity and the
                     malice which fell so speedily back on himself, while Clotaire, glad to be
                     released, and happy in the prospect of solitude, hurried away to indulge his
                     sadness by watching the vestals and thinking of Mona!
                  The next day was the grandest of the festival. Thousands sands and tens of thousands, in holiday attire,
                     came in from hill and valley, from country-side and their homes by the distant
                     sea, and congregated on the plains of Magh-Breagh. Tara emptied its thousands
                     on the plain. From the banks of the Boyne, from the north and south, they still
                     came, with pealing music and waving banners. With the braying of trumpets, the
                     shrill scream of the pibroch, the softer
                     notes of harps, and the anthems of human voices, they swept on,—a human
                     ocean,—and surrounded the lofty altar, built of long narrow slabs of white
                     marble, piled together, which towered like an isle of rock-crystal in the midst
                     of the plain. The monarch, attended by his consort and family, the provincial
                     kings and their families and retinues, the nobles and chieftains, in chariots
                     whose adornments were of precious stones and the trappings of whose horses were
                     links of silk, and gold, wound slowly—a splendid cortege—through the
                     multitudes, toward it. There was a temporary throne, covered with cloth of
                     gold, erected near the altar of Baal, on which the royal Laogare, surrounded by
                     his court, took his station, in view of the vast concourse, who made the welkin
                     ring with their shouts of fealty when they saw him standing crowned and robed
                     in splendor, the protector of their own and their country's destinies.
                  Each individual carried either an unlighted taper of wax, or a torch of
                     resinous wood. Some of these were carved and twisted in grotesque forms; some
                     were decked with flowers; some were moulded in the shape of birds, from whose
                     beaks the oiled wick hung like a worm, others in the form of serpents, from
                     whose open jaws it protruded like a tongue, while others, more elegant, were in
                     the shape of flowers, the wick spread out in their cups like delicate stamens.
                     However much these tapers and torches differed, they were all intended for one
                     object, which was to get light from the Baal-fire, to kindle the flame on their
                     darkened hearth-stones.
                  The city was deserted, and more than a million of human beings were out in the
                     plains of Magh-Breagh,—men of all ranks, ages, and climes,—to witness the
                     solemnity. There was another feeling, besides reverence for the rites of their
                     religion, which increased the interest of all present in the ceremonies. All
                     had heard of Patricius and his doctrinal innovations. His tents on the banks of
                     the Boyne were distinctly visible, and a rumor had gone abroad that he would in
                     some signal manner show his contempt for the Bealtic ceremonies. At last,
                     winding like a solemn current through the dense crowds, the Druids, bards, and
                     brehons, led by the Arch-Druid Semo, moved along, to the sound of rolling
                     anthems and deeptoned symphonies, toward the marble altar; while the human
                     masses, pressed back on either side, like receding waves, made a clear pathway
                     for them, paying them lowly homage as they passed. The Druids, arrayed in their
                     magnificent robes, wrought with gold and blazoned with gems, their flowing
                     locks crowned by the square caps of their order, with grave looks and majestic
                     mien walked together in ranks of two and two.
                  The bards followed, arrayed in loose white cothas, confined about the waist by girdles, their limbs incased
                     in a truise of weft fitting closely and
                     fastened about the ankles with stripes of the exact number of colors peculiar
                     to their order, their beards flowing, and their long thick locks bound with
                     fillets of gold, with their harps hanging pendant before them, and received
                     from the people, who believed them to be gifted with the powers of prophecy, a
                     homage but little inferior to that they offered the Druids. After them came the
                     brehons, or historians, clad in the
                     distinctive dress belonging to their rank, and followed by the sacerdotal
                     attendants and scholastics.
                  Meanwhile, Laogare, elevated by his position in full view of all, was observed
                     to look pale and troubled, and threw more than one anxious glance toward the
                     tents of the stranger, where all was silent and motionless.
                  Semo, bowed and faltering, assisted by two Druids, who bore between them, on a
                     tray of gold, the fagots, tinder, and implements for kindling the sacred fire,
                     ascended the steps of the altar, and, having reached the broad platform on top,
                     stood with his head and hands uplifted, adoring the bright object of his
                     worship A hush, like the silence of the dead, fell on the hosts around, who
                     with breathless awe watched his slightest movement. He held in his hand a
                     framed crystal; and, after his assistants had arranged the fagots and tinder,
                     he held it—uttering incantations all the while—so as to intercept the direct
                     rays of the sun, now beaming on the scene in unclouded glory, and concentrate
                     them into a powerful focus. In a few moments a light wreath of white smoke
                     curled upward: it was wafted away, leaving in view a clear, high flame of fire,
                     which burned steadily and brightly. When the people saw it, a tremendous shout
                     of exultation rent the air. A burst of music, the clangor of trumpets, blended
                     with the roar; but suddenly it was hushed: a wild fear and fury seemed to have
                     fallen on all, when they saw Semo, ghastly, and shaking in every limb, with his
                     arm outstretched toward the tents of Patricius, where, blazing fiercely and
                     brightly, a large fire flamed up in the air.
                  "Behold, O son of Niall," exclaimed Semo, turning to Laogare,—"behold, sons of
                     Heremon and Ir, how the daring stranger defies our sacred law and throws his
                     infidel scorn on our most solemn rites. If those flames are not extinguished
                     and trodden out, I tell thee, O king, that he who kindled it, and his
                     successors, will hold the sovereignty of Erin forever."
                  "Venerable Semo," cried Laogare, in loud and distinct accents, "the fire thou
                     hast drawn from heaven is sacred. That which hath been kindled by yon stranger
                     is common flame, which imparteth neither curse nor blessing. From its light the
                     fires of Erin will not be rekindled. Therefore let it burn to ignoble ashes,
                     while we light our torches at the sacred fires of Baal."
                  The Arch-Druid bowed his head, and another wild shout rolled upon the air, like
                     thunder.
                  "To-morrow," continued the monarch, "this stranger shall answer for this insult
                     to the representatives of all Erin, who will assemble in the great Hall of
                     Tara, where he must either plead a good cause or suffer the penalty."
                  Laogare then gathered his robes about him, and, ascending the altar, adored for
                     a moment, then held the point of his scepter, around which a taper of wax was
                     twined, like a serpent, to the Baal-fire. When he withdrew it, and held it up,
                     a small, strong flame was blazing on its point. This was the commencement of
                     lighting up the hearth-stones of the kingdom from the Baal-fire. All who could,
                     ascended and lit their tapers, or flambeaus, on the altar; those who were less
                     fortunate contented themselves with the privilege of borrowing from a neighbor,
                     quite satisfied to know that it all came from the same source; until the whole
                     of that immense throng was supplied with a portion of the sacred fire, which
                     they bore away rejoicing to their respective homes.
                  Meanwhile, the fire of Patricius burned low,—the white ashes were borne away like seeds on the
                     wind; but it touched the roots of a dark mythology, whose branches it would
                     wither and consume. In its ruddy light the Baal-fire had paled its demon glow;
                     and, although the people knew it not then, it was to them as much a sign of
                     promise as was the pillar of fire in the wilderness to the Israelites.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IX.
                  PATRICIUS.
                  THERE were to be no public processions that night. In the hidden recesses of
                     the temple, before mysterious shrines, the awful and concluding rites of the
                     festival, on which no profane eye might look, were to be celebrated. But from
                     the turrets and halls of Temora,*
                      from the palace of Tara, and from the city festive lights blazed out on
                     the night, while the light sounds of music and mirth floated in sweet, wild
                     echoes through the air. The streets, garlanded with flowers and brilliantly
                     illuminated, presented a scene of unequaled gayety and splendor. Every door was
                     thrown open, and every portal wreathed with evergreens and roses. Ladies
                     attired in silken robes which blazed with jewels, and attended by groups of
                     nobles, princes, and knights, all arrayed in the magnificent and distinctive
                     insignia of their respective orders, thronged the streets, saluting each other
                     with pleasant words of recognition and many a gay jest, as they visited from
                     one house to another, remaining a short time at each, uniting in the dance or
                     song, exchanging words of cheer and greeting with friends, then flitting away
                     to some other scene of splendor and hospitality. But in all of these gay
                     assemblies might be seen groups of noble and grave
                        
                        *The palace of Laogare, the monarch.
                      men who discussed in low and impassioned tones
                     the events of the day,—the audacious stranger whose tents were pitched on the
                     banks of the Boyne, the prophecy of Semo the Arch-Druid, and all that would
                     probably occur on the morrow, when Patricius, obeying the summons of the
                     monarch, presented himself before the Assembly of the Estates.
                  Amid all this whirl of hospitality and festivity, the palace of the King of
                     Munster was probably the center of attraction. The beauty of the ladies Eileen
                     and Eva, and the presence of the two foreign nobles, whose adventures and
                     personal appearance rumor had exaggerated into something almost fabulous,
                     attracted there the largest and most splendid company in Tara.
                  Since the morning, Clotaire of Bretagne had noticed and felt a marked change in
                     the conduct of the royal ladies of Munster toward him; but, unconscious of
                     offense, and stung by the cold courtesy of their manner, and also nettled by
                     the self-complaisant and patronizing air of Ulric the Saxon, who seemed to be
                     in high favor, but who was wise enough to present no tangible point of offense,
                     he withdrew from the brilliant circle to search for silence and solitude. The
                     sight of beauty crowned with roses, the sound of music ringing out the full
                     expression of the heart's poesy, the fairy, whirling, flashing dance, the
                     dazzling lights, the lightsome jest and merry laugh, oppressed him; and,
                     feeling all the sadness and isolation of a stranger in a strange land, although
                     many a bright eye sought his, and many a beauteous face smiled on him to court
                     a word or glance from the dark and noble stranger, he fled from it all, and
                     wandered out beyond the gates of the city, across the plain, toward the river.
                     There all was silent and dark. The pale glimmer of the stars over the scene,
                     the sound of waves as the Boyne swept onward to the sea, added to the solemnity
                     of the hour. Wrapping his toga closely about him, he quickened his pace, and,
                     without an object except solitude, reached the shore of the river. Seeking a
                     sheltered spot, which he soon found beneath a clump of willows whose long,
                     green tresses swept the dark tide below, he paused to rest.
                  On the opposite shore a glimmer of lights suggested to him, for the first time,
                     thoughts of the stranger from Rome who had that day mocked the power of the
                     Druids and showed his contempt for the superstitions of their old and
                     time-honored creed. And then, in the midst of that gloom and silence, where,
                     free from the brawl and battle and seductions of life, Nature uttered her
                     oracles, the mind of the young noble, ever open to the inspirations of good,
                     began a new life. His soul, insensibly led by its eternal affinities, soared
                     beyond the material boundaries which the world assigned it, and panted after
                     supernal strength and wisdom. He reviewed the magnificent pageant of Baal.
                     Again he saw a nation surrounding that lofty altar, which now looked so white
                     and ghastly beneath the stars. He saw the splendor of royalty, the chivalry of
                     nobles, the wisdom and intellect of the age there assembled to pay
                     superstitious reverence to a rite which they held sacred. He saw the
                     Arch-Druid, the sage and virtuous Semo, the dispenser and enthusiastic
                     high-priest of the mythology he taught, ascend the sacred pile, while below,
                     breathless and awe-struck, a people waited in expectation for the kindling of
                     that flame which they, in their docile faith, believed came from heaven. Then
                     he remembered the pause, the thrill, the horror which pervaded this grand array
                     of temporal and spiritual majesty, when from the rising ground of Firta-Fir-Tiec, before the tent of PATRICIUS, a
                     bright flame, full of defiance ance
                     and scorn, shot sky-ward, a sign and warning to all who saw it. Who had done
                     this? A Cyrus or an Alexander, with hosts of legionaries to support and defend
                     the aggression? Had the barbarians from Britain, led on by their Roman masters,
                     poured their wild hordes upon the wave-washed shores of Erin, and marched
                     hither to throw down the gauntlet of war on the plains of Magh-Breagh? It was
                     none of these. Behind those tents lay no army. There were no hosts encamped
                     under the shelter of yonder hills. Only PATRICIUS was there. A single man! A
                     preacher of novelties and strange doctrines, and a scornful witness of the
                     sacred rites of the religion of the land,—a defiant enemy of the old and
                     cherished faith which their fathers had brought from Phœnicia! The idea arose
                     to sublimity. One man against hosts of men! who had come, avowedly not to
                     assail mere opinions, but to destroy their temples and overthrow their
                     altars.
                  "Dius Fidius! he is a brave philosopher, this Patricius! He must be either
                     reckless of life, or fully conscious of a power that no human will can
                     withstand. He is, no doubt, the master of great secrets. If he has faith in the
                     superior excellence of his philosophy,—if he has discovered higher and brighter
                     aims for man than those now known,—by the stars! it is godlike to offer himself
                     to be immolated for the truth. If he is an impostor, seeking greed and power
                     and courting success by audacity, there is still something grand and heroic in
                     his daring: Hercules himself dared nothing greater. Shall the lesson be lost on
                     me? Shall I, the descendant of heroes from remote antiquity,—conscious fully of
                     all that I owe to the higher laws of virtue and morality,—with every instinct,
                     I hope, full of good aspirations and truthful energy,—with the pride of a noble
                     race, and the ambition to add a brighter link to the ancestral chain, warming
                     my blood,—shall I sink ignobly down beneath the first storm of my life? Shall I
                     die piping out my griefs because a blight has fallen on my heart? No, O Fate!
                     No, O Mona! Over thy ashes will I raise a worthier fame! Inspired by thee, O
                     lost love, will I consecrate my life to acts of heroic virtue, until, like
                     Patricius, I can stand serene and fearless in the strength of my own power.
                     Ha!" exclaimed the young noble, suddenly thrown on his guard by the sound of
                     approaching footsteps. He turned quickly, and saw a figure, muffled in a gray
                     cloak of ample dimensions, standing beside him.
                  "Who art thou, wandering beyond the city gates at this hour?" demanded the
                     stranger.
                  "I deny thy right to challenge me, sir stranger," replied the noble
                     stripling.
                  "I am one of the guardians of the honor of Erin, and demand the reason of thy
                     close neighborhood to the tents of the audacious Roman stranger."
                  "A close neighborhood, truly! Between us flows a broad, brawling river, over
                     which are no bridges and on whose tide I see no curraghs. Dost take me for a
                     bird or a fish?" said Clotaire of Bretagne, with fierce sarcasm.
                  "I know thee to be a stranger. To-day a stranger insulted the assembled majesty
                     of Erin. I know thee, Count Clotaire of Bretagne!"
                  "Having no reason to be ashamed of my name, and with a good blade to defend it,
                     I am Clotaire of Bretagne!" exclaimed he, drawing his Damascene
                     blade from its sheath and standing on the defensive. "Stand back, sir stranger:
                     I am armed. Stand back!"
                  "Forward is my motto, sir count!" said the stranger, throwing off his fallung, while he sprang on him with an agile
                     movement, and threw his arms around him in such a close embrace that the Saracen blade was
                     useless. A scuffle ensued, during which the nocturnal assailant acted entirely
                     on the defensive, and enraged his opponent still more by giving vent, several
                     times, to a low, mirthful laugh.
                  "Think it no discourtesy," he said, when at last, by a successful coup-de-main, he held the stripling count at his
                     mercy,—"think it no discourtesy, my pupil, if I have tested thee somewhat
                     roughly——"
                  "Abaris," exclaimed the young count, dropping his cimetar,—"Abaris, thou hadst
                     need to humble me thus,—to test my capabilities for self-government, of which I
                     have been dreaming like a fool. But why seek me thus, noble Abaris?"
                  "I sought thee not. Chance led me this way, and, hearing the sound of a voice
                     which I thought I knew, I came hither with a noiseless step, and heard thy
                     dreams, and determined to assure myself that they were not the dreams of an
                     idle boaster. But I have been wishing to speak to thee all day, but could find
                     no opportunity. A message might have been useless. Thou hast an enemy,—a
                     bitter, implacable enemy."
                  "In Ulric of Heidelberg! I know it," he replied, calmly.
                  "Yes. Already has he poisoned the hearts of my family against thee by his
                     extravagant and insidious tales about thy adventure with Mona the vestal. But
                     listen: be calm. This Ulric is a dastard; and what punishment couldst thou
                     inflict on such a thing which would be worthy a noble nature like thine? Thou
                     must either beat him like a dog, or murder him; for he has not the courage to
                     fight. For the honor of knighthood, thou wilt not do either; for the mere
                     gratification of the baser impulses of vengeance, thou shalt not be led into
                     crime. Leave him to me,—the craven! I will strip him until his designs are
                     apparent, and expose him to the contempt and ignominy he merits; for in this
                     land of ours treachery to friend or foe is ever visited with a wrath that
                     withers the marrow in the bones,—a silent and stern wrath, which makes a leper
                     of its object and drives him from the haunts of his kind."
                  "He shall unsay this wrong! By Thor! he shall unsay this foul lie!" shouted
                     Clotaire.
                  "Can a serpent heal the wounds his poisonous fangs have inflicted? Give him—thy
                     contempt. Let him feel that he is powerless to harm thee," said Abaris. "Think
                     not that I have been idle. I sent my father to Semo to hear the truth. Be sure
                     that thy fair fame did not suffer; for Semo regards thee with unusual favor. By
                     this time my mother and sisters know all, and feel pained on account of their
                     coldness toward thee. Thou art already avenged; for this craven knight was a
                     pretender to the hand of my sister Eileen, who will now spurn him; for her
                     high, proud nature would rather mate with an adder than with such baseness. As
                     to Mona, forget her. Such puling grief is unmanly."
                  "I may not forget Mona. I would not forget her. She is lost to me, in one
                     sense, forever; but the thought of her, like some fair thing throned amid the
                     stars, will lead me, lure me to build high my aspirations, until the deeds they
                     give birth to are as pure as Mona," exclaimed the young noble, with anguish on
                     every feature.
                  "It is a bright myth; and Death effaces the sacrilege," said Abaris,
                     thoughtfully. "If, then, O Clotaire, my friend, the thought of the dead Mona
                     inspires thee more fully with that active principle of good without which the
                     longest life is valueless, cherish it. The softer emotions of our nature need
                     discipline, equally with the baser
                     passions: whatever feeds them insidiously exposes the noble soul to the dangers
                     of sensuality," replied the bard, with an air of grave affection.
                  "Noble Abaris, let thy superior wisdom be my safeguard," replied the young
                     noble, with proud humility. "Thou art always calm, and canst well guide the
                     reins of my impetuous will."
                  "Calm! Am I calm now?" asked Abaris, abruptly.
                  "As calm and as cold as yonder sky," replied Clotaire.
                  "Thou art deceived. My impetuous nature is only chained by a powerful will,
                     which makes the pursuit of virtue its chief aim. But that which passed to-day
                     on the plains of Magh-Breagh has roused all my inner self to a fierce
                     perturbation. I would have avenged by one fell blow the outrage of this daring
                     Patricius, who now seeks by stratagem what the Romans of other days sought by
                     violence. Even now those lights which dance mockingly from his tents over the
                     dark waves of the Boyne, rouse up the chained menials of my will to tumult and
                     violence. But what a comedy is individual wrath against such monstrous
                     provocation! Erin shall never be dishonored in me. It shall not go down to
                     posterity that one of her bards was the assassin of a defenseless stranger,
                     although that stranger hath come with guile and insult to the foot of our
                     throne and our altar."
                  "But why heed so despicable an enemy, O Abaris? He is alone and defenseless.
                     What is there to fear?"
                  "That which human power cannot sway," replied Abaris, gloomily. "Yon stranger
                     fills my soul with trouble. Even now there is wailing and weeping in the temple
                     for the woe his coming foreshadows. He must be possessed of knowledge beyond
                     mortal sense; or how dare he, unattended except by a few fanatics, and unarmed
                     armed, throw open contempt on the Bealtic rites? If he is a mere spy, all will
                     be well. But come with me."
                  In another moment the Count of Bretagne was seated, with Abaris the bard, in a
                     curragh which lay moored among the sedges on the river-bank. Abaris grasped the
                     oars and pushed out from the shore. The oars bent beneath the sinewy strength
                     of his arms, the light curragh shot out across the mid-channel, riding the
                     waves like a feather, and in a little while glided up on the sands of the
                     opposite shore. Everything about the little camp of Patricius, toward which
                     they directed their steps, was wrapped in silence and repose. After searching
                     around in vain for some indications which might betray him as a spy or invader,
                     and reconnoitering every inch of ground, without the least interruption, they
                     retraced their steps in silence, when suddenly the curtain which hung before
                     the entrance of the tent of Patricius was drawn aside, and a person came
                     hastily out, who, forgetting to replace it, passed into one of the tents in the
                     rear. Standing back in deep shadow, Abaris and Clotaire, without being
                     themselves exposed to observation, saw all that was in the tent of Patricius.
                        They saw him, and wondered at his majestic and benign aspect,
                     his noble air and intellectual features, and the symmetry of his
                     well-proportioned frame. He was arrayed in the rich and flowing vestments of
                     the Roman patricii, and wore, suspended by a
                     chain of gold, an insignia of jewels and gold on his breast, which Abaris
                     thought resembled those crosses which the Egyptians revered as emblems of
                     immortality. He was refolding a parchment, which he secured carefully with
                     cords of twisted silk, after which he knelt before a rude altar, on which stood
                     a crucifix and taper, and, folding his hands, bowed his head with an expression
                     of great humility, after which he made a sign on his forehead, breast, and shoulders, which they could not
                     comprehend, and uttered rapid and fervent words in a language which they could
                     not distinguish, while his eyes, uplifted, seemed to behold objects beyond
                     mortal vision. They creep nearer,—for they see that he is so wrapped in
                     adoration that he would not heed them if they stood before him,—and listen.
                     They both understand him now, as, in the chaste and majestic language of Rome,
                     he pours out the eloquence of his pleading soul for Erin. How he beseeches his
                     Lord, whom he calls JESUS, to enlighten their darkness, to strike off their
                     fetters, to overthrow the idols and abolish the power of demons in this His own
                     inheritance! How he implores the assistance of a Holy and Divine Spirit, of
                     whose existence they have never heard, and beseeches Him to touch his lips with
                     fire, that on the morrow he may preach salvation to the Gentiles, and, like
                     Paul at Athens, make known to the rulers and princes of the people a crucified
                     God.
                  Abaris, intent and silent, almost breathless, leaned forward, the fine
                     lineaments of his face so motionless and pale that they looked like chiseled
                     marble, while his large eyes glowed beneath his massive brows like living
                     sparks. But Patricius uttered no more. His uplifted face wore a look of rapt
                     contemplation, while his features shone with a light that was flowing back and
                     forth, between heaven and him, like a tide of glory.
                  "It is time for us to be gone," whispered Abaris.
                  "Dost thou still feel troubled?" asked Clotaire, as they glided swiftly through
                     the gloom toward the shore.
                  "More than before,—a thousandfold more than before," replied Abaris, in an
                     agitated voice. "To whom does he pray? Whence the light that beamed around him,
                     like the light of a new day beaming behind the eastern hills? He is some mighty
                     enchanter or wondrous prophet! Already I feel the shadow of stupendous changes.
                     Quick, Clotaire!—I am oppressed! I suffocate!—Away from this spot!—out, out on
                     the foaming river! The wind rushes down on the flood tide—quick! out with the
                     oars.—There—so! There!" he said, or rather gasped, as they threw themselves
                     into the light curragh, which, unmoored, was swept out by the violence of the
                     tide, and danced about like a bubble on the foaming river. A few powerful
                     sweeps of the oar steadied it, and turned its prow shoreward.
                  When they landed, it was nearly day-dawn. The herdsmen were already leading
                     their flocks out toward the glades and pasture-lands, and the ways leading into
                     Tara were filled with country-people, who were bringing their produce to
                     market, in hopes of reaping a golden harvest in exchange for their
                     commodities.
                  "We shall meet in a few hours in the hall of Tara," said Abaris, taking leave
                     of Clotaire at the portals of his royal father's court. "Ha! here is my mother!
                     Why abroad so early, my lady mother?"
                  "A happy and proud day to thee, Abaris, my son," said the lady, kissing his
                     forehead, and to thee, noble stranger, for whose coming I have watched since
                     the departure of my guests. Pardon us if, too jealous of the honor of the
                     vestals of NERF NAOM, of which order our fairest and dearest daughter is a
                     member, we resented a slander which, at the time it was uttered, filled us with
                     dread and horror. Pity our feelings when we thought that the sanctuary which
                     shelters our daughter had been invaded by sacrilege."
                  "Royal lady, thou art too kind to a stranger. It is sufficient for me that I am
                     justified, and cleared of a dishonorable imputation," replied the young noble,
                     with a look of proud humility.
                  
                  "We shall no longer be strangers, noble youth. Let me assume a mother's place
                     in thy regard while thou art absent from the noble lady of Bretagne, who may
                     well feel proud of her son. Abaris," said the lady, turning to speak to the
                     bard. But he was gone; and, calling an attendant, she directed him to conduct
                     the Count of Bretagne to the guest-chamber usually appropriated to royal
                     visitors, and order refreshments.
                  At an early hour of the day, people began to throng up toward the hall of Tara.
                     The minds of men were filled with vague apprehensions and expectations of some
                     wonderful event, which for the time seemed to exclude all those sentiments of
                     national pride which had heretofore governed them on these occasions. Murmurs
                     and whispers ran from one to another, until the name of Patricius and the
                     prophecy of the Arch-Druid were on every tongue.
                  At last a peal of martial music burst on the air, and the great portals of the
                     hall of Tara were thrown open. To Clotaire of Bretagne, who had gone up in the
                     suite of the King of Munster and obtained an advantageous position which
                     commanded an uninterrupted view, the coup-d'œil was magnificent. The hall, five hundred feet long, was
                     adorned with elegant pillars, which, like the walls, were incrusted with fine
                     Italian marble. At the upper end was the throne, canopied over with rich silks
                     heavily embroidered with gold, over which hung the shield and armorial
                     quarterings of the monarch. This was surrounded by seats of honor, wrought of
                     precious metals and ivory and decorated with jewels. The stalls or seats of the
                     members of the Assembly were of highly-carved oak, and designated by the
                     shields and insignia of the order of those to whom they were assigned.
                  The monarch has taken his seat; the princes of the Milesian blood-royal take
                     their station near his person; the four provincial kings surround him; the
                     Druids and royal bards file slowly in, and seat themselves in their places near
                     the throne; then follow the senators and commons of the Assembly, who fill the
                     grand hall to its utmost limits, all seated according to their order and rank.
                     On this day the riches and resources of the kingdom were well represented by
                     the magnificence of the spectacle, and its strength exhibited by the loyalty
                     and wisdom of men who wore on their countenances a grave forethought and
                     determined patriotism. The splendor of the royal robes, the grave magnificence
                     of the Druids, the light yet costly attire of the bards, and the rich robing of
                     the nobles glittering with gold and sprinkled thick with gems, threw a glory
                     over the pageant which dazzled and bewildered the eye. When all was arranged
                     for the opening of the Assembly, the peal and clangor of music were succeeded
                     by a grand flourish of trumpets, after which all was silent,—so silent that a
                     deep breath would have rippled the stillness which pervaded that immense hall.
                     The monarch Laogare arose, and, resting his hand on his jeweled scepter and
                     throwing the other out with a graceful and impressive gesture, addressed the
                     Estates of Tara:—
                  "Kings, princes, priests, bards, nobles, and chiefs! Before the regular
                     business of the Assembly opens, we wish to give audience to one Patricius,—the
                     same who dared to throw contempt on the Bealtic rites on the plains of
                     Magh-Breagh. He is here, we learn, under the sacred character of ambassador,
                     and belongs to an order of the Roman nobility which ranks next to the imperial
                     dignity. This fact is signified by his name. We should receive him with all the
                     honors due to his rank, had he not infringed our laws and seduced our subjects.
                     As it is, to signify our grave displeasure toward this impudent innovator, we
                     command all who are here present to remain main seated when he enters.*
                        Now, heralds, conduct Patricius before the Estates of Tara."
                  
                     
                     *The words of Laogare.
                  
                  The eyes of Semo glared beneath his shaggy white brows, and the Druids turned
                     fierce and vindictive glances toward the entrance, while the countenances of
                     all expressed a profound and curious interest. Each one had formed his opinion
                     of the aspect and bearing of Patricius; but none were prepared to see him enter
                     unarmed, calm, and dignified in every gesture. Bare-headed, his noble and
                     radiant countenance full of elevated and holy thought, his clear eyes truthful
                     and beaming with the spirit of his mission, he walked slowly up the nave of the
                     hall, and stood in serene majesty before the monarch and the Assembly.
                  "Noble stranger," exclaimed Ere the son of Dego, a chief of royal descent,
                     while he sprang up from his seat, "such discourtesy were a disgrace to Erin.
                     Sit thou here: I will stand, if needs be one must."†
                     
                  
                     
                     †Historic.
                  
                  "The blessing of God and the stranger on thee, noble chief," replied Patricius,
                     laying his hand on the head of Ere.
                  "Thou shalt answer for thy contumacy, thou degenerate son of a loyal sire,"
                     cried the monarch, in wrathful tones, to the noble and impulsive man, who stood
                     with folded arms, unmoved and firm, by the side of Patricius, casting around
                     him a defiant glance, which took in all, from the monarch on his throne to the
                     lowest individual present. "And thou, enchanter! how is it thou darest to
                     practice thy seductive arts in our very presence? Whence come ye, and why?"
                  "I come, O king," replied Patricius, in strong, clear tones, which rang
                     distinctly throughout the extent of the hall and reached every ear,—"I come, O
                     king, from my Lord the Pope, Celestine, Sovereign of Rome, who deigned to
                     bestow on me, a poor man, surnamed Succath, and an humble priest, the puissant
                     and noble order of the Patricii, that his
                     messenger might do no dishonor, by the meanness of his rank, to the splendor of
                     the court which receives him. But, laying aside all considerations of earthly
                     grandeur, I announce myself a priest of the Most High God, whose sole object in
                     coming hither is to unfold to this nation the mighty plan of salvation, to make
                     known to them the value and true destiny of their immortal souls, and preach to
                     all one Lord, one faith, and one baptism."
                  A confused and wrathful murmur followed the speech of Patricius, blended
                     strangely with assurances of protection and expressions of admiration: then all
                     was silent expectation once more.
                  "Unarmed and defenseless," continued Patricius, "I have come with no other
                     protection than that strength with which the grandeur of my divine mission
                     invests me. I have come to bring to ye glad tidings of great joy; to direct
                     those who pour out their souls in senseless worship to vain idols, to a true
                     and mighty God, the Creator and sovereign Lord of heaven and earth,—to unseal
                     rich treasures of grace, even to those who defile the earth by their idolatrous
                     ministrations, and make known to all the immeasurable love and mercy of a God
                     who immolated Himself for the salvation of His creatures."
                  "Thou art a very Salmoneus, O Patricius,—a base pretender, whom TIENNE will
                     consign in wrath to the righteous judgments of Æacus, when thy mad fallacies
                     shall be washed away like the sands of the sea by the test of a mightier power
                     than thy ignorance and presumption dream of," said Semo, with a bitter and
                     sneering laugh.
                  But Patricius, inspired by divine light, spoke with holy eloquence to that royal, priestly, and
                     noble throng. With such force and unction, with such clearness and perspicuity,
                     he unfolded to them with such sublime simplicity the grandeur of the designs of
                     God for man, he told the story of Bethlehem and Calvary with such pathetic
                     force, that the boldest hearts quailed, the most superstitious felt an
                     undefined terror and misgiving which made them tremble, while not a few
                     sheltered themselves behind the pillars and covered their faces with their
                     robes to conceal their emotion. The Druids gnashed their teeth and clinched
                     their hands until the blood started beneath the nails, as the eloquence of
                     divine truth rolled, like wrathful thunders, through the recesses of their
                     souls. While Patricius discoursed on the sublime mystery of the Trinity, Semo,
                     whose face was lurid with the wrath that raged within him, arose, and, with an
                     air of triumph, exclaimed,—
                  "Thy story, O stranger, is full of wonders, which are strung together with rare
                     and cunning power. The ignorant, who are not accustomed to the divination of
                     mysteries, or well versed in that art which can detect a subtle error in
                     pleasing novelties, might receive these dogmas which claim a divine superiority
                     over those which we profess; but thou hast to do with men whose age and
                     experience, whose wisdom and judgment, can discriminate between pretension and
                     reality,—between falsity and truth. There is one point in thy vaunted doctrines
                     so utterly absurd that the poorest hind in Erin would laugh it and thee to
                     scorn,—a fallacy which will destroy the entire fabric of thy false system. I
                     allude to this Trinity, concerning which thou hast poured out a flood of
                     eloquent argument sufficient to drown us all—if it were not so utterly absurd.
                     How can Three exist in one, and one in Three?"
                  Patricius paused. He lifted his eyes heavenward, then turned to his disciple,
                     Benignus, who was with him, and whispered a few words in his ear. Benignus left
                     the hall, unmolested, while Patricius stood silent and patient, awaiting his
                     return. A smile of scorn passed from face to face. They thought that Semo had
                     silenced Patricius. His downcast eyes and silence indicated defeat.
                  "He is preparing to escape," whispered one.
                  "He has sent the crazed son of Sesgnen for some potent charm to aid him," said
                     another.
                  "We shall this day see the glory of TIENNE vindicated!"
                  "I thought he was no match for Semo. But see! his messenger returns: he
                     presents something to him: it looks like a handful of leaves. Hark! Patricius
                     speaks."
                  "To prove, O sage," began Patricius, holding up to the view of all a shamrock, whose three leaves spread out in vigorous
                     beauty from its slender stem,—"to prove that I utter no absurdity, and the
                     reality and possibility of the existence of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost in
                     the unity of one Godhead, I have only shown you this humble plant on which ye
                     have ofttimes trodden, to convince ye that the truth can be made manifest by
                     the simplest symbol of illustration."*
                     
                  
                     
                     *The words of St. Patrick.
                  
                  So simple, yet so convincing, was this practical argument, that many who,
                     having been almost persuaded, had yielded to the difficulties of the argument
                     proposed by Semo, now declared themselves believers in the faith of
                     Patricius.
                  Then arose a din and tumult. Like stormy surges dashing against a rock-bound
                     shore, all words, all voices, combined to swell the discord and increase the
                     tumult; and when Dubtach, the Arch-Poet of the monarch, left his seat and, pushing through the crowd, knelt
                     at the feet of Patricius and asked for baptism, the Druids, covered with dread
                     and confusion, clamored for his arrest, and prophesied ruin to the institutions
                     of the land unless the Roman impostor suffered the extreme penalty of the law
                     for sedition. But, lo! two of their order—two noble and virtuous men—two
                     ollahms held in high repute in the temple and schools—rush forward and declare
                     themselves disciples of Patricius; and now a youthful stranger, whose olive
                     skin and black flashing eyes declare him to be a native of another land, whose
                     noble bearing and manly beauty attract universal attention, throws himself
                     before Patricius, asking to be initiated in the truths of salvation.
                  "Clotaire of Bretagne! thou art mad! Hence! hence!" shouted Semo, when he saw
                     it. "Ha! what is this? Abaris! Abaris! Oh, my son! my son! Thou
                     false, too, to the religion of thy fathers. O king, arrest this man, who is
                     robbing thee of the gems of the chivalry and talent of Erin. I will myself slay
                     him!" exclaimed the infuriate Druid, separating the crowd right and left with
                     his arms, which beat wildly about him, to open the way to Patricius.
                  "Hold! hold!" said Laogare, springing before him and stretching his scepter
                     over the head of Patricius, a sign of royal protection. "The hall of Temora
                     shall be stained by no deed like this."
                  "Has the false tongue of the stranger beguiled thee also, O royal
                     Laogare?" asked Semo, panting for breath, and pallid with impotent rage.
                  "It is better, O sage, to believe than perish,"*
                      replied the monarch. Semo could bear no more, but, rushing out of the
                     hall, he fled, as fast as his aged limbs would bear him, away to the innermost
                     recesses of the temple.
                        
                        *The words of Laogare.
                     
               
               
                  CHAPTER X.
                  DAIRENE.
                  THE purple shadows of twilight lingered like a solemn dream over the earth.
                     Like a veiled and silent angel the evening star waited beside the portals of
                     night. Gentle dews descended like heavenly gifts,—all unseen until leaf and
                     flower were set with translucent gems, all unfelt until the lonely blossoms of
                     the wild-wood, and tangled vines, creeping through mossy glens, lifted their
                     heads in refreshment, as on its earth-mission the spirit of the night passed
                     over them. The waves seemed hushed to rest, and swept against the rocks and
                     through the abysses that lined the rugged shore, in soft and murmuring echoes.
                     The marble temple of Nerf, on its wild and beautiful promontory, and the
                     distant turrets of Innistore, where a beacon-light always burned from sunset to
                     sunrise, over which fluttered the national ensign gleaming with green and gold,
                     loomed up gray and indistinct through the gathering mist. Every sound except
                     the voice of nature was hushed, while, clear and wild, the song of the
                     nightingale rang through the solitude in sweet reverberations.
                  But now, along the margin of the woods, through the dim and shaded avenues
                     which skirted the beach, white-veiled forms began to flit like wraiths, so
                     fleet and noiseless was their motion; and anon low sweet symphonies swelled on
                     the night-winds like spirit-music, so soft, so ethereal, so solemn were their
                     tones. The vestals of NERF NAOM were
                     keeping vigils in the sacred grove until the moon arose, when they would return
                     to the temple to open the mystic rites in honor of her who was afterward
                     worshiped in Greece and Carthage as Hecate.
                  Dairene, sad and drooping, wandered away from the rest, to watch alone for the
                     first gleam of that golden disk over the distant hills, which formerly she was
                     the first to greet with choral hymns. Along the cool and misty shore she
                     wandered, until the sound of the waves brought to her heart low, sad,
                     whispering thoughts of Mona. She had ever been grave and silent; but, since
                     Mona had disappeared, she was never heard to speak, unless when her duties as
                     guardian of the vestals compelled her to do so; and those who on rare occasions
                     caught a glimpse of her face, which she kept constantly covered, declared that
                     it was as the face of the dead. The younger vestals always hushed their
                     laughter and ceased their jests when she came among them or passed through
                     their midst. It was the only way in which they could show sympathy for so stern
                     and silent a sorrow. Gradually she withdrew herself from all association with
                     them, except in the solemn rites of the temple, where she was always the first
                     and the last to come and to go. In her fastings and vigils, she seemed to
                     forget that she was mortal; and it was no unusual thing for her to be found
                     lying lifeless and cold on the marble pavement, where they had left her
                     kneeling so rapt in the wild brooding of her anguish and the dark chimeras of
                     her mistaken creed that they dared not call or touch her. She was conscious
                     that she had become like a troubled phantom among her kind; and it gave her no
                     slight pang to feel that, wherever she moved, the shadow of her woe fell over
                     lives to which time would bring its own bitterness; but the feeling was buried
                     deep down in her heart, and with few but gentle words she ever evaded all
                     intercourse with the inmates of the temple. Her favorite haunts were along the
                     shore, and over the wild, precipitous ledges of rock that, barrier-like, lifted
                     their sharp battlements over the sea. Twice, in the shadowy twilight,—far down
                     on the beach, while with folded hands and downcast eyes she walked in deep
                     musing,—she heard the sound of garments trailing past her; and once, at
                     midnight, when the moon, gibbous and pale, looked down through racks of white
                     cloud, she distinctly saw a form, flitting near her, so like Mona that she
                     stretched out her arms to clasp it, and fell fainting on the shore.
                  Now, gliding along with rapid motion,—but not so rapid were her steps as the
                     wild throbbing of her heart,—casting her eyes now toward the far-off hills, now
                     out on the shadowy sea, now upward where the star-spirits were lighting the
                     golden fires on the altars of heaven, she found herself far away, in a wild and
                     lonely place among the rocks, through whose narrow fissures the waters hissed
                     like serpents. She paused to rest, while Memory the mocker lifted the pall from
                     the shrine in her soul where lay the image of Mona. It touched the dead form,
                     and it started into life and warmth and beauty. But what were such visions to
                     her? She could not touch it; she could not fold it to her bosom as of yore;
                     and, wringing her hands, she lifted up her voice, and, in her anguish,
                     cried,—
                  "Could I only have pillowed thy head,—could I have kissed thy cold clay, while
                     I decked it with flowers,—had I watched thy fleeting breath, and gathered into
                     my soul thy last sigh, as it left thy bosom,—there would be some sweetness in
                     the bitter draught. But to think of thee, sunlight of my life! torn by the
                     jagged rocks, tossed and bruised by the cruel waves, thy joyous beauty dashed
                     out forever, and that voice, which to me was sweeter than the music of birds in spring——Alas! amid the roaring
                     billow it shrieked for help unheard,—unpitied! Oh, Mona! why was it not I—I,
                     the time-worn and time-weary Dairene—on whom this dark destiny fell?"
                  "Dairene," said a low, sweet voice near her; "Dairene."
                  Dairene turned quickly, and, tearing off her veil with wild emotion, beheld
                     Mona standing calm and beautiful before her.
                  "And didst thou hear me in thy spirit-home, O loved and loving one? Has NERF
                     NAOM taken pity on her old handmaid, and sent thee to comfort me?" said
                     Dairene, with awe, while she folded her hands over her bosom and knelt on the
                     sands at Mona's feet.
                  "Rise, Dairene. I am no phantom. I am Mona. I live," she said, tenderly.
                  "Thou livest? Then let me touch thee; then let me feel thee.
                     There! put thy arms about my neck, and lay thy cheek to mine! O Nerf Naom! it
                     is true! she lives! Mona lives! But, Mona, why this mystery?"
                  I have come to tell thee; for I have watched thee these many days Thy anguish
                     filled me with pity; and, moved by my old love for thee, and a feeling still
                     more divine, I have periled my life on this moment. Oh, Dairene, there is a
                     great and holy God, the Creator of heaven and earth, whose creatures we
                     are,—who so loved us that He gave His only Son Jesus Christ to die for our
                     ransom. He is the Deliverer of whom I dreamed, before whose power demons and
                     idols fall, the Lord and Maker of TIENNE and NERF! said Mona, speaking
                     rapidly.
                  "But—but—Mona," gasped Dairene, confused, and half wild with horror, "come: let
                     us return. Even now I see you hill-tops luminous with light. Hasten with me,
                     songbird of my heart, lest we be too late for the midnight rites."
                  "I return no more, Dairene. I worship only the true and living God. Never more
                     shall I bend the knee to idols, but, if needs be, will suffer death for
                     Christ," said Mona, in her sweet, clear tones.
                  "Thou art——" began Dairene, with a shudder.
                  "A Christian? Yes," replied Mona, lifting her head from Dairene's shoulder, and
                     unclasping her hand.
                  "Oh, hapless child of a faithless mother! Better had Semo struck the knife to
                     thy heart years ago! Better had it been for thee hadst thou perished in the
                     billows! for then thou wouldst not be so lost to me as thou art now! But thou
                     shalt not escape. I will denounce thee, and, if need be, O sacrilegious one!
                        mine shall be the hand to avenge the honor of NERF NAOM!"
                  She returned to grasp Mona's arm to drag her back to the temple; but she had
                     vanished; she was gone; and, uttering a wild and despairing shriek, Dairene ran
                     leaping along the shore, tossing her arms and tearing her gray hair, until,
                     overcome by maddening agonies, she fell prostrate and senseless to the
                     earth.
                  Mona had fled back to the cavern, where Lena, the fisherman's wife, awaited her
                     return with anxious dread. She looked so pale, and there was such a glow in her
                     large eyes, as she entered, that Lena sprang up, and, folding her brawny arm
                     around the fragile one, led her, unresisting, to a seat on the rushes.
                  "I have seen Dairene. I have spoken with her, Lena," she said, in a low voice,
                     while she panted like a hunted fawn.
                  "And how—what was her reception of thee?"
                  "Rapture,—joy,—until she learned that I was no longer a follower of NERF NAOM,
                     but a follower of JESUS CHRIST. Then, in wild fury, she would have dragged me
                     to the temple and placed me at the
                     mercy of the Druids," she replied.
                  "It is true, then, that this is no longer a refuge for thee," said the good
                     Lena, thoughtfully. "My husband has been here, gentle lady, and tells me that
                     while he was fishing many miles up the Shannon yesterday, near the shore, he
                     saw a large party, among whom were Semo and the other Druids from Lough Tore,
                     riding slowly along toward Innistore. He has learned that there is to be a hue
                     and cry after the Christians in these parts; and, now that Dairene has
                     discovered that thou art living, it will increase the fury of the Druids, and
                     their keen wits will not rest until thou art captured. But there is one
                     thing,—one way of escape, gentle lady: only it seemeth like insolence to
                     propose it to one of thy degree," said Lena, with respectful tenderness.
                  "Alas, Lena, why such language to one like me? Am I not too the servant of a
                     crucified Lord? The more suffering, the more humiliation, the more pain I have,
                     the more shall I be like unto Him who died for me. Oh, Lena, this morning,
                     when, under the sacramental veil, the holy Finian bestowed HIM on me,—the
                     sacred humanity, the immortal divinity, the mystical life of Jesus Christ,
                     true, full, and entire,—my heart was so replenished and filled with such
                     strength and love, that had I ten thousand lives I would offer them
                     unreservedly to His glory," exclaimed Mona, with a radiant and sublime
                     expression.
                  "But, my child," said Lena, humbly, while she gazed on the seraphic smile that
                     lit up Mona's face, "simple obedience to the Divine will must be our guide. The
                     holy Finian declares that it is our duty to avoid dangers; for by a needless
                     exposure of ourselves to the rage of our enemies we should incur the guilt of
                     presumption and lose the exceeding great reward of martyrdom. In the hour of
                     peril let us fly to shelter in the holy name of God; then, when all fails, if
                     it is the divine will that we seal our faith in the Word with our blood, let it
                     flow, let it flow, O JESUS CHRIST, from our head, our hands, our side, for
                     Thee, even as Thine flowed for us."
                  "Lead me whither thou wilt, Lena. Thou seest I am but a weak child," said Mona,
                     kneeling down by the good woman's side and leaning her head on her bosom.
                  "Yes: Dairene, maddened by her love for thee, and her pagan zeal, will not rest
                     until thou art immolated to her stern deities. Semo and the Druids will search
                     the very depths of the sea, that they may sacrifice thee to their vengeance.
                     There is no time to be lost. I have a sister at Innistore, who is the
                     tiring-woman of the noble lady of the castle: she will receive thee as an
                     assistant in the nursery in the place of the slave Panthea, who is crippled and
                     helpless," said Lena.
                  "Innistore! I am known at Innistore, by some of its inmates, who have been
                     accustomed to see me since I was a child, from time to time," said Mona,
                     looking up with surprise.
                  "For all that I am prepared, gentle lady," said Lena, opening a bundle. "They
                     will not know thee in the disguise I have prepared. Dairene herself would pass
                     thee by unnoticed. So, let me fold thy long hair beneath this cap, let me
                     sponge thy face with this dye,—thy neck, hands, and arms. Now put on this
                     peasant attire. There! thou art safe."
                  "A servant!" murmured Mona,—"a servant! Is this glorifying God? Is this ignoble
                     flight worthy of a Christian?"
                  "Dear lady, in holy obedience we imitate and glorify JESUS CHRIST, who became a
                     servant, an outcast, and a reproach for our salvation," said Lena, quickly.
                  
                  "Yes: to become a servant for Christ is very sweet, Lena. To be subject to
                     others, and feel no will of my own, is very sweet, because in place of my own
                     will the adorable will of the Most High God will reign, filling me with newer
                     and brighter life, until my soul is lost in heavenly communings which are types
                     of eternal rest. I see it all, and feel it, now. Servitude or death, servitude
                     or death, be mine, dear Lord, according to Thy good pleasure. Let us go now,
                     that we may reach Innistore before day-dawn."
                  "His hand is leading thee, and His right hand is
                     about thee!" said Lena, throwing a large gray mantle like her own over Mona's
                     head and shoulders. Then they stepped out of the cavern, and wound their way
                     cautiously down the steep and narrow path until they reached the level shore,
                     when they walked on rapidly and in silence.
                  "I must go in here an instant," said Lena, pausing near her cabin, which lay in
                     their way. "I have eggs and woolen hose to carry to Innistore, which I shall
                     sell, to buy bread for my little ones; and I wish to let those within know our
                     movements."
                  In a little while she came out, with two light willow baskets on her arms. The
                     one containing eggs she gave to Mona, the other she carried herself.
                  "We will go on now," she said, cheeringly. "They are all well within. My
                     husband and son would have risen to go with us; but I usually go alone, and I
                     feared it might excite surprise to see me thus attended."
                  The moon was now shining in unclouded glory over their way, while the
                     beacon-light at Innistore guided them on. It was a rough and rugged path:
                     sometimes it led them over sharp, broken rocks, and sometimes through thickets
                     of thorn-bushes and holly. The delicate vestal, nurtured like a
                     song-bird,—whose life had been passed amid flowers and music and song,—felt
                     footsore and weary, wandering at midnight in search of humiliations and
                     bondage. Humiliations and bondage! Was this all that the new faith had brought
                     her? No, not all. For that part of which the body is the prison—that sentient
                     and keen life, so deathless, of which the body is only the earth-garb—was
                     filled with a peace so tranquil, a courage so high, a brightness of hope so
                     heavenly, a faith so strong, that it counted all things as loss for the cross
                     of Christ, and was borne up, as on eagle's pinions, beyond the dull wailing of
                     afflicted nature, so near the confines of heaven that the bleeding feet were
                     not thought of, the weary limbs asked no repose, bondage was forgotten, and
                     death itself was lost in the sweet fullness of hope.
                  "Lady, we are at the portals of Innistore: throw back thy veil a little way,"
                     said Lena, knocking at the wicket. "I am sorry to disturb thee, Dathy, at so
                     early an hour," said Lena, when the porter opened it; "but I have come on a
                     business-errand to my sister, and also to bring a small present to
                     thyself."
                  "Good Lena, thou art ever welcome. Wait until I take down the bars. Thou must
                     not be kept standing after so long a trudge," said Dathy, who disappeared; and,
                     after a rattling of chains and the lumbering sounds of displaced bars, one side
                     of the portal, iron-ribbed and grim, was thrown open, and the two women entered
                     the lodge, where there was no want of substantial comfort.
                  "Say, good Lena, is this thy daughter? If she is, she looks more like an
                     Egyptian than thou dost."
                  "No, Dathy: she is not my child, except by adoption. She is a poor orphan who
                     has been confided to my care. Sit here, mavourneen, and rest a moment while I
                     get out the hose which I knit for my friend Dathy—may they fit thee as well as
                     the good wishes that made them!" said Lena, turning out the contents of her basket, to direct the man's attention
                     from Mona. "Aha! there they are,—the brightest scarlet and purest white in
                     Munster. Our monarch himself does not wear a finer or softer fleece."
                  "My good and excellent Lena!" cried Dathy, in an ecstasy of delight, "who of
                     the good people set thee on this? The very thing I wanted! Now, Dathy! do choroide gun roinn! in such hose thou wilt be
                     invincible! We'll see if that jilting hussy Maia will turn up her pert nose at
                     the wearer of scarlet and white. A thousand thanks, Lena! Here are wine and
                     wheaten bread for thyself and daughter."
                  "I thank thee," said Lena, accepting the offered refreshment. "I have brought
                     this young maiden to my sister, who wants an assistant in the nursery. I know
                     that she is faithful and even-tempered, and thought none would better suit the
                     place. But I must hurry back, to be in time to pack up our produce for the
                     fair," said Lena, in her quiet way.
                  "True," said Dathy, surveying his large, well-turned limbs and the brilliant
                     hose with equal complacency: "she sent word down last night that she expected
                     thee. Even-tempered didst thou say is the Colleen
                        dhu? It is well for her. I'd rather be pitched naked into a
                     thorn-bush than have to serve under Aileen,—saving thy presence, Lena. I expect
                     she's in a glorious snarl now! Old Panthea's been crippled these three weeks;
                     and, in addition to the uproar caused by that,—for Aileen, never sick herself,
                     thinks it is treason for any one to complain, however ill they may be,—we were
                     all set wild last night by the arrival of a troop of guests, who brought such
                     wonderful tidings from Tara that I have not slept a wink since letting them in.
                     Hast heard aught extraordinary, good Lena?"
                  "Nothing," replied Lena.
                  "Well, I might as well be the first to tell thee; for it has brought great
                     sorrow to Innistore, and a black woe to the house of Munster! Thou hast
                     doubtless heard of certain wretches called Christians? Yes. Well, they are
                     enchanters. I hear they can turn a lamb to a wolf, or a cuckoo to an eagle, by
                     a look of their eye; and it is said there are many of them in these parts.
                     Anyhow, one of them, named Patricius, was at Tara; and they say he stood on a
                     hillock at Firta-Fir-Tiec, on the banks of
                     the Boyne, the day the Baal-fire was kindled on the plains of Magh-Breagh,
                     three miles off, and put it out by shutting his eyes and blowing his breath
                     toward it. Only think! Then the people fled in confusion, pursued by a dragon,
                     which devoured men, women, and children in their flight. The next day the
                     infidel appeared before the Parliament of Tara, and under the very nose of the
                     Druids enchanted the monarch Laogare, the Arch-Poet Dubtach, two Druids, a
                     young noble from Gaul, and, worst of all, the pride of Munster, our bard, our
                     prince, the beautiful and noble Abaris." Here Dathy wiped off a genuine tear,
                     but continued:—"After which he chained them all, and changed them into beasts
                     and birds, and carried them off in iron cages to a bleak island, called Lough
                     Derg, where he has locked them up in a cavern of fire."*
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     *Dathy no doubt alluded to the cave of LOUGH DERG, known as Patrick's
                        Purgatory, where the apostle used to retire to pray and do penance.
                  
                  "And they all became Christians?" asked Lena, scarcely able to keep down the
                     exultation of her soul,—"all?"
                  "Every one. And they say that the Arch-Druid Semo has never spoken a word
                     since,—that the curse of Patricius is upon him. Didst thou ever
                     hear anything so absurd surd as
                     their belief? They declare that the King of the Jews—the Jews are a
                        foreign and detestable race—is God, and He and they are trying to subvert
                        our free and glorious land to his dominions! That is their religion.
                     That is the reason they are threatening our free institutions with disaster and
                     ruin."
                  "It is terrible, if true," said Lena, with a quiet smile. "But, good Dathy,
                     send some one with us now to the castle: the people are stirring, and it is
                     past sunrise. I have to hasten back."
                  Lena was anxious to get back, to dispatch a messenger to the saintly Finian
                     with the news she had heard, that he might be on his guard, and use more than
                     usual caution in coming to and fro.
                  "True. I had forgotten. Come hither, Malchy," he cried to a man-at-arms who was
                     washing his face at the court fountain. "Sit here, my friend, until I go with
                     this dame and her daughter to the castle. Here is wine; there hangs a rasher.
                     Make thyself at home: when I return, we will breakfast together."
                  The man-at-arms, nothing loath to the enjoyment of an easy chair and good fare,
                     came with a broad grin on his coarse features in obedience to the summons, and,
                     as he passed Mona, gave her a tap with his great hirsute hand on her cheek.
                     Almost fainting with terror, she clung to Lena, nor lifted her veil again until
                     they were seated in the apartment that served as a play-room for the noble
                     children of Innistore, and over which Lena's sister, an ill-favored and
                     ill-tempered person, presided, it being one of the nursery suite.
                  "Is she good-tempered? is she active? is she willing? can she sweep? can she
                     sew? can she sing? can she hold a child? can she feed a baby? can she make
                     gruel? can she scrub?" Mona heard her asking, with such sharp volubility that
                     it sounded like the patter of hailstones on a shield. "Speak up, and tell us
                     what thou canst do."
                  "I know but little," said Mona, with humble courage; "but I will be obedient,
                     and endeavor to perform well whatever tasks are assigned me."
                  "Ha! thou hast a voice like the cuckoo, and thy speech shows gentle breeding;
                     but, mind, there are no little brownies here to wait on my lady,"
                     said the virago. "But I'll try thee; and I do think, if thy great wild eyes and
                     yellow skin don't scare the baby into fits, we may do something with thee. So,
                     Lena, thou canst leave her. I have my hands so full since that old wretch
                     Panthea took to bed, that I get out of my senses a dozen times a day. I am
                     tolerably patient, though, and will try to teach the girl something. But mind,
                     young miss, no flaunting with the grooms and soldiers, and, above all, no words
                     when I scold."
                  "Thou wilt find Coreen modest, sister. I only beg thou wilt let her have her
                     sup up here, that she may not have to be among the men in the servants' hall.
                     And another thing. Sometimes I shall come for her, to spend a night at home.
                     Promise me that she shall go," said Lena, with tingling cheeks and a glance at
                     Mona, who was standing near her, with folded hands and downcast eyes.
                  "The Banshees fly off with ye, for putting such notions into the girl's
                     head—but, by our mother's milk, I suppose I must say yes, for thy sake,
                     Lena,—that is, if thou dost not come for her too often to spend a night, and if
                     she gets back by sunrise. As to her taking her sup here, she's welcome, as I
                     like to go down sometimes myself. We're in a stew at Innistore, now I can tell
                     thee; what with the witchcraft of the Christians, and the apostasy of the bard
                     Abaris, the very winds blow us sorrow. That old Roman slave, Panthea, pretends to be lame; my
                     lady storms and threatens; the child's sick. Here—what's thy name?"
                  "Coreen," said Lena.
                  "Here, Coreen, lay off thy veil, and fly round and clear this room; the
                     children are shrieking," cried the termagant, rushing into another room.
                  "Be patient; have good courage, my child," whispered Lena, when they were
                     alone. "When the holy Finian returns, I will come for thee."
                  She kissed her hand, and Mona felt a tear drop on it. Lena went away; and Mona
                     felt a chill and shudder pass over her.
                  "This is not death; there seems nothing great or heroic in it,—nothing worthy
                     of offering to the Most High God," thought Mona. "But it is suffering; yes, it
                     is suffering; and what matters it, sweet Lord, how we suffer, if we suffer for
                     and with Thee? Here will I think of Thee in thy Passion, here will I learn the
                     science of meekness and humility."
                  Her instinctive neatness and innate love of order gave success to her task, and
                     when the virago Aileen came to inspect the room she did not beat her.
                  And now, in truth, commenced her soul's warfare. She was the servant of
                     servants; but she thought of the Crucified, and was silent. She was pursued
                     from morning until night by petty tyrannies, which would have maddened her had
                     she not been a Christian; she was struck and buffeted by ill-governed children,
                     jeered and scoffed at by underlings, exposed to fatigues and labor beyond her
                     strength, without a kind word or a soft look to sweeten her toils; and
                     sometimes—yes, sometimes she felt weak and wavering, and numbed by the torture,
                     until she remembered Him on whose mangled shoulders the heavy Cross was laid.
                     She was human; she felt now her weakness, and would have sunk into a very abyss
                     of despair, had not the thought of the great ransom that was paid for her on
                     Calvary given her strength, hope, and courage.
                  And yet she was indispensable. Her sweet songs lulled the noisy children, and
                     her winning voice lured them away from the indulgence of dangerous sports. She
                     watched them while they slept, and met them with smiles when they awoke. Her
                     cunning handiwork and skill in embroidery made her of priceless value to
                     Aileen, who could now steal more rest. None asked a favor of her in vain, yet
                     none returned to thank her or offered their assistance or good offices. She had
                     but one friend among them all; and that was the poor slave Panthea. When she
                     could be spared, she hied up to the little closet under the caves, with warm
                     broth or healing embrocations, rubbed the crippled, unsightly limbs, bathed her
                     feet, and anointed them with unctuous oils, which Dairene had taught her how to
                     prepare; and while the forlorn slave, grateful and relieved, leaned back on her
                     pillow of straw, Mona told her, in low, sweet tones, of GOD, until it began to
                     grow brighter in that darkened soul—until, freed from the fetters of its
                     ignorance, at last it sighed after immortality through the Cross of Christ.
                  One evening Lena came for her, and together they sped away once more to the
                     cavern on the shore. Once more Mona knelt in sacramental penance at the good
                     Finian's feet, and once more did she receive, with a joy that angels can never
                     know, the Lord in his sacred humanity and perfect Divinity, in her earthly
                     tabernacle. And well was it for her that, in the depths of her humility, she
                     had left no venial stains to cloud the luster of her soul, well for her that
                     the heavenly feast so inebriated her with joy that earth's bitter trials were
                     all unfelt,—well for her; FOR IT WAS HER VIATICUM!
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XI.
                  PANTHEA THE SLAVE.
                  IN a lofty turret-chamber, which was enriched by all that was rare and
                     luxurious, near an open casement, which commanded an extensive and magnificent
                     prospect, sat the proud Lady of Innistore. A quantity of splendid silk lay
                     across her knees, and swept the floor on either side, in rich folds. It was a
                     banneret, which she was embroidering with golden threads and pearls, in
                     heraldic devices and quaint patterns. Her face was a type of fearlessness and
                     truth. There was that in her full, flashing eyes which would repel with scorn a
                     mean or oppressive act, yet which would imperatively demand submission and
                     respect to her position and state. The nostrils of her straight and beautiful
                     nose were thin, and dilated with every breath; while her full lips, curved to
                     the most perfect line of beauty, wore a look of more hauteur than tenderness.
                     Her raven hair was confined under a network of pearls, which was fringed with a
                     glistening border of pear-pearls, that drooped over her broad white forehead
                     and blue-veined temples like snow-flakes on a lotusleaf. A robe of
                     lilac-colored silk, with flowing sleeves turned up with ermine and a girdle of
                     twisted pearls, completed her attire.
                  The wind swept up from the sea in sweet and murmuring cadences, ever and anon
                     touching the strings of a harp which stood uncovered near the casement, and
                     yielded wild and music-breathing strains to its spirit-like fingerings. The
                     lady lifted her eyes from her broidery, and gazed out long and earnestly on the
                     noble and sunlit view; then, with an impatient look and a quick sigh, she threw
                     aside the banneret, and tossed the threads of gold and strings of pearls in a
                     glittering heap down with it.
                  "Bright, splendid, unclouded," she exclaimed, "are yonder scenes; but, viewed
                     through the medium of a vexed and troubled heart, they are wanting in glory.
                     Why is it that there is ever a longing—a void—in the soul? Why is it that we
                     are never filled with the joys around us? Why cannot we, like the birds of the
                     air or the flowers of the meadow, who heed neither hunter's arrow nor midnight
                     storm, after both are sped, revel and grow wild in the bliss of sunshine and
                     flowers? Why doth sorrow, like a taskmaster, scourge us, as if we were slaves,
                     away from all gladness? Why does disappointment embitter the very fountains of
                     life? Is it because we are human, and that there is a something
                     which we know not of, that would fill all the desires of an immortal nature? Is
                     it because there is a balm, down-flowing to the earth, which our instincts long
                     for, yet cannot find? O NERF NAOM, lead thy child! O NERF NAOM, teach me true
                     wisdom!"
                  An attendant entered,—one of the esquires of the anteroom,—and ushered in Count
                     Ulric of Heidelberg, who, bowing with courtly reverence, lifted the long white
                     fingers of the lady to his lips.
                  "Be seated, Count Ulric," she said, disengaging her hand with a queenly air;
                     for she had heard somewhat of his treachery toward his friend at Tara.
                     "Methought thou hadst gone to the schools at Lough-Tore."
                  "No, my Lady Bernice. Some unexpected deliberations detain the Arch-Druid at
                     yonder temple; and, weary of its
                     monotony, to avoid hanging myself, I galloped over to Innistore, in hopes to
                     find thy lord in a humor for hawking this fine day; but they tell me that he
                     has gone a journey."
                  "Yes; he has gone to seek an interview with our brother Abaris, who so unwarily
                     fell into the magic nets of Patricius," she replied, while a red spot glowed on
                     her forehead.
                  "Those events have indeed become portentous, in which the monarch, the teachers
                     of the schools, and the bravest chiefs take the lead," said Count Ulric, with a
                     sneer. "My creed is, to laugh at all doctrines and let them dance
                     round their circle of folly unmolested, unless they interfere with me is some
                     peculiar way. But what sayest thou, noble lady, to these strange doings?"
                  "Say, sir count? What can a weak woman say, when men forget their
                     fidelity to all faith and honor? Had I been there, Patricius would
                     have found one, at least, to defy and scorn his falsehoods," she said, while
                     such a fierce light shot from her eyes that Ulric involuntarily lowered his,
                     and thought it safer to change the subject.
                  "Hast thou heard the strange news from the temple?" he asked.
                  "No, sir count, I have heard nothing, since they returned from Tara. Methinks
                     that were enough to last one a lifetime," she said, with a quiet but
                     concentrated air of wrath.
                  "Not heard it yet, my Lady Bernice? Why, there has been the wildest excitement
                     there I ever witnessed. It was caused by an event of the most unexpected and
                     startling character. At first I felt, as in duty bound, highly wrought up; but,
                     as success now seems uncertain, all zest is gone, and, as I told
                     thee, noble lady, I galloped hither to seek diversion."
                  He did not understand the quivering of those thin nostrils and the gathering
                     flush on those oval cheeks; he did not know that her lips had opened to call
                     him "Fool," but sat all unconscious, until she burst out with, "On my honor as
                     the wife of a noble prince, thou hast not been an inmate of the temple so long
                     without learning something. Thy words are as mysterious as the revelations of
                     an oracle."
                  "I will speak more plainly, lady," he said, bowing. "Didst thou ever hear of
                     Mona the vestal?"
                  "Mona, the Rose of the Temple?—She who was drowned in the sea?"
                  "The same. She was not drowned, as was supposed. Dairene, one of the older
                     vestals, had seen and talked with her. She fled away from the
                     temple, and sought refuge with some accursed Christians, who have converted her
                     to their belief. Semo declares that the most awful penalties, the most horrid
                     tortures, shall burn and rack her, when she is delivered into his hands. But no
                     trace has been discovered as yet."
                  "Mona! Mona, the innocent and beautiful! Can it be so?" murmurred the lady.
                  "The Count Clotaire of Bretagne once saw Mona unveiled, and formed a wild and
                     passionate love for her. He has also become a Christian, and it is expected
                     that when one is found the other will not be far off. She, of course, will have
                     to die; he will be sent back in disgrace to his father's court at Bretagne,"
                     said Count Ulric, twirling his small jeweled dagger around his fingers.
                  "This crowns their triumphs. Druids, monarchs, bards, chiefs, and now a vestal
                     of NERF NAOM! Let the honor of the temple be vindicated! Let her perish, were
                     she ten times more lovely, were she ten times more gentle and sweet-voiced!—let
                     her perish, a warning and spectacle
                     to those who, like her, may be deluded!" exclaimed the Lady Bernice, with a
                     dark flashing of the eye.
                  There was a quick sound of footsteps in the anteroom, a rustling of robes, and
                     quick panting breath; then the drapery that covered the entrance was dashed
                     aside, and Mona ran forward and knelt at the lady's feet, closely followed by
                     Aileen, in such a tempest of fury that every limb quivered, and she could not
                     speak.
                  "What means this intrusion? Aileen, how darest thou come thus into my presence?
                     and who is this dark stranger?"
                  "Gracious lady, she is but a servant,—one whom I employed a few weeks ago. It
                     is she who has led me hither,—she who, because I wished to chastise Panthea,
                     the slave, for laziness, almost tore my eyes out. And when she saw that I would
                     do it, she flew off, like a mad cat, to appeal to thee," exclaimed Aileen,
                     stuttering and stammering.
                  "She did right, for aught I know, Aileen. But be silent. You have forced this
                     quarrel into my presence, and I shall adjust it to suit myself. What wouldst
                     thou, dark stranger?" said the Lady Bernice to Mona, who still knelt, with
                     folded hands and downcast eyes, at her feet.
                  "Pardon me, lady, if I have presumed too far for one in my humble condition;
                     but when Aileen would have stripped Panthea and laid the knotted scourge on the
                     shoulders of one so ill and crippled as she is, I only besought her to spare
                     Panthea and lay the stripes on me," said Mona, in low, trembling tones. "But
                     she would not relent. Then I dared to appeal to thee,—not against Aileen, but
                     to beseech thee, noble lady, to order that I may be scourged
                     instead of Panthea."
                  "Is Panthea of thy kith and kin?" inquired the Lady of Innistore, while a flood
                     of strange and turbulent emotions swept through her mind.
                  "No, lady, she is a foreigner,—I am a native of Erin; but, oh,
                     lady, her age, her sufferings, the slow approach of death to one so unfriended,
                     has made her my sister,—my mother. I only beg for the stripes, that Panthea may
                     be spared."
                  "So let it be," said the lady, after a pause of several minutes, during which
                     she fixed her keen, flashing eyes on Mona's face, as if through its lineaments
                     she would read the secrets of her inmost soul. "Aileen,—dost thou hear
                     me?—spare Panthea. Let the scourge fall on the shoulders that are willing to
                     bear it; and, remember, I shall require from thee a strict account of the old
                     slave, whom I ever found faithful and true to my interests."
                  "Thanks, lady,—thanks!" whispered Mona, while her face grew radiant with the
                     light within.
                  "Leave me," said the lady, more gently. "This is so noble and heroic, sir
                     count, that, although my heart pleaded loudly for that dark and beautiful
                     maiden, I could not deprive her of the glory of it."
                  "And yet," said Count Ulric, with a sneer, "I make no doubt, most noble lady,
                     that thou hast frustrated some deep design. She counted largely on thy
                     generosity, and would have sacrificed her heroism to her safety."
                  "Thou art a disbeliever, then, in exalted heroism of mind,—in the truth of
                     heroic generosity! I pity thee, Count of Heidelberg," said the lady, with a
                     smile of scorn.
                  "I have surely seen that face before," he replied, half musingly; for he deemed
                     it wiser in him to avoid a discussion on the attributes of exalted natures. "It
                     is like a half-forgotten dream. Those wild, beautiful eyes! That voice! Lady, if it were not for the Egyptian hue
                     of that skin, I should say she was Mona the vestal."
                  "Thou hast an imagination which certainly suggests strange conjectures. Mona
                     the vestal! I would warn thee, however, not to let thy wild suspicions subject
                     the maiden to insult and exposure,—perhaps danger from the infuriate Druids.
                     She is under the protection of the Lord of Innistore, who knows how to avenge
                     an injury offered to the meanest of his vassals," exclaimed the Lady Bernice,
                     while a red spot glowed on her cheeks, and her dilated nostrils and flashing
                     eyes gave her visitor silent but eloquent warning to pursue the subject no
                     further. So, making his adieus, he snatched up his plumed cap, and, with a
                     lowly reverence, in which there was something of mockery, withdrew.
                  "My vengeance," he muttered, as he ran down the marble stairway,—"my vengeance
                     is at hand, Sir Count of Bretagne. Thou didst rob me of a royal bride at Tara:
                     I will in turn torture thee. Before day-dawn tomorrow thy vestal-love shall be
                     in the hands of the Druids,—to suffer such pangs as shall tear thy heart
                     asunder to hear of."
                  The imperious dame was once more alone. But a darker shadow rested on her
                     queenly brow. Through her soul strange tumults were surging. Every nobler
                     impulse of her nature, every generous chord of her woman's heart, paid homage
                     to the heroic courage, the divine charity, of that delicate and fragile maiden
                     who had forced her way into her presence to implore a boon! And such a boon! To
                     be scourged! And for whom? For one who might reward her for the sacrifice? For
                     one to whom she owed fealty and obedience? Was it for the mother from whose
                     breast she drank the stream of life? It was for none of these, but for a poor,
                     despised spised slave,—a deformed and disgusting object, so very abject in her
                     lowness that the meanest of her servants felt themselves degraded by handing
                     her a cup of water! There was a motive under it all, which she, the noble and
                     well-learned lady, could not comprehend. It could not be human affection. The
                     mystery, whatever it was, might be good or bad. It should be tested. If bad,
                     then the maiden deserved the scourge; if good, her sufferings should be amply
                     rewarded by ease and affluence, to which she would elevate her; for then
                     indeed—thought the Lady of Innistore—"shall I have found a being worthy of the
                     love of a nature like mine."
                  Then she touched a small gold hand-bell, and two fair young maidens, her
                     attendants, instantly came in from the anteroom, where they had been
                     embroidering.
                  "Tell my esquire to saddle my hunting barb, and my falconer to bring out the
                     hawks; then don thy ridinggear, to attend me in an hour's sport."
                  In a little while the gay cavalcade was coursing over the plains beyond
                     Innistore. The fragrance of shamrocks and new hay, with the scents of the wild
                     wood, floated on the calm air, through which the sun poured his glory like
                     showers of gold over the earth and sea. A gray heron and white dove soon
                     appeared, floating high up,—soaring and bathing in the sunshine, as if their
                     lives were lost in the quiet rapture of the upper air. But the hawks, fierce
                     and keen, freed from jess and hood, espied their quarry, and sped like arrows
                     up, far above them, then with one fell swoop rushed down, and struck their
                     strong claws and iron beaks, with unerring and fatal aim, into some vital part
                     of their terror-stricken victims. It was a brave sight; and the vassals of
                     Innistore, pausing in their labors and dashing the moisture from their
                     toil-stained brows, wondered if their proud and beautiful tiful lady, who swept so brightly past on her
                     coal-black horse, had ever heard of sorrow or sadness. But they little knew of
                     the shadows that were coming and going like clouds or phantoms over that
                     troubled heart: they saw only the light of the large black eyes, the flush on
                     the beauteous cheeks, the perfect and noble form, the flashing jewels and
                     waving plumes; and what wonder is it that they thought she was a stranger to
                     the ills of human flesh? As the white dove fell fluttering and bleeding on her
                     bosom, she thought of the dark maiden, the slave, and the scourge. It sickened
                     her: and, throwing off the bird, and striking back her hawk, which was whirling
                     and circling around her for the caress which he always received after he had
                     struck down his quarry, she gave the signal to return.
                  That night, when everything was silent at Innistore, when the very watch dogs
                     had crept into their kennels for a moment's sleep, the Lady Bernice, pale and
                     sleepless, arose from her couch, and, wrapping a dark woolen mantle around her,
                     sought with noiseless and swift steps the apartments of her children. By the
                     dim light of a shaded taper, she saw Aileen sleeping on pillows of snowy linen,
                     stretched out, like a queen, on a soft and luxurious couch, over which hung a
                     drapery of white and red striped linen. The hard features, the sharp, pert
                     nose, the harsh mouth, were at rest; but her arms were out on the coverlet, and
                     looked as if they were ready to recommence their unwearied, restless, and
                     tyrannical routine at any moment. The children slumbered near her. The soft
                     breath of innocence, the sweet flush of purity, made their sleep beautiful. The
                     mother's heart was stirred by the sight to unwonted and sweet impulses, and,
                     bending over, she dropped a kiss on their soft, roseate cheeks, then turned to
                     find the one she sought. But she was not there. There was a small, low couch,
                     coarsely furnished, in a corner; but it was unoccupied. Thinking she might find
                     the dark-eyed maiden, who had thus strangely stirred up the depths of her soul,
                     in another apartment, she passed noislessly through the open door into the
                     large play-room beyond. But all was dark and silent there, except just where
                     the moonlight stole through the windows and lay in broken ripples on the floor.
                     It was just light enough to see that there was no one sleeping there.
                  "For what am I seeking in the midnight? For whom?" she asked, suddenly pausing
                     in the midst of the deserted room. Just then a moan, and the murmur of voices,
                     arrested her attention, and, starting around, she saw in a distant recess a
                     strong clear light shining through a crevice. She ran toward it. It was a door
                     half open, through which she perceived a steep, narrow stairway leading up
                     under the roof. From above the light gleamed down, and the moans and the
                     murmuring descended with it. With a light, swift step she ran up, and found
                     herself on the threshold of a small, cell-like room, and the witness of a sight
                     which made the pulses of her proud heart stand still. On a heap of straw lay
                     the slave Panthea, gasping, suffering, and weeping. Beside her knelt Mona, her
                     dark hair flowing loosely around her, waving down to the very floor, except
                     where, in moving her arm, it had parted over her right shoulder, leaving it
                     uncovered. It was quite bare; and where it was not disfigured by red swollen
                     welts and long purple stripes, it was as fair as drifted snow.
                  "Oh, dark-eyed one, this is indeed a new doctrine. Forgive! Forgive and bless
                     such a one as Aileen, who deserves bitter curses. Oh! oh! I fear if it depends
                     on that, I shall never be saved," cried Panthea, wringing her hands.
                  
                  "Consider, my Panthea, the love of Jesus Christ, who, under the ban of
                     ignominy, treated like a slave, scorned as a felon, crucified like a murderer,
                     yet lifted His voice to His Father—GOD—and besought Him to forgive those who
                     persecuted Him with cruel torments unto death. We must be like Jesus Christ,"
                     said Mona, gently.
                  "Dost thou forgive Aileen?" asked Panthea.
                  "Forgive Aileen, that she has caused me to do a little for Jesus Christ, who,
                     without knowing it, led me along the sorrowful way with Him, and bound me to
                     the pillar, where, with Him, I suffered stripes? Oh, Panthea, how can I thank
                     her enough for it? When this life shall drop its clay, like a garment, into the
                     dust,—when death shall lead the liberated spirit into the freedom and
                     brightness of the children of God,—we will wonder how so brief and cowardly a
                     warfare as ours has obtained for us such an exceeding great reward."
                  "Thou speakest of death as of something sweet and lovely. Wouldst thou be
                     willing, child, to suffer death?" asked Panthea, with awe.
                  "What is Death? It is a transition. We only fall asleep, our suffering body
                     wearied with griefs which have made our life a burden; we fall asleep cheered
                     by the sweet hope of Jesus Christ, and when we awake—oh, Panthea, what glorious
                     awakening into the dawn of a day which never ends,—in a land where no clouds,
                     or dimness, or tears ever come, and, best of all, where hope is ripened into
                     fruition, where there are no more fears, or despondencies, or uncertainty
                     concerning our immortality, because it is won,—it is eternal,—GOD
                     is there. The splendor of the Divine Trinity, the glory of the Virgin Mother,
                     the prophets, the martyrs, with all the hosts of GOD, make it heaven. Death!
                     sweet Death!" exclaimed Mona, clasping her hands.
                  "The Virgin Mother! Oh, she was human! She bore a threefold sorrow in her
                     tender soul! I love her, Coreen; she will know how a poor wretch like me is
                     unable to scale the steep way of heaven without great help. Yes, she will help
                     me! She will ask her Divine Son to behold me, a poor, sorrowful woman, through
                     her own anguish on Calvary," said Panthea, smiling and calm and hopeful.
                  "She is our mother, Panthea,—our true and loving mother! Her Divine Son refuses
                     her naught. Their love is a mystery, which is inseparable one from the other;
                     the love of JESUS and MARY is as much incarnate now as it was when it was
                     announced to her at Nazareth that the 'Word would become flesh, and dwell
                     within her.' She will aid thee, my Panthea; she will lead thee; she will bear
                     thee along tenderly; for this loving mother is so tenacious of the glory of her
                     Divine Son that she cannot endure the thought that His sufferings should become
                     useless to the vilest sinner. Hence she is the friend and advocate of poor
                     sinners," replied Mona, while the light of her eyes grew brighter, and the glow
                     on her cheek heightened.
                  "But these wounds,—these stripes!" said Panthea, laying her talon-like fingers
                     on the bruised and inflamed flesh of Mona.
                  "Forbear, and forgive me, Panthea, that I unwittingly have exposed them to
                     thee. What are they? Nothing to mourn over," said Mona, quickly covering her
                     shoulder.
                  The Lady of Innistore had listened to every word. Her soul was filled with
                     wonder and awe. Could it be true? Yet, if false, who would endure sufferings
                     and death for it? There was something so grand, so sublime, even in the
                     smallest thing she had heard, that she felt her soul swelling and dilating
                     within her to know more. These new
                     doctrines of a resurrection from the dead, and of eternal life, were ecstatic.
                        She knew that they were Christians. In the excitement of the
                     moment, her limbs trembled and almost refused to support her; and, fearing that
                     she might fall, she descended with faltering footsteps the narrow stairway, and
                     crept back to her own splendid apartments.
                  The next morning, Mona was summoned to her presence. The lady was alone, in a
                     shaded and darkened room. Her black hair, unbound by net or cincture, fell like
                     a veil around her. No pearls drooped over her pale cheeks to-day, no jewels
                     glistened on her neck or arms, but, with a sad look tempering the haughty
                     majesty of her brow, she reclined in an indolent posture on a couch.
                  "I am here, lady, at thy command," said Mona, who entered so softly that she
                     did not lift her eyes.
                  "Ha! yes! I have summoned thee to my presence to question thee," said the lady,
                     turning her penetrating glance, full of haughty will on the meek face of
                     Mona.
                  "Thou hast a right, noble lady, to question me according to thy will."
                  "Tell me truly, dark and beautiful maiden, why thou didst offer
                     thyself to be scourged for a poor deformed wretch like the slave Panthea, whose
                     death would have been a release to herself and others. Some powerful motive
                     must have ruled thee!"
                  "Noble lady, Panthea is old and crippled. I am young and strong——"
                  "Thou art deceiving me! Aileen is strong; I am strong; there are others still
                     stronger than we: why did not we—why did not
                     they—suffer for Panthea? Thou hadst no human motive. No mortal
                     reason can explain thy actions," said the lady, rising on her elbow, that she
                     might better see the face of her she was questioning.
                  "I pitied her, she was so friendless and desolate," said Mona, gently and
                     humbly; "nor do I esteem it much that I have done for her."
                  "Thou art a Christian!" said the lady, sternly.
                  "I AM," replied Mona, with a flush of joy over her countenance.
                  "Thou art MONA!"
                  "I was Mona," she said, with a shudder.
                  "Thou hast borne scourging right bravely, O faithless vestal: how wilt thou
                     bear death?"
                  "Death! For Christ!" she said, clasping her hands together on her bosom. "Oh,
                     lady, can it be that I—I, a poor, weak maiden—will be found worthy of suffering
                     death for Christ?"
                  There was a wild perturbation in the lady's soul. Here, under her roof, in her
                     very presence,—noble, heroic beyond aught she had ever dreamed of, suffering
                     scourges and glorying in death,—a Christian stood before her!
                  "And how wilt thou be rewarded by this Christ, after death?" she asked, in a
                     low, choking voice.
                  "With immortality, O lady; with new and eternal life; with the glorious vision
                     of GOD, which filleth those who are ransomed with exhaustless joy. Oh, Death!
                     strong portal of Eternal rest! Oh, sweet Death!" exclaimed Mona, as if
                     forgetful of the lady's presence.
                  "And how dost thou know this?" asked the Lady Bernice, in the same low
                     tone.
                  "The great and infinite God—our Father—has himself revealed it, through His
                     Divine Son. Oh, lady, believe! Turn thy soul away from the vain worship of
                     false deities to the true and living God," exclaimed Mona, throwing herself at
                     her feet.
                  "Maiden, thou hast proved thy faith by a heroism worthy of a better cause. I
                     admit that there is something thing
                     in it which is sublime and passes my comprehension. At some future time, as a
                     curious study, I will investigate its philosophy. But thou art a Christian. One
                     saw thee to-day, whose sharp eyes recognized thee under thy disguise. He is
                     tarrying at the temple. Perchance thou dost deserve death for thine apostasy,
                     and it may be difficult to protect thee, but I—yes, I will do my utmost to save
                     thee, Mona. Remain thou here. I will speak with Aileen," said the lady, rising
                     from her pillows and twisting her long tresses around a jeweled comb, which
                     confined them to the back of her head.
                  Aileen was luxuriating in one of her usual fermentations. Her shrill voice rung
                     out in commands and counter-orders, in threats and shrieks, varied by the sharp
                     sound of a strap over the shoulders of some luckless domestic who crossed her
                     path, or the crash of a tin flagon or a broom, which, falling short of its aim
                     or going beyond the head at which it was thrown, fell clattering against the
                     wall or lumbering along the floor. But the entrance of Lady Bernice calmed the
                     storm in a moment. She was an unexpected and rare visitor in those regions
                     where her foster mother had heretofore reigned supreme. Aileen stood aghast.
                     She felt that her coming portended nothing good for her. The lady's stern brow
                     and compressed lips convinced her that her star was no longer in the
                     ascendant.
                  "My gracious lady," said the subdued virago, "take this chair. If I had known
                     thou were coming, things would have worn a different look, I trow."
                  "I wish but few words with thee, Aileen," she said, standing cold and stern in
                     her marvelous beauty, and waving back with her hand the proffered chair. "Thou
                     mayest be faithful in thy professions,—nay, thou mayest feel for me a sort of
                     love, even,—but thou hast committed a fault which I would not brook from the
                     mother who bore me, if she lived. Thou hast set thyself up as the awarder of
                     punishments: according to thy will the scourge is to fly on whose shoulders and
                     breast thou pleasest. From this day thy power ceases. Thou shalt have no one
                     under thee; because thou art a tyrant. Thou shalt have no privileges or
                     immunities beyond the other vassals of Innistore; and, if this does not suit
                     thee, thou canst go away. Where is Panthea the slave?"
                  "Panthea?" gasped Aileen, pale and trembling, for she knew that inexorable
                     will, or she would have raged and stormed and wept. "She is up there,—in a
                     small room under the roof."
                  "Where no air or light can penetrate,—where her pain-racked limbs and feeble
                     body waste on straw! Tigress, I could tear thee and beat thee, were it not—but
                     I have learned a lesson. Go this moment with some of thy fellow-servants, and
                     bring,—as tenderly as if it were I,—bring Panthea here. Lay her on
                        that bed. First shake up the pillows and turn back the sheets.
                     There! begone!"
                  "But the children, lady,—the children!" faltered Aileen, almost gasping for
                     breath.
                  "Shall be removed forthwith to the chamber near my own, where I—I,
                     remember—will superintend their well-being; for I trust thee no longer."
                  After they left the room, she walked to and fro, while her face glowed and her
                     eyes flashed like the eyes of some fierce and beautiful beast of the desert. A
                     new life was stirring within her; new light was dawning through faculties and
                     attributes but half developed in her nature. She began to feel and understand
                     the pleading of her soul for better and higher things than she had ever known.
                     "A mean Christian shall not outdo me, a princess of royal birth, in
                     generosity," she murmured.
                  
                  Just then the door opened, and they brought in the sick slave and laid her on
                     Aileen's bed. The lady herself arranged the pillows, and, sending for one of
                     her own fine linen garments, put it on her with her own hand.
                  "Bring me wine," she said to her wonder-stricken servants. The wine was brought
                     in a silver goblet, and she herself held it to Panthea's lips, who, swallowing
                     a small portion, soon recovered her strength.
                  "Thou art better now, Panthea," she said, gently.
                  "May JESUS CHRIST be thy reward!" whispered the slave.
                  A deep flush reddened the lady's face, and tears flashed for an instant over
                     the light of her eyes, as she whispered, "Be quiet."
                  "Aileen," she said, turning to her, "this is no longer thy place. Go into the
                     western chamber, near my own, and make it ready for the little ones and
                     thyself. Panthea, one will be with thee in a little while, who has been thy
                     best friend. Hereafter, thou shalt want nothing."
                  Aileen, ashamed, enraged, and humbled, could only submit; but she vowed in her
                     inmost heart that the brown girl, as she called Mona, and who she imagined was
                     the cause of her disgrace, should suffer for it. Life without vengeance would
                     be a burden, she thought, and from that hour, moody and silent, she brooded
                     over plans of revenge. When Mona returned, all was changed. Panthea, breathless
                     and grateful, recounted faithfully all that had occurred.
                  "See how soon Heaven flies to the succor of its poor children, my Panthea; and,
                     as if to crown my joy, I see Lena, the holy woman, coming up from the park,"
                     said Mona, gently.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XII.
                  THE LOVER.
                  PANTHEA was asleep when the fisherman's wife came in. The fatigue she had
                     undergone in being removed from her cell under the eaves, combined with the
                     unwonted luxuries of a soft bed and fresh linen, had lulled her into a deep and
                     quiet slumber.
                  "I am glad to see thee, good Lena," whispered Mona, leading her to a chair.
                  "I have come up from the shore in great haste to-day," said Lena, with a
                     sorrowful countenance, while she lifted Mona's hand tenderly to her lips. "I
                     have ill tidings for thee, lady. There is a report abroad that the Druids,
                     having learned that thou art living and a Christian, have sworn to get
                     possession of thee once more, that they may wreak a horrible vengeance for what
                     they call thy apostasy. It is said that their spies are everywhere. I thought
                     this was evil enough; but at the very portals of Innistore I heard from Dathy a
                     tale which has curdled my blood. Is it true,—lady, is the thing I have heard
                     this day true?"
                  "Dathy? Tale? How should I know, good Lena—I, who never leave these
                     apartments?" said Mona, looking down.
                  "No need, gentle lady, no need to have left these apartments to hear it. Dathy
                     says thou hast been scourged by Aileen—scourged on thy naked shoulders— for the guilt of another," said
                     Lena, almost choked by the effort she made to keep back her tears.
                  "Trouble not thyself, my Lena, about idle tales. Thy information is not as
                     correct as it might be. As to Aileen,—poor Aileen!—Is she not groping in
                     darkness? How can she see the lures which the evil one spreads along her way?
                     Let us not judge Aileen harshly," said Mona, in a low voice.
                  "Is it true, though, that thou wert scourged?" persisted Lena. "Tell me
                        why, I beseech thee, sweet lady."
                  "Lena, if on some day in thy life-journey thou shouldst see our divine Lord
                     JESUS, faltering along, lame, sick, sorrowful, mocked, threatened, and treated
                     like a felon, would not thy soul burn within thee to help Him,—to aid Him?
                     Would it not fill thee with joy if thou couldst say, 'Here, dearest Lord, let
                     me take thy place: thou hast suffered enough; thou art fainting on the way: I
                     am strong: let me lift that rugged burden from thy lacerated shoulders, let
                     mine be the flesh that the scourge falls on'? And suppose he should say,
                     'Daughter, thy offer is precious and acceptable to me.' Consider, my Lena. What
                     wouldst thou do?"
                  "Hast thou had a vision, then?" asked Lena, in a low and agitated voice.
                  "No! No vision! In yonder suffering one—in Panthea, who, guiltless of offense,
                     and racked with pain, was sentenced to be scourged, I beheld renewed the
                     Passion of Jesus Christ. In her I saw a wounded member of His thorn-crowned
                     head, and, for the love of HIM, in this the creature for whom He suffered,
                        I endured the punishment. Aileen—poor Aileen!—was ministering
                     to Him, although she knew it not. Let us find no offense in her," said Mona,
                     humbly.
                  "May God the mighty Father pity her blindness!" said Lena, weeping; "may her
                     present humiliation prepare her soul to receive the light of Christ! But I must
                     hasten away. I have other tidings to relate. Dathy says that yesterday a German
                     noble who is tarrying at the temple, and who belongs to the schools, saw thee
                     here, and asked him many strange questions concerning thee. He suspects thee to
                     be other than thou seemest. He told Dathy that, if his suspicions were correct,
                     Semo would raze the foundations of Innistore to search for thee. But, should
                     danger approach, my son Dego, who is under-gardener here, and also a Christian,
                     will convey thee by secret ways back to the cavern on the shore, in which there
                     is a hidden chamber where the sacred vessels are kept. The good Finian himself
                     showed Dego the way of access to it; and there, he says, thou must
                     fly for shelter, and remain until the pursuit and persecution is over."
                  "Thanks, my Lena! May Heaven be thy eternal reward!" replied Mona, with the
                     far-away look of one who saw beyond the limits of human vision. "But stay one
                     moment, good Lena: I must tell thee one thing. The Lady Bernice knows my
                     secret——"
                  "Ay," interrupted Lena; "but even she cannot protect thee from the Druids."
                  "No; but she can consent for one who understands the art of healing to come to
                     Panthea. The holy Finian, I have heard, knows the secrets of herbs and
                     medicines. Panthea is a Christian. Once, when she was in danger of death, I
                     baptized her; but she has had no other help. Thou dost understand me?" said
                     Mona.
                  "Yes. I will bear thy message, and send thee word by my son Now adieu, my sweet
                     child," said Lena, embracing her tenderly; "adieu! should we never meet again,
                     remember me and mine."
                  
                  "Thou meanest, if I should get home before thee," said Mona, with a bright
                     smile. "Well, if I should, forget not, O Lena, that it may be some time ere I
                     shall be in those unclouded realms where those who have 'washed their robes
                     white in the blood of the Lamb;' and those who have gone up through much
                     tribulation, ever intercede for those who wait in hope. Let, then, thy
                     petitions be earnest and unceasing for my release: then, Lena,—then, my sister,
                     amid that glory ever new, the brightness and splendor whereof fill the
                     inhabitants of that land of life with rapture inexpressible, I shall not forget
                     thee. Farewell, my Lena," she said, kissing the brown cheek of the fisherman's
                     wife. Then they parted.
                  More than once was Mona summoned to the presence of Bernice of Innistore, who,
                     well versed in books and the subtleties of false doctrines, made use of
                     eloquence, argument, and persuasions to shake her faith. But, like a rock, it
                     stood strong and steadfast, the very waves that dashed against it recoiling
                     back on themselves. Calm and gentle and humble, her constancy and faithfulness,
                     the good and unanswerable reasons she gave for the hope she had, the proofs she
                     brought, simple, clear, and strong, of the existence of an ETERNAL and ALMIGHTY
                     GOD, not only startled the mind of the haughty woman, but when Mona, sitting at
                     her feet, talked of Jesus Christ and the judgment to come, she trembled, and
                     covered her face with her robe. But she still offered libations to Nerf Naom,
                     and crowned her statue with cassia-leaves and roses; she still went to the
                     temple to consult the Pythoness of the shrine of Nerf and throw spices into the
                     sacred fires; she was still pagan,—as much so as a seed is a seed until its
                     hidden life bursts forth in flower and fruit.
                  One night, when all were wrapped in deep and silent repose, a sudden clangor
                     burst on the air. The braying of trumpets, the shouts of the men-at-arms, the
                     shrill outcry of the sentries on the walls, the howling of chained beagles, and
                     the clank of bolts and chains as the portcullis at the entrance to the castle
                     was slowly lifted, mingled together in one confused and terrific din. Mona
                     started up. Her heart bounded and throbbed almost to bursting. The shadow and
                     bitterness of doom fell darkly around her; the dread, and the weak whispering
                     of nature appalled her. She thought that Semo and the Druids had come to tear
                     her away to suffer in the darkness and mystery of the temple-dungeon, which she
                     had heard was far down beneath the surface of the earth, having an outlet into
                     the sea.
                  So thought the Lady of Innistore.
                  So thought Dego, the son of Lena.
                  "Thou must fly, Mona!—thou must fly this moment!" exclaimed the Lady Bernice,
                     rushing in, with only her loose night-robes around her, while her countenance
                     wore a look of wild affright. "Kneel not there so calm while the Druids enter
                     Innistore."
                  There was a single tap on the door. Mona opened it, and found Dego there.
                  "Lady," he said, "come, thou hast time. I will bear thee to a place of
                     safety."
                  "Fly, Mona!" exclaimed the Lady Bernice, snatching up a gray woolen mantle and
                     throwing it over the vestal's shoulders. "Already I hear the tramping of their
                     horses, the ringing of their armed heels on the flags of the court—but hark!
                     hark! That cry! As I live, I believe it is my lord Eadhna! They come this way!
                     Nerf Naom!" she cried, flying to a window that overlooked the broad court
                     below, "what do I see? By the torch-light I behold Eadhna,—my lord,—and Abaris,
                     his brother, who holds aloft,
                     instead of a banner, a cross,—who wears on his breast, instead of the harp, a
                     cross,—the Christian symbol. And—and—oh, Nerf Naom! I see on Eadhna's bosom
                     also a cross of gold! And there, near him, rides the young Gaulish count, who
                     also wears this sign of sorrow and ignominy and shame. Oh, woe!—oh, evil day!
                     why hast thou come to Innistore?" she cried, wringing her hands.
                  "What troubles thee, dear lady? Dost thou see aught like calamity drawing near
                     to Innistore?" asked Mona, lifting her hand gently to her lips.
                  "He has returned a Christian!" she shrieked, throwing off Mona's hand,—"a
                     Christian!" then fled back to her apartments.
                  Mona slept no more that night; with Panthea, who still trembled with alarm, she
                     gave thanks to God that salvation had come to Innistore, and together they
                     prayed that the Lady Bernice might taste of the waters of life as they flowed
                     past.
                  It was even so. Like the Areopagite who sought Paul and returned believing in
                     Christ, so the Lord Eadhna had gone to seek his bard brother in the camp of
                     Patricius, to exhaust the eloquence of language,—to urge him by the hopes of
                     his family, by the grief of his mother, the pride of his father, the credit of
                     his house, to abjure these new errors, and once more, as one of the royal bards
                     of Erin, take his place in the council of the nation and at the altar of the
                     temple. Then, if all persuasion and argument should fail, he determined to slay
                     him with his own hand at the very feet of Patricius. But he returned a
                     Christian, accompanied by the bard Abaris and the Count of Bretagne, bringing
                     with him a billet from the holy apostle Patricius to the Bishop Finian,
                     beseeching him to go without delay to give baptism to the household of the Lord
                     Eadhna of Innistore.
                  Christianity had developed in full splendor the spiritual and intellectual life
                     of Abaris. Like a brilliant-plumaged bird whose wings, limp and powerless, had
                     kept him from soaring up into the sunshine, whose notes, sweet but earth-born
                     and earth-bound, had floated no higher than the cloud-drifts that bounded his
                     vision, he now, healed and full of power, soared, as on eagle pinions, far into
                     the sunbright regions of faith, where he sang of God and Christ in strains of
                     such surpassing harmony that all who heard him paused to listen, entranced,
                     first by the eloquence of his words, then by the promises of faith, which
                     filled their souls, at last, with the treasures of the mystery of Divine Love,
                     and a peace which breathed over them a foretaste of heaven. Like that fair and
                     lovely gem of the Church, Francis Xavier, of a later age, Abaris had found at
                     once the perfection and sanctification which so many toil after through penance
                     and tears, yet so few attain; he had solved at once the difficult science
                     which, even on earth, so elevates the spirit above the flesh that it has rapt
                     visions of God. But Eadhna and Clotaire, more fettered by human ties and more
                     filled with the thoughts and cares of life, followed at a slower pace,—humble
                     neophytes, whose faith, though not less strong, was less developed by
                     supernatural graces; who, while they adored in spirit and in truth the Divine
                     attributes of the Triune God, felt determined, at whatever cost it might be, to
                     fight the good fight and remain steadfast in Christ. The Lady Bernice stood
                     truly between heaven and earth. The eloquence of Abaris melted her proud soul
                     to tears; the persuasions of her husband shook her more than she would show;
                     the gentle arguments of the young count filled her with admiration; while the
                     example and prayers, the humility and sweetness, of Mona, and the patience of
                     Panthea, convinced her that their
                     faith was something more than human,—nay, almost holy; but, when half persuaded
                     to yield her proud nature to the yoke of JESUS CHRIST, her human friendships,
                     the censure of the Druids, habits of superstition, veneration for fables,
                     distrust, and the haughty love of power and regal splendor, dragged her back,
                     and lifted high barriers between her heart and the inflowing of divine graces.
                     She was soon the only one of the hundreds who filled the fortress of Innistore,
                     who had not asked for baptism. Abaris was constantly out with the vassals, in
                     the field, in their cabins, in their tents, in their barracks, teaching them
                     day and night, forgetting food and rest in his zeal for their salvation, until
                     old and young, the soldier and the serf, matrons and maids, the aged and little
                     children, thirsted for the waters of life; and again he sought Patricius to
                     beseech him to send a priest to them, for as yet they could find no trace of
                     the Bishop Finian.
                  "It is strange," said Lord Eadhna, "passing strange, that we have no tidings of
                     Finian. Hast thou ever heard of a Christian called Finian, Bernice?"
                  She paused,—opened her lips,—a deep flush dyed her cheeks; then she said, "I
                     might deceive thee if I did not scorn a lie. I know not where this
                     Finian is; but two of my household, who were Christians before ye arrived, may
                     tell thee. I have heard the name pass between them."
                  "Two Christians! And didst thou, sweet wife, protect them?" said Lord Eadhna,
                     tenderly.
                  "Their God protected them," said she, in a low voice, as she turned away to
                     hide a starting tear.
                  "Who are those Christians? Where are they, Bernice?" he asked.
                  "One," she said, slowly, "is Panthea the slave; the other is Mona the
                     vestal!"
                  "Mona the vestal!" cried he, with an expression of amazement on his face.
                  "Mona! Does Mona live?" exclaimed Clotaire of Bretagne, who was sitting in an
                     embrasure of a deep window, reading. He threw down the roll of parchment, and,
                     springing forward, knelt on a cushion at the feet of the Lady Bernice, half
                     wild with emotion. "Does Mona live? or is it some other Mona?"
                  "First tell me, sir count, whence this strange interest in Mona? Where couldst
                     thou have seen Mona? Answer me on thy honor as a knight and thy faith as a
                     Christian. For I have heard strange rumors," she said, with proud reserve.
                  "Never but once, lady, did my eyes rest on Mona. I rescued her from a savage
                     wolf, which had been driven, infuriate by the dogs, into the sacred grove. I,
                     not knowing that its precincts were sacred, followed him with my spear, and
                     came on him in time to save Mona, toward whom he was springing when my spear
                     cleft his skull. She fell insensible, and for a few brief moments I held her on
                     my bosom and gazed in her face——"
                  "I am a woman, sir count, and can understand the rest. Thou didst love
                     her."
                  "Yes. I loved her as thou, lady, mightst love a white dove, or a
                     lamb without blemish. But Lord Eadhna can tell thee how I was warned
                     suddenly,—how in a brief moment I learned that, she being a vestal, my love was
                     utterly hopeless. Then I heard that Mona had fallen into the sea, where I
                     believed she slumbered, until these tidings greet me, that Mona lives and is a
                     Christian! It is wondrous! it is too wild a thing to be true!" he said,
                     striking his forehead.
                  "Thou hast never seen her, then, since the first time?" asked the lady,
                     calmly.
                  
                  "I have thought of her as dead! Seen her! No! In the wildest frenzy of hope, I
                     never dreamed of Mona—living," he replied.
                  "And now that she lives,—that ye are both Christians,—does thy faith forbid a
                     renewal of thy love?"
                  "No, lady: our faith lays no ban on a love like mine. I would wed Mona."
                  "Then listen, and learn her history," said the Lady Bernice. And with flashing
                     eyes, a grave brow, and proud but truthful air, she told them all she knew of
                     Mona,—of her being scourged, of her sweetness and patience, and of the meek
                     innocence of her life. Both of those brave and noble men dashed tears from
                     their cheeks as she proceeded. Then she told, without a shade of boasting, how
                     she, by her heroic virtue, had protected and saved her. "I have heard her
                     speak," she continued, "of one Finian,—a holy man; and she may perchance give
                     thee the information thou dost desire concerning him. But tell me, Eadhna, what
                     need have we of Finian?"
                  "Noble wife, Finian is a Christian priest and bishop,—one who baptizes and
                     administers the divine sacraments of the Church to believers."
                  "But Abaris—our brother?"
                  "My brother is only a teacher: he is not yet a priest," he
                     replied.
                  "And what dost thou want with this priest?" she insisted.
                  "To baptize my children, and those of my household who believe in Christ."
                  "My children!" she said, with a bewildered look.
                        "Husband,—children,—household,—all Christians! But I will leave
                     ye now, and this evening ye shall see Mona."
                  They left the room, and were soon out on the marble terraces of Innistore.
                  "Shall we fish, or ride? Dost thou prefer a gallop over the moors, or a sail on
                     yon bright blue river?" said Lord Eadhna to his guest.
                  "I love the wave,—the bounding motion, and the sound of the tide sweeping
                     along," said the young count.
                  "It pleases me sometimes to think that the same billow that bears me up flows
                     on toward my native land,—that perchance my mother looks on it, or touches it
                     with her beauteous fingers, as she wanders on the shore."
                  "Let us out on the waves, then. Here, Malcho! bring the tackle and nets down to
                     the shore: we need not be idle, while the Shannon swarms with fish," said Lord
                     Eadhna.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XIII.
                  FOR CHRIST!
                  THE Lady Bernice sought Mona. She found her sitting beside Panthea, singing a
                     sweet Christian lay, while her busy fingers plied the needle on some fine
                     handicraft which required taste and patience. She arose, and, with love and
                     gratitude expressed in every look and movement, she offered the lady a chair.
                     She would have remained standing, but the lady drew a low, cushioned stool
                     beside her, and told her to sit there.
                  "And how is Panthea to-day?" she inquired, kindly.
                  "Better, noble lady. May the great God reward thee for thy kindness to a poor
                     slave!" replied Panthea.
                  "Thou art no longer a slave, Panthea: thou art from this moment
                        free!"
                  "Free, lady! Alas! let me still be thy slave!"
                  "What! refuse freedom?" exclaimed the lady.
                  "Pardon, sweet lady, but my bonds are precious to me. Let me still wear them
                     for the love of JESUS CHRIST. It is all I can do for Him, who has 'bought me
                     with a price' that I might inherit eternal life."
                  "They give life, they give themselves to be scourged, they refuse
                        liberty, the sweetest of all, for Christ," mused the lady. "But
                     it matters little to me, Panthea. I wished to do thee a kindness; but, if thou
                     dost prefer bonds to freedom, thou art still a slave."
                  "Thanks, lady," said Panthea bowing her head with a smile.
                  "I hoped to have pleased Panthea with my gift; but the news which I have for
                     thee, Mona, will, I know, fill thee with joy," said the lady, fixing her full
                     black eyes on Mona's face. "My lord has returned, a Christian; the bard Abaris,
                     and a young noble from Gaul, are at Innistore, our guests, and both Christians.
                     All of my household, except Aileen, are Christians also. I stand alone!"
                  "Salvation is nearer to thee than thou dost dream, O lady," said Mona, with
                     sudden inspiration.
                  "When I see one die for Christ,—when I see Nerf Naom fall from the
                     height of yonder temple when no storm rends the air or convulsion shakes the
                        earth,—then, Mona, perhaps I may receive this new faith," she
                     said, with a smile of scorn. "But it was not for this that I came. Dost thou
                     know a Christain priest named Finian?"
                  "I do, lady," replied Mona, after a moment's hesitation.
                  "Nay! have no fears for him. My lord wishes a letter from Patricius conveyed to
                     him. Dost thou know of a trusty messenger?"
                  "I know of one who would place it in his hands tomorrow at dawn," she
                     replied.
                  "Who?"
                  "Myself," she answered, humbly.
                  "I will not permit it. The peril is too great. Some one else must be found to
                     do it," said the Lady Bernice.
                  "I have to see the holy Finian on the morrow." Just then Aileen, who had
                     lingered at the door, crept through the apartment, unseen by any except
                     Panthea, on whom she threw a look of hatred and revenge. She had heard all she
                     wished to hear.
                  
                  "Dost thou go alone?" asked the lady.
                  "No, lady. Dego, the son of Lena, who is under-gardener at Innistore, and is a
                     Christain, will guide and protect me. He will not be home until night, as he
                     has gone some miles up the shore to gather sea-weed for the soil. Hence the
                     necessity that I should be the hearer of the letter from Patricius," said Mona,
                     in her gentle way.
                  "And for what dost thou venture on so perilous a journey, Mona?"
                  "Dear lady," said Mona, in her sweet, humble tones, "the Christian priests
                     offer to the great God an unbloody sacrifice, the fruits whereof are the real
                     Presence—the body and blood, the divinity and humanity—of JESUS CHRIST. Under
                     the forms of bread and wine, HE, the Divine One, is as truly present as He was
                     on the cross,—as He is in heaven at the right hand of the Father; and under
                     these veils we unworthy mortals receive Him, our food and our guest."
                  "Receive a God!" exclaimed the lady, with a look of awe,—"a God! I will not
                     believe it. It is profanity!"
                  "Not profanity, dear lady; for He Himself tells us, in the great Psalter of His
                     word, that unless we eat of His body and drink of His blood we shall not enter
                     eternal life. It is His own free gift to His children, whose sweet privilege it
                     is to receive it," replied Mona.
                  "This is wonderful! But, Mona, these are delusions. Thou art deceived, poor
                     maiden. But listen. One day a vestal of Nerf Naom was wandering through the
                     sacred grove, when a wild and ferocious wolf sprang on her, and would have torn
                     her piecemeal, but that a young, noble, and handsome knight came to the rescue,
                     and dashed his spear through the skull of the savage beast. The knight saw the
                     vestal, for the wind had blown back her veil; he saw her as she lay senseless
                     on his breast, where he had lifted her, and he loved her. Dost thou understand
                     me, Mona?"
                  "I do, lady," she replied, raising her clear large eyes calmly to the lady's
                     face.
                  "It is well. This knight is now a Christian. He is here; and when he heard that
                     thou didst not perish in the sea, but wert living, and also a Christian, he
                     unfolded his buried love and declared that he would wed thee! What sayest thou
                     now, Mona? Thou wouldst be my equal,—a countess, a powerful and rich lady, and
                     the beloved bride of a noble and generous knight."
                  "May the great and holy God reward him evermore for saving me from the fangs of
                     the wolf! I remember the day well."
                  "But he loves thee, Mona! He—this Count of Bretagne—would wed thee!"
                  "Noble lady," she said, very gently, "I have naught to do with human love: I
                     know it not. I would not wed the greatest monarch the earth knows, even if such
                     a one deigned to seek my hand. I am pledged and plighted in a holy faith to a
                     divine Spouse" And a smile, one of those rare and radiant smiles that sometimes
                     flashed like light from heaven over her face, now lit her countenance.
                  "Thou art mad!" exclaimed the Lady Bernice, angrily.
                  "Not mad, most noble lady. I only mean that, instead of being a vestal of Nerf,
                     who is a false Deity, I wish to be a vestal of JESUS CHRIST, who is the true
                     and living God."
                  "Per Ethis! They count all things as nothing
                     for this same God,—life, love, riches, rank, power, and liberty!" said the Lady
                     Bernice, in a low voice. "It seems noble,—it is heroic, to say the least of it.
                     But, Mona, it is my will for thee to appear this evening before my lord; he
                     wishes to question thee. Therefore wash the dye from thy flesh, unfold those rich tresses,
                     and at sunset come to my chamber, where I will see thee properly attired for
                     the interview."
                  "Lady, might I be spared this?" said Mona, distressed and agitated.
                  "Spared! No! I will it!—I command it!" she said, as she rose, with
                     an imperious air, to leave the room.
                  "Thou shalt be obeyed," said Mona, meekly; "and may He who has promised to be
                     my help in times of temptation, aid me with strength!"
                  That evening the Lady Bernice stood waiting alone in her splendid chamber. It
                     was hung round with amber-colored silk and Phœnician mirrors. Luxurious
                     couches, tables made of ivory and silver, filled with flacons of crystal and
                     small golden vases containing cosmetics and perfumes, caskets of jewels, and
                     other fine articles of adornment, stood against the walls. Large vases of
                     flowers, an embroidery-frame, a song-bird warbling in a gold-wired cage near
                     the window, would have told, in plain language, that this was the favorite
                     retreat of some high-born dame, even had she not been there in her haughty
                     beauty, engaged in the truly feminine task of examining a number of splendid
                     dresses which were strewed over the couch before her. They were of the richest
                     fabric and most costly finish. The last rich tints of sunset streamed through
                     the western window, and fell with a deep glow around her, and brought out the
                     glitter of many a gem in the robes and draperies she handled. Looking first at
                     one, then at another, she laid them down with a dissatisfied air. At last,
                     under a heap which she had not touched, she espied one made of white and
                     silver. With a smile of satisfaction she hastily drew it out, and, selecting a
                     veil to match it, she threw them over her arm, and went toward a mirror ror
                     which overhung one of the costly tables we have described. The robe was
                     fashioned of white silk, embroidered with foliage of silver and pearls; the
                     veil was of transparent tissue, dotted with silver and bordered with a fringe
                     of seed-pearls. "This will do," she said, well pleased. "This will just suit
                     her strange and wondrous beauty. Aha! here she is now. Come in, Mona. See what
                     I have selected for thy adornment. Does not this suit a vestal?" she said,
                     laying her hand on the rich robe.
                  "Noble lady!" she said, shrinking back.
                  "Mona," was the imperious reply, while those large gleaming eyes were bent full
                     on her, "I am one used to command,—and to obedience in those whom
                     I command. Come hither, then, and let me deck thy matchless beauty as it
                     deserves."
                  Without another word or gesture of repugnance, she approached, and yielded
                     herself submissively to the lady's humor. It was a new form of suffering; and,
                     breathing the name she loved so well, she stood silent and patient,—silent and
                     patient, like a lamb which is garlanded with roses and spangled gauzes and gay
                     ribbons, to become a victim in the shambles. So Mona stood while the proud dame
                     of Innistore arrayed her in robes of purity and splendor. With her own hands
                     she braided back the dark, flowing tresses, over which she threw the veil and
                     clasped over it a band of pearls, fastened the jeweled clasps that secured the
                     dress, then stood off to view the effect. Never had she seen anything half so
                     fair; and, lifting her hands, she whispered, "Oh, Ethis! how more than
                     beautiful!" With downcast eyes, Mona stood like a white-robed spirit watching
                     over the dead, so pale, so motionless, so holy was her aspect,—her wondrous
                     beauty half veiled, half disclosed, her hands folded like two lilies on her bosom, and her eyes
                     looking down, darkening her white cheeks with the shadow of their black
                     fringes.
                  But her thoughts were not there,—no, not there.
                  "Come; my lord and his guest await us," said the Lady Bernice, sweeping along
                     in her superb beauty, followed by Mona. They looked like the unclouded moon and
                     the evening star. Mona's heart was troubled. She felt like a bird entangled in
                     the fowler's snare. In her poverty and humble obscurity, she had experienced
                     the sweetness and joy of suffering; her soul, undazzled by the glare of life,
                     had bounded lightly forward, and each cheerful endurance had brought her nearer
                     heaven; but now temptations, siren voices, the glitter and magnificence of
                     riches, distracted the even tenor of her progress. Not that she yielded to
                     them, or that she even feared them: they only for a fleeting moment diverted
                     her mind from its calm and joyous contemplations; like a breath of wind they
                     passed over her soul, rippling and agitating its pure depths, until the bright
                     images reflected therein from heaven were hidden,—only hidden,—not erased. She
                     would have yielded again with rapture to the scourge, but she would fain have
                     been spared this.
                  Lord Eadhna and Count Clotaire were conversing together in low, earnest tones
                     when, the Lady Bernice and Mona came in. The last bright glare of day still
                     lingered in the west; and in the uncertain and translucent shadow Mona looked
                     like an ethereal being who had lost her way in the realms of space and paused a
                     moment in this isle-world to rest. In graceful lines and rich folds the white
                     gleaming draperies fell around her, giving out here and there a flash and glow
                     as they caught the lingering day-beams.
                  "Welcome, child of God, our friend and sister," said Eadhna of Innistore, with
                     gentle reverence.
                  "Welcome, Mona," said the Count Clotaire, while his heart bounded and his
                     cheeks glowed with the fair and chaste hopes her presence awakened. But a
                     feeling which was impelled by some interior power, and which he could not
                     define, held him back: he did not approach her.
                  "I owe thee many thanks, Lord of Innistore,"she said, very gently, and with
                     sweet gravity, "for the protection of thy house; and to thee, noble stranger,
                     blessings and thanks, for the poor life thou didst so courageously save."
                  "Mere thanks, Mona, are a poor reward for such an act," whispered Bernice. "Thy
                     words are as cold as marble."
                  "I fear thou hast forgotten me, Mona, in the terror of the
                     incident; but I—thy image has never left me a moment since the
                     hour it occurred," said Count Clotaire.
                  "Nay, gentle sir! I could"—began Mona; then she paused, lest some word might
                     fall to wound. "A transitory glimpse could not insure remembrance! But my
                        deliverer has not been forgotten. I have prayed for Heaven's
                     most precious graces for him. If I seem ungrateful, pardon me; for I am not
                     skilled in the language of the world."
                  "In the presence of these thy noble friends and mine, I beseech thee, Mona,
                     tell me: could I not win thee to a warmer feeling than gratitude?" said the
                     young count, earnestly.
                  "I grieve to pain thee," said Mona, whose face grew very white. "Heaven knows,
                     if I dared, I would spare any word which might wound thee. But I am not
                        my own! My feelings, my hopes, my loves, sir count, are no longer
                     mine to give: they are pledged to ONE from whom I would not withdraw them to
                     obtain the empire of worlds, of such priceless value is the reward I hope to
                     win."
                  
                  Count Clotaire bowed his face and covered it with his hands. Strong emotion
                     shook his frame; they could hear his quick-heaving breath, and the sharp
                     throbbing of his heart, all was so breathless and still.
                  "Mona," he said, at last, in low and tremulous tones,—"Mona, when I thought
                     thou wert slumbering beneath the sea, thy image, like a veiled angel, led me to
                     aspire after the perfection of morality and a pure height of philosophy. Now
                     that thou art living, and, though lost to my love, a Christian, a servant of
                     Christ, even as I wish to be, thou shalt help me heavenward. Thy words have
                     gone like a keen, sharp blade through my heart, hewing asunder fibers and
                     chords that bound me in sweet memories and bright visions of hope to thee;
                     but—but—go: I would not rob Heaven of its vestal! My love for thee
                     was deep and strong; but from this moment I give thee up,—my offering for the
                     love of Christ," he continued, as he approached her, and, bending on one knee,
                     lifted her hand reverently to his lips.
                  "May Christ be thy reward evermore!" she murmured, while a single tear rolled
                     over her pale cheek.
                  "Per Nerf Naom! It is enough to drive one
                     mad!" cried the Lady Bernice. "But hark, my lord! there is a great tumult
                     below!"
                  Just then one of the esquires—now a Christian—rushed in, with terror depicted
                     on his countenance, and, in hurried and confused words, informed the noble
                     company that the Druids, with a large company of the officials of the temple
                     and men-at-arms, were on their way up to the presence-chamber. With a single
                     cry of alarm, the Lady Bernice threw her strong arm around Mona and bore her
                     swiftly through a side entrance into a circular apartment, which was hung round
                     with curious tapestry representing the ceremonies and processions of Nerf.
                     Lifting this, she pressed a spring in the oak paneling under it, which slid
                     back, giving them ingress to a dark and narrow passage. She paused an instant
                     to adjust and secure the spring, then, without speaking, ran swiftly along,
                     winding and turning, until at last, out of breath, she paused, and whispered,
                     "Thou art safe,—but this night, Mona, thou must away. Tarry here. After
                     nightfall I will bring Dego, the fisherman's son; fly with him, and, if it be
                     possible, seek the safety of Finian's cave until the pursuit is over." Then,
                     folding Mona to her noble and generous heart, she returned, and, letting
                     herself through the secret door with great caution, she went to confront and
                     defy the Druids.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XIV.
                  HEAVEN RECEIVES ITS VESTAL.
                  IT was past midnight when the Lady Bernice returned with Dego.
                  "They are infuriated; they rave and threaten us all with dreadful vengeance,"
                     she whispered. "I defied them to the last; but now the party is dispersed.
                     Those who remain at Innistore sleep; the Druids have returned to the temple;
                     and this is the hour for thy escape. Thou hast been betrayed by a Saxon
                     stranger, Mona—may curses light on him. But see: here are a flask of wine and
                     some wheaten cakes. Gather up thy robe, it is thine,—my gift; fasten it under
                     thy girdle. Now wrap this gray mantle, which I have brought, around thee. Ere
                     long thou wilt see Finian: here is the letter from Patricius—curses on him! it
                     is he alone who has brought such woe on me."
                  "I cannot even thank thee, lady: words fail; but there is ONE who is watching,
                     and who will reward thee ten-fold. I shall see the holy Bishop Finian. Once
                     more, through all perils, I must see him, to partake, if God wills it, of that
                     mystic feast, which giveth life to the soul. But for this, I would not
                     fly!"
                  "Not fly! Nay, Mona, do not provoke me to spur thee on with the point of my
                     dagger," exclaimed the lady. "I suppose this insane love for Christ would make
                     thee willing to be slain by the Druids before my very eyes!"
                  "My life is His! Eternal thanks! My life is His! He has given it; let Him
                     recall it when it suits His holy will," she said, in her low, musical tones.
                     "He calls for thee, lady. HE, the Lord and Master of Life, awaits humbly at the
                     door of thy heart. His divine head is wet with the dews of night, while He
                     implores thee to receive salvation. He points to His wounded temples, His
                     streaming forehead, His torn hands, His lacerated feet, He opens the purple
                     wound in His side, to prove that the love which bore such torments to save thee
                     will not rest, will not be satisfied, until thou art His; for, alas! He who
                     with his breath can create worlds, cannot save the meanest of the creatures He
                     has made, without their free consent."
                  "Silence, Mona!" cried Bernice of Innistore, in a voice of anguish. "I will
                     hear no more. I would not be a Christian, to be the mistress of the universe.
                     Begone! This passage will lead thee, Dego, through a subterranean way, far out
                     beyond the walls of Innistore."
                  "Panthea, dear lady! Panthea!" whispered Mona.
                  "Panthea! I shall have her killed if thou dost not begone. Take this key, Dego,
                     and on the morrow bring it to me," she said, half wild with excitement, as she
                     turned suddenly, and, folding Mona to her breast, impressed a kiss on her
                     forehead. "Never fear for Panthea," she whispered; and Mona felt
                     two warm tears drop on her head. And they parted,—the lady to her silken
                     pillows and sleepless couch, Mona to her midnight flight.
                  After walking an hour or two, they at length found the end of the subterranean
                     passage. Dego adjusted the key to the lock, and it turned easily. In another
                     moment they were out beneath the gray and silent heavens, in the solitude of
                     the night, where only the rustling wind among the foliage of the forest, and
                     the far-off moaning of the sea, were
                     heard. Pausing a moment to rest, and lift their hearts to God, they sped along
                     toward the distant shore. There was a calm smile on Mona's cheek. Over her
                     spirit, like the ebbing and flowing of prisoned tides, holy thoughts descended
                     and ascended, until, in sweet and close communion with Heaven, she thought not
                     of the perils of the way.
                  At last they reached the shore. The broad white sands and rugged cliffs were
                     before them. The first gray light of dawn spread dimly over the scene. The
                     morning star, like a patient saint, pale and obedient, awaited amid the shadows
                     for the bright day-beam to kindle and then absorb its waning fires, in a
                     greater and more perfect glow. The ocean tides were flowing in, rising, and
                     moaning, and wailing, like TIME, inexorable and strong. Still lost to outward
                     scenes, in blest anticipations, Mona neither saw nor heard the scenes around
                     her, until a shrill cry and a heavy fall startled her away from the bright
                     visions which Hope and Faith were weaving about her. She turned quickly, and
                     saw Dego lying lifeless on the sands, where he had fallen, transfixed by a
                     bearded arrow. She held his head; she felt his heart: all was stilled forever.
                     Then she saw dark forms issuing from the woods, tossing their arms, and
                     uttering wild cries, as they rushed down toward the shore. She saw Semo. She
                     heard the frightful howl of the beagles as their keepers unleashed them. It was
                     enough! Clasping her hands over her head, she sprang, like a hunted fawn, up
                     over the slippery rocks, along the narrow ledges, over a steep and precipitous
                     path overhanging the sea, until at last she gained the cavern. She entered its
                     friendly arch, and was flying back into its deep recesses, when she discovered
                     that it was not Finian's cave, but one which was connected with the mainland by
                     a narrow ledge of rocks, which, except during a very short interval when the
                     tide was out, was covered with surf and foam. Already the billows were dashing
                     their spray over the ledge, and Mona knew that ere long the roaring waves would
                     climb higher and higher, until they reached and filled the cavern. Escape was
                     impossible, death inevitable. In a moment she understood it all, and, folding
                     her hands meekly together, she knelt, and in hope awaited her transition. She
                     had not expected it so soon; but, now that it was so near, she felt that the
                     promises of God were not vain. Strength and hope brightened together in her
                     soul, and, looking beyond this mortal life, the thought of death's brief agony
                     dismayed her not; neither was she afraid of the mystery of a new and unknown
                     life, because her trust was in Him who is mighty and strong to deliver.
                  The Druids and their pagan followers found themselves baffled, but exulted that
                     her doom was sealed. They knew the cave well. It had served their purposes more
                     than once, when some dark deed was to be perpetrated at midnight, which they
                     desired the sea to wash off from the earth. Slow and mighty flowed in the
                     reverberating billows; but swiftly flew the news of the peril of the Christian
                     maiden, and, by the time the sun arose like a golden flame amid the purple and
                     gold of the orient, the shore, the cliffs, the heights around, were thronged
                     with living beings. All the Christians who heard it hastened thither. The Lord
                     of Innistore, the Count of Bretagne, with men and ropes, flew to the rescue;
                     but a glance convinced them that no human arm could save her. The Lady Bernice,
                     on her black barb, attended by her maidens, was also there, stern, pale, and
                     full of an anguish which she had never known before. In unclouded splendor
                     shone the sun on the strange scene. The sea-birds, with light gleaming on their white wings, whirled and
                     shrieked amid the tossing spray. The wind tossed the leaves of the trees with a
                     joyous motion, and from the rolling lands above flowed down the mingled odors
                     of newly-mown hay and the scent of wild flowers while the summer birds warbled
                     their clear, wild songs as they floated in the sunshine.
                  Presently a loud wail arose above the roar of the surges. It was the cry of a
                     mother over the slain body of her first-born; it was Lena, the fisherman's
                     wife, who, hearing of the peril of Mona, had rushed out from her cabin, without
                     kirtle or hood, with her strong-limbed boys, to try and save her. But on her
                     way she stumbled and nearly fell over the stark corpse of her son,—her
                     Christian child!
                  "Is he thine?" asked the Lady Bernice of Lena.
                  "Mine? Mine?" she asked, roused by the question. "He belonged to God. He gave
                     him. He has taken him. The mortal has put on immortality, and, through JESUS
                     CHRIST, inherits eternal life. Thanks!—thanks! Then no more grief, no more
                     tears, Lena, over this cast-off garb of clay; but, grateful that thy course is
                     finished and the race won so early, my son, I will give thanks that thou hast
                     passed to the regions of hope, to the Land of the living." Then, stooping over,
                     she kissed the pale lips, and, covering the body with her mantle, she knelt to
                     pray for his repose, and Mona's safe transit to the eternal rapture of the
                     Beatific Vision!
                  "A mother!" murmured the lady,—"a mother rejoices that her child
                     is with Christ! I can conceive that a mistaken heroism might suggest all else
                     that I have seen; but this,—a mother's love offered up with joy to
                     their Deity,—it surpasses all I have yet witnessed; for that love
                     is stronger than death itself."
                  While this was passing, the wild billows were dashing in with great velocity.
                     The wind rode in on the waves with a thundering and bellowing that shook the
                     earth with its reverberations. The water was now within a foot of the cavern,
                     beneath whose arch the vestal of Christ knelt, while the sun, slanting into its
                     depths, rested about her calm, pallid face, and white, glittering robes, like a
                     glory. The wind had torn the fastenings from her hair, and it flowed back, with
                     her veil, from her beauteous countenance, which already wore the ineffable
                     repose of eternal peace; and she looked like an angel watcher amid the storms
                     of life. As the billows rose nearer and nearer, her head in deep humility sank
                     lower on her breast; and while her soul wrestled with its last foes,—the
                     pleadings and throes of nature,—a torpor crept over her frame. Her passing away
                     would be sudden and bright; the billows would engulf her for a moment, then
                     bear her up, free and rejoicing, to that shore which is washed by the waters
                     which flow from the Throne of the Lamb.
                  In vain Semo directed his archers to aim their swift, bearded arrows at her
                     breast, as she knelt, a bright mark for their keen eyes; vainly flew the sharp
                     flints from the slings of the soldiers; idly were sped the long, glittering
                     spears from the stalwart arms of the men-at-arms. None reached her, but fell
                     ringing against the rocks, and dropped without a sound into the boiling
                     waves.
                  Like a maniac, Dairene now ran shrieking and tearing her gray hair along the
                     shore. The crowd made way for her; for she was a vestal of Nerf. Her wild
                     shrill cries rose piping above the roar of the bursting billows, as, heedless
                     of peril, she climbed, tearing out her nails against the sharp rocks, until she
                     reached the highest ledge of rocks, and stood panting and sobbing over Finian's
                     cave. The rocks which contained Finian's cave ran out parallel with the ledge
                     on which Mona, in the terror of the
                     moment, had taken shelter, when, confused by the dim light and the pursuit of
                     the Druids and their minions, she ran up in her vain endeavor to reach a place
                     of safety. The two caverns were nearly opposite to each other, and the two
                     ledges, running out seaward, in the form of an angle, leaving a narrow strait
                     for the sea to enter, commanded a full view of the shore. A man was seen to
                     enter Finian's cave, and after a short interval reappear, and take his station
                     on the rocks beside its entrance. Then, while all were gazing, the holy bishop
                     in his sacerdotal robes came forth and stood in full view. He spoke to the man,
                     Lena's husband, who uttered, between his hands, such a shrill, piercing shout
                     that Mona heard it above the howling of the waves, and started up. The
                     fluttering of Dairene's veil first arrested her attention; then, with a look of
                     sudden hope, her glance was lowered, and she saw the aged priest of God,
                     standing with outstretched arms, to give her the last absolution. She could not
                     kneel; the waves had reached her waist; but she bowed her head once more, after
                     making a gesture of joy by lifting up her hands toward heaven, with a smile of
                     rapture.
                  Then she lifted her eyes up no more, until another shrill signal reached her.
                     She understood it now; and, when she looked up, she saw the holy bishop
                     standing, holding up high, in view of all, a crystal case, framed in gold,
                     which contained a consecrated Host! Every Christian on the shore, inspired with
                     courage by the sight, knelt, humbly adoring. The Druids, gnashing their teeth
                     with rage, felt awed, and were silent. The very beagles ran whining and
                     crouching about the feet of their keepers, as that PRESENCE, which was lifted,
                     a sign and promise to those who believed, flowed out in solemn and mighty
                     influences over those whose souls still slept in the shadow of death. Mona saw
                     it. She stretched out her arms, while a glow like as of the brightest sunrise
                     lit her face. Then they could see no more; for the spray covered her like a
                     veil, and a huge billow sweeping in with a mad roar engulfed her. Those on the
                     shore heard a wail and shriek, they saw the fluttering of white torn garments,
                     they saw something plunge from the rocks down into the sea, and they knew that
                     when the vestal of Christ yielded up her life to the relentless wave a vestal
                     of Nerf Naom perished with her. It was over. The Druids and bards,
                     with their vassals, were turning homeward. The people stood or knelt in groups
                     on the shore. The Lord Eadhna and the Lady Bernice, with Count Clotaire, whose
                     countenance wore the hue of death, stood together, awaiting the good Finian, to
                     whom they had dispatched a message, beseeching him to come with them to
                     Innistore. Lena and her sons were bearing away their dead, when, lo! a sound
                     like thunder rolled out upon the calm morning air, a despairing wail went up
                     from the Druids and their band, and Semo was seen to fall prostrate to the
                     earth. All turned toward the place whence the sound issued; and Bernice, who
                     had seen one perish for Christ, now saw the great marble statue of Nerf Naom tottering on its high pinnacle on the
                     summit of the temple, she beheld it topple and reel, then fall, crashing
                     through the roof, and burying beneath its own fragments, and the ruins, the
                     holy or inner shrine, and the statues of Nerf, Ethis, and Latona.
                     With clasped hands she stood rigid and pale, gazing up into the empty air,
                     where but a few moments before the statue of Nerf Naom had stood, an image of
                     beautiful strength; then, with a deep sob, she flung herself on the earth,
                     offering her life, her liberty, her state, her love, her children, her all to
                     the true and living God. When the holy bishop, from whose eyes tears still
                     flowed, reached the spot, she ran,
                     and, heedless of those who gazed on her, throwing off her pride and self-love,
                     she knelt humbly at his feet, and, lifting the hem of his garment to her lips,
                     implored baptism.
                  When the Druids lifted Semo from the earth, they discovered that he was dead;
                     and five of their number, with three bards and one learned ollahm, returned,
                     and, prostrating themselves at Finian's feet, sought to be initiated into the
                     mysteries of the creed of the Christians.
                  As the throng gathered around the holy man to hear his words, Ulric the Saxon,
                     with a fiendish smile, rode up, and whispered in the ear of the Count of
                     Bretagne,—
                  "Did my eyes deceive me, or was that maiden who perished in reality Mona the
                     vestal?"
                  "Ha, Ulric!" shouted Clotaire, directing his hand toward his dagger, "thou
                     here? But no!—rest, if thou canst, in thy iniquity. Vengeance belongeth to God.
                     She whom thou hast so basely betrayed—Mona, my first and last earthly love—is
                     beyond thy malice now; and the thought that she is interceding for thee—ay,
                     even for thee—stays my arm. Away, now, nor ever molest me again with thy
                     presence."
                  "What lambs these Christians become!" exclaimed the Saxon, with a sneer; but he
                     saw a kindling light in Clotaire's eye, a bracing up of the muscular form, and
                     a quick upheaving of the chest, which warned him off in time; and, after a
                     gesture of mock courtesy, he galloped away with speed toward the temple.
                  That night the noble young Christian wandered alone along the shore. It was
                     cloudy and dark, and a deep calm had settled on the sea. He thought of Mona; he
                     wished that the waves might wash her body to the shore; in the tumult of his
                     grief, he wept and prayed by turns, until, thinking of her as one of the
                     radiant virgins who, clothed in raiment like the sun, surround the Throne,
                     giving glory to Him who sits thereon, his sorrow was turned to joy, his weeping
                     to gladness. Then, kneeling on the lonely shore, he vowed himself to the
                     service of God, and offered up at the foot of the cross his nature, his
                        humanity, his soul, his life,—a free offering, a holocaust, to Him
                     who suffered thereon.
                  "Come hither, Christian stranger; behold a marvelous sight," said a man, who,
                     wrapped in a dark mantle, had come near him, and stood unnoticed and unseen. "I
                     am a Christian: therefore have no fear."
                  Clotaire of Bretagne followed him till they came to a place so closed in by
                     rocks that one could scarcely enter the narrow opening leading to it. The tide
                     was out, leaving a calm, deep pool, and they penetrated the gloomy recesses of
                     the rocky path which surrounded it, the strange man leading, until a faint,
                     luminous appearance in the distance guided their steps.
                  "There it is: let us approach it," he said.
                  They did so, and saw floating on the shallow water, as if in calm slumber, the
                        body of Mona the vestal. Her robes were folded around her, and
                     her hands crossed on her breast in sweet composure. A smile rested on her lips,
                     and a look of unutterable calm on her brow. A fair luminous halo flickered
                     around her head, revealing every lineament of her face. They lifted her gently:
                     they dared not leave her there another hour, lest the waves should bear her out
                     to the fathomless sea. Far up on the shore they hurried with the sacred
                     remains; and while Clotaire watched beside them, filled with awe, and giving
                     thanks to God, Lena's husband, the fisherman, went to Innistore to inform the
                     good Finian of the event.
                  In a few years, a large and splendid church was erected near the palace of Innistore, beneath
                     the altar of which, in a shrine of silver, Mona the vestal slept.
                  Aileen had betrayed her; but, repenting, she was converted to Christianity, and
                     became the most humble and austere of that household, all of whom were so truly
                     devoted to God. Panthea became her most tender care; and it was a touching
                     sight to see her watching and serving one whom she had so persecuted. The bard
                     Abaris, Clotaire of Bretagne, and a number of converted Druids and bards,
                     retired to Innisfallen's Isle, in Lough Tore,
                     where in cloistered aisles and solitary cells they sought perfection as the
                     safe road to eternal joys.
                  Our task is done. Let those who doubt the narrative of Mona turn to the old
                     archives of Erin, where they will read of greater wonders than any which we
                     have related, not only of numberless saints, but of holy and wise kings,
                     Christian sages, and heaven-inspired bards, whose memory and lives the Church
                     cherishes like a sweet odor, who were, while living, her strength and succor,
                     and who, amid the glories of the better land, are her fairest jewels.
               
               THE END.
