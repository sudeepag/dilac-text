            INTRODUCTION.
            THE first time I heard Anna Dickinson speak, she stated that she had known
               poverty.
            The time had been she was not able to buy a pair of gloves worth one shilling; that
               she had worked hard, and yet was poor.
            She had decided it would be more profitable to give a poor lecture than receive poor
               pay.
            I indorse her decision; and write a poor book, because of the very same reason,—poor
               pay.
            Byron, by force of inspiration, wrote his "Bride of Abydos" in one night.
            I, by force of poverty, write my book in one week.
            
            He wrote for fame!
            I write to pay my board.
            His motive was the more elevated!
            Mine, the more urgent.
            Yes,—I am poor; worse still,—I am in debt. I owe— 
                  
                     "The butcher, the baker,
                     The candlestick maker,"—
                  
                and see no way of canceling my indebtedness.
            Everything I own in the world is at the pawnbroker's,—my watch, my brooch, my
               wedding-ring; and I see no way of redeeming them.
            The spot on earth most sacred has passed into the hands of strangers.
            Others walk the halls, enjoy the grounds, bury their dead; where my feet once trod,
               my eyes once feasted, my dead once reposed.
            Reduced thus from affluence to poverty; alone, dwelling upon these things; I
               determine in some way to recover the lost.
            Behold the reason why. I write a book!
            That it will be sensational, is not my fault; my life has been one long
               sensation.
            That, "à la Trollope," it will have its white and
               its black marks, is not my fault; some people are white, others
               black.
            Unknown to friend or foe, I launch this manuscript upon the sea of literature; alike
               indifferent, whether the frail bark outrides the storm, or founders in sight, so that
               the purchase money, borne by the retreating wave, be washed to my feet
            
               BOSTON, 1871.

            AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY.
            
               CHAPTER I.
               I AM BORN.
               
                  
                     
                        "Queen of the sisters twelve, Imperial June!"
                        "And a babe was cradled in her bosom."
                     
                  
               
               ALL hail! beautiful June! month of roses; and of skies, whose blue arch, bending,
                  lovingly embraces the fragrant earth, as bridegroom his beloved bride.
               Beautiful June! in whose long, delicious days, summer arrives at the perfection of
                  her charms; whose gentle airs, enameled fields, running streams; revive the
                  invalid, delight the child, while the hours of Nature's lover.
               
               Upon the sixteenth day of thy month, O beautiful June! I was born!
               About four miles from the seaport of B—— is the large, agricultural town of
                  W——.
               Its inhabitants are mostly tillers of the ground. Still, the quiet beauty of the
                  place, together with its reputed healthfulness, induced a few men of means and
                  education to locate themselves there, and engage in amateur farming.
               Earliest among these, of Puritan stock, both military and civic honors making his
                  own name distinguished, came my maternal grandfather, Judge H——.
               Although a gentleman, and companion of the learned, he soon ingratiated himself
                  with his more lowly neighbors; securing at the same time, their respect and
                  sincere regard. So well, too, and profitably, he managed his lands, that by
                  degrees his opinion became their law.
               Away from the main road, upon rising ground, stood the old-fashioned family
                  mansion; completely embosomed in roses, the place was familiarly known as "Rose
                  Hill."
               Three daughters graced this pleasant home. The youngest, the fairest, met;
                  and—true to her romantic nature—loved a wild but generous-hearted seaman. Against
                  the judgment of her father, she persisted in marrying the youthful Captain.
               If ever there was a love match, they made one.
               Though separation, incident to his profession, and sorrow, were mingled in their
                  cup; neither—to the hour when the waters closed over the form of the idolized
                  husband—had cause to regret their union.
               I was their first child.
               The preparation that heralded my advent, I have been told, was wonderful. Such
                  embroidery! such laces! such trimming! such tucking! and all the Liliputian
                     trousseau,
                   the work of loving fingers and a loving
                  heart; indulging, as each small garment was shaped, hopes and anticipations, as
                  only the prospect of a first babe can inspire.
               At length the long-expected time arrived.
               After hours of agony, which almost cost the young mother her life; at the close of
                  a quiet Sabbath, just as the sun's last rays glorified tree and flower, welcomed
                  with smiles and prayers, upon the sixteenth day of thy month, O beautiful June! I
                  was born!
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               I AM A BABY.
               
                  
                     "A babe in a house is a well-spring of pleasure."
                  
               
               MOST infants are lovely only in mother's and nurse's eyes. But it has come down,
                  that—skipping over the flabby, lobster period—I presented to admiring friends the
                  grateful spectacle of a rosy, live baby; who, with large, wondering eyes, looked
                  the world—into which it had such difficulty entering—full in the face.
               Could I have foreseen what she would have given in answer to that appealing look,
                  I would resolutely, then and there, have shut mine eyes upon her forever.
               That was not to be.
               I was to see life; and through the seeing, find my happiness, and—my misery.
               
               A chance neighbor, studying my youthful orbs, impressed with the idea that I
                  should probably find a use for them, meaningly remarked: "Well! she's got eyes,
                  ain't she?"
               My father, swelling with pride, assented; adding, "The child seems six months
                  old!"
               A disputed mark upon my tiny fore-finger, was settled by my mother declaring it to
                  be strawberries; and the subject still further clinched by my devouring, of that
                  delicious fruit, nearly a cupful when three days old.
               This feat, together with my observant eyes, secured an infantile fame; and many
                  was the gossip who came to look at the cup, and gaze upon me.
               Of one heaven-given right I was deprived.
               I never lay in maternal arms drawing sustenance from its natural source, my
                  mother's fair breast.
               The suffering incident to giving me birth was too intense, and too prolonged, to
                  allow of one other effort in my behalf.
               Nature avenged herself!
               I was the victim!
               Still, I throve. To compensate, A BOTTLE, emblem of my lost happiness, was placed
                  in my puny grasp; and immediately became my constant companion.
               Looking back, I am free to say, that, could I have anticipated, I should have
                  adopted it on the spot as my future COAT OF ARMS.
               I think it would have been pleasant to have enjoyed evermore this purely physical
                  state of existence; holding on to the "emblem" until full, then sinking off into
                  the sleep of the innocent.
               But Fate had other—any better?—things in store for me; and Time, leagued with
                  Fate, ignoring my private wishes, carried me out of babyhood into childhood.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER III.
               I AM A CHILD.
               
                  
                     "For a child is in a new world, and learneth somewhat every moment"
                  
               
               I AM afraid Fear was a little too indiscriminately mingled with the motive power
                  of my earlier years, to have allowed their being perfectly happy.
               I learned to walk through the base motive!
               I took my first step in mortal fear!
               At the house of a friend, answering some summons, a darkey thrust his sooty visage
                  inside the door.
               Now I am speaking of ante-Lincoln days; when, as yet, our colored brothers had not
                  come up to our houses, our tables, our very bed-chambers, so to speak; and the
                  moment that vision of darkness met my childish eye, although I had literally never
                  taken one step in my future career, I rose from the cricket whereon I had been
                  planted, and made straight for the sheltering arms of my mother; putting, in
                  unquestioning faith, her love between me and, as I thought—the devil!
               I had now found my feet.
               Being of the "female persuasion," I did not have to hunt for my tongue. My friends
                  will testify to that.
               I was about to moralize—but hark! an agonizing scream falls on my ear. Once heard
                  above all, once uttered, never forgotten.
               Yes—her hour has come! The woman next room—childbirth pangs upon her,—obedient to
                  the fiat "In sorrow shalt thou bring forth," pays the penalty of her sex, and
                  suffers more than words can tell!
               
               Everywhere; these same shrieks, constantly ascending to the ear of the Father,
                  never closed to the cry of his children, must, one would think, shut out the very
                  music of heaven.
               The silence of death has succeeded.
               
                  Is it that?
               Happily, to the babe.
               I have a bachelor cousin (what does he know about it?) who says,
                  "Better if all thus died."
               I agree!
               Population might not get on so fast, but it would be a good thing for the little
                  ones!
               Once here, however, and likely to remain, who can understand them? even our
                  own?
               We bring them into the world; feed them; clothe them; are always with them; yet in
                  too many instances know them, as we do the moon, by outside
                  observation.
               With the surface part of my being kindly cared for, I grew on; not much pains
                  being taken to sound the depths, comprehend and train the hidden nature, which was
                  my true self.
               To feed and to clothe, is that all?
               In modern days, chances are against the child through this undue attention to the
                  external.
               I do not complain; but I say, if more thought had been given to the best
                  development of a highly sensitive organization; more labor bestowed upon the
                  heart, less upon the head; I, for one, should have come up a better woman.
               Clearly, I combined the elements of two distinct lives.
               The one, bright and joyous; mischief and prank filling the house with sunshine.
                  The other, dreamy and sad; influenced by emotions difficult to explain, but
                     with which my playmates had no sympathy.
               
               Never mind. I was full of vitality, and thoroughly enjoyed everything going,
                  excepting—dolls.
               Being a girl, I know I ought, but somehow I didn't
               Imagination was not at fault. Mine, however, would not take that direction.
               I had no pleasure in tugging round the senseless things; making believe keep
                  house; and all the rest of the tiresome programme.
               I loved flowers. Already delighted in books. Adored music. A pity! as temperaments
                  peculiarly susceptible to sweet sounds, are equally so to sorrow.
               None had, thus far, come to me. None might.
               
               Beloved by parents, petted by friends, I unconsciously slipped from happy
                  childhood into sweet, mysterious girlhood.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               MY GIRLHOOD.
               
                  
                     
                        "Beauty, is modesty and grace in fair retiring girlhood".
                        "Induce not precocity of intellect, for so shouldst thou nourish
                           vanity".
                     
                  
               
               THE other day I saw a picture, very beautiful in its whole conception.
               Two figures, mother and daughter, are upon an eminence.
               Wearily, the mother is looking backward; over the long, winding path her feet have
                  trodden to reach this spot.
               Eagerly, the daughter is looking forward into the dim distance; trying to locate
                  the way her feet shall take.
               I place myself beside the mother.
               MY past returns.
               Its memories of youthful aspirations, so
                  crushed; youthful plans, so blighted; youthful friendships, so dead; that I only
                  feel sorrow in contemplating this ardent, high-spirited maiden, knowing the
                  certain disappointment to which she goes.
               Only the phlegmatic really enjoy!
               Once I met a person who boldly asserted the same; and who, if launched again upon
                  life, would beg to leave behind—her heart!
               I was no longer alone.
               A fair-haired, blue eyed girl, rivaled me in my mother's love. I do not wonder. So
                  sweet-tempered, so thoughtful was the dear child; a willing help in all the
                  various domestic cares, which, to my shame, I invariably shirked.
               But I do not think my father ever gave to his second, the blind affection he
                  lavished upon his wayward first-born.
               "Whom the gods love die young."
               Endeared to all within her sweet influence ence, scarcely had fifteen brief
                  summers passed, than, leaving us forever to mourn her loss, my sister died!
               And one other; to his latest hour, will bear in his "heart of hearts" the memory
                  of a dearly loved, and early lost!
               My grandfather dead, my parents moved to a large manufacturing place; and my
                  mother's eldest sister, having no daughters of her own, claimed me for an
                  unlimited time.
               If she had put me right into her kitchen, and taught me how to "bake and to brew,"
                  I think a good deal of troublesome romance would have gone off in the smoke
                  incident to that useful pastime.
               Through mistaken kindness this was not done; and over the intervening years, I
                  solemnly declare that kindness to have been the wreck upon which I
                  went down.
               Instead of the frying-pan, Algebra!
               
               What need has a girl of Algebra? She spends her money too fast to stop and reckon
                  it
               Instead of the pudding-bag, French!
               Was she ambitious to hear me scold my future household in that voluble tongue?
               Parents! What ever else you fail to do, learn, betimes, your female offspring TO
                  COOK.
               We may have our eating-saloons, our fashionable restaurants, our imported
                  "Blot's;" but one old style, well-prepared dinner, out-weighs them all!
               Meanwhile I was put through a course of studies that would have floored any girl,
                  whose mental activity had not been quickened, as mine.
               I enjoyed it.
               Nature, Art, the Sciences, lay open before me.
               Text-books of a high order were at hand.
               My education, intellectually, was not neglected.
               There is no good, however, without its attendant evil. Here, in this excellent
                  family, my very worst characteristic—pride—was secretly fostered; and in its rapid
                  growth, overshadowed many a better quality.
               Others looked upon me as something a little uncommon, and I certainly regarded
                  myself in that light.
               But for one thing, Eternity will prove me indebted to this pious woman.
               My religious faith became so rooted and grounded, that no after shock of
                  temptation or sin could drift me from my Scriptural mooring. 
                     "Among the faithless, faithful she,"
                   and had her Bible told her the sun did not shine, with her eyes in her head,
                  she would have ignored his rays.
               So would I!
               From this time a new element was infused into my composition.
               Impulsively giving up other pursuits, I
                  sought to fathom its mysteries; and devoting all my energies to the one study of
                  the revealed Word, I was led on, fascinated by the glorious truths, until Religion
                  became my one idea.
               My Aunt in her daily life was an epitome, a living example of her faith.
               I then thought the same divine afflatus had taken possession of my
                  heart.
               Possibly it had; and after wanderings were over the smouldering spark that, by and
                  by, should flame up, repurifying every emotion.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               THE CIRCUS.
               
                  
                     
                        "The rude hall rocks—they come, they come,
                        The din of voices shakes the dome."
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        "And hurry, hurry, off they rode
                        As fast as fast might be"
                     
                  
               
               PLEASURE again claimed me. Home to D——.
               The town is all agog!
               Upon straggling fences and unused buildings, in the Market Square, and at the
                  Post-office, are enormous hand-bills, setting forth that next Wednesday morning a
                  Circus Troupe will make their entrance. The whole company, in gorgeous costume;
                  splendid horses, with rich trappings; band playing, banners flying. "Afternoon
                     performance ance to commence at two
                  o'clock, door open at one. Evening performance to commence at seven o'clock, door
                  open at six. Admittance twenty-five cents. Children, accompanied by parents, half
                  price."
               It is with the afternoon performance I have to do.
               I am quite young; precisely at that age girls are most desirous to look well.
               I have a beau; sort of half and half; keeps me on the anxious seat all the time
                  with his indecision, whether to stick by me, or go with Lucy Dean!
               I feel that the matter of an extra ribbon would decide him.
               It is a settled thing. My mother will not give me money to throw away upon what
                     she calls "wicked amusements."
               Now I have had my mind all summer interested in a certain blue sash, and have
                  saved up a quarter of a dollar towards buying the same.
               If my irresolute friend invites me,
                  
                     "Everything is lovely, and the goose hangs high;"
                   but if he should choose that dark-eyed miss, good-by to the sash, for I am
                  going Wednesday afternoon to see that Show.
               For once, the weather deserved credit. It was propitious. 
                     "Nor too hot, nor too cold,"
                   and all the forenoon streams of vehicles—from the stylish carriage, that
                  drove directly to the hotel and deposited its load in care of the obsequious
                  landlord; to the country wagon; that brought wife, children, lunch, and hay for
                  Dobbin to munch, while his companions within were feasting upon the unwonted
                  pageant,—poured through the streets.
               Shall I ever forget that day?
               The tent pitched on the open common, so white against the clear blue sky, while
                  from its centre floated the Flag we have all learned since to love. The air so pure. The grass
                  so green. The people in their best clothes. The hurrying hither and thither to
                  accost a friend, or secure a good position. Jokes on every side. The trampling of
                  horses; over all the lively music, together produced a flutter of excitement that
                  told pleasantly upon the nerves, and evoked expressions of good feeling from the
                  most reserved.
               The exhibition was advertised at two o'clock. By one every seat was taken; and all
                  the space between the pit and the more elevated boards, filled with a jostling
                  crowd.
               I was among the first on the ground, and took my place about half way up; neither
                  so low, but I could see the feet of the performers—neither so high, but I was out
                  reach of sun, wind, or flapping canvas.
               Now began the fun!
               Loafing men, inside, struggling for a chance.
               Loafing boys, outside, eager to get in, but just short of the magic sum wherewith
                  to effect an entrance.
               The more daring tried to force their way under the tent. But no sooner were head
                  and shoulders well in, than an unexpected jerk of the leg, at the hand of a
                  watchful "attaché," twitched the poor sinner out.
               Pent between two monstrous women—one had a baby in her lap—I looked here and there
                  to discover my acquaintance.
               Yes—yonder was my beau, the vacillating! over whom I had cried half the
                  night—flirting and making love to that miserable Lucy Dean.
               How homely the girl is!
               What can William Watson see to fancy in her? and, am I to believe my
                  eyes! tied round the awkward creature's waist is my blue sash!
               I could tell it among a hundred. I knew my fate hung on that!
               
               
               Pride crushed back my tears; and just then, too, with flourish of trumpets, came
                  flying through the narrow alley "The Troupe," to see which I had sacrificed so
                  much.
               Was there ever anything so magnificent?
               How rich they must be! Crimson velvet dresses, trimmed with gold.
               
                  And such horses! even their saddles allover gold!
               Where did so much come from? I know. New York.
               
               But see them prance!—in and out—in and out! just like a dance. Why! it
                     is a dance. The band is playing a waltz.
               How glad I am I came! Who cares for Bill Watson, Luce Dean, or the old sash
                  either?
               Good gracious! What is that fellow doing?—piling glass bottles to stand upon? so
                  high too! is he stark mad? Suppose the underneath one should happen to
                     break! He has reached the top, and, as the crowd applauds,
                  stretches out his arms!
               I shall faint dead away—I know I shall!
               
               Now isn't that boy a beauty? The man with him must be his father—and
                  they are going to ride one horse. How carefully he holds on to the little chap
                  that he may not fall—and kisses him, two or three times.
               
                  What!—the boy has sprung to his feet—is upon his father's hand—upon
                  his fathers shoulder—upon his father's head—with both arms and one leg in the
                  air—the horse all the time going round the ring fast as ever he can gallop!
               I hold my breath!
               I know that tune the band is playing, 
                     "Pretty, pretty Polly Hopkins,"
                   and the men are laying down a piece of carpet.
               Somebody is going to dance!
               O! isn't that the handsomest girl that
                  ever was born? I guess Luce Dean will feel worked up now! her dress is awful
                  short, though! that's the way they wear them in New York; but her feet are just as
                  nice as they can be—and such lovely bronze slippers! her white lace overskirt,
                  caught up on the left side, with a pink rose—pink sash (I am glad I didn't buy
                  that blue thing), and pink buds in her hair.
               Her partner! isn't he sweet? green satin trousers, white silk
                  stockings, black shiny pumps, and a little straw hat on one side, with narrow
                  green streamers.
               Now they begin. See their steps! 
                     
                        "Pretty, pretty Polly Hopkins,
                        How do you do? how do you do?"
                     
                  
               
               She flies from him I He cannot overtake her! She taps him on the shoulder, and
                  before he can turn, she's gone! 
                     "Pretty, pretty Polly Hopkins!"
                  
               
               What a dance you are leading that enamored swain!
               What's that? the growl of a lion? They don't have lions at a circus.
                  It can't be thunder! When did the shower come up? How it rains! The
                  spectators are leaving. I hope Luce Dean's sash will get wringing wet, and all the
                  color run out, the minx!
               O, how it lightens! If I was only at home! Mother said it was wrong to come. I
                  know I shall be struck. Dear me! dear me!
               With the vision of 
                     "Pretty,pretty Polly Hopkins!"
                   before my eyes—and, mingling with the thunder, the refrain, 
                     "None the better, Tommy Tompkins,"
                   in my ears—I rush for the door.
               The grand times I had in that dear old village!
               If these pages chance to meet the eye of S. M., K. H., R. W., recall what
                     dances! made memorable by the
                  wonderfully executed "Turkey Step" of W. J. and the approving slap of G. I. I.
                  upon his fat legs, after his well-cut "Pigeon's Wing."
               What sleigh-rides in winter! what beach rides in summer!
               Life now was gala!
               It will not be supposed I could take all these rides with good-looking young
                  men—enjoy all these dances with well-dressed beaux,—and come off heart whole!
               O, no! many was the skirmish I had with the little "god of love;" and one of his
                  well-aimed thrusts, took six weeks to heal!
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               THE TWICE ELOPED.
               
                  
                     "And now is seen the passion for utility, when all things are accounted by
                        their price."
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        "And she has met with Glenlyon,
                        Who has stolen her away,"
                     
                  
               
               NEVER attempt to dodge your destiny; as well float up current. You cannot do
                  it
               About this time I ran away. As I am romantic, I will express myself differently.
                     I eloped. Not in company with a lover, but—with myself!
               Two motives induced me. I wanted to see the city—and my dear father's death
                  leaving us in straitened circumstances—I wanted to "turn an honest penny."
               Why I did not take to school-teaching,
                  honorable and remunerative, I am unable to tell.
               Hiding my light, as it were, under a bushel; unknown to my friends, I entered a
                  leading store as saleswoman.
               
                  My world was immediately turned upside down!
               My mother's blue blood boiled in her veins!
               Her twin sister's son, from the hour I thus ignobly lowered the aristocratic
                  banner of our house, pitiless and unforgiving, walks the streets of Boston,
                  vouchsafing to me no cousinly glance!
               Meantime I made a capital clerk.
               
                  Algebra told! and many a customer rued the day I had applied myself
                  so closely to its calculations.
               I discovered a business talent.
               No greater change, however, could possibly have been made in any individual life.
                  Heretofore, mistress of my own time, habits of a born lady, proclivities decidedly
                  literary. Now, busily employed all day, I had no opportunity to exercise my tastes
                  or enjoy my books.
               But I could Study human nature; and, believe me, there is a good deal of it
                  round!
               Better not, ladies! go into a store with heads so high you can scarcely see the
                  person who serves you. Better not, ladies! address her as a lower order of
                  creation; for the girl who ties up your purchase, may be, in birth and education,
                  immeasurably your superior.
               There are those who understand, and, to their honor, act in
                  accordance; that in the inexplicable confusion of life, some are jostled out of
                  their sphere.
               Fortunately, for my peace of mind, and lean purse, I did not care for dress;
                  rather held to the Chinese notion,—one thing forever! Still, there
                  were days when I liked to put on all my finery, and mildly enjoy the extra
                  notice.
               
               Take it all in all, this was about the happiest period of my life.
               Well may I think so!
               As then, my Destiny fulfilled her mission, and leading me to my supremest
                  happiness; introduced me to the gifted son of—a Methodist preacher.
               From that time existence took on a deeper meaning.
               My whole being recognized, and went out to its new master—LOVE—and, welcomed to
                  its resting-place, returned no more; but dwelt forever there, in sweetest
                  peace.
               There are three things that interest the public. Birth; Marriage; Death.
               They had got well over my birth; and while waiting for my death, took in hand my
                  marriage.
               Obscurity availed nothing. Sensation was my twin sister.
               The engagement of the only daughter of Captain E—to a humble minister's son, was,
                  for the time being, among my acquaintances, the topic.
               Methodists, twenty years ago, were not what they are to-day, in either education
                  or popularity.
               We will leave the Book of Doom to decide whether, upon its
                  unprejudiced pages, as many were not registered favorably then, as now!
               Meanwhile, there was a strong counter pressure brought to bear upon the
                  contemplated match by those interested in breaking it off. Foremost among whom was
                  a sheep faced, inanimate, rival suitor.
               If there had been anything wanting to decide the question, this foolish
                  interference would have supplied the link.
               Serenely keeping our own counsel, we, the principal faction concerned, accepted
                  one "Thanksgiving" an invitation to dine
               
               Out I well remember the dinner. It really was capital!
               But it is with heartfelt sadness I record, that one, to whose kindness then, and
                  often after, I was indebted; leaving her earthly friends in sorrow to mourn, now
                  feeds upon the heavenly manna.
               Leaving, my companion announced to our surprised hosts, that ere all met again we
                  "twain should be one flesh;" and hurrying to the depot—took the train for
                  Providence, R. I., in those days the "Gretna Green" of persecuted lovers.
               Evidently I was getting my hand in—to Elopements!
               Arriving there, an unforeseen obstacle presented itself. It was necessary to be
                  "cried;" or, even in that accommodating city, the marriage would not be legal.
               "Great oaks from little acorns spring."
               That year politics ran high—and even the good cheer of a regular holiday, could
                  not restrain the zeal of a few souls ardent in the cause.
               An excited knot, sufficient in number to form a quorum, was hunted up; and much to
                  their amusement, the Town Clerk published in their ears the "bans of wedlock,"
                  between "contracting parties, Paul Pennington and Elizabeth M. Weymouth, both of
                  Boston, Massachusetts."
               The delay over, a willing clergyman ratified the whole thing—not forgetting in the
                  haste to rejoin his feasting family, to dwell at some length upon the word
                  o-b-e-y.
               I think I never realized the comprehensive meaning of those four letters, until
                  elaborated by his tongue.
               With a generous fee in his hand, he went back to the waiting group;
                  and in fluttering happiness, I exchanged my maiden freedom for the
                  soft restraint of a blushing bride!
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VII.
               I AM A WIFE.
               
                  
                     "And a well-assorted marriage hath not many cares."
                  
               
               THERE never was a rich Methodist minister!
               If lucky enough to receive sufficient salary to keep soul and body together; and
                  fifty cents over for a rainy day; he will inevitably give away the fifty
                  cents.
               Rejoicing in a father whose "treasures were laid up in heaven," my husband had his
                  own way to make in the world.
               I at once determined to aid him in the laudable undertaking.
               I deserve the more credit, as it was done before "strong minded" women came
                  tumbling into the arena; upsetting every blessed man; and seizing, with all else
                  they can lay hands on, their very breeches, so to speak, as trophies of
                  victory!
               It was some years before the war, too.
               Times then, and the mode of doing business, were quite different. The high
                  pressure system was not so much the style. A young man of industry and integrity
                  had an almost certain prospect of success. His word entered into the
                  account, and if honorably redeemed, was additional capital.
               Now, arrangements written in blood are hardly considered binding.
               Then, Honesty was a power.
               Now, ignored as "behind the times," she hides her diminished head; and,
                  crestfallen, acknowledges "she don't pay!"
               Then, the aspirant was willing to wait, and receive gifts from Fortune as he
                  earned them. Now, the poor Jade is so "battered and bruised," that—fleeing for her
                  life—she scatters indiscriminately her treasures, and Young America secures the largest share!
               "A man is praised as he does well for himself."
               1871 indorses the days of Job!
               We took a small store. With just one hundred and fifty dollars, started in
                  business.
               We were young, healthy, and had our wits about us.
               Soon people began to find, indeed it became rather the fashion, to patronize us;
                  and there is not a person living who ever had dealings with Mr. P——, but will bear
                  witness, "his word was as good as a bond."
               As for myself—well! I was more conscientious then, than I am now.
               One thing was sure. We devoted our whole time to business. An early hour in the
                  morning—a late hour at night—found us still employed.
               I gave up all my acquaintance; or, what amounted to the same thing, they all gave
                  up me; and, obedient to my nature, took hold in earnest of the thing in hand, only
                  too happy in the constant companionship of my husband.
               All the outside time we could possibly command was devoted to reading, study, and
                  mutual improvement. None given to pleasure.
               Influenced by his sedate and consistent life, I again became interested in
                  religion. This second conviction leading me through a heart-rending experience, in
                  which "Satan was determined to sift me as wheat" To his discomfiture, however, I
                  united with the Church; of which to-day I am its most unworthy member.
               Meanwhile in trade, there were the usual ups and downs; until the great financial
                  crisis swept over the land.
               Many large houses were completely uprooted. In our snug little quarters we just made out to weather the gale; but it took
                  many a weary month to repair damages.
               Time passed on. Increased success was again ours; and, looked upon as "rising," we
                  considered ourselves—established.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               A PRESENTIMENT.
               
                  
                     "The idol of thy heart is, as thou, a probationary sojourner on earth."
                  
               
               IT now became evident that one of the partners must give up—and taking, I think,
                  the respect and good wishes of our customers, I bade adieu to public, and entered
                  upon private life.
               Behold me! in a pleasant home, a few miles from the city, invested with the new
                  dignity of housekeeper; the happy mother of a growing family.
               My husband, also, made a change.
               In a larger building; extending his operations; with tact and shrewdness, slowly
                  but' surely, he laid the foundation of a more than competence.
               
               Every thing prospered. His unyielding principle had got him an excellent name. Old
                  firms were pleased to acknowledge the successful, self-made young merchant
               In both business and social relations he was favored.
               As I have said, he was religious. Up to this time he had worshipped with his
                  Congregational brethren. But now, true to the faith of his fathers, he formed an
                  embryo society—the increasing membership of which—still hold him in grateful
                  memory.
               We had lived in M—— about ten years; in as perfect a state of happiness as can
                  well fall to the lot of mortals.
               We owned our house. Its appointments were comfortable, even elegant. My tastes
                  were all gratified. My wants all met—and supposing this state of thing would
                  always continue—I lived on.
               At the close of this last year, however; indeed, all during the month of December
                  ber, I was a prey to the most distressing, but persistent fancies.
               A great Shadow had fallen upon me!
               I became conscious some terrible misfortune was impending.
               So entirely did this belief take possession of my mind, that I passed the greater
                  part of each day in tears; often apologizing to friends for the unaccountable
                  emotion, which I could neither explain, nor banish.
               It seemed absolutely certain that something awful would occur before the old year
                  died out; and when the new year, bright and glorious, came in; my husband, my
                  children well; the house standing firm on its foundation; words could not express
                  my joy.
               But, I was not alone in my Presentiment!
               The first day of January, 18—, fell on Sunday.
               A reverend gentleman, who was taking tea
                  with us, upon moving from the table, requested permission to kneel.
               Thus he prayed—
               "We stand upon the threshold of another year. Thanks be to our heavenly Father,
                  all is well. Soon, we may be called to part—child with its parent—parent with its
                  child. Wife with her husband"—
               Suddenly he stopped; with the sensation of a blow upon his head; words failed—he
                  could go no farther.
               Monday morning dawned. Its peaceful hours went on.
               Punctually returning in the six o'clock train, the dear, well-known step in the
                  hall fell upon my ear.
               The events of the day discussed; the pleasant evening meal finished; the
                  children—a father's kiss warm upon their rosy lips—fast asleep; my husband
                  commenced reading aloud to me.
               All at once, putting his hand to his head, he exclaimed, "O! this rush of blood!"
                  and giving no sign, fell dead at my feet.
               Friends rushed in! Medical aid was summoned!
               It was of no avail.
               The respected business man—the adored husband—the beloved father—the faithful
                  church member; leaving business, wife, children, and church—had gone
                  to his God!
               Would I could here stop; lay down my pen; close mine eyes; and join the
                  departed!
               But no! Living, I am a widow!
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IX.
               I AM A WIDOW.
               
                  
                     "And I said this in sorrow; but pity cannot reach it."
                  
               
               
                  
                     "All things being are in mystery."
                  
               
               AT a comparatively early age—I was eleven years younger than I am now—I lost my
                  husband.
               I mourned him with my whole soul.
               The world appeared dark; and there was no brightness to relieve my sombre sky.
               To do as he would approve became my chief desire.
               Naturally, my first efforts were directed towards the struggling, religious
                  society he had left.
               Mr. P—— was a Methodist from choice. I, because of the love I bore him.
               A witty minister of the "standing order" used to say, "that as fast as I was
                  twisted into a Methodist at one end, I unraveled as a Congregationalist at the
                  other!"
               Be that as it may—I am confident that had Paul Pennington hailed as a god, the
                  SUN; rather than have been separated from him, I should, a devout worshipper of
                  the same luminary, have knelt by his side. 
                     
                        "Thou, for my sake, at Alla's shrine,
                        I, at any god's, for thine!"
                     
                  
               
               Happily for my future, he had welcomed the True Light, and his heart was illumined
                  by divine rays.
               Seven is considered the ruling number.
               Not so by me!
               THREE, comprise the mystic cycle of my fate.
               I have passed through three distinct phases of life!
               I have had three special calls to a religious life!
               
               I have suffered three marked punishments for not conforming to that
                  life!
               And I have had three—separate VISIONS!
               Now I am not a Spiritualist. I have no sympathy with this wonder of the nineteenth
                  century. But as regards these, thus evidenced by my senses, the last trump itself
                  will not shake my faith.
               One—early in life—when, alone in my chamber; torn asunder with desire to throw
                  myself into the arms of the Saviour; hindered by frightful unbelief from so doing;
                  I saw, with my own eyes—A HAND— extended to help me upwards.
               One—later in life—when, again alone; striving to break the iron band of
                  worldliness that held me in its riveted embrace; I heard, with my own ears—A
                  VOICE— earnestly asking me "to give up seeking religion!"
               One—latest—when, in a crowded conference meeting; I saw, with my own favored vored
                  sight—MY HUSBAND—standing, white-robed, with the angels; joining in the song of
                  praise then going up to heaven from his Christian brethren, assembled in evening
                  worship.
               But we are all human beings; and though "grief may endure for a night, joy cometh
                  in the morning."
               With time, the "great consoler," my feelings were somewhat modified; and assumed a
                  more healthy tone.
               I was still young, tolerably good-looking, and at this late day developed a
                  wonderful power "to attract."
               I do not think I had ever before realized my capacity in that line. My nature had
                  been too concentrated; in turn, too absorbingly interested in one thing.
               To make the most of available "points," it is necessary to generalize, to
                  diffuse.
               If that were the condition, clearly I was on the high-road to success!
               
               Going over soul and body to the other extreme, I generalized; until the whole
                  brotherhood of mankind was embraced in my far-reaching regard.
               I diffused; until there was nothing left to diffuse.
               Heart, house, and purse were thrown wide open, and friends trooped around.
               The caution of the elder Weller to his son "Samivel" was thrown to the wind.
               A young widow at the head of an establishment, is a mighty taking thing.
               People regarded me now with favor, who allowed my "shop girl" era to slip from
                  their memory. Yet I was not nearly as deserving their esteem, prodigally
                  scattering, as when carefully gathering. So goes the world!
               "Revenons à nos moutons". Just here comes in the
                  innocent art of cooking.
               If, three times a day, I had been obliged to prepare food for my household; for
                  lack of time, the quick sands into which my wandering feet were drawn, would never
                  have been explored.
               Our family physician "hit the nail on the head" when he wished "had not a cent in
                  the world, and six children to clothe and feed." I shrank with horror from the
                  bare idea of what would have proved an Evangel
               He well understood two things; my organization, and the importance of necessitated
                  employment.
               The homely lines— 
                     
                        "Satan finds some mischief still
                        For idle hands to do,"—
                     
                   are very significant. To everybody outside an "oyster," work was the one
                  blessing given when driven out of Paradise.
               Unoccupied time is a fearful engine of evil.
               Hopkins' hell—paved with the skulls of infants! Hades—peopled with good
                     resolutions lutions! are a "bagatelle," alongside the thronging multitude sent to
                  the "dark Plutonian shore," as punishment for deeds committed through
                  idleness!
               Upon how many tombstones might be truthfully engraved— 
                     "Gone to the Devil; because of—TOO MUCH LEISURE!"
                  
               
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               MY EVIL GENIUS.
               
                  
                     "But if thou nourish in thy heart the reveries of passion."
                  
               
               I HAD always the sympathy of the little "society."
               My home became, as it were, a grand rendezvous
                  for the Methodists. Social gatherings, class and committee meetings, succeeded
                  each other.
               I heartily entered into the spirit of them all; and to this day recall them with
                  pleasure.
               But no weather stayed the tide. I became alarmed for the well-being of my Brussels
                  carpets; and in a happy moment conceived the idea of confining the "stewards" to
                  an old rug.
               
               I see them before me! planted in a row; full of finance; yet careful, in their
                  greatest excitement, never to allow one foot to go over the prescribed limit.
               And the sympathy, too, of one dear old lady; for whom I reserved "a little chamber
                  on the wall," sacred to her own use; who, catching the falling mantle of my
                  sainted aunt, bore me up with her prayers; and—I do not doubt—opened for me a good
                  account with the court of heaven!
               I had failed in getting my husband's life insurance.
               Not liking the company in which for a number of years he had been insured, he
                  proposed to change. The papers were made out, awaiting the doctor's signature.
                  Pending this, Paul died; and having signified his intention to the old
                  company—neither new nor old felt obliged to put out their money.
               Sorry for my loss, a person conversant with the circumstances called to
                  condole.
               Was it the dead, come back to explain?
               A faintness as of death came over me; but recovering, I entered into conversation.
                  I found him educated, well-bred, a gentleman in every sense of the word.
               An external resemblance so striking, could but argue similarity in character.
               This fact immediately arrested my attention and interested my feelings.
               Could it have been otherwise?
               Impulsiveness in youth, is often recklessness in maturer years. I am not conscious
                  of ever having considered an act in connection with its result.
               I ought on the spot to have called in Fancy and shut down the gates. I did not do
                  it; and getting the upper hand—she took me rough-shod 
                     "O'er many a brier, and many a brake,"—
                   until with bleeding feet, stripped, peeled, and torn, she has set me down on
                  a barren coast.
               
               But I anticipate!
               My new friend was religious. This made him the more engaging—as
                  contradictorily—however much I may have followed the Evil, I am powerfully
                  attracted towards the Good.
               His sympathetic nature called forth mine. In telling him my troubles, they
                  disappeared. In asking his counsel, I again had a guide. In receiving his
                  instructions, I learned very highly to regard.
               All this time I was aware he was married; but having no idea of entering that
                  state myself, the knowledge did not disturb me.
               All I asked was sympathy; friendship; these satisfied.
               How arrive at these without companionship?
               There was where regret came in heavy upon my soul; and for every hour I detained
                  him from her who had a better right to his society, I have endured months of
                  torture. 
                     
                        "The mills of the gods grind slowly,
                        But they grind exceeding small,"—
                     
                   and whoever goes as grist to their mill, is smothered in his own dust!
               Everybody needs a change; though it may be from good to bad. It is an unalterable
                  law of our being. Not often understood; seldom acted upon.
               If had now taken a short journey—thereby forcing my feelings into a different
                  channel—the aim would have been accomplished; and I should gladly have come back
                  to my pleasant home.
               Just then, too, my brother was continually bringing me into difficulties.
               When himself, a better-hearted man never lived; so kind—so useful—that I really
                  felt I could not keep house without him; but, like the cow that gave a good pail
                  of milk, then upset it; the poor fellow, in his cups, undid all.
               
               He borrowed money of my friends who expected me, in honor, to pay it.
               When sober he seldom talked; when in liquor he was all talk—and in his jealous,
                  suspicious moods—got me into more scrapes than I could well manage.
               The house filled with company was his opportunity.
               I well recollect upon the occasion of a party, missing certain guests; and finding
                  them in a remote room, all the preserves in the pantry before them, "cheek by
                  jowl" with James, with one spoon regaling themselves!
               He often, too, attempted to frighten, and in that way get the best of me.
               Once, however, I had him at a disadvantage. He was persevering; if he commenced a
                  thing, would be sure to finish. I had a row of poplars I wished cut down, and set
                  him to the job. All through those hot summer days he chopped and sawed, sawed and
                  chopped, bored and salted, until every tree was "done for" beyond a hope of
                  resurrection!
               Would, as then, my only brother could be with me now!
               Altogether I began to grow uneasy, dissatisfied, and tired of everything about
                  me.
               Widows of four years' standing will sympathize with me in this. It is
                  uncomfortable to be constantly reminded of lost happiness.
               So, without duly considering the subject, I sent for an auctioneer—and sold
                  out!
               My house being well furnished, drew a crowd; and seldom had the handsome "Knight
                  of the Hammer" as, good an opportunity to display his peculiar eloquence.
               It was all over; my life at M—— wound up—and I again a resident of Boston.
               In this connection there occurred a singular thing.
               
               The practical is uninteresting. I am eminently practical. I am eminently
                  uninteresting; but this—
               One Saturday night, my small family in bed and wrapt in slumber; I, alone up and
                  wakeful, went into the dining-room and seated myself at a large, black-walnut,
                  extension-table.
               With paper before me, pencil in hand, I was summing the probable proceeds of the
                  sale.
               The utmost stillness prevailed.
               Suddenly, within one inch of the paper, there was a heavy, resounding blow; as
                  though some strong, muscular hand had come down flat on the palm, with all its
                  force.
               The "masterly" retreat at Bull Run was a circumstance to my exit from that room;
                  ascent of those stairs; bolt into my mother's chamber.
               . I declare, my blood curdles even now as I think of it!
               I have stated the fact. I leave wiser heads to account for it.
               Only—as the IT, invisible, had shaken my calculations; I wish the IT, visible, had
                  so shaken my bones; that, stiff and sore, flat on my back, unable to move; per
                  necessity, taking time to determine its expediency; I had been saved the first
                  fatal step of breaking up, through the agency of that good-looking auctioneer, my
                  peaceful, comfortable home!
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XI.
               FROM GOOD TO BAD.
               
                  
                     "Refresh thy jaded limbs, return with vigor to the strife."
                  
               
               FOR a long time I had not boarded; and I thought being summoned to my meals,
                  ushered to my seat, served with rich viands, would be decidedly "the thing."
               Hotels are pleasant—but my diffusive period had quite put it out of
                  my power to indulge in that luxury.
               Imagination tided me into a regular boarding-house; second or third rate; I never
                  could make up my mind how to class it.
               For a while, novelty served me a good turn. Very slowly the curtain rose,
                  revealing "behind the scenes." "En passant," if
                  it is your fate to board, never go near the kitchen; if your reason don't fail,
                  your appetite will!
               Presently I began to be considered an old boarder. Attentions flagged. Treated
                  coldly at table, if not on hand when rung down. Savory morsels all reserved for
                  newer comers. Innuendoes respecting the quantity of food consumed by some folks,
                  and statements as to its price.
               I became a perfect "price current." Could quote all "the fluctuations of "Faneuil
                  Hall Market;" tell to a fraction the cost of butter—and rise in sugar; when lard
                  was "steady"—and ashes "quiet."
               The romance of boarding was at an end.
               Observing how profitably this woman pulled the ropes; determined she should pull
                  no more at my expense; and with an eye to the main chance, I suddenly "bought out"
                  a house.
               A word of caution to my fellow-creatures
                  about to invest in that most hazardous of all stock, a "furnished
                  dwelling-house."
               Take up every carpet and examine it against the light!
               Sound every dish to certify the cracks!
               Sit down in every chair to try their legs!
               Sleep on every bed to test its vitality!
               If carpets, dishes, chairs, stand the trial; if you rise in the morning safe in
                  wind and limb; haggle no longer, clinch the bargain.
               My "bargain" was in a fair part of the city—and eschewing boarders, I let all my
                  spare rooms to lodgers—merely to lodgers!
               I believe, now-a-days. it is thought difficult to determine a person's status.
               Although I had undergone "an experience" I was most awful green.
               My house seemed well filled. The occupants coming to me one after another to
                  ascertain whether they could retain their rooms, and on what terms, appeared
                  satisfied that it had come into my hands.
               One thing struck me as a little curious. With a single exception, they were all
                  girls.
               Now I had made up my mind to lodge gentlemen; but they were here—so nice and
                  pleasant—and besides, "a bird in hand is worth two in the bush" any day. I could
                  not find it in my heart to send them away.
               In putting things to rights, and making them comfortable generally, a week passed
                  on.
               I thought I had fallen upon a streak of luck now, sure—and settled myself down for
                  the winter—when lo! the aforesaid "exception," a young man, appeared; and
                  requested an interview.
               All honor to that young man!
               Be he what he may—be he where he may—I thank him!
               He asked me if I understood the nature of my house, and the character of its
                  inmates?
               
               Perceiving that I did not comprehend, he went on to inform me, "that I was at the
                  head of a first-class 'fancy' establishment; with a first-class set of kept
                  mistresses under my immediate charge."
               Transfixed with horror, I heard him through.
               They had been deceived by the retiring landlady.
               I was not what they supposed.
               His conscience would not suffer me to be kept in the dark another day. Under seal
                  of secrecy he made the exposé, leaving me at
                  liberty to act as I thought proper.
               It was midnight!
               Falling flat to the floor, I passed the night in an agony of thought.
               To clear the house was, of course, a foregone conclusion.
               But what would my friends say? my mother? my child?
               O God! if thou hadst not sustained me through that fearful suspense—
               Morning dawned. If never before—nor never since—that day I saw the
                  sun rise; and by nine o'clock there was not a soul on the premises save myself and
                  the astonished cook.
               I was smothered! I could not breathe! rushing, I threw windows and doors wide
                  open, to let in all of Heaven's pure air.
               I had been to a great deal of expense. The place was in fine order. However,
                     I could not enjoy it—and selling at a sacrifice—I was once more
                  afloat!
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XII.
               THE QUIET TOWN OF L——.
               
                  
                     "Seekest thou rest, O mortal? seek it no more on earth."
                  
               
               
                  
                     "Man, thou hast a social spirit."
                  
               
               DISGUSTED with my city experiences, I sought a more tranquil sphere; and
                  accordingly withdrew from "the haunts of men" to the quiet town of L——.
               I still felt alone. Amid all, my heart was continually thrown back upon itself to
                  consume its own vitality.
               From year to year I became more and more unhappy. Every change seemed for the
                  worse.
               Shall it be the same with this last?
               The few friends I had in the place tried to make it agreeable—but their efforts
                  not being met half-way, were discontinued—and life was at a dead lock.
               Better had it forever remained so!
               I had one accomplishment which now came into play.
               I sewed well.
               
                  That I had been early taught to do; and as a child, it had been no
                  small gratification to hear friends praise my beautiful stitches.
               Sewing is a safety-valve! many a disordered fancy passes off at the point of the
                  needle. I always pitied the sterner sex for this, their great deprivation.
               But they have their cigars! and smoke is useful!
               With all my improvidence, I was eager to earn; and so pressed this gift into the
                  service.
               I made shirts—fine shirts—for gentlemen; arid the opportunity given; as in the
                  case of a young friend; I have no doubt I, too, could have secured a good husband,
                     if I had wanted one, through the
                  agency of "custom sewing."
               I presume my power of "attraction" continued in full force.
               I judge so, from the many professions of undying love poured into my listless
                  ears.
               I did not wish to marry. It was suggested, that after such a lapse of time, to
                  change my condition would be more than proper; I, however, did not cafe to. That
                  was enough.
               Even my strong craving for sympathy had somewhat abated.
               The fact was, I had now got thoroughly interested in my shirts!
               
               I received them from an establishment where they were manufactured to order; and
                  have often wondered if my male acquaintance, in slipping on their well-fitting
                  garment, dreamed whose fingers had put it together! or whether, when we met, they
                  noted the close scrutiny to which they were subjected, in my desire to see if the
                  "plaits" were all right!
               "There is no peace for the wicked!" Less for a widow!
               In this secluded place my Evil Genius again turned up, and planted itself directly
                  in my path; this time also, in the questionable shape of—another married man!
               What was up?
               Had I to make good the deficiencies of my wedded female friends?
               In some cases, the task would be too Herculean.
               In this, I did not make the attempt: but I must here confess; the good looks, the
                  good heart, the evident penchant of the
                  gentleman, excited an interest—and perchance would have made a deeper
                  impression—had I not previously been ground to powder for the very same offense;
                     thinking a little too much of a man,
                  sworn to another!
               Experience is a very costly, but a very good teacher, where it does not come too
                  late.
               
                  I am indebted to it—and have written on the most obscure leaf of my
                  private diary—IF married again, look sharp to your husband; and put no faith in
                  that arrant humbug—sympathy!
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               THE FATES.
               
                  
                     
                        "That I may see once more
                        The splendor of the setting sun
                        Gleam on thy mirrored wave."
                     
                     
                        "And thou Lachesis
                        Dost spin the thread of human life!"
                     
                  
               
               MONTREAL! Grand in its churches! Its convents! Its religious processions! Its
                  situation!
               Whoever has courage to ascend the turret of "Notre
                     Dame"—fifteen feet higher than our own Bunker Hill Monument—is richly
                  repaid in a charming panoramic view of the city at his feet.
               Spanning the St. Lawrence, is the far-famed Victoria Bridge; and the noble river
                  itself, with many an island lying upon its calm bosom.
               
               As I write, memory vividly recalls the happy hours passed upon its waters; the
                  fear of its dangerous rapids being lost in admiration of the scenery along its
                  shores.
               Here, too, occurs this singular phenomenon—the Ottawa and St. Lawrence flowing
                  side by side—each retaining its distinctive color.
               Montreal, Americanized as it is, presents in itself and its surroundings so much
                  of the foreign and picturesque, that each season beholds its streets thronged with
                  travellers seeking the cool, invigorating air; together with the thousand objects
                  of interest claiming attention at every step.
               And artists—endeavoring to transfer to canvas the mountain, crowned to its top
                  with foliage; through which, glimpses may be caught of a winding road gay with
                  vehicles of every description; from the youthful occupants of which—it would
                  require but little stretch of the imagination— music and laughter are borne back
                  upon the wind!
               Neither does he forget the low, quaint cottage, adjoining the splendid mansion;
                  each conspicuous by contrast.
               Nor the curious costumes; making in appearance, grandfathers and grandmothers of
                  the young: but which delusion is instantly dispelled, by the brilliant eye, seen
                  nowhere out of Italy, save in the Canadian born peasant.
               Summer has gone! Winter approaches! Travellers and artists his them to more
                  congenial climes. Ice is formed! The waters of the St. Lawrence congeal. Snow
                  descends! The mountain trees bend beneath its weight.
               It piles the streets so high, that from opposite windows, neighbors can scarcely
                  see one another.
               Unbroken in its depth—unstained in its whiteness—it lay the whole distance
                     between tween this great city of "Our
                  Lady," and the obscure, unknown village of Laprairie.
               The small houses are far apart!
               How, in case of sickness?
               A watchful Providence is above all; and has in equal remembrance, the favored
                  inhabitant of the city, the lone dweller in the hamlet.
               Thus it came to pass—though the storm raged, and the wind blew round the isolated
                  house—that mingling with its blasts, angels heard the tiny wail of a new-born
                  infant; a mother thanked God her agony was over—a father clasped to his heart—a
                  son!
               Of foreign birth, proud of his ancestry, one of whom, high in rank, had fought
                  under the first Napoleon; exclusive in his feelings, naturally and by force of
                  education; Monsieur Chaudet, induced by the prospect of more easily acquired
                  wealth, came to the Canadas; intending eventually to make the "States" his
                  home.
               But a "winsome" maiden interfered with his plans; and settling down— 
                     "Far from the busy haunts of men"—
                   his wife, his books, his fields, engaged his attention, until a new ambition
                  was aroused by the birth of the little Gustave.
               Very early in life the child discovered a nature sensitive to the last degree.
               Each influence, for the time being, entirely swayed him; and the transition from
                  good to bad—or from bad to good—was so instantaneous and so complete, that it was
                  amazing one identity could display such conflicting phases.
               That the boy might have educational advantages and mingle with his fellows, the
                  quiet country was exchanged for the bustling city. Laprairie—for Montreal.
               Here, witnessing frequent military parades rades, he acquired a taste for display; and although placed under immediate
                  care of the most self-denying Catholic order; the very ritual of their
                  church—accompanied by its bewildering music—so cultivated in him the æsthetic,
                  that no Parsee adored his burning god, as the young Gustave—"the Beautiful!"
               His disposition was generous. His heart tender. His talents of a high order.
               Under a father's judicious training there might have resulted, from these several
                  characteristics, a perfect whole.
               To the irreparable loss of the son, the father—hardly entered upon middle life—was
                  suddenly cut down.
               And Gustave—the gifted, the tenderhearted, the generously disposed, the easily
                  influenced to good or bad; an orphan, beside himself with grief—was thrown at an
                  early age upon the world, to receive its impress of virtue or vice, as his all
                  important "first step" should determine.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               LA MAISON DE MAUVAISE FÂME.
               
                  
                     "And the wages of her sin shall be hereafter."
                  
               
               
                  
                     "Look again on this fair girl."
                  
               
               A LARGE house, brown-stone front, in a fashionable quarter of the city.
               It was evening.
               The street was brilliant with gas.
               Only a close observer, however, could have detected lights within the mansion.
                  Heavy draperies thoroughly screened the windows. At intervals alone, a curtain
                  suddenly raised, and as immediately dropped, gave a glimpse of the magnificence
                  within.
               In truth, everything wealth could command was to be seen and enjoyed there.
               Carpets, so soft the footfall left no echo.
               
               Furniture, gorgeous in its appointments without regard to cost.
               Pictures, selected with evident care and taste.
               And mirrors, from floor to ceiling reflecting back this beauty, apparently doubled
                  the size of the already spacious apartment.
               The hall was dimly lighted. From time to time as a person entered, the door was
                  hastily opened, and at once carefully closed.
               Well-dressed were they who ascended those steps. To be envied, in that they were
                  Fortune's favorites—and possessed the "Open Sesame" to even that aristocratic
                  dwelling; the pass-word to which was—money!
               "Ho, there! wine for a dozen!" peremptorily called a young man to a retreating
                  waiter—as he threw himself into a seat before a marble table, somewhat apart from
                  the other occupants of the room.
               "Lor! massa 'Gus'—you ain't goin for to drink all that ar wine, your own self?"
                  asked the negro, answering the order as directed.
               "Never you mind. Clear out!—and don't show your woolly head till called for—but be
                  mighty sure you are on hand then;" impatiently responded the individual thus
                  addressed.
               "Goin' it strong for a young un; guess he can't stand all that ar liquor an' keep
                  his eyes peeled;" muttered the darkey as he closed the door.
               Rising, the youth crossed the room; and with "Come on, Dick! have a drink?" seized
                  a comrade by the arm and dragged him over to his table.
               "Ha! French blood's up! jealous, by Jove! won't let me finish my talk with the
                  pretty Louise! Don't want anybody but yourself round! If that's your go—better
                  take her away from here—or you won't have
                  her long. See! another has already got my place. Harris—that rich, old swell—by
                  all that's good! A seat longside that girl don't get cold, you
                  bet!"
               The taunting words were unheeded. For making the same discovery, Gustave had
                  pounced upon the girl called "Louise," and fairly lifting her out the circle of
                  her admirers, had carried—as he would have a babe—the slight figure, and set her
                  down close by himself.
               It was done so suddenly there was no opportunity for resistance.
               "That's too bad!" exclaimed the person thus deprived of his fair companion;
                  directing a fierce glance at his bold rival. "Just the cut of that young scamp,
                  how do you call him? Always takes exactly what one wants, without so much as
                  saying, 'By your leave!' 'There is honor among thieves!'"
               "What's that about thieves?" interrupted Gustave. "Look sharp to your tongue, my
                  fine fellow, if you don't want it pulled out by the roots! All is fair in war you
                  know!"
               "I say, Harris! why make a damn'd fool of yourself? The girl don't care a snap for
                     you, anyhow—and they say she's bewitched with that fiery chap's
                  black eyes! Console yourself!—my boy—console yourself! 'There's as good fish in
                  the sea as ever came out of it.' Now here's"—
               "Damnation! if you want to console yourself, do it! But I swear! I am
                  not going to submit to anything of this kind. We are six to one, and have Louise I
                  will!"
               "Take her if you can get her," remarked Gustave, quietly sipping his wine; at the
                  same time bringing all the fascination of his dark eyes to bear upon the lovely
                  female at his side. "Take her if you can get her"—and raising his glass to his
                  lips—Here is to your success gentlemen!
               "'He who wins shall wear.'"
               
               "Then, by Heaven, you French devil! I will wear. Come on!" and with one bound
                  clearing the space—Harris had his hand almost upon the girl's shoulder—who, half
                  dead with fright, clung trembling to her companion.
               Almost—but not quite. For Gustave, throwing her from him—eyes blazing with
                  fury—sprang to his feet!
               Maddened by rage he drew his revolver,—and the next moment would have been Harris'
                  last, had not the woman—with the instinctive devotion of her sex—flung herself
                  fainting upon the breast of the man she loved—and stayed back his hand from the
                  terrible crime.
               The uproar now became general.
               Crazed with passion and drink, oaths and curses came thick and fast; and blows
                  too—some of which fell heavily upon tenderly reared forms—all unused to such
                  treatment.
               Murder, after all, would inevitably have closed the scene—but for the timely
                  appearance of the "Madam" of this stylish hell,—who with the warning, "Gentlemen!
                  the police are upon you!" quickly cleared the room—by passing them through a
                  secret passage into the next—outwardly, highly respectable, brown-stone front!
               Dick, who during the entire fracas had taken the best possible care of himself,
                  had gone with the crowd.
               Gustave, the chief actor, had resumed his seat and again addressed himself to his
                  wine.
               He was alone with the girl.
               The excitement under which he had labored all the evening, passed away. His voice
                  was low and tender.
               "Drink, Louise!" filling high her glass, and touching it to his own lips ere he
                  offered it to his companion; "drink, 'mignonne!'
                  nothing like wine to drown trouble—and you and I both need it—for, tonight we
                  part!"
               
               The girl raised her eyes to his in an agony of doubt!
               He answered their mute appeal.
               "Yes, Louise! we must part. The shadow of life has fallen upon me. I came here
                  purposely to drink, as I never did before, that the very recollection of grief
                  might be taken out of my soul. But it is of no use"—and bowing his head upon his
                  hand—he wept convulsively.
               She watched him with intensest interest; at length, laying her delicate hand upon
                  his dark hair, timidly murmured—"Dearest! there is something beside wine to drown
                  trouble—there is love!"
               Her voice took on a beseeching tone.
               "Take me out of this place. O, Gustave! carry me far away, where no familiar eye
                  shall see me; and—all your own—let me, your Louise, be the one to bring you back
                  to happiness?"
               The youth raised his head, and gazed long and earnestly upon the beautiful
                  pleader.
               No, 'mignonne', it cannot be. I am not
                  ungrateful. I shall bear with me till my latest hour the remembrance of what you
                  have saved me from this night, but to-day the knowledge came to me that I am an
                  orphan, and penniless.
               "Nor shall you remain here. In the pure atmosphere of your distant
                  home, by repentance, you shall atone for our sin of the past few months."
               She scarcely heeded his words.
               She threw herself before him, and lay moaning at his feet. She entreated. She
                  implored. In vain; and the dread conviction fastened upon her that she saw
                  tonight—for the last time,—the face of him she had loved "not wisely, but too
                  well!"
               At last, worn out with fatigue and sorrow, Gustave threw himself upon a sofa and
                  slept.
               
               Turning down the lights, Louise, kneeling by his side until break of day, watched
                  with the unsleeping vigilance of love, every movement of the handsome sleeper.
               Ah, Gustave! impulsive, misguided Gustave! dost thou thus redeem the ambitious
                  hope of thy dead father for thee, his eldest born?
               Ah, Louise! devoted, unhappy Louise! would thy tears, thy prayers had availed; and
                  that he, upon whom thou lavished the deepest affection, had returned thy love; had
                  met the cravings of thy fond heart!
               So wouldst thou have been saved.
               So would I have escaped the misery that was to, result from meeting, in the
                  future, one of whose very existence I was as yet in such blissful ignorance.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               ST. LOUIS.
               
                  
                     "Thy father's friend, and thine, who tendereth thee tried love."
                  
               
               "BY Heaven! I am in luck. St. Louis, too, has a free lunch!
               "I say, Charley! what an institution this is!
               "How would a poor devil of a fellow manage just now if she hadn't? every cent
                  gone, not a place to put my head. No matter. Food before sleep, and I
                     am starved—that's a fact. A shame too, with that rich uncle of
                  mine, for my father's son to be walking the street in this shape!"
               "Uncles don't help. Keep up good courage, Gustave. Better times ahead. If I had a
                  dollar in the world, you should have
                  half. Come! you are too good-looking a fellow to be down in the mouth. Pluck up!
                  and walk right straight into the affections of some rich girl, and your
                  everlasting fortune's made without any further bother. All I'll charge you for the
                  idea is—let me see?—you may set me up!"
               "What in?—food, or liquor?—the last I judge, from the way you handle it—but
                  remember, the 'drinks' have got to be paid for!"
               "Yes—I know; but take a glass; it will give you strength to look up your
                  fortune—the girl—eh, Gustave!"
               "No, I will eat; that is free—and I shall be ashamed to come here
                  to-morrow—so must lay in a stock while I can."
               "Well! good-by—give us your hand!—and be sure you take my advice. I declare
                  'Gus',—I feel as good as behind my bar—now!"
               The two young men separated.
               One, to walk the streets in absolute want. Not a cent in his pocket; long distance
                  away; what should he do? Walk forever? No—his mind is made up; his dinner was
                  given him—his lodging, he will beg.
               "But for the love of Heaven, landlord!—only for the night. Just think!—for over a
                  week I have not slept in a bed. I am completely worn out. Rest assured I will pay
                  you soon as I can earn the money."
               "Lots say the same thing. But I'm a tender-hearted chicken—and you're an
                  honest-looking fellow—so I suppose I'll have to take your word this time.
               "Look here, Captain! see how I'm continually bamboozled into harboring these young
                  people who will pay me when they get work. If half they promise comes in, I shall
                  be a rich man!"
               The individual thus addressed, turned. No sooner had his eye fallen on Gustave, than—seizing him with both hands—he
                  held him in a hearty embrace.
               "You here!—the son of my old friend begging a night's shelter; why,
                  how's this?—landlord! I'll take this young gentleman off your hands. Thought I
                  recognized the voice—precisely like your father's—don't speak—know all about his
                  death—and it shall go hard if I don't find you a good berth, for his sake. Got one
                  on hand now, by Jove! How would you like to be clerk—Captain's clerk—of the good,
                  staunch steamboat Isabel, all the way from here to New Orleans?"
               The young man overcome by his feelings, could hardly trust himself to reply; and
                  when taking out his purse, the Captain handed him seventy-five dollars—his first
                  month's pay in advance—with the kind remark, "You youngsters are always out of
                  money, and you may need this," Gustave could restrain himself no longer, but burst
                  into a flood of tears.
               His affairs had now taken so unexpected and favorable a turn, that he entirety
                  forgot his Mentor, Charley's Advice; thereby ousting that free-hearted young
                  person out of his prospective bar; and taking the risk of losing a rich wife, he
                  accepted on the spot the generous offer of his father's friend
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVI.
               THE "ISABEL."
               
                  
                     
                        "I know a maiden fair to see,
                        Take care!"
                     
                     
                        "I would that I could utter
                        My feelings without shame;
                        And tell him how I love him,
                        Nor wrong my virgin fame."
                     
                     
                        "And he that would say 
                        A pretty girl nay"—
                     
                  
               
               AND the Captain's clerk liked his berth.
               To be sure, he had a good deal to look after—with considerable responsibility for
                  one so young—and what was new to him, a "gang" entirely under his direction.
               But he had already seen something of the world, and felt quite equal to meeting
                  this increased demand upon his ability.
               The negro element was his especial enjoyment; and they came fully as much to
                  appreciate him.
               In the frequent stops of the Isabel to load and unload, Massa "Gus"
                  as they invariably called him, could get the allotted amount of work out of them
                  with less driving than had been their wont
               It is barely possible they had an eye to the extra whiskey which they would be
                  sure to get, if they gave satisfaction to their young master.
               There was plenty of excitement, too, connected with the life; constantly "taking
                  on" and "letting off" passengers at the different stations; for somehow the Isabel this particular season proved to be the most popular boat on
                  the river.
               And when regular duties were over, company, cards, and dances whiled many an hour
                  of the passage up and down the Mississippi.
               
               "What the deuce has got into the women, 'Gus,' this summer? "sung out the
                  Captain." Have they all taken to travelling for a living? I never
                  carried so many before in any one year, by Jove! as I have the last four months. I
                  believe it's you—with those devilish black eyes—you young rascal! that's bewitched
                  them all. Well—go ahead—it's good for the boat!"
               Gustave with a smile turned away; being pretty sure in his own mind that in some
                  instances it certainly was, either himself, or his "eyes."
               In one, he might have sworn to the fact.
               On a never-to-be-forgotten evening, as it afterwards proved, being short of a hand
                  at Euchre, they had called as usual upon the young clerk.
               His partner was a lady he had never seen before.
               She was well-dressed and handsome; very agreeable, and remarkably
                  self-possessed.
               She was alone on the "trip;" and in that way the accidental meeting at the
                  card-table, resulted in a more intimate acquaintance.
               By the time she reached her destination it was quite evident that the "black eyes"
                  had done their usual execution; and that the stranger had left with their
                  owner—her heart.
               This flirtation would like many others, in time, have passed from his mind; if, as
                  the Captain said, the person in question had not persistently taken "to
                  travel."
               Every few weeks she made the passage; always alone; and each time, making no
                  attempt whatever to disguise her feelings, became more decided in her advances
                  upon Gustave. 
                     
                        "She showed him the way; and she showed him the way,
                        She showed him the way to woo."
                     
                  
               
               It now began really to look as though he would be obliged to marry the lady to get
                  rid of her, The case was desperate. He consulted his friend, the Captain.
               
               "Do no such thing," was the blunt reply "you are too young. Ship her!"
               As his affections were in no wise entangled—and he had other plans for his
                  future—that decided the question; and intimating as delicately as possible the
                  exact state of the case, he supposed, poor fellow, he was well quit of the whole
                  thing.
               Once, he had broken off "an affair"—it made his very heart ache to recall that—but
                  then he was not to blame; he could not marry her.
               
               This however, he was not destined so easily to dismiss.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               ANITA.
               
                  
                     
                        Abra was ready ere I named her name,
                        And when I called another Abra came."
                     
                     
                        "She can both false and friendly be.
                        Beware! Beware!"
                     
                  
               
               FOR some time Gustave saw no more of his would-be love, Anita.
               Finally, towards the close of the season, she came on board to make the "up trip"
                  accompanied by a gentleman, whom she introduced as her brother.
               They were to be a while in St. Louis and hoped often to have the pleasure of
                  meeting Gustave.
               As the lady appeared to have given up all designs upon his liberty—and the
                  gentleman appeared to be a genial, polite man of the world—nothing could have been more agreeable
                  than this proposition to the Captain's clerk.
               When the boat landed—and Anita escorted to her hotel—the two new friends strolled
                  about the city; regaling themselves as young men will, with a cigar there, a drink
                  here.
               It occurred to Gustave that the stranger was particularly attentive, urging him
                  not to spare the wine; and once he thought—but it was so quickly done—if at
                  all—that he immediately dismissed the base suspicion from his mind.
               At length Walter proposed going to look up his sister; and took his companion,
                  nothing loth, along with him.
               Finding Anita rested, and already seated in the carriage preparatory to taking a
                  drive, her brother instantly placed himself beside her; calling upon Gustave to do
                  the same; and all were rapidly whirled off.
               The walk, the ride, or perhaps the wine he had drank in such unusual quantities,
                  began to make themselves felt.
               Silent, Gustave was glad to lean back at his ease; and if not asleep, was at
                  least, in that dim, unconscious state, in which the senses scarcely comprehend
                  what is going on around.
               "Anita, mía! you have got him now—sure—fast
                  enough. A fine scrape! to bring your brother into, just as he has travelled half
                  over the world to see you once more. Yes—a devilish fine scrape! What if the
                  authorities get hold of the affair?—where am I?—and you too—sister mine—answer me
                  that? Now in Italy"—
               "Hush, Walter! not a word. My life's happiness shall be your reward. We are all
                  that is left to each other. You would not see your sister die before your
                  eyes!—and I tell you again—O, my brother! life, without Gustave—my heart's idol—I
                     will not accept. But have we not
                  arrived at our destination?
               "I hope so; for really I begin to feel skittish! Suppose your handsome lover
                  should prove rebellious; and refuse outright the felicity of calling you—my
                  pretty—his bride; what then?"
               "Didn't you use the powder as I told you? O, Walter!"
               "Yes! yes! Don't look at a fellow so! It is all right; if we can only keep him
                  under its influence long enough to get through this confounded job. You ought to
                  live in Italy. Your blood is too hot for this part of the world!
                     There you could try your hand at the drug business—and no
                  questions asked—but thank the gods, we are here! In a few moments I shall salute
                  you as the cara sposa of the man you have risked
                  your life, and mine, to obtain; and then, poor me! over the water—alone—never more
                  to see my darling Anita!"
               The carriage stopped.
               The lady and her brother alighted.
               Gustave followed mechanically; still under the influence of a powerful
                  narcotic.
               "Hurry up! or we shall be too late after all;" whispered Walter, as he handed his
                  sister up the steps.
               They were evidently expected; and immediately ushered into a room—where the one
                  occupant, a clergyman, prepared for the occasion—was all ready to receive
                  them.
               No time was lost in performing the short ceremony, which united for life the young
                  girl to the almost unconscious man at her side.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               THE CAPTAIN'S CLERK.
               
                  
                     "In himself ambition is dead."
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        "Or, if there 's vengeance in an injured heart,
                        And power to wreak it."
                     
                  
               
               "WHAT! Gustave! my clerk! gone and got married, without so much as telling me, his
                  friend, and his father's friend before him? By Jove! there is some mistake,
                  landlord. 'Gus' wouldn't serve me such a slippery trick!"
               "He didn't go and get married, as I have told you over and over
                  again. Somebody took and married him. Don't you remember that tall girl—with all
                  that hair—who went up and down the river with you so often last summer?"
               "Yes—of course I do!"
               "Well! that's the one. They say she was crazy after your clerk. So she, and her
                  scapegrace of a brother—just got home from one of his long tramps—fixed it all up;
                  and the rope is spliced!—tight, too—looked out for that—minister's
                  all regular—and the girl has got her certificate to show for it."
               "By Jove! that's outrageous! what I call a true blue 'out-an'-outer.' But, where
                  is 'Gus?' can't spare him, married or single."
               "You'll have to do it, Captain! It seems by his own account he was drugged; and
                  when he came to and saw how matters stood—he swore he wouldn't live with his
                  wife—no, not an hour; and took an awful oath—that he'd leave no stone
                  unturned—till the cursed knot was untied."
               "Poor fellow! I must hunt him up. Where did you say he was? It won't do to leave
                  him alone to bear all this load!"
               "He 's gone off; and you won't see him
                  round these parts in a hurry, Captain, I tell you!"
               "Sorry. I always knew 'Gus' was a brick—and—by Jove!—I glory in his spunk. What
                  has become of the girl!"
               "O, her precious brother looked after her, poor thing! It was as much
                  as he could do though, to keep her from taking her own life; said she couldn't and
                  she wouldn't live without her dear Gustave. Finally, they got her into the
                  carriage and took her home. I kind of Pity her, after all. She 's a mighty
                  handsome piece, and has always had her own way!"
               It was as our old friend, the landlord, said. Gustave had indeed gone off—nobody
                  knew where.
               He had made inquiries, and ascertained that more difficulties than he supposed,
                  lay in the way of untying the "cursed knot," as he styled his forced marriage.
               The whole thing was legal—with the exception of his strange statement that he had
                  been drugged. That he must prove. There was but one witness—the
                  brother to the bride. He would not be likely to implicate himself, or his
                  sister.
               So the whole matter rested; and the betrayed man—too sensitive to face his old
                  associates—thrown out of his situation, had nothing to do but execrate his fate,
                  or his "eyes," which had brought him into his present unhappy condition.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIX.
               THE GRAND ITALIAN OPERA.
               
                  
                     "Tell me, daughter of taste, what hath charmed thine ear in music?"
                  
               
               THE theatre was ablaze with light!
               Carriage after carriage deposited its load of beauty, fashion, and wealth at its
                  door.
               Boston's favorite Opera was to be rendered by Boston's favorite artists—and
                  everybody susceptible to the silvery sweetness of Brignoli's "Miserére," or the
                  haunting melody of Phillips' "Prison Song"—was present.
               From parquet to ceiling was one living mass of brilliant and interested
                  spectators.
               I recall the depreciatory remark of the great Schiller; that a Grand Opera is
                     theauto-da-fé of Nature; yet, always to
                  me—the rustle of silk, the sheen of satin, the costly lace, the flash of jewel;
                  the happy faces, the subdued laughter, the murmur of voices, the restless motion
                  of graceful forms, with subtle perfume of the many flowers—are fitting
                  accompaniments to the impassioned, entrancing melody falling upon the ear, and
                  hushing every other sound by its wondrous spell: falling upon the heart, and
                  stirring in its depths longings, O, such irrepressible longings, for the Unseen,
                  for the Infinite!
               High up in the crowd stood a slight, but well-formed man; rather above the medium
                  height. That he was young, both face and figure disclosed.
               Graceful in attitude, he was now gazing intently upon the Prima Donna, oblivious
                  to all save the ravishing strains she was pouring forth.
               
               His hair was of the darkest dye, and so thick as partially to conceal his face.
                  Beard he had none; but his full, black mustache, hiding his entire upper lip, gave
                  character to a mouth otherwise rather feminine.
               His eyes—but wait!—until the music ceases; and the cheering of the
                  "house"—breaking the spell—causes him to raise them. Ah! in color they match his
                  hair—in size and brilliancy they rival the Italian songstress'.
               But soft and tender as they now seem, one instinctively shrinks from the lurking
                  demon detected there, instantly suggesting— 
                     "Land of the Cypress and Myrtle."
                  
               
               He is alone. Speaks to no one. Recognizes no one.
               At length, his attention is arrested by two ladies—both evidently past their
                  youth—who are eagerly discussing between the acts the respective merits of their
                  favorite singers, and favorite operas.
               The younger, after a while, apparently acquiesces in the superior musical
                  knowledge of her companion; and they again settle themselves to listen.
               The young man from time to time regards them.
               His eyes seek oftenest the face of the elder.
               He would be puzzled to give the reason; as there is nothing at all observable in
                  her appearance.
               Her plain dress serves but as a foil to the more gayly attired. Eyes of an
                  uncertain hue—complexion, neither dark nor light—but mantled with the glow of
                  health. She is now in repose; her whole being is absorbed.
               But as he looks, those doubtful eyes flash with expression; teeth even and white,
                  gleam between the parted lips; color deepens ens; and through the master passion of her
                  soul—MUSIC— the woman before him, transformed, is beautiful!
               Thus they met! He the younger. She the elder.
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               L'INCONNU.
               
                  
                     "Whence, and what art thou?"
                  
               
               THE Opera, successfully inaugurated, lengthened into a season of five or six
                  weeks.
               A mutual acquaintance, Fate's chosen instrument, bridged over the separating chasm
                  with the formal introduction—
               "Allow me the pleasure, Mrs. Pennington, to present, I hope to your very favorable
                  notice, my particular friend, Monsieur Gustave Chaudet!"
               This gave the opportunity whicheach—unconsciously destined to influence the other
                  for all time—improved.
               We both equally appreciated the "divine
                  art;" and every evening found us its "most constant worshipper."
               From casual glances—resulted smiles; slight recognitions; occasional remarks.
               I passionately loved music. So intensely indeed, as often to sit with closed eyes,
                  that no attendant "stage" circumstance might distract from the harmony itself.
               Still, I will confess it lent additional interest that the handsome Unknown, night
                  after night, eagerly awaited my entrance to conduct me to a seat.
               He appeared quite as much pleased to have fallen in with some one in sympathy with
                     his tastes—and who whiled with pleas-ant talk the expectant
                  moments—before the "rising of the curtain" and "between the acts."
               Music is a wonderful medium for the "tender passion;" and of those very sensitive
                  to its power, holds—at times—the Fate!
               Thus we, upon the opening night complete strangers—before the last came round—were
                  far on the way to an intimate friendship.
               Meanwhile the stranger had ingratiated himself, and narrated many incidents of his
                  romantic life.
               He earnestly begged permission to call at my residence; as my society, he assured
                  me, had now become essential to his happiness; and few days passed that some of
                  its hours were not brightened by his presence.
               It is generally thought there can be but little sympathy, no love, between the
                  sexes—unless well mated in point of age—years being the received
                  data.
               I cannot answer for others—and will frankly own—I had never known of but one happy
                  connection where this discrepancy was marked.
               When thinking upon this subject at all,
                  serious objections to spending my life with a person so much younger, of course
                  presented themselves.
               But I was peculiar; in that, late in life I had
                  developed; thus bringing my feelings to a level with his, my
                  junior—who, thanks to certain "evénements"—had
                  on the other hand, matured very early.
               So that, after all, throwing out of the account what was in our case
                  absolutely incommensurate time; we met on the common ground of high health, high
                  spirits, and—inevitable consequence—a mutual fondness for high life.
               Friends, alarmed for the result—with the usual success attached to those little
                  "episodes"—interfered.
               Although it seemed even at the time, to my own self, inexplicable how it could
                  come to pass; the cravings of my lonely heart were really satisfied;
                  and—a shining proof of Folly attempting to cope with Destiny —I was left to desire
                  no other companionship.
               We travelled. Beheld with our own eyes the grandeur of mountain scenery.
               Saw for ourselves the vast, old ocean; and listened long, to its eternal, solemn
                  cadence.
               Looked together upon enchanting landscapes; and through the aesthetic our hearts
                  were powerfully drawn out, and attracted towards, each other.
               My friend made the most extravagant professions of love; and those professions I
                  had no reason to think otherwise than sincere.
               But all this while there appeared to be a mystery hanging over his life.
               Of his past, I knew nothing; save what he had chosen to impart. I was perfectly
                  convinced, however, that something—and of a serious nature too—had been
                  withheld.
               
               He became fitful. At times, giving full rein to excitement—fearfully wild; then
                  the reaction—and he was equally gloomy. In both phases evidently the victim to
                  unhappy memories, which, in spite his best endeavor, would obtrude.
               I sought in vain to penetrate the veil.
               In the kindest manner—but decidedly—he would invariably put me off; until I became
                  nearly as miserable as himself, and deplored the hour we met.
               He had never spoken of marriage—which was singular—as the most casual observer
                  could see that his life's fruition lay at my disposal. 
                     
                        "Tous les jours je t'attends; tu reviens tous les jours,
                        Est-ce moi qui t'appelle et qui règle ton cours?"
                     
                  
               
               This state of things could not continue.
               A dénouement was at hand.
               In the course of travel we found ourselves at the delightful city of G——.
               I had that day privately determined to bring matters to a crisis; and unless I
                  could satisfactorily fathom the secret, then and there, end the acquaintance.
               I obtained his promise to reveal all. But upon the very eve of disclosure his
                  heart failed him, and the revelation was again postponed.
               Feeling now positive that indeed there was something of a frightful nature
                  concealed; I demanded to know the worst, however crushing that worst might be.
               By way of answer, he displayed to my horror-stricken eyes a poison; which he
                  declared should terminate his existence, if the interview resulted as he
                  feared.
               In the face and eyes of this threat, I still insisted; and unable longer to oppose
                  my pleadings—with hesitating voice, tearful eyes, breaking heart—he spoke of his
                  deep love, of his terrible conflict between inclination and duty, and confessed;
                  that with all his affections centred in
                  me, he was the bound husband to another!
               Though I tore out my quivering heart; honor compelled instantly to banish from my
                  very thought the man who had so entwined himself around its every fibre; and
                  leaving him to bear his own misery as best he might, I went from his
                  presence—forever!
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               AN INTERVIEW.
               
                  
                     "What concentrated joy or woe in blest or blighted loved!"
                  
               
               "SCORN me as you will, you are still my husband! I risked reputation—almost life
                  itself—to call you mine; and never, while I breathe, shall another bear your
                  name!"
               "For the last time I ask you. Anita! give me my freedom?"
               "Not that, Gustave!—all else in heaven and earth; but not that. Would you drive me
                  insane?"
               You were already mad when, to accomplish your purpose, you committed the fiendish
                  act. O, but you were cunning! No witness save your brother, as to the manner in
                  which you entrapped me."
               
               "Gustave! It was love that drove me to it. O, forgive me! Take me once to your
                  heart. Look! on my bended knees I swear I never loved another. Every pulsation is
                  for you, and you alone. Devotion such as mine, cannot fail in time to win your
                  tenderness. Grant me that time? By all your hopes of future happiness do not,
                  Gustave, do not—refuse me now!"
               "Anita! I came here for no scene—simply to obtain my release; but since you deny
                  me justice, hear what I say! As you love me, so love I another; and had not my
                  honor prevented—in her ignorance of my great wrong—she would to-day have been my
                  wife."
               "And you dare tell me this! Never will I grant your request. So help
                  me God! I am your wife. As you will not permit me to be your Happiness, I will be
                  your Misery. Go where you will; with whom you will; as your Evil Genius, I shall
                  be forever at your side!"
               "Then be the blood of your brother upon your own head, Anita! By Heaven! dead or
                  alive, he shall be made to confess; for—I will be free!"
               Before she could find words to reply, he was gone; and terrified, lest he should
                  put his threat in immediate execution, she rushed from the room to warn her sick
                  brother; who, upon a sick-bed, was, alas! doomed by a Word more potent than any
                  could be uttered with mortal lips!
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXII.
               WALTER.
               
                  
                     
                        "But now the hand of fate is on the curtain, 
                        And gives the scene to light."
                     
                  
               
               "YOU surely would not betray me, Walter! your only sister! who has known no other
                  love than yours from infancy?"
               "Anita! I cannot die with this fearful sin on my soul. Think of it! the life's
                  happiness of the young man destroyed; not through fault of his—but yours—and
                  mine."
               "To save him, must my name be made a by-word and
                  scoffing? Walter! kneeling at his feet, he spurned me as he would have a dog. Is
                  it not sufficient anguish to be thus driven from my husband? and to lose you? for
                  you are dying—O, my brother!—I never harmed you; and I know in your
                  last hours you will not rashly do anything to increase my
                  wretchedness!"
               "You say truly, I cannot live; and the good Priest has this day told me that only
                  by confession, can I hope myself to be forgiven. I must not bear this
                  secret with me to the grave."
               "Walter! have mercy upon me—upon me—your sister; or I am lost,
                  undone!"
               "Dearest! even for you I cannot risk the bliss of heaven. Anita! meet me there! As
                  a "Sister of Charity," atone for the past; and with the blessings of the
                  unfortunate upon your head, enter Paradise!"
               That day—the dearly beloved, absolved, brother closed his eyes in
                  death.
               That day—the heart-broken, despairing Anita was placed in charge of Sister
                  Irene.
               And that day—Gustave received through
                  an, unknown source, in the handwriting of Walter, his friend at the last, a full
                  confession of the wicked deception practiced upon him by his sister—and by
                  himself—the dead!
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               THE LETTER.
               
                  
                     "For a letter, timely writ, is a rivet to the chain of affection."
                  
               
               WHY could I not altogether have banished my late unhappy experience?
               Why not—to the end—have remained independent and self-reliant?
               It was not to be.
               I was in the power of an irresistible Destiny.
               The Fates were busily weaving the dark web of my future; elaborating day by day
                  the everlasting truth, 
                     
                        "The mills of the gods grind slowly,
                        But they grind exceeding small."
                     
                  
               
               I suffered; more than I chose to acknowledge.
               Was I never again to know peace?
               
               Was every anticipated happiness to become ashes in my grasp?
               I withdrew, as of old, into myself. I nursed in secret my grief. I no longer found
                  anything in outward circumstance to give pleasure; and I discovered too late—that
                  I had ventured my all upon the truthfulness of one man—and had lost!
               I knew, moreover, that man was wretched.
               All could have been saved by the frank avowal of his secret marriage.
               True—fear of losing—had been his excuse for not informing me sooner.
               Through this selfish motive he had blasted the prospects of both.
               I could not forgive; him—for bringing upon me this new trouble; myself—for blindly
                  trusting where I really knew so little.
               Meanwhile, armed with his precious document Gustave proceeded at once to lay it
                  before the proper authorities.
               His previous statement being so well substantiated, he had now no difficulty in
                  getting from the court his papers. To his infinite relief his marriage vow was
                  disannulled, and he pronounced at liberty!
               The "cursed knot" was at length untied.
               But what course should he now pursue?
               How convince her he loved, that his honor was unimpeached?
               He wrote; and the same day that was telegraphed the all comprehensive word
                  "FREE!"— I received this letter:—
               "Ma chere Amie,—Blame me not, The devotion of my
                  life shall prove to you I am not unworthy. Ecoutez! My situation was perplexing in the extreme. United in
                  marriage by force—to as it were a stranger—never heeding for one moment her ardent
                  protestations of undying affection; never seeing, in truth, her face from the hour
                  of the illegal ceremony until I demanded my liberation; but utterly unable to prove all this; I have necessarily
                  been under a cloud. Only the death of her brother saved me. During his sickness
                  his burdened conscience gave him no rest; and at the last hour, regardless of the
                  entreaties of his sister, he confessed to his Priest the whole; thus leaving it in
                  my power, as an honorable man, to throw myself upon your forgiveness; and—may I
                  hope?—upon your love. You are older than I. 'Qu'im-porte
                     l'age?' Do not, I beg, give one thought to the idle fancy
                     that will ever affect my feelings towards you; for before my
                  Maker, I declare to you—singular as it may appear—I never have loved
                  but one, never can love but one, never shall marry but
                  one. You, you alone, must henceforth prove my guiding star. Adieu—je pense toujours à vous, et mon cœur reste avec
                     vous—GUSTAVE."
               This placed the entire matter in a new light.
               I had now but to consider whether, against the judgment of my friends, I dared
                  take the responsibility of marrying this man so many years my junior.
               What does not love dare?
               Ignoring all difference in age; in religion; in circumstance; in position: my life
                  all passed; his all to come; and risking, as never before, my future upon this
                  last throw—I again married!
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               THE HONEYMOON.
               
                  
                     "Honey-sweet, but lacking not the bitter."
                  
               
               IMMEDIATELY upon our marriage we had secured a house in R—— Street and there
                  collected our "household gods."
               
                  That was the happy era of my newly wedded life!
               Gustave was devoted to me, and to all my interests; and worked hard to establish
                  business plans upon a firm footing.
               We were comfortably and pleasantly situated.
               Our days glided peacefully on; our evenings made very enjoyable by books, music,
                  and the society of friends.
               I never tired of listening to his fine voice, as, accompanied by the piano, he
                  sang the ballads I loved.
               In my contentment I surely refuted the "croak" that, in marrying Gustave, "I was
                  rushing upon certain ruin!"
               And we were happy! We had a honeymoon!
               No marriage—consummated though it be under the most disadvantageous,
                  irreconcilable circumstances—but has that.
               
               No two—however thrown together in the intimate relationship of man
                  and wife—can fail to appreciate, and at first, find satisfaction in the new
                  tie.
               Novelty lends its powerful charm!
               Both, too, are upon good behavior. All that is most agreeable and best in their
                  "make up," is unconsciously displayed.
               Annoying dissimilarities are not suffered to appear.
               Mutual "politesse" conceals these.
               What a pity human nature is such uncertain stuff that "familiarity breeds
                     contempt tempt;" and that knowing
                  this—individuals, united for life, should ever allow this all important "politesse" to become a thing of the past!
               The subject has been exhausted. Everything has been written and said to impress
                  the fact that life is made up of trifles; and that constant attention to these
                  "trifles" is, most of all, essential to the newly married.
               Burlesque has ridiculed the idea of a man devoting himself, and showing after
                  marriage the attentions of the lover; but no burlesque, no ridicule can do away
                  the "fixed fact," that upon these attentions depend all the happiness, and nearly
                  all the affection, of the wife.
               In this direction I had no cause for complaint.
               My "Don Juan" had subsided into a most exemplary husband.
               From the time of our meeting, his flirtation period had come to a sudden and
                  complete "finis."
               Still, he was not perfect.
               His fiery nature had developed a suspicious, jealous disposition that the merest
                  word excited.
               True, he never raised his eyes to another—but what was not so satisfactory an
                  accompaniment—he never permitted me to raise mine!
               Necessarily, to avoid outbreaks, a good deal of valuable time was spent in the
                  unprofitable exercise of "walking over eggs."
               Taking all things into consideration, I have come to the settled conclusion that
                  it is not desirable to be so exclusively an "object of interest."
               Shadow of this "grande passion"—is Jealousy;
                  which, as a bane to domestic peace, stands unrivaled!
               There is no reason connected with it! 
                     
                        "Trifles light as air,
                        Are to the jealous, confirmation strong
                        As proof of holy writ!"
                     
                  
               
               
               Per necessity; my friends, and many harmless pleasures went by the board.
               All this was as nothing, however, in comparison with a danger that threatened to
                  engulf my every comfort, my every hope, my every ambition.
               Slowly, but surely it approached!
               And after months of torturing suspense, the conviction was forced upon me, that
                  undeniably well as my young husband loved me—he as undeniably loved his glass
                  better.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXV.
               MY CREED.
               
                  
                     "It is not for me to stipulate for creeds."
                  
               
               
                  
                     "By giving others many goods, to his own cost and hinderance."
                  
               
               I AM Orthodox!—always have been—through thick and thin!
               I believe in the Lord.
               He looketh from heaven upon the children of men; and—in His high Omniscience—can
                  determine to a dead certainty who among them needeth discipline.
               He looked down. He saw me. He did not hesitate to put on the screws.
               With Gustave, domestic life began slightly to pall.
               Young men, the least bit fast—under one
                  pretense and another—were from time to time introduced into our circle, to give it
                  a little more zest.
               In spite of my remonstrance, they gradually obtained a hold upon my too yielding
                  husband; and occasionally he accepted an invitation out
               Their influence began to tell. Business was neglected. His attentions to me
                  assumed a little less of the lover-like.
               About this time I lost heavily through the unforeseen, and as it affected me,
                  dishonorable failure of parties with whom, during my widowhood, I had intrusted
                  considerable property.
               Misfortune with some, works just the reverse of what might be expected, or of what
                  it ought!
               So ours, instead of retarding the evil, but brought it the more surely and rapidly
                  upon us.
               Gustave became more than ever addicted to the use of intoxicating drink; and in
                  his insane desire to drown trouble—attached himself to a set of associates—of the
                  "most approved brand," to lead a genial, impulsive young man to his utter
                  ruin.
               "Josh Billings!"—thou art a Prophet! "if one commences to go down
                  hill, everything is greased for that particular occasion!"
               About this time, also, was initiated the one—I correct myself—the two, great
                  financial errors of my life.
               "To raise the sinews of war, "I placed myself in the power of a Loan Office;
                  no—not a Loan Office—a Vampire; who sucked the very last drop of my heart's
                  blood—with all the unconcern of a fox—contemplating his savory morsel—the
                  bewildered chicken—he holds in his paws!"
               "To raise the sinews of war," I placed myself in the power of friends; obtaining
                  help here and there—hoped to stave off
                  impending disaster—and in time, by aid of said help, retrieve all.
               Delusive hope!
               To-day, rather should Executors take every dollar; the Sheriff every "household
                  god;" I—calmly gathering my garments, and emphasizing every note of 
                     "Shoo! Fly; don't bother me"—
                   would walk into the most comfortable Poor House I could find—take the best
                  room the law allowed—and, 
                     
                        "Folding the drapery of my couch about me,
                        Lie down to pleasant dreams."
                     
                  
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               BOSTON'S FEMALE BROKER.
               
                  
                     "Until for surface sweetness, thou too art drawn adown the vortex."
                  
               
               PEOPLE said I was smart! I was: a little too smart: so I "pitched in"—to
                  speculation!
               I didn't walk in—nor run in—I pitched in; and came down head first,
                  in which interesting position I have been ever since.
               Permit me to explain.
               Bewailing my losses, it flashed over me one day that by furnishing and sub-letting
                  dwellings, I might do a pretty good thing.
               Besides—I was anxious to become—a broker! a female broker!! BOSTON'S
                  FEMALE BROKER!
               
               With gain and ambition in view, I proceeded to hire a couple of houses at either
                  end of a well known street; so that—whatever custom the one failed to get going
                  up—the other could catch coming down.
               I was fortunate in persons to run the same; and plumed myself no little on my
                  sharp arrangements; was particular—that whatever leases I took should secure me
                  from all loss; and was equally careful—in those I gave.
               Of course I charged a stiff price; wasn't that the most important
                  part of the business?
               Making up my mind not to bother; not to see, in fact, my tenants; only as from
                  time to time I collected my rent, I sailed off in rather an airy frame of
                  mind.
               All went well. I began to be encouraged.
               From the house at the "upper end" I received my first month's pay.
               That was square; but I guess it took all the poor woman could rake and scrape; for
                  when I called at the end of the next month—she had gone 
                     "Where the Woodbine twineth."
                   The house had changed hands three times; and each lot had set up housekeeping
                  on their "own hook," well supplied with my furniture, beds and bedding!
               It then occurred to me, it would pay to look after furnished houses oftener than
                  once a month.
               "But I had still a "forlorn hope." The person at the "lower end;" no sooner had
                  she taken possession, however, than the furnace, which had faithfully done duty
                  any number of years, gave out.
               Generously, I immediately put a new one in its place at my own expense—privately
                  thinking all the while—my landlord should foot that little bill.
               I had reckoned without my host. 
                     "Not for Joe! O, no, no!"
                  
                   nor for me; and it took
                  precisely the money I had received from the other house to set this one going!
               So it went on. If those two houses had been sworn partners, they could not have
                  played better into each other's hands.
               "Paul paid Peter"; and "Peter paid Paul"; until there was nothing left to pay
                  either "Peter" or "Paul"!
               Distracted, I threw them both on to the market!
               Napoleon, after his disasters, gathered himself and risked his final throw upon
                  Waterloo.
               The "Oakes Ames Co." suspended; but with shovel in hand, have resumed their
                  digging.
               I too, was on my mettle!
               It was still my determination speculate; in Howard—not State Street. I have been
                  told there is a difference; do not confound them—Howard Street—if you
                  please!
               I outdid myself; and with unusual sagacity selected a house completely out of
                  order from top to bottom.
               We commenced this time at the top.
               In dull times, set workmen to repair and there is no knowing where they will end.
                  I have consulted competent judges, and they tell me there is not a tighter roof in
                  all Boston.
               An underpinning is considered desirable. That was attended to.
               The first person after the premises was an Irishwoman, of the better class; who
                  was all ready to come right in with a large family of boarders, about sixty I
                  think; hard-working men; who must have their meals three times a day; at just such
                  an hour; to the minute.
               The range would not go! I saw it myself; not a potato could be coaxed to bake, not
                  a sausage to fry; and right before the face and eyes of those sixty hungry wretches, waiting for their dinner, the
                  old thing was marched off, and a new stove set up!
               Outside repairs, mine. Inside, hers.
               Poor soul! the expense came hard on her the first month; and as she
                  didn't say anything about the rent, I couldn't find it in my heart to
                  mention it.
               I let it slip!
               The second and third month it slipped!
               I slipped, too!
               But at the end of the fourth month, I had the satisfaction of slipping her—bag and
                  baggage—stove and boarders—on to the sidewalk!
               My investments were exciting, if not profitable.
               The "real estate" business was getting red-hot!
               I longed for the wilderness; for some far-off, lone isle.
               I would have married Robinson Crusoe on the spot.
               No such relief was at hand; and walking right through the ingenious theories of
                  Lucy Stone—Susan B Anthony—and Antoinette Brown—I precipitately retired; not with
                  "honors thick about me, "but with dishonored notes so filling the air, I couldn't
                  see my way home.
               Never again shall the "Siren Song" of "Female Ability" induce me to
                  run with my brother financier—as rival contestant for the prize—money.
               No! Leaving him legitimately to make—I will agree, quite as fast, in the most
                  lady-like manner—to spend it!
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXVII.
               OLLA PODRIDA.
               
                  
                     "Many thoughts, many thoughts—who can catch them all?"
                  
               
               MATTERS now began to look dark indeed. Everything I touched went under. However
                  much advice and acute judgment were brought to bear, each investment fell
                  through.
               With the same implicit faith I put in the words of Mr. "Billings," do I believe
                  GREASE—at that period—entered largely into my own composition; or I
                  never could, in every case, have gone down so rapidly and—so slick!
               
               A change became absolutely necessary. We could remain no longer in R—— Street.
                  Debts increased every day; credit grew "beautifully less"; Gustave's dissipated
                  habits more confirmed. Friends turned the cold shoulder with the cheerful remark,
                  "I told you so!"—and under these exhilarating circumstances—I made another
                  move.
               My Evil Genius, never for one moment caught napping, led me into N—— street.
               What could I do in N—— Street?
               I looked around. My situation was desperate. I recalled with distrust the horrible
                  old house in Howard Street; the furnished house in Harrison Avenue; the
                  lodging-house in Washington Street; and concluded in N—— Street, by way of
                  variety, to start a boarding-house.
               I had been in New York—and came home determined to engraft the best qualities of
                     those dashing institutions—upon the milder outcroppings of the
                  same here.
               Now you may advertise until the "Herald" retires, rich upon the profit of your
                  investment, and not fill your house.
               
               I just did this; wrote in a fine, lady-like hand "Furnished Rooms to let"—"Table
                  Boarders wanted"—and genteelly pasted the notice outside my door.
               There is fashion in the width; two inches there; four inches here. In reckless
                  expenditure of paper, Boston goes New York double!
               My table rapidly filled up.
               It did me good to look upon that long line of thin forms, rounding each day at my
                  expense.
               Little did I think I was filling up a set of half-starved boarders—who, as soon as
                  they got a streak of fat—would make for more aristocratic quarters.
               It is one peculiarity of this business. All new boarding-houses go through the
                  same ordeal. I have changed locality five times—and know!
               Now—I am posted; the minute I clap my eyes on an "applicant," I can tell how much
                  he will hold—to a biscuit!
               I had partaken of so much HASH myself, that when I first commenced, I couldn't
                  find it in my heart to offer it to a stranger.
               I call upon you—O, my boarders!—first and last, seventy-five in number; from your
                  scattered homes, answer me! Did I oftener than seven times a week set before you,
                  in its decent proportions of meat and potato, that much abused dish?
               Be genteel or die! I followed this to the letter; so of
                  course—gentlemen—"only!"
               Whoever heard of a genteel boarding-house harboring women?
               Young ladies are "fuss and feathers;" and married ladies—well!—"Don't you think my
                  dear there is a falling off in Miss Jones' table?—hadn't we better be looking
                  out?"
               Give me men! I say it boldly; you can impose upon them; you can't
                  upon women!
               How some boarders entwine themselves
                  around the affections! Parting, is like taking your heart's blood; and leaving
                  behind them a blank, they go; bearing that most sacred of trusts, an unpaid board
                  bill; with butter at fifty cents the pound!
               Mine have "entwined," often. Here is a case in point.
               I once lodged and fed a party of "Professionals." It seems but as yesterday.
                  Didn't they make times lively? Their names are engraven on my heart—and on my
                  slate—for three left, owing me thirty-six dollars!
               The fourth! Let me do him exact justice.
               From the fashionable time in the morning—when, alone, he ate his aristocratic
                  breakfast of one egg and a slice of toast—all through the day; up to the hour of
                  hiding his handsome face under a "mask of color;" and with his witticisms throwing
                  the "house" into convulsions; he was a perfect gentleman.
               Pleasant to all; prompt to pay; a very small eater; he was indeed a model boarder.
                  But—by that eternal law of compensation following a landlady the world over—the
                  man who sat next him, ate his weight three times a day!
               I have hinted that my domestic education had been somewhat
                  neglected.
               Still, I knew a thing or two—and what I did know—I never intrusted to
                  others.
               It became necessary to transfer the feathers from an old bed, to a new.
               Waiting for a rainy day, that I might be secure from the interruption of calls, I
                  shut myself up in a small room with my two ticks.
               Mother had told me it was a good plan to leave part of each open—and inserting one
                  into the other—gently force the feathers from the old to the new.
               I was not to be trammeled with any such half-way idea!
               
               I ripped open one entire end, and boldly emptied the feathers.
               Whew! I was in for it!
               Nothing daunted, with both hands I went to work. The day passed on. The job was
                  finished. But myself!—
               From the crown of my head to the sole of my foot—feathers!
               
               Eyes, nose, mouth, ears, hair, eyebrows—feathers!
               
               Like Nebuchadnezzar, I emerged: thankful for the next three months—to go to
                  grass!
               Gentility said, colored help! I submitted. My prime minister, Samuel
                  Adams, was as black as the Ace of Spades.
               Like all prime ministers, he ruled. I was a mere puppet—useful on Saturday
                  nights—to "pay off."
               He would notify me when he intended to go out "perzactly;" but failed to "put in
                  an appearance" when expected home.
               He was musical—no matter what was up—negro melodies came "in at the death!"
               He had a girl—more than that—he had a new suit of clothes. One night he took his
                  girl and his clothes to a concert. Light pants and vest; dark coat, to match his
                  skin; sleeve-buttons, he sent for me to put them in; and may I never see a
                  rosebud, if he didn't have one in his buttonhole!
               During his engagement at the Howard Athenæum I boarded Pfau, the Russian
                  gymnast.
               It was Sam's ambition to rival him.
               Awakened one morning by a shuffling sound, I stole softly down. He had arranged
                  his apparatus—consisting of a rope swung in the wood-shed—and I caught him in the
                  very act of making his fearful leap, from the top stair of the back steps to the
                  hen-coop!
               
               If he had missed his footing, he would have fallen just three feet, four
                  inches.
               In the matter of food he was fastidious. Eggs he couldn't bear the sight of—I had
                  nine hens and one rooster—and I never saw an egg while Sam was in the house!
               But the milk! that corn he acknowledged; and if he couldn't go out as
                     wet nurse, it was not because he had NO MILK!
               One colored brother will do, but five! My kitchen was the "blackness of darkness."
                  I couldn't see through it!
               The next experiment was not much more satisfactory. All white, to be sure; that
                  was something in the way of looks! I felt too, that somehow the dinner would come
                  on to the table; but at what a sacrifice of the "raw material." And "back-door
                  friends" was a disagreeable feature—necessitating the appointment of a "Vigilance
                  Committee"—if the saving of cold victuals was any object.
               But trying to mingle the Hibernian and African in the way of help—I am free to
                  confess—was the most unmitigated failure of all
               They were set like a flint against each other. In attempting to elicit one spark
                  of united assistance, I only set fire to myself.
               "Gentlemen! I put the question!" Can the mistress of a boarding house know
                  anything outside her kitchen? Above all—can she be expected to improve her mind?
                  to read?—dear me! one eye on the sugar and the other on the spoons, where 's her
                  chance?
               Descending from the literary stand-point, I suppose there is no
                  gainsaying that some houses, in spite the hindrances, do succeed; and the
                  landladies thereof—rising, Phœnix-like, above the perplexity of help; the
                  inconvenience of loss; smiling and popular—wear pink ribbons!
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXVIII.
               PANDEMONIUM.
               
                  
                     
                        "How have I sinned that this affliction
                        Should light so heavy on me?"
                     
                     
                        "In the scene that ensued
                        I did not take a hand."
                     
                  
               
               I HAD discovered pink was not my color.
               I always wore black; and in mourning, would prefer to drop the curtain; leave to
                  imagination the "after-piece;" but inexorable Truth compels me to go on.
               Our house was large; the expense of furnishing had been heavy. The locality too,
                  was unfortunate; still, at first, as I have said, there appeared to be no
                  difficulty in getting boarders, hungry table boarders; and I flatter myself that
                  alone, I could have made this last experiment pay.
               But alone, I was not suffered to engineer.
               A candle, about to expire, flares up with unexpected brilliancy.
               Curiously enough this original metaphor, coupled with the equally original "saw;"
                  "What is sauce for a goose, is sauce for a gander;" will admirably apply to me,
                  the goose; and to Gustave, the gander.
               I was about to expire financially—(pity I hadn't sooner!)—and collected myself for
                  a last flicker.
               Gustave was about to wind up his dissipated term, and gathered his forces for a
                  last "free blow."
               To that end—he established a BAR!— though I went down on my knees to beg off from
                     that.
               
               I found it took ready money to get in a stock of liquors.
               Dealers in the infernal stuff know their power; and whatever other bills are
                  dishonored; theirs are paid at sight.
               
               
                  Their books, to the interest of their plethoric pockets, present
                  accounts well posted and paid up.
               Smarting under this fact, I am happy in the thought, that one day there will be
                  thrust before their astonished eyes a private memoranda, that will require all
                  their wits to settle; though assisted by Satan himself—head bookkeeper—LOCATED
                  THERE!
               The bar went on—ignored by the better class of my boarders—who soon ignored the
                  house, also.
               But many, young and inexperienced, attracted by the cheerful, well-lighted room,
                  found their way thither; and far into the night the rattling of dice, and the
                  uncorking of bottles, fell upon my listening ear.
               Did I say Jealousy, as a bane to domestic peace, stands
                  unrivaled?
               I retract!
               My views are liberal. I believe in good hard-shell Baptists; and in good
                  Hottentots. I believe good may result from the awful crime of murder; and that
                  good may come of the African slave-trade.
               But, accursed liquor! in thee there is NO good. Emanating from
                  hell—through and through, from top to bottom—thou art one, unmitigated Evil!
               By love of thee; the most gifted—become driveling. The most genial—morose. The
                  most loving—demoniac.
               To unhallowed thirst for thee; accursed liquor! God, wife, children, friends,
                  home, clothes, food, self-respect and life, all are sacrificed; and underneath the
                  ceaseless roll of thy wheels, O, thrice accursed liquor! more are crushed than
                  ever fell before the triumphal car of the Indian Juggernaut!
               Why, upon me and mine, had descended the fell destroyer?
               From infancy, I had abominated this foul outcropping of total depravity.
               
               My father before me, had lost thousands because of not offering, at a dinner party
                  on board his ship, the hateful thing, to a person addicted to its use, who never
                  forgave the slight!
               But come it did, with all its attendant train of degrading humiliations.
               To the theatrical profession I am indebted for many pleasant hours.
               I am an extravagant admirer of the "Legitimate Drama;" and in my palmy days, was a
                  liberal patron of the same.
               But geologically speaking there is a lower strata; and that found its
                  way to Gustave's "free blow."
               It must have been a hungry strata; for each day, to the music of the
                  bell, a string of those Bohemians formed themselves in order of march from the
                  "bar" to my dinnertable; led off by that prince of dead-heads—Monsieur Antoine
                  Tournais—who had managed to fasten himself upon Gustave with all the tenacity of a
                  drowning man.
               "Entre nous," it is my private opinion he would
                  have been drowned long ago, only he was so thoroughly soaked with brandy, there
                  was no room for water!
               In return for Gustave's hospitality, he volunteered to distribute some advertising
                  bills.
               I do not know whether he had a shirt to his back, but I do know he
                  had a pair of white gloves; with which, and his eternal "pardonnez madame" he electrified the female help Who answered, as he
                  went from door to door, his aristocratic ring.
               I certainly consider that man, with his slippers and white stockings, and a
                  monkey, borrowed a few days to lend additional style, at once the disgrace and
                  ornament of this MODEL bar!
               
               "Requiescat in pace." I hope his friends have
                  found a use for that epitaph, and that—poor fellow—he is indeed at rest.
               
               I am now speaking of Monsieur Antoine Tournais, not of his friend, the monkey!
               All housekeepers know that cooks like a cup of that which "cheers, but not
                  inebriates;" and like it strong too
               
                  My cooks reversed Cowper's apologetic idea; and absolutely required a
                  cup of that which, however much it "inebriated" them, failed to "cheer" me.
               We had dinner, as Sam said, "perzactly" at twelve o'clock.
               One day, during the black and white episode, about half-past eleven, my pastry
                  cook—white—took herself and her inebriating facilities bodily out of the house;
                  and I have not laid eyes on her since; when she knew that my meat cook—black—was
                  up in her attic on a three days' drunk! 
                     
                        "But the hands that were played
                        By that heathen Chinee,
                        And the points that were made
                        Were quite frightful to see."
                     
                  
               
               The wind is tempered to the shorn lamb—or the shorn lamb is tempered to the
                  wind—as I am not quoting Scripture, I forget which.
               
                  N'importe.
               
               There never was a shorn lamb born, that could walk up to the wind I had to face;
                  and there never was a wind blew, that my temperature was not put to its test!
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIX.
               INFERNO.
               
                  
                     
                        "And so he drinks the more and damns himself—
                        Then drinks again, and sleeps and wakes and raves."
                     
                     
                        "Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech,
                        That I dwell in the tents of Kedar!"
                     
                  
               
               A RUSH from the bed to the door—and "Sam!" uttered in stentorian voice—rings
                  through the house!
               Sam appears; goes to the chimney-piece; takes there from an empty bottle;
                  disappears; and returns it filled to the same place.
               This-scene has been repeated many times, every day, for one week. If I told the
                  truth, I should say three.
               Gustave, not to mince the matter, is on a drunk.
               Will he ever be on anything else?
               I have misused the word. You cannot get him drunk.
               He is on a drink; and he will challenge you to that, until you
                  drop.
               The pure juice of the grape, I have no doubt, is a very delectable article.
               When freely used, even in remote ages, it no further "set up" Noah; than to make
                  him father the sons of. Ham! No further "set up" the rather
                  an-eye-to-the-main-chance, young man, Lot; than to bring out his harmless joke,
                  that his old, salt wife had no objection to his taking to his bosom a young, fresh
                  one! No further "set up" Abraham's wife, Sarai; than to make her tell two
                  outrageous lies; and beat Hagar almost to death into the bargain!
               The pure juice of the grape nowadays, is grown in hell; and whosoever imbibes the
                  brimstone mixture there pressed, goes
                  through a series of antics initiated in that hot clime.
               Thus, with Gustave.
               To this day I am in doubt, and cannot pronounce, whether I prefer the phase of the
                  driveling, tear-shedding, maudlin, hard drinker; or the free-fight,
                  knock-down-and-drag-out development!
               I ought to be a judge. My brother was the one; my husband the other.
               With the first, my life was safe; but the experience—sickeningly enervating.
               With the last, my life was in danger; but the experience—inspiringly exciting.
               Upon the cat-love-the-mouse principle, Gustave always insisted having me in sight
                  when a "spree" was on him; and his "insist," I could not dodge.
               After drinking, tossing, and tumbling; tumbling, tossing, and drinking, until
                  apparently exhausted; he had fallen into an uneasy, fitful slumber.
               All was quiet.
               By and by he slightly stirred. Pitying, I approached to bathe his head; and softly
                  laid my cool hand upon his burning forehead.
               Quicker than thought he dashed it from him.
               "Away with your damn'd hand! Never you dare, vile woman, to touch me again!"
               "But, Gustave! it is me, your wife."
               "Damnation! you are no wife of mine. Go finish your talk with Mr. F——. You can't
                  deceive me, try your best; what I see, I know. My eye is upon you—my
                  fine bird—and this time you won't escape!"
               "Gustave! I have not spoken one word to Mr. F—— for"—
               "Go to hell! I wouldn't take your Bible oath that you haven't made arrangements to
                  go off together. You man seducer! Don't you attempt to fool me; but if it costs me
                  my life, I 'II cut short your little game!"
               
               I saw what was coming, in the jealous frenzy to which he had now wrought himself,
                  and sprang for the door.
               He was there before me. He had locked it; and holding the key at arm's length,
                  brandished it triumphantly over my head.
               How handsome he was in his mad wrath!
               So looked "Lucifer," "Son of the Morning;" when, fallen, he announced in solemn
                  conclave, his choice to 
                     "Reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven."
                  
               
               "You thought you would go for your lover, did you? Perhaps you will, when I am
                  dead; but that won't be till I've finished you. I'll not leave you,
                  with your paramour, to gloat over my ruin. If it hadn't been for you,
                  devilish deceiver! I should never have drank a drop. You have driven me to it; and
                  now I'll pour down the cursed stuff till I'm mad, ha! ha!"
               "Gustave! Gustave! in mercy to yourself"—
               "Don't 'Gustave' me! To you, Madame, I am Monsieur Chaudet. Running
                  away from me, were you? that won't pay; look here! my beauty!"
               And dragging me before the mirror; that I might see, as well as feel; he pressed
                  both hands tightly over my mouth and nose.
               I could not breathe. I was suffocating. I gave one despairing glance; my face was
                  purple; my eyes were starting from their sockets—
               God in Heaven! mine hour had come!
               Swifter than the passage of light the prayer, "FORSAKE ME NOT," went up, with the
                  faith of the dying, into the very ear of the Omnipresent; and brought down instant
                  relief.
               The hands relaxed their hold—and I was again numbered with the living!
               "Gustave! Gustave! you would kill me with your own hand,!"
               
               "Kill you, my darling, precious wife! I'd like to find myself—or any
                  other person—laying the weight of their finger upon you."
               Was the man in his senses?
               Didn't he know that Murder had almost branded his soul?
               "Gustave! dear Gustave! I implore you to lie down. You need rest. Let me open the
                  door? I must go out from here, indeed I must!"
               "Indeed you mustn't; and by Heaven! you won't. Going after your Mr. F——, were you?
                  Hell and damnation! The handsomest man in State Street, eh!—'How is that for
                  high?' My memory is good"—
               "O, Gustave! give me that key?"
               "Damn you! sit down in that chair; and if you value your life, don't move."
               "O! but I am nearly dead. I MUST have air;"—and mortal fright overcoming my dread
                  of him, I shrieked for "help! help!"
               "Didn't I tell you not to move? Damn your soul to hell! take that"—and a BLOW,
                  heavy and unerring, descended upon my devoted head.
               White, as the sheeted dead, I faced my foe.
               Thus far, only Fear had influenced me; but now, every passion was let
                  loose.
               
                  Sorrow, Pity, Love, Hatred; and high over all revenge; a
                  burning thirst for REVENGE, upon the infatuated, lost Gustave.
               Had my strength equaled my will, the powdered dust of his "mother earth" would
                  never have recognized her own!
               Had I held the thunderbolts of Jove!
               A man, younger than myself!
               A man, for whom I had sacrificed so much!
               A man, to strike me, a woman!
               
                  Me, his wife!
               
                  Me, in whose veins coursed the blood of five hundred aristocrats! but
                  every drop of which was now like molten lead.
               
               My whole being was in arms!
               Single-handed I could have fought Satan.
               I had not only Satan, but for the time being, his prime minister, Gustave.
               It was two to one!
               Benumbed alike, with the blow upon my head; and with the blow upon my heart;
                  living—I sank to the floor—as one that was dead.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXX.
               THE HEGIRA.
               
                  
                     "So I saw despondency was death, and flung my burdens from me"
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        "They were so queer, so very queer,
                        I laughed as I would die."
                     
                  
               
               MEANTIME— 
                     "'Midst the wreck of matter, and the crush of worlds"—
                   I held on to my reason. Poor me! It was about all I had to hold on
                     to; except—my Saratoga trunk!
               
                  That I packed; and one Sunday, secretly left in the evening train for
                  New York; leaving my planet, "without let or hindrance," to roll on, or go to
                  smash, amid her sister spheres.
               It is the evening of the day I arrived; bright and cool.
               
               I really feel the need of recreation; and putting aside "Cooper Institute"
                  facilities—"Shakespearian Readings"—"Operatic Librettos"—I am going to the Circus:
                  the New York, Fourteenth Street, Circus.
               I want to hear "Williams" sing; see "Stickney" ride; exercise my mind over "Billy
                  Button;" as he tumbles into the ring; scrabbles on to his horse; throws off
                  coats—vests—pants—boots—and appears before my dilating eyes—a first-class
                  rider—radiant in scarlet and gold!
               I am on my way! Want to know how I look? dark green, poplin dress; black velvet
                  sack; with one geranium leaf—one tuberose—one verbena—stuck in the
                  button-hole.
               That bouquet is stereotyped. No one ever saw me at the Fourteenth Street Circus
                  without it.
               I anticipate the cheerful salutation and exclaim, "We are all here; hope
                     you are well, Mr. Clown!"
               The Band strikes up. I am ears and eyes.
               Here they come; in the systematic confusion of the "Grand
                     Entrée."
               Gallant men; fair women; gayly caparisoned horses; true to your paces in the mazy
                  intricacies of the sprightly waltz.
               The "glamour" over, I pick my Knight.
               Pale face—fair hair—slight, muscular figure—long limbs—(he will use all their
                  length by and by in his famous "Four in Hand;") showing beneath the Andalusian
                  mantle an occasional glimpse of his colors—blue and fawn; and his horse?—light—but
                  "with very little of the Arabian—my dear sir!"—give you his picture.
               What have we here? "Plantation Bitters," with two crosses—XX—kicked about in this
                  shape? regardless of cost; and always upwards?—never a fall; give the law of
                  gravitation a chance, and send these Bitters after it. O, the barrels are
                     empty? all right!—go ahead!—but do
                  Mr. "Levantine" make one mistake; or I shall think you hail from
                  "Tartarus;" and for morning pastime have taken a foot practice with"
                  Beelzebub!"
               "Whoa, January!"—Will that man and his establishment be the death of
                  me? Shall I have a chance at another meal?
               If I was a boy!—if I was a darkey! if I was only anything, that could
                  spread right out, and scream!
               "Whoa, January!" you are "Whoad" with a vengeance; and to start
                  either wagon, nag, or driver, is beyond all save the Pony, that opportunely comes
                  to the rescue, and backs the precious trio out
                  of sight.
               The music changes.—
               Here you are my little lady! with your brief, gossamer skirts.
               That is right; make your courtesy to the expectant crowd.
               I kiss you my hand!
               The "ring master" awaits your dainty foot. Spring lightly to your saddle; not
                  that—"as to the manor born"—spring lightly to the bare back of your
                  impatient steed.
               Away! white robe—pink shoulder knots—trailing flowers—in the rapid whirl—are but
                  as the changes of a Kaleidoscope.
               Away! right through the twelve hoops, placed to stay your flight.
               Bravo! you have well won the tumultuous applause.
               Bravo! again. With thoughts intent upon that "Aërial Feat"—there is no one I
                  should so like to be this night—as "Madame Carolène
                  Roland!"
               Hurra! for the "Blue and Fawn;" as—with the rush of the wind—" Stickney's" "Four
                  in Hand" sweeps past; guided by his, masterly skill.
               From my distant seat I catch his "allez!" hissed
                  between his teeth; and instantly recognizing ognizing the voice his coursers quicken—if
                  possible—their already lightning speed.
               Now, gathering his reins—the panting "four" are side by side—and over all hovers
                  the graceful form of the daring rider!
               Now, throwing up his reins—and lightly balancing himself upon one foot on the
                  "leader "—the loosened "four" dash wildly around the arena. 
                     
                        "One stormy gust of long suspended ahs!
                        One whirlwind chaos of insane hurras!"
                     
                  
               
               But "au revoir." I will put my
                  "verbena"—my"tuberose"—my "geranium leaf" into water—and come again to-mor-row
                  night.
               Being somewhat acquainted, I had gone directly to the hospitable house of a
                  quondam landlady.
               I found her neatly arrayed in a brown silk; narrow pink ribbons floating from her
                  stylish head-dress; and a rich, pink bow, of most approved dimensions, at her
                  throat.
               Noticing my mourning, but relieved to learn that none of my immediate friends were
                  dead, she entered into friendly talk; and suggested, for our mutual enjoyment,
                  several little excursions.
               Remember! I had two distinct natures; and that "fair play is a jewel."
               The gloomy and sad had been indulged long enough; if I expected to preserve the
                  balance of power—or more truthfully speaking—the balance of reason; so I fell in
                  with her plans.
               With my dressy friend—and the joyous half of my "personelle"—I had, for the next ten days, a right down good
                  time.
               I would not think of home—positive "Nemesis" would be on my track only too
                  soon—and my flight avenged!
               We often rode round "Central Park"—twenty-five cents apiece for the whole
                  distance—thanks to the new arrangement.
               
               We often sailed down to "Staten Island"—ten cents each way—and in this rational,
                  economical mode, passed many a happy day. 
                     
                        "On old Long Island's sea-girt shore,
                        Many an hour I've whiled away;
                        Listening to the breakers' roar,
                        That wash the beach at Rockaway."
                     
                  
               
               There came a telegram. They were sick.
               
                  Who was sick, I wondered?
               That afternoon, in the most unconcerned manner, I took another turn at "Central
                  Park."
               There came a second telegram. They were very sick.
               
                  Who was very sick, I wondered?
               That day I steamed down to "Staten Island," in a perfectly tranquil state of
                  mind.
               When I had "touched bottom"—it occupied me longer than it did "Gail Hamilton" (for
                  my own convenience), I turned my face homewards.
               The BAR had disappeared. Carpet and furniture had converted it into a
                  comfortable-sitting room.
               The two large parlors made one grand dining-room; where waiters by the score,
                  flying round like mad, were serving customers at forty cents a head!
               Without an allusion to the past, I was humbly requested, as Cashier, to step into
                  that exciting establishment—known in Boston—as the "Narragansett House."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXI.
               THE GRAND FINALE.
               
                  
                     "I cannot add—I will not steal; enough, for all is spoken."
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        "For the things
                        Concerning me have an end."
                     
                  
               
               IT was Gustave who was sick. It was Gustave who was very sick; of his liquor—of
                  his bar—of HIMSELF!
               I trace the incipient, embryo purpose of reformation to my strategetic
                  "Hegira."
               My influence again somewhat reinstated, I set myself steadily to reform many
                  abuses; dismissed a gang of "Cormorants" in the shape of "hangers on" and "help;"
                  retrenched in every way; looked right sharp after affairs; and if Gustave had even
                  now taken a complete turn round, we might, after all our mishaps, have in a
                  measure saved ourselves.
               But he was a boon companion, and could not be spared from his set.
               He was generous; and fell into the too common error of being so at other peoples'
                  expense so that, the little I had left—dwindled to less; and it became evident
                  everything must go.
               I will be just to him, though I implicate myself.
               If from the first I had been more decided—held to my "rights"—a good deal of
                  subsequent "unpleasantness" might have been avoided; but I was naturally
                  confiding, and hard experience alone, will remove that weakness.
               He who begins by trusting everybody, ends by trusting none!
               If ever, in the flesh, I do get hold of a cent—well!—"nous
                     verrons"
               I was now in the condition of "Micaw-ber," waiting for "something to turn up."
               
               Unlike that renowned man, I was not disappointed.
               Something did "turn up"—
               A KEEPER was put in; with strict orders not to leave the premises without the
                  money in his pocket! 
                     
                        "Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my
                           bread, hath lifted up his heel against me."
                     
                     —Psalms xli. 9.
                  
               
               For the benefit of those who have never had such companionship foisted upon
                  them—let me state; that the security of a respectable Toad, under a harrow, is
                  Elysian compared with it.
               Lynx-eyed, sitting where he could command "the situation," not one thing escaped
                  his notice.
               I drank my very tea in fear and trembling, lest there should be a "slip between
                  the cup and my lip."
               Miraculously disposing of that "Incubus," I rushed to our principal creditor, and
                  begged him, for the love of Heaven, to come down and put such an attachment on the
                  place, as would wind up that, myself, and everybody concerned.
               This he did; and in an inconceivably short space of time—considering the number of
                  articles to be touched by the magic wand of going! going!
                  GONE!—everything I owned in the world, for the second time, under the hammer of a
                  voluble auctioneer, was knocked down to the highest bidder!
               I actually felt relieved.
               I had reached the last round of the ladder; but one more step and I should kiss my
                  "mother earth."
               That spectacle was in reserve.
               Not being "woman's rights," I never made a public speech.
               Going back eighteen months, I wish I could assemble every individual I owe in this
                  wide world, and say unto them—
               
               "Gentlemen!—I am a woman; and as such, have the meanest possible opinion of my
                  capacity to transact business.
               "My mother erred; in that, she did not learn me to cook. 
                     
                        "'The devil finds some mischief still
                        For idle hands to do.'
                     
                  
               
               "If I had been a good cook, I should not have been a poor financier.
               "You are the victims of her unfortunate mistake.
               "I owe you collectively a good deal of money. I have not one cent wherewith to
                  repay.
               "I throw myself upon your mercy.
               "I am going to New York to hide my humiliating defeat—and am indebted to the
                  kindness of a friend—for a free pass thereto. Farewell."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXII.
               RESURGAM.
               
                  
                     "And all in sympathy with thee, tremble with tumultuous emotions."
                  
               
               THE broken-down of all nations congregate in New York.
               To that conglomerate centre I accordingly wended my ardent steps.
               I had now my "free pass"—and my clothes.
               The "pass" was taken up in my transit. My clothes I expected to meet on my
                  arrival.
               They were not there!
               I had sent them on in care of Gustave, who had preceded me. He had gone into
                  business, and had raised his share of the partnership money—upon them!
               
               The last round in the ladder slipped out; my feet flew up; I came down flat on my
                  back.
               I HAD NOTHING—
               Quite agreed with "Dick Swiveller" that an umbrella would be something; but my
                  umbrella was invested in—a Bleecker Street restaurant!
               Poor Gustave! He had hoped through successful custom to make good my loss, before
                  I discovered it.
               But the old, uncontrollable habit got the upper hand. His business, as usual,
                  proved a failure; and my best clothes still grace the shelves of a Prince Street
                  pawnbroker!
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIII.
               THE CANAL STREET PAWN SHOP.
               
                  
                     
                        "Which I wish to remark—
                        And my language is plain—
                        That for ways that are dark
                        And for tricks that are vain,
                        The heathen Chinee is peculiar.
                        Which the same I would rise to explain."
                     
                  
               
               THE account of Dr. Kane's explorations in the ice-bound region of the North is
                  interesting; because—it is true.
               The account of Dr. Livingstone's travels in the burning region of the South is
                  interesting; because—it is true.
               This chapter will be interesting; because—it is true.
               I had three choice articles of wearing apparel left.
               
               I was hungry. They must go to satisfy that hunger; and after shedding tears enough
                  over each separate piece to start a reasonable Niobe in a fair business, I set
                  out.
               What was the use of dodging so many corners? wearing myself to death trying to
                  deceive people?
               My landlady knew everything in that bundle just as well as I did. How suspiciously
                  she eyed me as I passed out; for all I took such good care to keep my plump figure
                  between IT and her.
               And the policeman on the corner; didn't he know just as well as I—who tied up the
                  things—that within the thick paper, so carefully done up, was my muff?—O! how I
                  have needed it this cold winter; my warm beaver sack?—and my pretty, point-lace
                  collar?—that I never looked at without recalling the black eyes of the coquettish
                  girl who sold it me in Montreal!
               "Forewarned, forearmed." I had an idea that "Cops" could see right through a
                  millstone; so was mighty careful to trip by him airy and indifferent,
                  specially to the package dangling by its strong string from my finger.
               I didn't stop to ask the way to Canal Street. No. I crossed over to a good looking
                  darkey—sunning himself and a cheap cigar on the sidewalk—and inquired.
               What was the matter? didn't anybody ever before carry a thick, brown, paper parcel
                  through Canal Street?
               The fellow had one of his African eyes on it all the time he was pointing out the
                  way!
               I'm near-sighted; where am I? O! here it is; the very place. Underground shop;
                  yes—door, part wood; top, glass; all the panes excepting one, painted white to
                  screen the customers; and that shows up in black letters, "Money to Loan!—on
                  Diamonds—Watches—Pianos."
               
               But I have not got any "Pianos—Watches—Diamonds:" what to do? I stand
                  irresolute.
               A small, sharp-eyed man spied me, and hurrying up said, "What can we do for you
                  marm, this morning?"—all the while taking in the dimensions of my budget; and I
                  will wager my sapphire ring, now in the hands of Mr. A—— as security, that he knew
                  exactly what was inside, and had already made up his mind precisely how much to
                  advance on the lot!
               Hiding my confusion, I gave elaborate reasons for troubling so courteous a
                  gentleman as himself, with the trifling affair. But, with many apologies, "the
                  fact was—I wished to surprise a friend with a gift—and being just a little short
                  of funds—and having read his advertisement in the "Herald"—I had taken the liberty
                  to bring with me a few things; which, if he would be so obliging as to examine—and
                  could be so kind as to give me some money upon—I should esteem it a very great
                  favor—and would throw all the custom in his way I possibly could—ever after."
               "O! with pleasure, marm." Should he look at them?
               I wonder the "things" were not turned into salt by the abominable lie I had
                  manufactured; for, if he hadn't taken them, my "friend" would not
                  have lost a gift, but I should have gone supperless to bed; which, as I had not
                  yet seen my dinner, "n'y pensons pas!"
               "And what, marm, may you want on this collar?"
               "Well! it cost me fifteen dollars; but I don't suppose you will allow more than
                  half that!"
               "Expect—me—to—allow—seven—dollars—fifty—cents—on—THAT!" exclaimed the Jew, holding
                  up the strip of lace two inches wide, fourteen inches long.
               
               "One dollar twenty-five cents is the very most; and we do that to accommodate
                     you, marm!"
               I thought of my muff—my sable muff; my sack—my beaver sack; and groaned in
                  spirit.
               The man caught the echo of the groan; looked into my face; and "set on edge" with
                  desire to make money, determined to drive a bargain.
               All I could get out of him for the muff, which cost me twenty dollars, was a
                  paltry two; all for the sack, which cost me forty dollars, was a paltry four; and
                  both nearly new.
               But I was the gainer in one way. I had no "transparency" to carry through the
                  street; and I went up Broadway, with seven dollars twenty-five cents in my pocket,
                  as lightly as though I had not got to pay, for the use of that bewildering amount,
                  at the end of one short month, fourteen dollars and fifty cents; besides running
                  the risk of never getting back into my possession the aforesaid "articles."
               I went home. I had my supper; and impulsively generous, invited Jane Matthews to
                  sup with me.
               We enjoyed it. Muffs, sacks, collars do eat well; and we had coffee,
                  too. That upon my weak stomach, rather "set me up."
               We played a two-handed game of Euchre in which, imitating that "heathen Chinee," I
                  made some "points;" naturally enough, having just swallowed my point-lace
                  collar!
               At ten we separated. At eleven I went to bed; or rather threw myself on the sofa
                  until my husband should come in.
               I slept. Attend to my dream—
               A good-sized dining-room; carpet green and red; showing up bright in the full
                  blaze of the gas. Gustave always would turn on that, regardless of the monthly
                     call of the Manhattan Gas Light Co.
                  The table set out—O! so nice—with its new dishes; and—I thought I saw a white
                  cloth? no—I thought I saw a great sheet of white paper? no—it is the "New York
                  Herald," all covered over with "Money to Loan!" "Money to Loan!" in letters a yard
                  long.
               But the fragrant odor of a well-cooked dinner comes stealing in at the open door;
                  through which too, enters my husband. I am so glad.
               The waiter sets down a large tureen right over the word "Money," leaving only "to
                  Loan" bristling all around.
               Is the money gone, and nothing left but the LOAN?
               I writhe in my sleep!
               For the oysters. Gustave lifts the cover; and poking about the dish, angrily
                  screams to the cook, "What is this mess?"
               "Just what mistress ordered, sir!—seasoned it the best I knew how, sir!—she would
                  have muff for dinner, with oyster sauce."
               "Yes—Gustave! my muff; they fare worse in Paris; eat away. It will digest quicker
                  and much easier than my piano; that was rosewood; and you are used to logwood, you
                  know! Pass me the end of that tassel, please, with a good deal of the gravy! Have
                  some coffee?"
               "Yes—milk it well; I will sugar myself. Are you crazy? Here's half
                  your collar in the bottom of my cup, and the other half in my throat. Who told
                  you, Bridget, to settle your coffee with lace collars?"
               "Nobody, sir! mistress said fry it for breakfast; but as I looked at you, coming
                  up the steps, sir, I thought may be, you would like it better
                  soaked."
               "You and your mistress go to hell! The next thing, we shall have her sack served
                  up for dinner."
               "To-morrow, sir! Got it roasting now; it is awful tough; won't be done clear through before your next meal. What kind of
                  vegetables?—whiskey, or point-lace?—Sir!"
               "My whiskey is point-lace, muff, beaver sack; but it is not for
                     you to fling it at me; take that—you officious fool! "bawled
                  Gustave; hurling tureen, muff, and all, after the flying cook.
               I awoke with a start—
               There was the green and red carpet, with the gas turned on to its full extent.
               There sat Gustave with those three pawn tickets, that had fallen from my pocket,
                  in one hand; and a boot, he had just pulled off to send after the first, in the
                  other.
               Tears were in his eyes. Conscience was at work.
               I thought it no more than fair it should work, though the leaven of it rose him
                  high as "Haman's gallows;" as—but for his impoverishing dissipation—I should now
                  have round me, my widely scattered comforts.
               My dream shadowed the truth.
               The demon, Drink, pollutes everything it touches!
               The demon, Drink, destroys everything that crosses its path!
               The demon, Drink, inaugurates a series of "dissolving views" startling to the
                  generally accepted, cohesive habits of "household gods!"
               While it is a law of Nature, that the less shall precede the greater; it is a law
                  of this Monster, that the "greater" shall precede the "less."
               The grand piano, that once occupied the whole side of a handsome room, has
                  dwindled to a printed slip, my finger can cover, labeled—"Loan Ticket No.
                  1009"—somewhat retrieving its in significance, in size; by its
                     significance, in import.
               Verily, the Greater hath preceded the Less; substituting Discord for
                  Harmony, in its unnatural priority!
               
               Tokens, endeared by associations and years of possession, are gobbled up by "The
                  Insatiable;" that spews out of his foul mouth in return, strips of yellow paper,
                  all looking one way.
               Bah! I could paste "Tammany Hall" from floor to ceiling, with the hateful
                  color!
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIV.
               BOOK AGENTS WANTED.
               
                  
                     "By cheerful wit and graphic tale, refreshing the harassed spirit"
                  
               
               "VIVE!" New York! Down with Brooklyn!
               This has not always been my war-cry. Time was, I sympathized with the "City of
                  Churches."
               But, let me tell—
               The boarding-house, and every other scheme, having signally failed, thereby
                  sinking my entire means; nothing less than starvation, staring me directly' in the
                  face, could have induced my next step.
               Pitying Shade! Guardian Angel! Wast thou asleep, when I answered the above
                  "want?"
               
               To break myself in, make myself "au fait" to the
                  business; I selected Brooklyn as the place; and a mongrel affair, half
                  receipts—half advertisements—as the base of, operation.
               Already I emulated the maid of "green gown" memory; and my eggs had bought, only
                  she knew, how much.
               Brooklyn was to hatch the chickens!
               So, decked in borrowed plumage, a black lace shawl carelessly thrown over me for
                  effect, hopes high, anticipations brilliant, to Brooklyn I went!
               To be explicit—
               My commission upon each number sold was to be ten cents.
               "En passant" the publisher had secured the
                  lion's share, and had taken his pay in advance.
               Behold me! a novice! and raw at that; with twenty-five pamphlets that had fallen
                  dead from the press, as my only capital, save—my tongue.
               I used that freely; and did more talking over those money-saving receipts, and
                  self-sacrificing advertisements, than would have set up the entire New York Bar,
                  in a first-class practice!
               Either, all "heads of families" in Brooklyn were "petrified," "à la Cardiff giant;" or, servants had received strict
                  orders to admit no vagrants.
               Only two American faces greeted my vision that blessed day.
               However, perseverance wins; and by dint of my sweetest smiles; my extremest
                  politeness; my shawl poetically arranged; I did sell, through the agency of these
                  same servants, six of my precious load.
               Sixty cents clear gain. Fifteen cents to be deducted for car fare.
               I indulged in no dinner; made that out of my New York landlady at
                  night.
               For three days, I continued thus. The miles of streets I walked; the acres of
                     steps I ascended: then—following the
                  example of the 
                     "King of France, with forty thousand men"—
                   descended; are they not forever memorialized in my failing limbs?
               Brooklyn! adieu! I shake thy dust off my feet!
               From thy sympathetic, Ferry-begirt area, I bore an exact profit of one dollar and
                  twenty-eight cents; and—an experience.
               But, turning, the El Dorado of the "agent" meets my longing gaze.
               Dirty! Noisy! Splendid!—New York! I salute you!
               No more worthless pamphlets. A genuine book, could alone satisfy my
                  aspirations.
               What should it be?
               Up and down the columns of the "New York Herald" mine eyes roved in eager
                  search.
               "Book Agents wanted!" met me at every turn.
               At length I hit upon just the thing. Volume nice; author well known; profit
                  good.
               With unquestioning faith, I entered the arena as "agent" for that
                  work.
               Recalling the past, I eschewed dwellings. Most women prefer ribbon to literature,
                  when it comes to actually paying for the same.
               I looked solely to places where men "most do congregate," for patronage.
               Pride, sensitiveness and—yes—delicacy too, must go by the board, if success is the
                  goal, in this calling.
               It won't do, to offer a book worth the money, and receive your dollar with the air
                  of a beggar soliciting alms!
               It won't do, to walk Broadway an hour before you can muster courage to offer your
                  book at all! I know.
               
               It won't do, to feel put down because
                  you chance to be the nineteenth, who has offered to sell, in that very place, that
                  very day, before dinner!
               No. Boldly approach, and assume to confer a favor.
               Come straight from your home to your customer.
               Bless you! it is the nineteenth woman who makes the trade.
               What matter, if they can buy to better advantage elsewhere? make them buy of
                     you.
               
               I am not "strong minded;" but I pity the men of nowadays. Alongside the women,
                  their chance is slim!
               "Bloody Mary" is said to have remarked, "that in death, 'Calais' would be found
                  printed upon her heart!"
               Not "Calais," but "Mexico," is imprinted in letters of fire upon my heart, and
                  head too!
               Every nerve, of an exhausted vitality, responds to the assertion that she is
                  indeed, our "Sister Republic."
               Had I roamed the "Halls of the Montezumas" republican at heart; and—immortal as
                  the "Wandering Jew"—walked down the Years, to that freed land of to-day; I could
                  not more persistently have laid before New York and Boston, this ephemeral
                  fact.
               Facing wind and weather; bearing 
                     "A Banner with this strange device,"
                  
               
               I passed on.
               I went into "Wall" Street with awe; into "Broad" Street with hope.
               Had not the fascination of the female element, thrown its charm and romance over
                  the "bread and butter business" of "stock brokerage?"
               I drew near.—
               Directly before me, in large letters upon the door, was this notice:
               "BEGGARS AND PEDDLERS NOT ADMITTED."
               
               Meekly I slipped in; passed a long row of industrious clerks; and entered—the
                  "Sanctum."
               The "Presidential Candidate" was flitting about, gracefully button-holing a very
                  good looking—I wonder who it could be?—brother financier.
               The soliciting partner, at lady-like ease, was softly humming, 
                     
                        "Will you walk into my parlor?
                        Said the spider to the fly."
                     
                  
               
               Seizing a favorable opportunity, I spoke to them of my errand.
               "Madame! responded the `Candidate,' if 'General Grant' and the 'Angel Gabriel'
                  indorsed your book, WE should not invest in 'Mexico!"
               Subsiding into my normal condition of "a worm of the dust," I crawled away.
               But I came from the "Grand Opera House," proud to show upon my Subscription tion
                  page the name of New York's, public-spirited, magnificent, "un bon vivant."
               I came from "Bunker Hill," glorying in names whose fathers fought, bled, and died
                  for Liberty!'
               Not having "nine children and one at the breast," I was thrown upon the bare
                  merits of the work; and I am free to say those merits have never failed me.
               I have had the pleasure and the honor, of introducing Colonel Albert S. Evans'
                  reliable, and very readable, production into many of our first families.
               Excuse my laughing! It is at this recollection.
               In Boston there dwells a bachelor; very rich, and—I will be charitable—very
                  close.
               Still, he had known me "egg and bird," and I was sure of my man.
               Confidently presenting to him my "Mexican" claim, he patronizingly patted me on
                  the shoulder, his face all of a yard long, and informed me, in sepulchral tones, that he had
                  just lost fifty thousand dollars; that he would be happy to buy some other
                  day!
               "Mexico" was at a discount; her budding hopes crushed out of sight by the
                  magnitude of this loss, which I considerately gave him four months to recover.
               The breezy, exhilarating zephyrs of March wafted me again in that direction.
               His face drawn to precisely the same angle; his shoulder pats precisely as
                  sympathetic; his voice precisely as hollow; he said he was now arranging his
                  business, and urged me to come by and by!
               Reckoning by years, it is time that man's affairs were settled.
               Reckoning by money, it is time that man was bled to the tune of one subscription
                  book, at least
               Imitating the euphonious harmony of the primer rhyme 
                     
                        "Zaccheus he
                        Did climb a tree"—
                     
                  
               
               I announce to thee, bachelor mine—— 
                     
                        "I shall call
                        In the fall."
                     
                  
               
               But as to the Biblical student there would be keen, though perhaps obscure,
                  satire, in the transposition of the lines; 
                     
                        "In the Fall
                        
                        I shall call."
                     
                  
               
               How this avocation sharpens the wits!
               As to the human countenance, it becomes so transparent that an "agent" must be
                  stupid indeed who cannot read as he runs.
               What variety too, in manner!
               Some, kind and generous; others, polite and mean; some, indifferent and morose;
                  and others, downright rude, with curses not "loud but deep," speed you on your
                  way.
               Seeking the first; shunning the last; I have been brought mostly into contact with
                  the agreeable.
               
                  My Mexico's fair list, boasts names "men delight to honor;" as well
                  as those of personal sonal friends to
                  the distinguished party, who made the "Gala Trip" through her gorgeous
                  Tropics!
               Fellow-laborer, in this inviting field, look to thyself! "Be ye wise as a serpent,
                  harmless as a dove."
               Fellow-laborer, gird thyself! Names of note have preceded thee. May not Paul,
                  Apostle to the Gentiles, in his earlier years, have been engaged in this
                  business?
               Does not his assertion, that he was all things to all men, hoping thereby to gain
                     some, smack of an experience evolved as an "Agent?" At all events,
                  the whole secret of success is inclosed in this very nutshell, "all things to all
                  men." In these days, the chances are you will thereby gain the
                  lot.
               I know one—young and handsome; who, by close observance of this rule, made his
                  "pile" out of a last year's almanac; better still; out of a pamphlet far more
                  un-
               interesting and passè than any modern almanac;
                  for, under the able generalship of a well-known humorist, "Allmanax" are taking a
                  lead in literature!
               I know another—of education and address; who failed to earn his salt, though
                  showing a work indorsed by the first in the land, through lack of the "Chameleon"
                  in his nature.
               But I know a woman—long may she wave!—who, to unprecedented tact in swelling a
                  subscription list, unites consummate shrewdness in making herself good against
                  possible loss; thus eminently combining the two essential points, of "raising the
                  wind," and when "raised," of appropriating the same: the capacity to do which, in
                  a more enlarged sphere, would place her "bull," or "bear," in the front rank, as a
                  Wall Street financier!
               I declare; was I myself to start a subscription book, and that person applied
                     to me for a chance, such is my
                  admiration of her as a "success," that notwithstanding a certain looseness
                  respecting "meum et tuum," I would appoint her canvasser-in-chief over any
                  district she might desire. "Sauve qui peut."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXV.
               THE "HUB."
               
                  
                     "There always shall be one to bless; for I am on thy side."
                  
               
               IN New York I was comparatively a stranger; but they "did not take me in," either
                  figuratively or literally.
               Only the Omnipotent can reckon the prayers that silently go up, on "the wings of
                  the morning," from the streets of that gay metropolis for help; for material aid;
                  which can that day, only be realized by Heaven itself!
               My last book was sold.
               At the end of five months, I too, fell into the ranks of the great multitude who
                  throng her streets with burdened hearts; and—nothing to do.
               
               Per necessity I returned to Boston; indebted a second time, to the kindness of a
                  friend, for a "free pass."
               
                  There I was well known; and sure at least of one acquaintance within
                  her classic limits, who would not suffer me to starve.
               I was now, sole and undisputed owner of a purple and black, striped gown (how glad
                  I am I was persuaded six years ago at Jordan & Marsh's into buying it; a
                  firmer piece of goods was never thrown upon Boston Market).
               I was now, sole and undisputed owner of a "water-proof" (more ancient, equally
                  abiding).
               And—my reputation!
               Financially, this was bad. But morally—here I made a stand.
               When I leave the Metropolitan city; come on "via" Springfield; and get out at the Boston and Albany depot; the order
                  and cleanliness before me, is in grateful contrast to the confusion and filth I
                  have left behind.
               Quietness reigns. The sky is blue. The air pure; and bracing—with the thermometer
                  at zero, and a stiff gale from the Northwest!
               I set my feet upon historic soil.
               Abode too of the fine arts; nowhere beside so critically appreciated.
               Mecca of genius! Centre of triumphs! climaxed by the "Peace Jubilee."
               Athenians of America! justly art thou proud of thine Athens, creation's Hub!
               Are my proclivities downward? Am I of the "earth, earthy?" Do I fraternize with
                     dirt?
               
               If, after this, I own right up, and say, "Give me New York for better or for
                  worse;" all Boston will howl back in the affirmative.
               But listen—
               
               Once more at home, where the greater part of my life had been spent, my heart
                  swelled with gratitude that I was again one of thy citizens; O, Puritanical city
                  of Boston!
               To be sure, within thy walls I had waded through seas of sorrow; but, let the
                  "Past bury its own dead."
               I hoped to commence life anew.
               I have a cousin who, in the course of his half century life, has brought forth two
                  original remarks.
               One, I have already given; the other, declared poverty to be an unmitigated
                  curse!
               I protested. In the first place, the dear companionship of friends would alleviate
                  the evil; in the second place, education would rob it of its sting; in the third
                  place, one's own consciousness of talent and mother wit, would come to the rescue;
                  in the fourth place, the world owed everybody a living; which everybody was a fool
                  if he did not get.
               The reticence of my cousin was his chief virtue. That was good for
                  the brief response, "TRY IT!"
               Years have elapsed. I have tried it; and am prepared to say—the
                  wisdom of the godlike Socrates; the sage Plato; the practical
                     Confucius—pale before the transcendent utterance of that man!
               Not to discuss the question of what the world really owes; it is stereotyped, that
                  it is a mighty hard thing now-a-days to make her pay her just debts.
               Talent, I hold to be terribly in the way, unless it has a wider field than poverty
                  can afford, in which to follow its bent, and—operate.
               What you are pleased to consider your "mother wit," be very careful not to
                  ventilate, unless you are tolerably situated in a worldly point of view.
               
               You can neither say, nor do, a smart thing in reduced circumstances.
               How dare you expect your talent, or your wit to be appreciated, if you have lost
                  your money? "Qui perde pèche."
               Poor unfortunate! "be not deceived; "the people" are not mocked;" whatever your
                  own conception of ability, others will not recognize it, unless set in gold!
               As to education to while the hours of poverty——well! this is a delicate question;
                  but, at the risk of offending the scholastic, I reiterate; that the most important
                  branch of knowledge, next "Our Lord's Prayer," to be instilled—at least into the
                  youthful, female mind—is the complex art of modern cookery!
               Then, a certain livelihood is secured; no thanks to "Belles-lettres" or
                  mathematics!
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXVI.
               THE RECEPTION.
               
                  
                     
                        "Going forth gayly in the morning to woo the world with smiles."
                        "Is met by those way-faring men with coldness, suspicion, and
                           repulse."
                     
                  
               
               BUT the dear companionship of friends?—there I have you!
               "Thou fool!" dost thou not know, that—in poverty—thy friendships are a myth!
               Take a walk down Washington Street any fine day, and learn for yourself.
               Before you reach the "Old South" the fact will be patent.
               It was patented to me on this wise—
               Entering a leading store in that fashionable locality, I was received as a
                     stranger. No. Strangers are entitled
                  to courtesy. I was met, as would be the foul scum of society, for daring to float
                  in that debarred direction; and yet, in the by-gone days, many is the time I have
                  tripped on "light fantastic toe" to the merry music of "Fisher's Hornpipe," with
                  the very person who thus ignored me!
               Amid all my humiliations it was the first time, but by no means the last, that I
                  had been so strangely regarded; and as the final "feather to the camel's back,"
                     that completely broke me down. I passed the remainder of the day
                  in tears.
               I would not shed so many again, though all my quondam acquaintance should rise
                     "en masse," to crush me back into my original
                  elements. Not much!
               And another—in whose veins every drop of blood flowing, is as mine—but let him
                  pass! I fancy upon the occasion of that well improved opportunity, he who readeth
                  can understand, with the heart searching-glare of my wrathful eyes, I managed to
                  avenge myself—and scorch him!
               And another—who, in the far-off hours, of girlish intimacy, had so entwined
                  herself around my heart-strings, that every memory of those happiest times but
                  flash before me her laughing face, looked coldly; nay worse; believed me capable
                  of winking at deeds, the abhorred conception of which caused my very soul to
                  shudder!
               My reputation! the conviction was forced upon me; an enemy had surely tampered
                  with that. I know— 
                     "A look may work thy ruin, or a word create thy wealth"—
                   but could so foul a slander have arisen from this?
               While absent, I kept house four weeks. During that time two disreputable
                  individuals contrived to insinuate themselves into my good graces; and through
                  ignorance of their style, become inmates of the family.
               
               Ascertaining the truth, they had but short notice to leave.
               The odium of this affair, trifling as it was, so thoroughly disturbed me; that I
                  immediately sacrificed every advantage, and gave up my new home.
               In my great need; and though persecuted, as it were, for very righteousness' sake;
                  many believed in good faith that, in the city of New York, I was the prosperous
                  mistress of a—house of ILL FAME!
               Believed; that the innocent girl; the close student; the happy wife; the desolate
                  widow; the wretched victim of another's intemperance; could be so lost to herself,
                  to her friends, to her God; as to countenance a life, the "steps to which take
                  hold oh hell!"
               But one, raised his voice in my behalf.
               But one, contradicted the vile aspersion.
               On my bended knees have I returned thanks to the All Powerful for raising me up
                  the "one" friend, in that, my direst need.
               No longer do I wonder, that despairing kinsfolk so often seek to recognize their
                  dead at the gloomy Morgue!
               
               And the other; would I could give his name! who, in mercy, saved me
                  from that last, sad resting-place.
               With words of sympathy; offers of aid; he brought me back to hope; and his
                  persistent, Christian kindness—
               Held me back—from appearing unsummoned, before the "Unknown!"
               Held me back—from the unblest future, of the deliberate "Suicide!"
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXVII.
               "OUR LORD'S PRAYER."
               
                  
                     
                        "Our Father who art in heaven,
                        Hallowed be thy name.
                        Thy kingdom come.
                        Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
                        Give us this day our daily bread.
                        And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against
                           us.
                        And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil;
                        For thine is the kingdom, and the power,
                        And the glory—forever—Amen."
                     
                     
                        "Now I lay me down to sleep;
                        I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
                        If I should die before I wake—
                        I pray the Lord my soul to take."
                     
                  
               
               IT IS PAST!
               Day is softly fading in the west. Night is gently coming to the earth.
               I sit in my quiet room; and Memory, forgetful of my blessings; faithful to but
                  half her mission; spreads out before me the loss of my youth, my ambition, my
                  property, my reputation!
               Serenely I consider this absence of all the world calls good.
               From the bitter ashes of earthly disappointment has arisen upon my vision, the
                  heavenly Star of Hope!
               I lift mine eyes—
               They fall upon my youthful husband; the man to whom, before angels and men, I have
                  sworn to be true.
               "Clothed, and in his right mind," he is sitting by my side.
               He is making an honest effort to reform.
               He is engaged in useful labor.
               Curses, are exchanged for prayers; blows, for loving words; prodigality, for
                  Christian economy.
               And—as he falls upon his knees before me—humbly, and with tears, imploring my forgiveness for the great wrong he has
                  done; the words, "Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who
                     trespass against us;" burn in letters of fire upon the wall; and I KNOW
                  it would be at the peril of my soul, to refuse.
               He, forgiven, will cover a multitude of my sins!
               Here, I have had tribulation!
               Hereafter, face to face with the ABSOLUTE, I shall have compensation!
               "At even time it will be light."
            
            THE END.
