            "All for Love," is a graphic story of Corsican life, in which the
               wild passions of that tameless race are vividly depicted. The magnificent caverns
               described in its pages actually exist in that island, and they have been used as
               places of concealment by the unfortunates banned by the blood vengeance which is the
               curse of that gem of the Mediterranean. The grand mountain scenery also receives
               justice at the author's hands. The story itself is deeply interesting from the first
               page to the last; the action is rapid, and the interest never flags.

               CHAPTER I.
               THE RIVALS. THREAT OF THE FORSAKEN LOVER.
               WHAT quality is there in the air of mountain lands which renders their sons
                  unconquerable? Look over the history of the civilized world, and we find that men
                  who breathe a highland atmosphere are chainless as the eagle that dwells among
                  their native hills. "God and freedom" are their watchwords, and the great Jehovah
                  has never failed to smile upon those who do battle for the sacred rights of
                  man.
               There is a small sea-girt island on which this struggle has been long and arduous;
                  in which the blood-vengeance has cursed the soil, yet among whose people the idea
                  of constitutional liberty was acted on before Washington fought for his country's
                  rights; before France waded through seas of blood to the phantom of freedom she
                  now enjoys.
               Corsica is little known except as the birth-place of Napoleon, yet it was there
                  that Pasquale Paoli lived, fought, and legislated so wisely, that with a little
                  foreign aid he might have won lasting independence as the heritage of his countrymen. Such aid was not granted, and
                  Paoli died an exile in a foreign land, but not the less revered as a patriot and a
                  statesman because circumstances were against him. Worthy to be ranked with
                  Washington, Paoli stands out among the sons of men as a fettered giant, struggling
                  with almost superhuman power to break the shackles that bind the land of his
                  birth. That he failed was not due to himself, but to those who looked on with
                  silent sympathy, yet forbore to stretch forth a helping hand to aid the noblest
                  struggle against fearful odds that ever has been waged.
               It is to that island lying upon the blue bosom of the Mediterranean that our story
                  leads us, and the stranger who feels the soft voluptuous air floating around him,
                  who gazes in silent rapture upon the enchanting scenery, would scarcely dream that
                  amid such Eden loveliness can lurk the demons of hate, despair, and death.
               The crimson gleam of the setting sun is melting slowly into the purple twilight,
                  and the azure sky begins to sparkle with stars, while the yellow disc of the full
                  moon slowly rises as from the waves of the undulating sea stretching out in the
                  distance.
               Three lofty mountains approach the shore, covered with olive groves, and villages
                  nestled amid their shades. As the brilliant glare of day fades into twilight, the
                  fires of the shepherds, who dwell amid the alpine fastnesses, gleam with ruddy
                  hues from point to point on the abrupt declivities.
               The names of these mountains are Angiola, Santa Susannah, and Monte Felicetà; at
                  their base lies the town of Isola Rossa, founded by Paoli. To the right lies the
                  peninsula of Cape Corso, the most northern point of the island, and on the left is
                  a long projecting tongue of land, around which the sea sweeps in tranquil
                  murmurs.
               The town, with its small houses, flat roofs, and green window shutters, its wealth
                  of shade, and its neat church, with snow-white towers, is a most picturesque and
                  cheerful looking place.
               In the sea are three red rocks over which an old tower keeps watch, carrying back
                  the fancy to those days in which the sword of the Saracen brought terror and death
                  to the dwellers in this lovely region.
               At the entrance of the city is a spacious square, in the middle of which is a
                  fountain surmounted by a marble bust of Paoli. This spot is the common resort of
                  the inhabitants in the evenings, and many groups were now collected beneath the
                  ornamental trees that cast their umbrage over the emerald sward.
               A group of children had erected a cross, around which they were dancing with
                  clasped hands, and singing with melodious voices the revolutionary song of France,
                  the Marseillaise,—on the opposite side of the square a group gathered around a
                  young girl who touched a guitar with much skill, and sang the national heirs of
                  Corsica; these vocaros are either tender laments for the loss of a beloved one, or
                  wild, terrible songs of vengeance. They are mostly composed by women, yet the
                  horrible and the terrible are only veiled by the melancholy beauty thrown around
                  them. They are mere improvisations, extended at pleasure by the performer, and
                  alternately express the tenderest emotions, or the highest state of excitement,
                  according to the skill of the singer.
               The woman, who held the guitar with careless grace, was young and attractive in
                  person, though an expression of melancholy abstraction characterized her features.
                  She was above the medium hight, with a figure of lithe and graceful proportions,
                  hands and feet of remarkable symmetry, and a face of such varying expression as
                  would have rendered it interesting even had it been far plainer than hers was.
                     But her features were of that regular
                  southern type in which beauty of proportion and delicacy of coloring are
                  transcended by the passionate power which breathes in every line—vibrates in every
                  thrilling tone, is read in every tremulous motion of the flexible lips, in the
                  sweep of the heavily-fringed lids which veil large, black, melancholy eyes that
                  reveal a tale of suffering of no common stamp.
               Her dress was of dark blue material, of better quality than that usually worn by
                  the peasantry; this was set off by a few gold ornaments, and the mandile, or head
                  hand-kerchief, which was coiled around her head, was of such brilliant hues as
                  harmonized with her dark and striking style of beauty. Her long, glossy black hair
                  had escaped from its confinement, and fell in waves of jet almost to her feet, as
                  she stood with her guitar slung across her breast by a broad scarlet ribbon; with
                  accurate touch she struck the chords, which formed a wild accompaniment to the
                  tones of her flexible voice, and the monotonous rhythm was calculated to produce a
                  deep and melancholy effect upon her hearers.
               Suddenly a voice spoke beside her.
               "Marie Montoni, change your measure, for here comes the bridal party, and Baptisto
                  Matra will not be likely to give a liberal douceur to one who meets him with a
                  lament on such an occasion as this."
               "True," replied Marie, vaguely, "Matra must have an epithalamium. I promised that
                  I would compose one expressly for him, for he weds with the Pearl of Isola Rossa,
                  the beautiful Clarice, who is my best friend."
               "See that you give it pretty soon, for here they come—the old woman, the brother,
                  sister and bridegroom—but the pretty bride is missing. I say that is shabby, now,
                  for Clarice to refuse to come out on the eve of her bridal."
               "And I say it is all right," said another. "Clarice is a lady, though she is the
                  daughter of a peasant, and she has the whims of one. Luckily Matra has the money
                  to uphold her in her fantasies, and that's why she's took up with him I fancy, for
                  he isn't the handsomest man in these parts."
               "Hush—h, they are close upon us. Matra has a long arm, and will not forgive an
                  insult."
               As the party thus referred to drew near, the improvisatrice changed her song of
                  vengeance for one of love and triumph. She sang of the happiness and good fortune
                  of the successful wooer, of the days of joy about to dawn upon him, of the pride
                  with which the family of the bride elect would bestow upon the fortunate suitor
                  the hand of the fairest girl in all the island.
               With folded hands and placid brow, the bridegroom listened to his own praises so
                  eloquently sung. He was a heavy, stoutly built man of fifty, with a low,
                  retreating forehead, and a sensual mouth. There was nothing to attract the love of
                  a young, fair girl in that repulsive face, but his dress showed that his position
                  was better than that of most of the people who clustered around him. He wore the
                  finest cloth, ornamented with embroidery, and a heavy chain of gold glittered upon
                  his scarlet vest.
               A large, middle-aged woman, dressed in the peasant costume, accompanied Matra, and
                  behind them came a boy and girl of fourteen and sixteen years of age. If the Pearl
                  of Isola Rossa was as beautiful as her friends declared her to be, she was
                  singularly unlike her relatives, for the heavy, sallow features, and small,
                  bead-like eyes of Senora Marcante had been transmitted to her offspring with
                  singular fidelity, and the most partial critic could not have pronounced either of
                  the three moderately good-looking. However, they were dressed in their best
                  clothes, and were perfectly satisfied with the impression they believed they were
                  making. Many congratulations were offered
                  to the bridegroom, and also to the fortunate mother who had succeeded in winning
                  the rich trader for her son-in-law; but above all, the strains of music rang out
                  their joyous peal, and but one among the listeners bore a discontented and bitter
                  heart as he hearkened to the bridal hymn.
               This was a young man of three or four and twenty, wearing the dress of a
                  fisherman, with the Phrygian cap placed jauntily upon his curling black hair. His
                  figure was tall, well-knit, and elastic, and his features had that mingled
                  expression of boldness and tenderness which evinces a fine and noble nature; yet
                  there was a latent gleam of fire which betrayed that in a burst of momentary
                  passion, he might be goaded to commit an act fatal to his peace throughout all the
                  days of his after life.
               The appearance of Guilio Falcone amid the crowd caused many whispered comments,
                  for it was known to all present that Clarice Marcante had been the love of his
                  boyhood and youth—that for her sake he had refused to become a priest when his
                  patron, Count Rospoli, offered to provide for him handsomely if he would take the
                  vows. When the old nobleman insisted that his patronage should be accepted, Guilio
                  disappeared from the neighborhood, to return after a brief absence as the captain
                  of a lugger, ostensibly engaged in fishing, but it was secretly asserted that she
                  carried on a contraband trade under the protection of a noted smuggler known as
                  Captain Barnardo.
               Senora Marcante listened to these stories, and turned scornfully from the young
                  sailor, to smile upon the offers of the rich Matra; Guilio was forbidden to think
                  of Clarice, and magnificent preparations were made for the marriage, which was now
                  on the eve of consummation.
               This was a severe blow both to the pride and the affections of the young lovers;
                  Clarice also had resisted so long as the power to do so remained with her; but
                  Senora Marcante was a wilful and despotic woman in her own houshold, and when she
                  decided that the marriage should take place, there was no appeal from her
                  authority.
               The chosen bridegroom was of the wealthy bourgeois; and he had amassed a fortune
                  by trading with the neighboring coasts of France and Italy. His villa and olive
                  groves were among the most desirable in the vicinity of Isola Rossa, and the
                  mother pronounced Clarice the most fortunate of girls in attracting so desirable a
                  match; but the young girl compared the pompous, heavy Matra with the handsome and
                  spirited young fisherman, and her heart utterly rebelled against the destiny
                  awarded her. The rich lover seemed unconscious of, or indifferent to her
                  feelings—he thought all women were perverse in such matters, and in time his wife
                  would settle down quietly in the place assigned her; he had no fears as to his
                  power to manage her, for his was a strong hand, and a relentless will.
               Senora Marcante sat beside her chosen son-in-law, and listened complacently to the
                  florid epithalamium poured forth by the wandering improvisatrice. She was a dark,
                  keen-eyed woman, who seemed quite capable of using force if her daughter should
                  prove rebellious; and the expression of gratified pride that rested upon her
                  features, showed that she was quite elated by the brilliant future that opened
                  before her family. With unwonted liberality, Matra had pledged himself to advance
                  the interests of Pietro; and to find a marriage portion for the heavy-looking
                  Ninetta, who sat twirling her fingers beside her.
               Guilio Falcone drew near the shrewd-looking dame, and while the music rung out its
                  monotonous rhythm, he found means to mutter in her ear:
               "Mother Marcante, is it impossible to move you from your cruel purpose? Will you
                  break my heart, and that of my Clarice?
                  for she is mine—mine in the sight of Heaven!"
               This impetuous whisper caused the woman to turn her head slightly toward the
                  speaker, and she replied in a low, taunting tone:
               "Remember the proverb that belongs to your trade, and act on it, young man. The
                  adage says, there is as good fish in the sea as ever were caught from it; angle
                  for one of them, and leave my child for your betters; she shall never
                  marry you, nor such as you."
               A flash of lurid anger passed over the face of the young lover, and he
                  disdainfully said, as he nodded toward Matra,
               "And he, with his mean face, his meaner nature, is considered worthy
                  to win and wear my betrothed, because he can claim a little more gold
                  than I possess. Money is good, but it cannot buy heart-love like that between
                  Clarice and me. Oh! Mother Marcante, do not drive us to desperation. Stop this
                  marriage, and let Clarice come to my home, for I have one to offer her. I have
                  labored for her—I have found a nest in which she can be happy, and lo! when I came
                  into the harbor to cast anchor, the news was hurled at me that you were about to
                  give my bride to yonder lump of flesh and stupidity. Is this right? is it just to
                  two young people that are devoted to each other? You do not know what may yet come
                  of all this."
               "Guilio," replied the Senora, impressively, "listen to me: You have ever been a
                  wild and wayward youth, but I do not believe you have in you the stuff that will
                  make a bandit. You have lived upon the sea, and the macchia
                  *
                   would not agree with you. A week among the fastnesses of the hills would
                  break you down, and make you a prey to your pursuers. I advise you not to attempt
                  anything desperate, because my daughter is quite beyond your reach,
                  and will always remain so. If I would not give her to you as a peaceful,
                  well-to-do lad, I would scarcely permit her to follow your fortunes if you dare to
                  invoke the blood vengeance. There! I hope that is plain enough, young man."
               
                  
                  *A forest.
               
               At this moment the melody abruptly ceased, and Guilio drew away, muttering some
                  unintelligible words, which were drowned in the vociferous applause which greeted
                  the musician.
               Matra spoke in loud, pompous tones:
               "Well done, Marie; I am charmed with your bridal song, and since you have praised
                  me so judiciously I will double the compensation I intended to give you."
               A faint smile, half scornful in its meaning, passed over the lips of the
                  improvisatrice, as she held out her hand for the promised guerdon, and she briefly
                  said:
               "My service is performed, and I must be gone before the sun rises on your wedding
                  day. I sing of marriages, but they are not in my line. The scathed heart has
                  nothing to do with love and joy, though the lips may sing of its fullness. The
                  hopes crushed out in blood may never blossom again."
               She spoke in a vague, half dreamy manner, and her eyes were fixed upon the distant
                  sea, over whose restless waters the moon was now pouring a flood of yellow
                  radiance.
               "Poor Marie," was muttered by those around her. "Hers was indeed a tragic
                  history—so young, so fair, yet so unfortunate!"
               Matra drew forth a small gold coin, and placed it in the outstretched palm of the
                  singer.
               "I am told that you also possess the power of divination. Read me my fate, good
                  Marie, and keep the gold unchanged."
               He held forth his fat, white hand, which looked clammy and cold. The girl glanced upon the lines traced
                  within its palm, shuddered, and tendered him back the coin.
               "I know nothing of palmistry," she said. "Take back your gold, and give me such
                  guerdon as my song has merited."
               "Nay, nay, keep it, fair Marie, though I should be glad to have you read my
                  future."
               "Why should you ask it?" she vaguely replied. "Are you not a successful man in all
                  your undertakings? Fortune smiles on you, and love offers its crown to your life;
                  what more dare you ask of Fate than has already been granted you? Why seek to lift
                  the veil from the future, when the bright sunshine is upon the present? Better
                  bask in its warm beams, and pray to the holy virgin that it may never be worse
                  with you than now."
               "She speaks words of wisdom," said Senora Marcante, "and the priest says it is
                  sinful to pry into the ways of Providence. Enjoy the good that is sent us, bear
                  the evil when it falls; that is the true philosophy of life."
               The dark eyes of the improvisatrice were fixed upon the speaker, with an
                  expression of intense sadness, and she spoke with inexpressible bitterness.
               "Life has no other philosophy than endurance. What God sends to his
                  creatures they must bear, and that is an end of the matter. Mother
                  Marcante, can I find shelter beneath your roof a few hours to-night. I promised
                  Clarice to see her once more before I leave the town, and I must do so without
                  delay."
               The old woman regarded her with an expression of suspicion, while she slowly
                  said:
               "No one willingly turns away the smitten of God, and you are welcome to the
                  shelter of my roof, Marie Montoni, if you are true to me and mine."
               "True to the best interests of your daughter you will ever find me," replied
                  Marie, composedly. "Why should you now doubt my devotion to her, good mother?"
               "If you are true to her interests, I can trust you; for they lead her
                  to the altar with Baptisto Matra, to place the nuptial ring upon her finger."
               Marie bowed her head as if in assent, and the dame added:
               "Then come with me, and talk reasonably with the wayward girl, who will see no
                  grandeur in the future, no joy in the life that opens so fairly before her. Oh!
                  children are vexatious and ungrateful creatures. While parents seek to do the best
                  they can for them, they often try to thwart their efforts for their advancement.
                  It's a weary world, a weary world, in spite of all the angels in Heaven are
                  constantly trying to do for us."
               Marie shook her head dubiously as she glanced at the repulsive face of Matra, and
                  muttered:
               "I am afraid the angels had little to do with this, but I will talk with Clarice,
                  as you wish me to do. I am afraid we are all too much like the ungrateful children
                  of whom you just now spoke, and we carry out our own will while professing to
                  follow the dictates of Heaven."
               Dame Marcante looked sharply at her, but as the speaker seemed wrapped in a
                  species of dreamy trance, in which she appeared scarcely conscious of the purport
                  of her own words, the good woman turned to Matra, and said:
               "It grows late, and I have much to attend to to-morrow. It is best to seek my
                  home, and rest before labor. You, too, Senor, will need repose to prepare yourself
                  for the happiness that awaits you. Long life to you, my son, in which to enjoy
                  prosperity with my fortunate daughter."
               The bridegroom sleepily returned his thanks for her good wishes, and with some
                  effort arose from the comfortable seat he occupied. He placed himself beside
                  Marie, but she seemed to recoil from him
                  with some inexplicable feeling of repulsion, and glided around the portly form of
                  Senora Marcante till she found Ninetta, whose hand she grasped as her companion in
                  their homeward walk. Grateful for the preference thus shown, the young girl
                  said:
               "I will show you my beautiful dress, Marie. Oh, it is grand to have such a fine
                  wedding, and so rich a brother as Senor Matra will be!"
               Marie's lip curled, but she absently replied:
               "Yes—very grand, Ninetta, if poor Clarice could only think as you do."
               "Clarice is so strange. She never does think as mother and I do. Mother says she
                  is too fanciful to belong to any but a rich man, and it must then be right to give
                  her to Matra, even if she does not care particularly for him. Mother says she will
                  learn to love him in time."
               The dark eyes of the listener emitted a flash as they were turned indignantly upon
                  the simple prattler, but the vacant face that met her view caused a sudden
                  revulsion of feeling. She laughed bitterly as she replied:
               "Perhaps your mother is right; but in my opinion time will come to an end for us
                  all before Clarice learns the lesson that has been set for her. Poor girl! I wish
                  it were otherwise."
               "Then she will prove very perverse," retorted Ninetta, with a pout. "If Matra had
                  given me all the beautiful things that he has sent my sister, I
                  should think him the greatest man in the world."
               Marie made no reply to this, and the two followed in the steps of the elder
                  couple, while Pietro skipped along in pursuit of the fire-flies that flitted
                  around them. The soft sea breeze moved the foliage of the trees, and the bright
                  moon flooded the bay with a light almost as clear as that of day. The children
                  still sang their wild war chant, and the tinkle of the citera was heard from many
                  different points as the party pursued their way toward Dame Marcante's humble
                  domicile.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               AM I YOUR DAUGHTER?
               THE cottage nestled in a secluded nook near the sandy beach, and within sight of
                  its windows lay the dark hull and tapering masts of Guilio Falcone's bark, making
                  ready to go on another voyage. A pathway from the landing wound upward to the
                  widow's door, which, until of late, had been familiar to the feet of the handsome
                  fisherman; and the fair Clarice, who on the morrow was to give her hand to
                  Baptisto Matra, had often lingered upon it with her hand clasped in Falcone's, and
                  her eyes beaming with that deep passionate love which both believed to be
                  indestructible.
               Now it was seldom trodden by her, for her mother kept too strict a watch upon her
                  movements to permit such wanderings from the path she was resolute her child
                  should walk in.
               Clarice was the beauty of Isola Rossa, and when the wealthy Matra was attracted by
                  her fair face, she was allowed no voice in the arrangement which gave her hand to
                  him as his wife. To be elevated to the position of mistress of a villa, with
                  servants and lands, was too great good fortune to be cast away for love forsooth.
                  That was but a dream, while this was a tangible reality, whose blessings would
                  increase and multiply as time rolled on.
               Thus reasoned Senora Marcante, and Clarice listened with a rebellious heart, which
                  shrank and quivered with pain when she
                  thought of her beloved Guilio; of the happy future they had planned together, and
                  she thrilled with repulsion as she compared him with her ungainly bridegroom.
               The cottage stood upon a ledge overlooking the sea; it was of humble pretensions,
                  though it was a comfortable home in that genial climate, and was kept with a
                  degree of neatness not often found among people of the widow's class. Fruit trees
                  grew around it, and a vine trailed its green foliage over the walls, making it a
                  complete nest of verdure.
               Matra bade the party good-night at the base of the ascent, saying that as they
                  were now safe in sight of the door, he would seek his own home, and spare himself
                  the fatigue of going up with them. Senora Marcante replied to this with cordial
                  emphasis:
               "It will be best so, my son; adieu till to-morrow, and may the holy Mother of God
                  have you in her keeping. Her blessing upon your union with Clarice is, I believe,
                  already assured."
               "I trust so," replied the bridegroom, as he turned toward his own domicile.
               Marie looked after his receding figure, and she scornfully said:
               "A lover worth the care of the Holy Mary would have gone on with us for the chance
                  of a moment's interview with the object of his affections. Oh! Mother Marcante, do
                  you hope that Clarice can ever be happy with that ton of flesh yonder? A fish from
                  the sea has as much sensibility as Matra has, and Clarice is all tenderness and
                  truthfulness."
               "That may be true, but still I have chosen wisely for her. Clarice is fair and
                  delicate; she is not suited to bear the burden of a hard life. Baptisto can make
                  her a lady in station, as nature has made her one in taste and refinement. Trust
                  me, Marie, that I am doing what in the end will be best for my daughter's
                  happiness."
               "I wish I could think so. With one she loves, Clarice would cheerfully bear
                  privations even; but in the case of her new home, her spirit will fret itself
                  forever against the enforced bonds that will bind her to such a man as you are
                  about to bestow her on."
               "If such are your sentiments, I think you had better not seek Clarice to-night,"
                  said Senora Mercante, drily. "It is too late to preach against
                  the marriage now, for every arrangement is completed, and she shall surely become
                  the wife of Matra on the morrow."
               "Clarice has my promise to see her once more before I leave Isola Rossa; but you
                  need fear nothing from me now. The fate of your child is already
                  decided, and I shall not lift my finger to change it. Will this assurance satisfy
                  you?"
               The woman ungraciously replied:
               "I suppose it must, for you are always wilful, and at the last moment Clarice may
                  prove unmanageable if I keep you away from her. See her, then, and bear from her
                  her last farewell to the presumptuous Guilio, for it is he who will watch for you
                  when you leave my cottage, I very well know. See—I am secure of the game I am
                  playing, or I would never permit this interview between you."
               As she ceased speaking, they reached the cottage door, which stood open to receive
                  them. It consisted of a large central room, with doors on either side opening from
                  it into the apartments of the family.
               An iron lamp, of antique shape, hung from the centre of the ceiling, and in the
                  full glare of the light which fell from it, sat a young girl with her hands
                  clasped upon her lap in an attitude of hopeless dejection.
               
               Her light and graceful figure was clad in a robe of pale sea-green, with a jacket
                  of some brilliant figured material, fitted perfectly to her form; her heavy suit
                  of lustrous auburn hair was partially covered by the usual Corsican head-dress, a
                  mandile white as drifted snow, with a border of fine red stripes closely woven
                  together.
               Clarice was scarcely seventeen years of age, but her form was rounded into perfect
                  womanhood, and there was a world of passionate thought and feeling in the deep
                  dark eyes and flexible lips of this young creature thus early placed in a position
                  of such pain and peril; for the overbearing mother was far from comprehending the
                  actual condition of her daughter's affairs. She did not see the conflict raging in
                  that bosom between love and duty—the struggle between ambition and passion, for
                  ambition was the ruling trait in that yet undeveloped nature, and its promptings
                  bade her give her hand to Matra, while every voice in her better nature pleaded
                  for him she truly loved.
               She did not rise when the two women entered, but kept her eyes fixed upon the
                  floor as if in deep meditation. Dame Marcante sharply spoke:
               "How now, Clarice; I expected to find you in bed and asleep. A pretty-looking
                  bride will you be to-morrow, with that woe-begone face and stupid look. Of what
                  are you dreaming, child?"
               "Of despair—death," replied the girl, drearily, lifting her eyes to the face of
                  the speaker. "Do you think that I can sleep when my heart is torn with anguish?
                  When hope has knocked at it for the last time? Oh, mother! I would that I were
                  dead—dead—dead!"
               Her voice died away in a feeble wail, and her head drooped upon her bosom in an
                  attitude of hopeless dejection Senora Marcante roughly shook her by the shoulders,
                  as she said in harsh tones:
               "Are you determined to play the fool to the very last hour? Get up, go to your
                  room, and get to bed. Any girl, with common sense, would exult in the grand future
                  that opens to you to-morrow. You leave the peasant's cot to play the part of the
                  great lady, and yet you talk of despair and death. Stuff! you'll laugh at all
                  these heroics one of these days."
               "If I do, it will not be as Matra's wife. No laugh will ever come to my lip, when
                  once his kiss has polluted it."
               "We shall see, all in good time. I have no fears for you when the words have been
                  really said; you will come to you right reason then. Here is Marie Montoni to
                  speak with you. I permitted her to come, though I knew it was giving you a last
                  chance to send a message to that impudent fisher lad, who would drag you down to
                  his level by making you the sharer of his wretched poverty."
               "Guilio is not poor; he is rich enough for one brought up as I have been, and I
                  would rather mend his nets, and help him draw them with my own hands, than give it
                  to this man you are forcing me to wed. Oh, Marie, good Marie, plead for me, for in
                  this hour I am desperate."
               She grasped the hand of the singer with such force that she could scarcely repress
                  a cry of pain as she said:
               "Words will now be useless, Clarice. Your mother has shown me her mind, and I am
                  afraid she is immovable. Come with me and let me talk with you. I have calmed you
                  before to-night, and caused you to listen to the voice of reason. You have always
                  found good to flow from following my advice."
               Clarice arose mechanically, and placed her hand in that of her friend. As the two
                  turned towards the door leading into one of the side apartments, Marie said to the
                  mother:
               "Have no fears, mother Marcante, that I shall seek to influence Clarice against
                  your wishes. Her fate is now placed beyond my control."
               
               She mentally added, "And yours, too, for others are circumventing you fast enough
                  without any aid from me. I may safely promise anything now."
               The two girls entered the room of Clarice, and closed the door. It was small, with
                  a single window which opened upon the bay, and commanded a view of the cove in
                  which Falcone's lugger lay moored. Beside this was placed the crucifix, before
                  which the poor girl offered up her prayers for his welfare, and while her orisons
                  ascended to Heaven, her eyes could behold the beacon light which assured her of
                  the presence and safety of her earthly idol.
               She sunk down before the altar, bowed her head, and raised her clasped hands
                  imploringly toward the head of Christ crowned with thorns, and her pale lips
                  muttered:
               "Pardon and guidance, oh Friend of the friendless, for I am in a dire strait. Thou
                  knowest my heart; oh, give me strength, give me courage, to walk in the path
                  appointed to me. Let me not falter or grow weak."
               Marie Montoni watched the wan face and pleading lips of Clarice with vivid
                  interest, and while she is thus engaged, we will give a sketch of the heroic story
                  of her own broken life.
               At sixteen she was the betrothed bride of a daring Corsican who plotted against
                  the enemies of his country. The conspiracy was revealed to the French commander,
                  and the ringleaders were arrested and broken on the wheel, that most terrible of
                  all cruel punishments. Among them was the youthful betrothed of poor Marie. He
                  perished with manly courage, but his enemies refused to him the right of
                  sepulture; the bodies of the slain patriots were exposed in the public square, and
                  the penalty of death denounced against those who attempted to remove them.
               Marie sat alone in her desolation, and to her excited senses the voice of her dead
                  lover seemed ever beside her, wailing in her ears:
               "The birds of prey tear my flesh, and no faithful heart is found to lay me in the
                  tomb of my fathers."
               The cry maddened her, and she was resolute to remove her martyred lover from the
                  ignoble position he occupied. On a dark and starless night, Marie enveloped her
                  form in a black faldetta, a national garment, the back extremity of which is
                  thrown over the head in such a manner as to resemble a nun's hooded cloak.
               Favored by the gloom of the night and this sombre garment, the heroic girl glided
                  past the sentinel, and reached the square on which lay the corpses of those
                  gallant men exposed to the dews of night, and the scorching sun of day. Last in
                  the row lay the body of her beloved Antonio.
               Nerving herself to the task, she passed the others, lifted the body of her lover,
                  and bore it within a neigboring monastery, beneath the floor of which lay the
                  burial vault of the dead man's family. With superhuman strength she gained the
                  marble slab above its mouth, sat down in the dim light that came from a chapel
                  near by, and sustained the ghastly head of Antonio upon her lap.
               Tears and caresses were lavished upon the lifeless remains, and then she slid the
                  body into the vault beneath, closed its mouth, and kneeling above it, offered
                  prayers for the repose of his soul.
               Marie gained her home in safety, and on the following day the family of Antonio
                  were arrested on suspicion of violating the orders of the French commander. No
                  sooner was this news conveyed to her than the real culprit presented herself
                  before the officer, and confessed her guilt. She said:
               "I have given burial to the remains of my betrothed. Let my life be the atonement,
                  that the innocent may go free."
               At first he was incredulous, but when convinced that this deed of heroism had actually been performed by a
                  young and slender girl, he gave her her freedom, and ordered that the other bodies
                  should be removed and buried. The parents of Marie were dead, and her relatives
                  cast her off to lead the life of a wandering improvisatrice. From her musical
                  talent she gleaned a precarious existence, and as her history was generally known
                  throughout the island, shelter was never denied to her by a people who are
                  singularly alive to every trait of heroism, and ready to excuse crime itself, if
                  it is backed by the wild daring which forms the groundwork of their national
                  character.
               She also possessed another claim upon their sympathies. The vague sadness which
                  became the predominant phase of her mind often gave her the air of a person whose
                  senses have wandered beyond the control of their possessor; and the wild
                  inspirations she sometimes uttered to the music of her guitar, gave her among the
                  common people the reputation of a seeress.
               Mysterious as the oracles of Delphi these utterances often were, but a weird
                  significance was attached to them in the minds of the listeners, and few would
                  willingly have offended the wandering musician, from the superstitious fear that
                  the familiar spirits with whom they believed her in constant communion, would find
                  means to avenge any slight put upon her.
               From this feeling arose the consent of Senora Marcante to the interview between
                  the reluctant bride-elect and her self-invited guest. She would willingly have
                  played the spy upon the two friends, but the fear that the attendant spirit of the
                  girl might reveal her espionage to Marie, withheld her. A belief in witchcraft is
                  wide spread in Corsica, and Senora Marcante was not superior to the majority of
                  her compatriots.
               At length Clarice arose from her devotions, and turned her pale face toward her
                  friend. She looked into her eyes, and saw burning in their dark depths a vivid
                  light very different from the soft dreaminess that usually characterized them. She
                  knew that Marie was ready to take some decided part in the drama of her own life
                  which was to open with more than one striking tableau on the morrow.
               She rapidly whispered:
               "What is it, Marie? What have you to tell me? Did Guilio come upon the square? Did
                  he—did he speak to my mother?"
               "Yes, he did, and she roughly repelled him. Clarice, darling, there is no hope
                  from that quarter. Your mother intends to give your hand to-morrow to the rich
                  Matra, and, save in your own resolution, there is no help for you."
               "That will not fail me now, for I tell you there must, there shall be
                  help for me. God will not permit me to be forced into a marriage with Baptisto
                  Matra, when I am in the sight of Heaven already a wife."
               Marie started, and asked:
               "What do you mean? I cannot understand you, Clarice."
               "I only mean that I have solemnly plighted my troth to Guilio, and I dare not
                  break the pledge I have given him. We have knelt together at the shrine of the
                  Virgin, and repeated the form of the betrothal. He placed the bridal ring upon my
                  finger, and I wear it concealed in my boddice. I look upon the vow taken, when
                  this circlet of gold was accepted, as binding as if the priest had made us one
                  flesh. Yes, Marie, I feel that in God's holy sight I am truly the wife of Guilio,
                  and it is wicked even to think of giving myself to another."
               Marie gravely shook her head.
               "I am afraid your mother will scarcely view it in the same light, for she has
                  declared that nothing shall prevent you from becoming the wife of Matra."
               
               "My mother never loved me," replied Clarice, with a burst of passionate weeping.
                  "She gave me advantages superior to those of my station, but I have always felt
                  that her affections were given alone to Ninetta and Pietro. Why, then, shall I
                  sacrifice myself to please her?"
               "Ah, that is it; she has reared you for a higher station than you were born to
                  fill, and she is only carrying out her plan by giving you to one who is rich
                  enough to make a lady of you, and who is desperately enamored of you. I promised
                  to say nothing against her plans, and I will not, but I say to you that hope is
                  not yet dead and buried under Matra's piles of gold. If Guilio is what I take him
                  to be, he will never let you be torn from him in this manner."
               A knock came to the door, and Senora Marcante's head was thrust into the room.
               "You talk too late. Clarice, you must sleep a few hours, or your eyes will lose
                  all their brightness. "Marie, too, needs rest. I insist that you shall put out the
                  light, and retire."
               Clarice coldly replied:
               "Since it is your last night of authority over me, Madame, I obey you. I have
                  little further to say to Marie; all that remains to me now is to prepare for the
                  event of the morrow."
               "Come, now, that is rational. I thought you would listen to reason when you found
                  opposition to my will to be quite useless. Sleep in peace, that your cheeks may be
                  blooming, and your nerves steady when you stand before the priest as the bride of
                  the wealthiest trader in Isola Rossa. Think what a beautiful house you will have;
                  how fine your dress will be. Ah, you will be the envy of every girl of your
                  acquaintance."
               "For what, Madame?" asked the girl, with bitterness. "For the grace and elegance
                  of my betrothed? for the nobility of his character? the generosity of his nature?
                  Those only are legitimate causes of envy, and not the mean dazzle of gold, which,
                  if report speaks truly, has been won by any other than upright and honorable
                  means. Yes—they will do well to envy me my lover. I can only say, that any one
                  among them is quite welcome to take him, with all his possessions, even if they
                  were ten times as great as they are, for I set no value either on Senor Matra or
                  his wealth."
               "Then you are a stupid and ungrateful creature, who is unworthy to be elevated to
                  the pinnacle of prosperity by the efforts of those connected with you. I have done
                  all I could to bring about this marriage, and whether you thank me or not, it
                  shall certainly take place. I am glad that Matra takes you to-morrow under his own
                  charge, for I am tired of your caprices and impertinence."
               Clarice listened disdainfully; she turned her eyes with a searching expression
                  upon the old woman, as she suddenly asked:
               "Madame, are you really entitled to claim from me a daughter's
                  obedience? Answer me truly, as Heaven shall judge you."
               At this unexpected question Senora Marcante recoiled, and grew visibly paler; but
                  she recovered instantly, and, with a derisive laugh, replied:
               "I am willing to abide its judgment; are you not my child? To whom else, then,
                  should your obedience be due?"
               "That is the question I myself asked; for your harshness toward me, your want of
                  affection for me, compel me at times to doubt the relationship. Am I your daughter
                  or that of the stranger who, seventeen years ago, found refuge in this cottage and
                  died here?"
               The unexpected nature of this question evidently disconcerted Senora Marcante, for
                  she became extremely pale, as she faltered:
               
               "What absurd stories have you been listening to? What do you know of a stranger
                  who once came hither in distress?"
               "I know much about her, and the stories cannot be so absurd if they produce the
                  effect I now witness. Speak, Madame, am I your child or that of the stranger who
                  came in darkness and storm, to ask for shelter for herself and the infant she
                  carried in her arms?"
               Senora Marcante turned to Marie with an assumed expression of commiseration, as
                  she said:
               "Clarice is growing mad. I am afraid that Baptisto will be forced to put her in a
                  lunatic asylum before the honeymoon is over. Poor child! it is fearful to have the
                  temper get the better of the judgment thus. Can you not bring her to a more
                  rational state, good Marie? Persuade her to retire, and dismiss this absurd fancy
                  from her mind. Not my own child, indeed! Why should I have kept her through all
                  these long years, and given her every advantage that a nobleman's daughter might
                  have claimed, if she belonged to another person?"
               "Because you were well paid to do so," said Clarice, still intently regarding her.
                  "No—I am not mad yet; I keep that last phase of misery till you have really made
                  me the wife of Matra. Then, I may go mad at my leisure, for I shall have nothing
                  else to do."
               "You shall have the chance to try it, at all events," replied Dame Marcante,
                  angrily; "for you shall be the wife of Baptisto before twenty-four hours have
                  rolled away. My authority shall not be set at naught by you, on the silly ground
                  that you are the child of some other person. An Italian lady once dwelt in my
                  house. She had enjoyed wealth and high station; but she died in my arms a few
                  hours after her child went to the angels, and both are buried in the church yard.
                  It is ridiculous for you, Clarice Marcante cante, to set yourself up as the
                  descendant of a high born woman. You, who are of peasant blood! ha! ha! it makes
                  me laugh."
               Clarice glanced toward the mirror in which her patrician head was reflected, and a
                  haughty smile curved her lips, as she replied:
               "I do not believe that plebeian blood flows in my veins. Look at me—compare me
                  with the two children to whom all your love is given, and tell me if we bear the
                  same seal from the hand of divinity. You treat me as an alien, you crush my hopes
                  without remorse, and yet you claim the sacred name of mother. My heart refuses to
                  acknowledge the tie. Daily, for months, has the conviction been growing upon me
                  that I have no claim of blood upon you. Wherefore, then, attempt to force me into
                  a marriage which must render me miserable?"
               The woman sneered, though she evidently trembled. She spoke, in a husky voice:
               "Go to bed, Clarice, and sleep off this fit of heroics. To-morrow you will be
                  calm, and willing to see that your mother knows best what is for your welfare. No
                  beggarly fisherman shall claim child of mine for his wife. You shall have houses
                  and lands, silks and jewels, in the place of the spoils of the sea as your only
                  portion. Marie, reason with this silly child, and bring her to her sober
                  senses."
               "Leave her with me, and I will see what can be done," replied Marie. "You are both
                  excited now, and had better separate."
               Dame Marcante raised her voice to its most positive pitch as she said:
               "Good night, then, and see that you heed my warning. There is no escape from this
                  house to-night; the path to the sea is watched, as is that toward the hills, for
                  Matra shall not be foiled of his bride to-morrow."
               
               With this information she left the room, and after a whispered consultation
                  between the two girls they threw themselves upon the bed and endeavored to
                  sleep.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               MAKING READY FOR FLIGHT.
               SUDDENLY Clarice aroused herself from the dreamy reverie into which she seemed to
                  have fallen, and asked:
               "What is your opinion, Marie? Has Senora Marcante the right to force
                  me into Matra's arms, when my whole soul recoils with inexpressible loathing from
                  the thought of becoming his wife? I mean has she the sacred right of motherhood to
                  bend me to her will of iron? for that is a strong tie to be rent by violence. You
                  are wise beyond most people; you can read the human heart. Am I free to act for
                  myself, or is she my sovereign mistress by right of maternity?"
               "I do not know—I cannot tell. What passed here just now has raised strange doubts
                  in my mind as to your true origin. Yet if you are not the child of plebeian
                  parents, Guilio is no fitting mate for you."
               Clarice lifted her lithe form with a movement of pride, and her voice quivered
                  with intense emotion as she replied:
               "Were I a princess born, Guilio would still be my king, for I love him with the
                  strength of my nature, and my soul bends down in homage before him as my true lord
                  and ruler. He is noble and true in every impulse of his nature, and no knightly
                  ancestry is needed to emblazon his worth. Guilio has bestowed on me the royal gift
                  of his affections, and I have responded to them with my whole being. If, as I have
                  dreamed, I am of gentle blood, I have been cast off by those who should have owned
                  me long ere this, and to their prejudices of birth or fortune I owe no allegiance,
                  even if they should seek me out at this late day to do me justice. Fate has bound
                  up my life with that of Guilio Falcone, and when he bears me from the altar on
                  which they would offer me as a sacrifice to avarice and pride, I give myself to
                  him without reserve. I am, from that moment, his own true wife as long as life
                  shall last."
               Marie shuddered.
               "Ah, it will be a terrible scene, Clarice. Blood, blood will surely be shed in the
                  melee."
               A tone of fierceness vibrated in the voice of Clarice as she vehemently
                  replied:
               "If it does flow, it will be from the heart of my enemy. It is his life staked
                  against mine; for I will thrust this dagger into my heart if the priest completes
                  the ceremony which binds me to Baptisto Matra."
               She drew a sharp stiletto from a case concealed in her bosom, and held it aloft,
                  while a wild, exulting smile parted her lips.
               "Should my lover fail to rescue me, my enfranchised soul will thus rush forth to
                  join the great caravan of death, which gains strength with every passing moment.
                  Oh! it will be far easier to die than to live on as the wife of that senseless,
                  soulless mass of clay to which my mother would give me. Mother! no,
                  mine lies in the grave behind the church, and this hard and cruel tyrant has
                  usurped her name."
               "Since you are so resolute not to marry Matra, why did you not elope with Guilio
                  when you met him on the shore to-night?" asked Marie. "It would save much future
                  suffering to all concerned."
               "We knew that we were watched, and his bark could not be prepared for our flight before the morning.
                  Besides, his friend Barnardo will join him to-night, and Guilio relies on his
                  assistance to render our escape certain."
               "Barnardo! what, the suspected smuggler? Is he the friend of Guilio?" asked Marie,
                  with interest.
               "I believe he is the same person; I know he is spoken of with caution, but he is a
                  fast and brave friend in the hour of need. His felucca will enter the bay
                  to-night, and her quick sailing will enable us to baffle our pursuers tomorrow.
                  But, Marie, dear Marie, tell me truly. Look into the mirror of Fate, and reveal to
                  me if I am the victim of a fantasy, or am I indeed the thrall of Senora Marcante?
                  As her child, I shall scarcely have courage to bring upon her the
                  punishment which may be exacted, should blood be spilled in my rescue."
               "On what grounds do you doubt your relationship to her?" asked Marie.
               Clarice had risen, and was standing in front of an old-fashioned Venetian mirror
                  which hung above a carved ebony stand; this was a singular article of furniture to
                  be found in a peasant's cottage. Her eyes wandered to her own person, and she
                  said:
               "Look at me, Marie. There is not a trace of resemblance between me and the other
                  members of this family. My nature is not kindred to theirs, and an inner voice
                  seems to cry out forever that I am not of them. Senora Marcante has ever treated
                  me harshly, and this last harshness in forcing me into a marriage which must
                  render me a miserable, perjured wretch, almost convinces me that she cannot really
                  be my mother."
               Marie sorrowfully regarded her.
               "My poor Clarice, your mind must indeed wander, or you would never have
                  entertained such a fantasy. Whose child can you possibly be, if not hers? Were you
                  not born in this town? cannot every villager around give testimony to the fact
                  that you have grown up among them as Clarice Marcante?"
               "Yes, and to much more than that," replied the young girl, eagerly. "Look at this
                  stand—this mirror—at yonder chest of drawers, and call to mind the story of the
                  lady to whom they once belonged. She came hither, a refugee from Italy the year I
                  was born, and bore with her a babe a few weeks old. There was also a child in this
                  cottage; one of the infants died; it was said to be the stranger's babe, but I
                  sometimes doubt it. My reputed mother's hardness makes me feel that she who really
                  deserves the name is lying in her grave, and I am only a changeling."
               "If this were true, Clarice, what would you gain by the exchange? You are now
                  known as the child of respectable though humble parents. The history of this
                  stranger can only be guessed at, and may have been such as would not bear
                  examination. She died of a broken heart, alone, deserted by her former friends;
                  yet she had money, for it was the sum bequeathed by her to Mother Marcante that
                  has given her the comfortable position she now enjoys."
               "And that money enabled her to afford me such advantages of education as have
                  lifted me above the class to which I am supposed to belong. Much as she loves her
                  own children, Senora Marcante has made no effort to elevate them above their true
                  position."
               "Perhaps because she saw it would be a useless task. Your mother does not lack
                  judgment, and she can see what is best for each one of her children. Dismiss this
                  wild fancy, Clarice, and let us talk rationally together. Before dawn I must leave
                  you, and Guilio will be awaiting me upon my path, to hear such words as you may
                  send to him now. I have promised your mother not to play the traitor to her, but I
                  have her permission to bear your farewell
                  message to the poor lad who has loved you so long and faithfully."
               "Yes, and who merits better treatment than to be falsely deserted now. Tell him
                  this, Marie Montoni, and take heed that you repeat my words exactly as I say them.
                  'The mountains are high, and the macchià is
                  thick, but I fear neither, if the hand of a loved one guides me through
                  them.'"
               Marie shuddered as she looked upon the glittering eyes and colorless face of the
                  excited girl. She said:
               "Clarice, your words vindicate your claim to Corsican descent. Do you know that
                  they proclaim a vendetta, and your hand is to be won at the price of blood?"
               "Matra's blood or mine must be shed, for I repeat that I will take my own life
                  sooner than give myself to Baptisto. I loathe him. In the sight of heaven I am
                  already the bride of another; and Guilio must claim me at all hazards, for I will
                  not live through the day that forces me to wed his rival."
               "Would you indeed have courage to take your own life? To rush upon the unknown
                  future! Dear Clarice, do not speak thus, for it quite unnerves me."
               "Courage! yes—to die true to my love; but not to live the false and mean life that
                  must become mine as the wedded wife of Baptisto Matra. Marie, at my command Guilio
                  sought my mother on the public square, and made a last appeal to her. It failed,
                  and now extreme measures are pardonable. I will fly to the hills with the man of
                  my choice, and with him endure hardships of every kind, sooner than link my fate
                  with that of the loathsome creature they have chosen for me."
               "But how are you to escape now?"
               "A daring heart knows how to plan and execute. Guilio is no craven; let him hold
                  forth his hand, and I will spring to clasp it as my safeguard and defence.
                  Enough—I trust him, and he knows it."
               "And your mother—"
               "Is such no longer, even in name. The outlaw's bride will claim no kindred but him
                  for whose sake she gives up all. No home, save the wide canopy of heaven, with its
                  golden stars."
               "You can never bear the hardships of such a life. Poor child! you do not dream of
                  what is actually before you."
               "Have you not led a wandering life, and fared hardly enough, yet you
                  are alone. I shall be with him I love; his arm will sustain me when I
                  falter, his lips breathe hope to me when I grow weak; he will make my wild life
                  beautiful with his tenderness. Oh! Marie, is not this far, far better than to wear
                  my heart out with weariness in the luxurious ease which is its alternative? Shut
                  up in my gilded cage, as the prisoner of Matra, I should pine and die. Away in the
                  free mountains, sharing the life of him I love, I shall be happy in spite of
                  privations."
               Her face lost its pallor—a fine carnation tint spread over her cheeks, lighting up
                  her eyes with an expression of heroic tenderness, which was inexpressibly
                  captivating.
               Marie caught her enthusiasm, and she said:
               "You are right, Clarice. Your soul is no fitting mate for such as Baptisto Matra.
                  I have already said as much to your mother, but she could not view the affair in
                  the same light."
               "It matters not now," replied Clarice, with decision. "Let Guilio act promptly,
                  and I am ready to follow him to the hills. No true heart will blame me, for I have
                  been forced to take this course. Repeat my words to Guilio, and he will know that
                  my heart is firm—that all doubts have departed. I give him freedom to act."
               An hour before dawn, the improvisatrice emerged from the cottage of Dame Marcante, and by the light of
                  the stars found her way down a narrow path which wound toward the sea. She glanced
                  searchingly around her as she cautiously threaded her way toward a clump of bushes
                  a few hundred yards from the house. A dark form started from its shelter, and in
                  guarded but eager tones the voice of Guilio said:
               "You have seen her, Marie! My angel knows that the appeal to her mother was vain.
                  Is her courage now equal to the venture? Speak, I conjure you, for my soul is on
                  fire to learn if her heart is as strong as I know it is tender."
               "You do not trust her too far. Clarice will be true as steel, as you will confess
                  when I repeat her own words to you."
               "And they were—"
               "'The mountains are high, and the macchià is
                  thick, but I fear neither, if the hand of a loved one guides me through
                  them.'"
               A suppressed cry of exultation burst from the lover's lips, and he exclaimed:
               "My own noble and true one! Never shall she have cause to repent her trust in me.
                  I will rescue her, or die in the attempt."
               "But have you reflected on what is to be the price of success?" asked Marie, with
                  a shiver. "In this land of blood vengeance, a fearful penalty may be exacted."
               "True; yet I must risk taking the life of my rival; if he falls, I am
                  thenceforward an outlaw; but how many good and noble men have submitted to the
                  same fate in this unhappy land of ours. I shall only add one more to the ranks of
                  those who prefer wild freedom to ignoble bondage. Like a craven, I will never
                  stand by and see the girl of my heart given to a mean, senseless clod of clay,
                  who, but for the gold he has dishonestly scraped together, would only be
                  considered fit to grovel in the wayside ditch."
               "Yet it will be a sad thing to bring blood-guiltiness upon your head, Guilio. To
                  tear a tender fragile creature like Clarice from a comfortable home, to throw her
                  upon the chances of the wild life you must lead."
               Guilio laughed triumphantly, as he replied:
               "I have my secret too, Marie; but it is one I shall not betray just now. As to my
                  darling Clarice, my love shall be her shield and her trust. Better for such as she
                  the mountain side, with a true arm to sustain her steps, than the silken home in
                  which dullness and hate would take up their abode. Clarice could never live a week
                  as the wife of Matra; but with me she will be happy, in spite of evil fortunes;
                  yet the last I do not fear. I have enough—more than enough. Ah! you shall soon see
                  that fairy land has not exhausted all its marvels yet."
               There was a tone of joyous confidence in his voice which unconsciously inspired
                  Marie with a portion of his own courage, and she inquired:
               "What then are your plans? Mother Marcante is confident that the wedding will come
                  off to-morrow, with all the ceremonies usually practised among our people, and
                  your movements must be carefully planned, or you may yet be baffled."
               "In those very ceremonies lie my hopes of success. I shall play my part in the
                  festival, the end of which will be a little different from that which Senora
                  Marcante now anticipates. I will not betray my programme, Marie, lest the birds of
                  the air may whisper it to those who are interested in circumventing it. I will
                  only reveal the part assigned to you. So soon as the bridal cortège leaves the
                  cottage, you must hasten to the beach, and make a signal to be taken on a felucca
                  which will lie near the shore. When there, patiently await the arrival of my
                  bride, for she shall surely join you before the sun sinks towards the hills. Then we will steer to some neighboring
                  cove, whence we can reach the mountains without fear of pursuit. Already have I a
                  retreat prepared for my bride, for I have feared this termination to our betrothal
                  since Senora Marcante began to listen to the flatteries of Matra. Clarice has long
                  been pledged to me, but for that her mother cares not. The yellow gold has
                  jaundiced her heart, and she can see nothing but its glitter. You will not fail to
                  accompany us, Marie?"
               "No, for I love Clarice, and I owe you some kindness for past services; besides,
                  it is not my way to forget the hand which has helped me in my own time of need.
                  You will find me on the felucca."
               "Thanks, noble and true girl. I knew that you would stand by us in our need. And
                  now for an interview with Matra, for I must see him before the morrow dawns."
               "To what end?" asked Marie, in an alarmed tone. "He loves Clarice; he has all her
                  family on his side, and he will never give her up. Why raise his suspicions as to
                  the course you intend to pursue to-morrow?"
               "It is to lull them more effectually that I seek him. He does not dream that a man
                  of my class will risk the Vendetta. My humble craft they think is their
                  protection, but they forget that I am mountain born; that I have trod the alpine
                  hights as a free hunter before I tamed down my spirit to pursue my present
                  calling, that I might gain the means which would enable me to claim my bride. Let
                  them scorn me, till the blow is struck; I would give Matra one more chance to save
                  his craven life. If he forces me to take it, let his blood be upon his head!"
               "Blood! blood! blood!" repeated Marie, with a dreary intonation. "It is the curse
                  of this fair land. How prosperous, how happy we might be, but for this one plague
                  spot. The soil is desecrated by the deeds of its own children. Woe to us all that
                  it is so."
               "What better can you expect from such a history as ours?" asked Guilio, fiercely.
                  "Men of indomitable will, fiery courage, and free impulses, have been for ages
                  ground down beneath the heel of a foreign despotism. Too weak to battle with
                  success, yet never yielding utterly beneath the pressure of circumstances, we are
                  of that heroic Spartan mould which will fight to the death, and perish with arms
                  in our hands, sooner than yield up the sacred cause of Freedom. From our birth we
                  breathe the air of resistance, and in our madness we wreak upon each other the
                  evil passions which are its inevitable product. Yes—we are a wild and lawless
                  race, but how noble we might have become if Paoli, the great and good man, had
                  been permitted to carry out his plans for the freedom and elevation of his
                  countrymen. Let the fate of Corsica be what it may in the future, Marie, it is a
                  proud thought that this little island in the sea first gave birth to the idea of
                  constitutional freedom: that idea which has been acted on and so nobly carried out
                  in the New World. God grant that that great people may be found worthy to preserve
                  the priceless boon to the latest ages of time."
               "Amen!" responded the singer, as she held out her hand to bid him adieu, at the
                  point from which their paths diverged. "I shall pray earnestly for your success,
                  Guilio; and oh! may it be gained without the sacrifice of a human life."
               "I trust that your prayers may be answered; but, if blood must be spilled, I shall
                  not hold my hand where the treasure of my heart is at stake."
               The two separated—Marie to make her preparations for the voyage she had promised
                  to undertake on the morrow, and Guilio to seek the dwelling of Matra, for a last
                  appeal against the invasion of his rights as the betrothed of Clarice.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IV.
               BARNARDO MAKES A DISCOVERY.
               THE villa of Baptisto Matra lay just in the edge of the town, and its wide,
                  orange-shaded lawn swept down towards the sea in an undulating line of beauty. It
                  was an exquisite bijou of a house which had been erected by a man of artistic
                  taste who had wealth at his command. After a few years of luxurious ease in the
                  paradise his genius had created, Senor Manetti wearied of the monotony of his
                  life, and sold the place for a tithe of its cost. Baptisto Matra became the
                  purchaser, and he had the good taste to make no improvements of his own. The house
                  and grounds were kept in the strictest order under the supervision of his mother,
                  who was his housekeeper, and, until of late, his arbitrary mistress; for Senora
                  Matra was a woman of iron will, and even at the mature age of fifty her son had
                  not entirely emancipated himself from her control.
               In a most complacent frame of mind Matra recalled the musical praises which had
                  been lavished on him so lately; the brilliant wedding approaching so nearly, which
                  would give to his arms the fair pearl of Isola Rossa; and he laid the flattering
                  unction to his soul that Heaven smiled on all his plans.
               As Matra approached the verandah, he was somewhat surprised to see a tall,
                  stalwart figure seated in front of the entrance, smoking a Turkish pipe filled
                  with perfumed tobacco. The bright moonlight streamed full upon the marked features
                  and grizzled hair of this visitor, and the master of the mansion paused a moment
                  to recover his self-possession before he emerged from the shadow of the orange
                  trees that sheltered him from observation.
               The pipe was removed from the lips of the visitor, and after a brief survey of the
                  lawn, he impatiently muttered:
               "I warned the demented old dotard that I should be here to-night, and yet he goes
                  gallivanting after that white-faced girl who loathes him in her sight, and leaves
                  me to cool my impatience as I may. Why does he so perseveringly seek this poor
                  child? Matra is not a man to love with desperation, yet this marriage with a
                  portionless and unwilling bride has been pushed on by him with a fervor that would
                  almost make one think so. I must fathom the motive before we part; I must
                  understand the game he is playing. My tool shall have no secrets from
                  me, especially when I am quite ready to crush him out of my path if he annoys
                  me."
               Matra bent his ear in vain to catch the sense of these mutterings, and with a
                  feeling of chagrin at his want of success, he strode forward, and in a voice of
                  affected jocularity said:
               "How now, Captain Barnardo, what lucky wind has wafted you here to-night? I was
                  scarcely expecting to find so welcome a guest beneath my roof."
               The captain gruffly replied:
               "The business of which I warned you three weeks ago has brought me to Isola Rossa.
                  I sent you word that I should be here at night-fall, and here I have been waiting
                  nearly three hours for your appearance. How's this, pray? I am not used to play
                  the lackey, even to so great a man as Senor Baptisto Matro has lately become."
               "I have had no message from you. To whom was it entrusted?
               "I sent it through the usual channel. Luigni Roma was the bearer."
               "That explains all. Luigni lies stricken with fever in the cottage of his father,
                  and he has been delirious since his arrival at home."
               
               "Hm! it will be well for us both if he never recovers."
               "What do you mean?" inquired Matra, nervously.
               "Only that he may turn evidence against us in the affair of the Italian we——" He
                  stopped, and made an expressive gesture towards his throat. Matra became very
                  pale, and looked around with a terrified expression.
               "For heaven's sake, Barnardo, be more cautious. If any one should be in hearing,
                  we would be ruined. It makes my blood run cold to think of it."
               "Pooh! there's nobody to play the eaves-dropper. The servants have all gone to bed
                  ages ago, and I told your mother I would sit here and wait for you. Sit near me,
                  and we can talk over our matters confidentially."
               Matra took the seat to which he pointed, but it was with evident reluctance, and
                  he was very careful to place himself beyond the reach of his companion's arm.
                  Barnardo seemed to understand his motives, for a sardonic smile curled his lip,
                  and his tones were bitterly sarcastic, as he said:
               "It's too late for caution now, old fellow. My grasp is upon you, and you need not
                  think to play me either shy or false in the game we've embarked in. Like a
                  ninepin, such men as you can stand firm enough till the ball is bowled against
                  them, but when that comes, ça, scatter, plump
                  down you fall! The ball is rolling toward you, and I shan't put out my finger to
                  keep it back, I can tell you, unless you are on your good behavior with me."
               "My good Barnardo, this is strange talk to me. I do not understand your threats.
                  We have always been the best of friends, and I can see no cause of quarrel between
                  us now."
               "But I do, Senor, and a very grave one, too. As long as you had judgment to steer
                  clear of womankind, I had faith in you; but now you're going to risk everything by
                  taking a wife, a young and giddy one, too, it seems. Don't you suppose that she
                  will soon find out you are something worse than a contrabandista? that she will
                  blab it, as all her sex do? Then where are we, I should like to know?"
               Matra looked relieved.
               "Oh, if that is all, I can answer for the discretion of my betrothed.
                     My wife will never dare to speak of what I choose to have kept
                  secret."
               "You're mighty confident of your authority, but I've known men as secure as you
                  are, circumvented by the pestilent women to whom they trusted most. Besides, you
                  are about to make a most unsuitable match; this young girl might be your daughter,
                  or per Bacco, your grand-daughter, for that
                  matter; moreover, she loves another man, and of course detests you in proportion.
                  What can induce you to stoop to pick up this poor peasant girl, is more than I can
                  fathom."
               "Have you not looked upon her, and seen that she is fairer than most women?" asked
                  Matra, with a deprecating smile. "Men often prize beauty above station or
                  wealth."
               "Aye, but not such men as you. There is something behind all this display of
                  disinterestedness which I must understand. What advantage to yourself do you
                  propose to gain by this strange marriage? for I know you too well to believe that
                  you would hamper yourself with a wife that despises you, if you didn't expect to
                  make something by doing so."
               Matra affected to laugh, but there was an expression in the stern eyes of his
                  companion, which completely quelled him in spite of his efforts to sustain his
                  courage. He asked:
               "Why should you refuse to believe that I am so desperately enamored of this young
                  girl, as to render me careless to worldly advantages? I am sure she is handsome
                  enough to turn even your head."
               "Stuff! my head was never made light by any such nonsense sense since the verdancy of youth passed
                  away; neither is yours. You are to gain something by this match, or you would
                  never have pressed it on as you have. I must know your motives before we part; you
                  know me, Baptisto; we have rowed in the same boat too long to play false to each
                  other now. What is the secret of this affair?"
               Thus pressed, Matra seemed very much embarrassed for a reply. After several
                  moments of perturbed thought, he wiped the drops of excitement from his forehead,
                  and in a hoarse whisper, said:
               "Suppose the girl isn't what she seems? That she is in reality more than my equal?
                  What would you say to my choice then?"
               "Hum—I hardly know; but I am in the darkness yet. Speak to the point, if you
                  please. Who and what is she, if she is not really the child of Bianca
                  Marcante?"
               "I believe—nay, I am certain that she is a person of far more importance than the
                  child of the shrewd old peasant woman."
               He paused, and Barnardo impatiently said:
               "Then who, in the fiend's name, is she? What is this mystery, and how have
                     you discovered it?"
               "It is simple enough. Do you remember the papers of the Italian who was sent on
                  his long journey by us? They fell into my hands, while you preferred appropriating
                  the greater portion of the gold he had with him. I looked over these papers, and
                  they gave the clue to a most singular piece of family history. Barnardo, what I am
                  about to confide to you, will be held as secret as our other transactions
                  are?"
               "Assuredly, yes; honor among thieves has passed into a proverb, and it is not my
                  intention to violate its faith. Whatever I may think of the use you have made of
                  the information you have gained, I shall certainly not betray you; so now out with
                  it, man."
               Matra drew near to him, and, in a guarded tone, went on:
               "On looking over the papers, I was as much surprised as any one could be to find
                  that the man we had done for, was the agent of a wealthy nobleman in Sardinia,
                  sent hither to trace a woman and child, who were supposed to have taken refuge
                  near Isola Rossa more than seventeen years ago."
               The listener uttered an exclamation very like a groan, and his pipe-stem was
                  suddenly crushed between his teeth. He bent his head forward in breathless
                  interest, but he said nothing.
               Matra went on:
               "This lady was the wife of a man of rank, but she lived unhappily with him, and
                  after a scene of violence between them, she took her sleeping child in her arms,
                  and with a considerable sum of money concealed about her person, in the silence of
                  the night she left her home. Her evasion was so complete that no trace of her
                  could for years be obtained.
               "After anxious search for some clue to her place of concealment, her husband at
                  length discovered that she was landed at Cape Corso; thence she probably made her
                  way to Isola Rossa. The Italian was sent hither to ascertain if either mother or
                  child are yet living, as the latter has inherited a large property, which can only
                  be claimed after she becomes the acknowledged heiress of her father's name and
                  honors."
               Barnardo forced himself to ask:
               "And what has this romance to do with the daughter of Senora Marcante?"
               "Everything, as I will soon show you. I can remember all that has happened in this
                  town for the last thirty years, and I instantly recalled the delicate woman who
                  found shelter with the Marcantes at the very time referred to, for I was sometimes at their cottage in those days, and I
                  have often marvelled at the resemblance the peasant woman's child bore to the fair
                  stranger. I have for years had my suspicions that the living child of the Italian
                  lady was passed off as the daughter of her hostess. I do not know why this was
                  done, but that such an exchange was accomplished I have long been convinced; and I
                  kept a sharp eye on Senora Marcante in consequence of it."
               Barnardo laughed hoarsely; he rudely said:
               "Stuff! I don't believe in such an exchange at all. The girl has been reared here,
                  and never before has a doubt of her parentage been expressed. What further proof
                  have you to support your absurd idea?"
               "One that seems incontrovertible to me: While a little half-clad child, I have
                  often remarked a singular birth-mark upon the breast of Clarice; there are three
                  red streaks, in the shape of a cross, clearly defined upon her flesh. This mark, I
                  learned from the papers, is an heirloom in the family to which she belongs. Thus,
                  you see, the evidence that this girl is really the high-born heiress who is sought
                  for is clear to my mind."
               Some powerful emotion seemed to be struggling in the mind of the listener, but he
                  conquered it, and steadily said:
               "And the man we robbed and murdered was sent hither to seek and identify her? It
                  was an evil chance which caused that casket to fall into your hands,
                  Baptisto."
               "Why so, pray?"
               "Because it suggested to you a piece of villainy which will be likely to cost you
                  dearly in the end. Do you suppose that this beautiful young girl will remain with
                  you an hour after she ascertains her true position? that her family will permit
                  her to fill the station of your wife?"
               "Perhaps not," replied Matra coolly; "but she will at least be mine as long as I
                  shall be likely to care for her, and her relatives must pay me nobly to be rid of
                  me. Half her fortune will only release Clarice from the bonds the priest will
                  forge to-morrow. I care very little for the girl. Her lover might have taken her
                  and welcome, but for this discovery."
               "If that is the case, why not release the girl on the same terms, without asking
                  the services of the priest? Clarice would gladly relinquish the chances of
                  fortune, to escape from the marriage in which her reputed mother is forcing
                  her."
               Baptisto slowly shook his head:
               "No—that would not answer at all. She is too young to be bound by any contract she
                  might make, and those to whom she belongs are too powerful to heed it, if it did
                  not suit them to do so. My only safeguard is to make her my wife, and then the
                  terms of separation will be of my own dictation. The freedom from a misalliance
                  will be purchased at any price I may choose to set upon it."
               "Hum—there is something in that. But you have not told me yet to what family she
                  belongs. I suppose you ascertained that?"
               "That I have yet to find out, for the name of her family was carefully avoided. A
                  strange cipher was used to indicate them throughout the papers; but I have sent an
                  agent to Italy to make such inquiries as must soon develop something
                  satisfactory."
               "So-o—after all, you are venturing in the dark on such a move in the game of life
                  as this will be. The supposed heiress may turn out to be worth no more than if she
                  had really been Senora Marcante's child. I think you risk too much, if your heart
                  is not concerned in this affair."
               Matra looked confused, and after a pause, he said:
               "The girl is really as beautiful as the pictures of the Madonna donna, and I have a taste for beauty, as you know
                  of old. Besides, I have a grudge against this young Falcone, and it pleases me to
                  wrest her from him. They have long loved each other, and it is striking him upon
                  the heart to lay her hand in mine as my wedded bride."
               "And what of her?" asked Barnardo, significantly. "It is a poor
                  preparation for matrimonial felicity to bring a shrinking wife to preside over
                  your household. If what I have heard of this young girl be true, she has that fire
                  and spirit which will not render her a tame captive to your will."
               "Then she can go from me. I shall tire of her pretty face in a month, and the
                  bribe to give her up shall repay me for my brief sacrifice of freedom."
               Barnardo made a gesture of impatience. He arose and said:
               "Come, show me the papers which have given you this imaginary fortune. I may see
                  less in them than you seem to have found, for, by the mass! I have little faith in
                  this sudden elevation of little Clarice to the dignity of family and fortune."
               "Go with me to my room, and I will show you what will convince you that my actions
                  have been warranted by facts."
               Barnardo discarded his pipe, and followed his host into a lighted room fitted up
                  with much elegance. He looked around him with a strange gleam in his eyes, as he
                  drily said:
               "Ah-h, I remember much of this plenishing. But if your destined bride could only
                  know as well as I do the history of many of these articles of luxury and beauty,
                  she would be less than woman if she did not close her eyes in horror upon them.
                  Ah, here is the jewel-casket which the Neapolitan lady held to her heart till
                  death loosed her grasp, and here——"
               Matra threw up his hand in a paroxysm of fright, as he hoarsely exclaimed:
               "For Heaven's sake, Barnardo, cease such talk. Other ears than mine may hear your
                  words. I am only known as Matra, the rich trader, and you are the captain of one
                  of my vessels. Why should you speak in this reckless manner because you are
                  offended with me? I am willing to do all in my power to satisfy you, but you are
                  in so strange a mood to-night that I scarcely know how to take you."
               Barnardo threw himself into a luxurious fàuteuil, and after a painful pause, replied:
               "Have I not good cause to be in a bad humor? We are banded together as comrades
                  for good or for evil, and you are about to take to your home a Delilah, whose
                  craft will discover your secret occupation, and whose hatred to you will lead her
                  to proclaim it to the world. Content yourself with your legitimate gains, and let
                  this girl, and her possible fortune, go to whoever wants them. They will only
                  prove a snare to you."
               "That will I never do," said Matra, with more appearance of spirit than he had yet
                  shown. "If you were seriously opposed to the marriage, you should have spoken
                  before this time. It is too late now, for my pride would never brook a
                  disappointment after the publicity that has been given by my preparations for a
                  grand bridal. Here are the papers. Examine them at your leisure, while I smoke my
                  pipe."
               He took from a cabinet a box banded with steel, and secured by a strong lock. On
                  opening it, a sheet of paper closely written appeared, but it bore no address. On
                  the envelope was a laurel wreath drawn with a pen, enclosing a cipher through
                  which a dart was passed.
               An expression of intense yet painful interest passed over the features of Barnardo as his eyes fell upon this
                  symbol, and he hurriedly grasped the parcel and opened it.
               The directions to the agent were written in Italian, but they were expressed in so
                  terse and guarded a manner that nothing more could be learned from them than Matra
                  had already revealed. The man who had been dispatched to Corsica to discover
                  traces of a runaway wife, had taken passage upon the felucca commanded by
                  Barnardo. Its character was unsuspected by him, and to secure the money it was
                  discovered he had with him, the captain, aided by Matra, who happened to be on
                  board himself, dispatched him, threw him into the sea, and took possession of his
                  effects.
               Thus the temptation to a new crime fell into the hands of Baptisto, of which he
                  was not slow to avail himself. The papers in the possession of the murdered man
                  Barnardo had not considered of any importance; now, he felt with bitterness that
                  he had suffered a secret to pass into the keeping of Matra which was one of vital
                  importance to himself. He reflected silently, and made up his mind as to the
                  course he would pursue. His own carelessness had given Matra this advantage, then
                  why should he seek to balk him of his prize? Let him drain the golden Pactolus,
                  but he would take good care that the greater portion of his gains should at last
                  enrich himself.
               At length he raised his head and spoke:
               "I can enlighten you as to what this means," and he pointed toward the laurel
                  wreath and cipher.
               Matra eagerly asked:
               "Can you indeed do so, my good Barnardo?"
               "I have been much in Italy, as you already know, and I am acquainted with the
                  secret device of more than one noble family. These laurel leaves surrounding this
                  cipher point out to me unerringly their haughty owner, who is no less a personage
                  than Rinaldi Ernesti, senator and count, once the owner of a fair inheritance, now
                  living in his castle near Genoa, from lack of means to keep up his ancestral state
                  in the capital. If Clarice is his daughter, your dream of wealth from
                  her will prove as baseless as most dreams are."
               Matra looked shrewd.
               "You forget an important part of my communication. The daughter has inherited a
                  patrimony which renders it important to her father to reclaim her, hence his
                  anxiety to do so."
               "True; explain, if you please, that I may thoroughly understand the position of
                  this young girl."
               "The father made a plebeian alliance which turned out unhappily—his wife forsook
                  him, and concealed their child from his knowledge. One of her brothers became a
                  wealthy trader, and the fortune he amassed is to centre in this girl, provided she
                  is acknowledged by her father as the heiress to his name and honors. This much I
                  have known from the beginning, but I could find no clue to the family I am
                  ambitious to enter. Are you sure that it is the Ernesti?"
               Barnardo surveyed the crest with bitter meaning as he replied:
               "I have good cause to remember that symbol, but it is a matter of bygone days, and
                  I shall not consider it necessary to explain how or whence I obtained my
                  certainty. Suffice it to you that this young girl is Countess Ernesti in her own
                  right, and, as you say, the heiress to wealth. Once made aware of her existence,
                  her friends will take her from you, even if she is your wife; but that is your
                  affair, not mine. If you can salve your broken heart with a golden plaster, all
                  will be settled to your satisfaction, no doubt."
               "That can I do easily enough," replied Matra, with irrepressible exultation. "It
                  is a novel scheme for making ducats, but it will pay—it will pay nobly. At one
                  blow I increase my own fortune, and
                  gratify my grudge against Guilio Falcone. Yes—yes, I will bring down this highborn
                  maiden to the level of me and mine."
               The captain regarded him disdainfully.
               "Be sure of one thing, Baptisto, get quit of her before she has a chance to find
                  out what will elevate you rather higher than many of us care to go."
               Matra winced at this sneer, but he carelessly replied:
               "You can rely on me to take good care of our common welfare, for you
                  are in the same boat that bears me on to safety or punishment. I am no fool where
                  self-interest is at stake."
               "That's true enough; but I am tired now, and must rest a few hours before I seek
                  my bark again. My usual den is ready to receive me again, I suppose."
               "There is always a place for you under my roof. But you will stay to my
                  wedding?"
               "Excuse me. I do not care to see the pearl of Isola Rossa cast before the beast of
                  which the priest tells us. I shall leave before the ceremony comes off."
               Matra made an ineffectual effort to smile at this taunt, but there was an ominous
                  gleam in his deep black eyes, and his fingers worked nervously, as if ready to
                  clutch the knife he wore concealed upon his person; he coolly said:
               "Swinish as you may think me, there is not another girl in Isola
                  Rossa who would not have been glad of the chance to become Madame Matra."
               "Which only proves that they are a most tasteless and venal set of creatures.
                  There—good night; I have said all I mean to say, and I must rest—rest—rest."
               "Very well; but not in your usual room—now that it is fitted up for my bride's
                  dressing-closet. Come into the other wing—a place for guests has been provided
                  there."
               He took up a lamp, and led the way into a small apartment ment containing only a
                  bed and a single chair. The seaman threw off his coat, and without further
                  ceremony stretched himself upon the hard couch, grumbling as he did so:
               "It's just as I thought it would be. When a man thinks of marrying, his heart and
                  home narrow toward his old friends, as this place proves. See how mean it is, how
                  inferior to the accommodations I have hitherto claimed in this house. But it is
                  good enough, I suppose, for a rough old customer like me."
               "How could I know that you would come here just at this time?" asked Matra, in a
                  deprecating tone. "If you had warned me in time, I would have done better for you,
                  but when a man is on the eve of marriage he must get things ready for his bride,
                  even if his visitors are incommoded a little."
               "Yes, oh yes—I am not unreasonable. Only leave me to sleep now, for I have work to
                  do to-morrow,-work that must be thought on beforehand."
               "Good night, then, and success attend your labors, say I, for your industry fills
                  my coffers as well as your own."
               He closed the door as he went out, and Barnardo spoke through his set teeth as he
                  lazily turned himself upon his couch.
               "Perhaps the work in hand may have a contrary effect, my worthy friend. Wealth,
                  wife, home for you; while risk, hardship, and scant courtsey are my share of the
                  venture. The balance must be more evenly struck, or I give up the pirate craft,
                  and with it the respectable history of the successful Matra.
               "The husband of a countess—indeed! of a daughter of that race of strong will and
                  fiery courage: faugh! I trust the bride will prove her lineage by thrusting a
                  dagger in his heart as he stands beside her at the altar.
               
               "What? is it true? Can it be that the child of her I pursued and ruined by my mad
                  passion has grown to womanhood in a peasant's cottage? How could I be so blind as
                  not to know her the instant my eyes fell upon her! Oh, mine has been a wild, sad
                  fate, but my baseness toward that helpless woman is the darkest spot in its
                  wretched history.
               "Lawless crime, bold adventure, are nothing to falsehood that stabbed in the
                  dark—that crushed a feeble creature, because I had the power to arouse the
                  suspicions of a weak nature.
               "What atonement can I now make? Shall I snatch the girl from her vampyre
                  bridegroom? 'Tis too late for that, I fear; yes, the marriage must go on, yet I
                  wish I could prevent it. Strange! Hardened as I am, I cannot bear the thought that
                  this low-born churl shall claim Ginevra's child as his bride, even
                  for an hour. Blind fool! why did I not examine those papers myself, then Matra had
                  not obtained this advantage over me."
               He arose and walked to and fro in the narrow room in a a state of irrepressible
                  excitement. Plan after plan occurred to him, and finally he sat down to mature
                  that which seemed most feasible to him. He could not rest, for phantoms from the
                  long-buried past came flitting around him, and they effectually murdered sleep.
                  Matra would have shivered and grown pale, could he have fathomed the ruthless
                  intent with which his guest finally laid down, muttering:
               "That will wipe out all, and settle old scores. Falcone shall bear the blame, and
                  I will go free. I will possess myself of those papers, seek him, and
                  restore Ginevra's child to her birthright. That will be atonement for the wrong I
                  inflicted in those years of passion and crime. Ah! have they been followed by
                  anything better? worse—even worse. Darker and more infamous have my days become as
                  they have lengthened out."
               And, in a momentary paroxysm of repentance, Barnardo bent his head upon his arms,
                  and reviewed all the wretched and irrevocable past; yet his meditations ended in a
                  fixed resolution to add yet another crime to the dark catalogue already recorded
                  against him.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               A TERRIBLE COMPACT.
               IN the meantime, Matra walked the verandah, with his thoughts divided between
                  exultation at the near approach of the marriage which was to secure such brilliant
                  advantages to himself, and the vague fear which had entered his soul that, in
                  spite of the apparent concurrence of Barnardo in his views of self-aggrandizement,
                  he might yet attempt to circumvent them; for no one better understood the violent
                  and unprincipled nature of his colleague in crime.
               From his unscrupulous daring, Matra had hitherto reaped a golden harvest; but he
                  knew perfectly well that a feather's weight might turn this bold bad man into a
                  relentless enemy, and the glittering edifice of prosperity he had so successfully
                  reared, would thus come toppling down, crushing him beneath its ruins.
               Thus reflecting, Matra ground his teeth in impotent rage, and fingered the handle
                  of his knife with the vaguely formed intent to enter Barnardo's room as he slept,
                  and stab him to the heart.
               The temptation no sooner assailed him than it became irresistible, and three times
                  he crept to the door of the chamber occupied by his fearful guest; each time to
                  hear him moving within, and to curse him in his heart because he would not lie down and seek that repose which it
                  was his purpose to render eternal.
               Matra was returning from one of these expeditions, when a door was suddenly
                  unclosed, and the dark gipsy-looking head of an old woman was thrust through the
                  opening.
               "Who walks the house at this late hour?" asked a harsh voice.
               "It is I, mother. I cannot sleep—I have not yet been in bed."
               "Neither have I, my son. Come in, for I would speak with you."
               Matra entered a spacious chamber in which a light was still burning. The furniture
                  of this room afforded a striking contrast to that which was found in the remainder
                  of the house. It contained only the common articles in use in the houses of the
                  poorest peasants, and they all had an ancient, well-worn appearance. The light
                  fell upon a tall, spare form, wrapped in the black faldetta worn by the women of
                  Corsica, and its sombre hue seemed to give additional expression to the dark
                  features and gleaming eyes of the wearer.
               Those eyes were deep set, and black as night, absorbing every ray of light that
                  fell upon them, and emitting only flashes of scathing fire when the passions of
                  their owner were aroused. A true Corsican, the soul of this woman was iron, and
                  her blood was like seething lava when any fancied or real wrong assailed her. Her
                  features were sharply and clearly cut, and the firmly set mouth, with its thin
                  lips, showed that a resolution once taken was never departed from.
               That face, when deformed by passion, might have belonged to one of the furies, and
                  rarely did it wear a soft or womanly expression. She drew Matra far into the room
                  and stood so long silent that he ventured to ask:
               "What do you wish to say to me, mother?"
               Though the nominal master of the house, he had for years stood in as great dread
                  of this imperious woman as the very menials under her control. He had never dared
                  to oppose her wishes until the question of his marriage arose; then the importance
                  of the interests at stake gave him courage to act without her approbation, for she
                  resented the thought of a young wife in the home she had so long ruled over.
               In reply to his question Senora Matra impressively said:
               "I have been alone for many hours, and as I sat on yonder seat, I had a vision
                  which concerns you. I have called you hither to warn you—oh! my son, my son!"
               "A vision, mother? Tush! you have slept, and dreamed of me."
               "No," she impressively replied. "I have not slept; at times it seems to me that I
                  shall never sleep again, for the scene of blood that rises before me murders
                  sleep. Oh, Baptisto, this marriage is accursed, and it will bring only evil to
                  you—only evil!"
               "Nonsense, mother! Because you do not like Clarice, you bring every objection that
                  can be thought of against my marriage with her. I have reasoned with you in vain,
                  and now I must frankly tell you that I will not give up this match. I
                  do not often oppose you, but when my will is once fairly set against yours, you
                  see that it will carry the day."
               She wrung her hands wildly as she replied:
               "I feel that—I know it; but this disobedience will cost you all that is dear to
                  you—all, all. Hearken to my warning, and be saved in time; I sat upon my chair,
                  and a scene of violence arose before me. The fair temptress who is to be your fate
                  was torn from your side, and you fell bathed in your own blood. A voice spoke to
                  me, and I heard it distinctly tinctly
                  say: 'This girl is no fitting mate for a son of yours; he must give her up, or
                  dire ruin will come to him.' It was the voice of Fate, Baptisto, and must not be
                  disregarded."
               Her burning eyes were fixed upon him with an eager, questioning glance; but he
                  sneered as he replied:
               "Madam, when I have spoken of marriage you have ever opposed me; twice before this
                  you have had ominous visions when I thought of bringing a wife into my house. The
                  trick has become stale; I listened to you, and gave up my hopes of wedded
                  happiness in youth and in early manhood; now, I am fully matured, and capable of
                  judging for myself; I have too much at stake to be moved from my purpose. Clarice
                  becomes my wife to-morrow; that is my irrevocable determination."
               "And your old mother must be driven to the wall to make way for a young bride!"
                  she scornfully said. "Look at my room, and then go into those prepared for her
                  reception. If the peasant girl were a princess, greater pains could scarcely have
                  been taken to set her out daintily."
               "Mother, it has been your whim to surround yourself with the memorials of other
                  days. You can have whatever you choose to order, for I have the means of paying
                  for the most expensive things. It is my will to prepare what is handsome for my
                  bride, and no one in this house, not even you, shall gainsay me."
               The old woman looked into his heavy face, and saw there the expression of dogged
                  obstinacy familiar to her from his boyhood, and she felt that the sceptre had
                  departed from her. She bitterly said:
               "You refuse, then, to hearken to my warning? You believe it to be but a figment of
                  my own brain; well—perhaps it is, but there is prophecy in my blood, as events of
                  bygone years should have taught you. Spurn my counsels, laugh my visions to scorn,
                  but the end will come.
               I must remain here till after to-morrow; then, if the dream of blood is not
                  fulfilled, I will seek another home. The hut in which you first saw the light will
                  be a more welcome shelter to me than the roof which bends over my rival in your
                  heart and house. Let the young bride come as a living curse to the elderly dotard
                  that takes her to his heart. Why should I care if it be so? My day is past, and
                  the night speedily cometh."
               Matra still listened unmoved. He was weary of the thraldom in which he had been so
                  long held, and was glad to have it ended on any terms. He coldly said:
               "You must act as you choose, but there is no need that you should return to the
                  old ruin by the sea. There is a cottage on the hill side which belongs to me; you
                  can retire to that after my marriage; perhaps it will be best for us all that you
                  and Clarice should not attempt to live in the same house."
               A lightning flash was emitted from the eyes that rested on him, and the iron lips
                  assumed their most defiant expression. She spoke with cold precision.
               "Doubtless—doubtless such is your opinion, but who is to take care of what is
                  provided for the house? Who is to prevent you from being ruined by the waste that
                  will ensue if I leave the management of your affairs. Do you suppose that
                  white-faced chit knows anything about house-keeping? Her head is only filled with
                  vanity and folly, as you will soon find to your cost. Oh, yes, send the poor old
                  mother away by all means, and you will soon see what will come of it."
               "Mother, I only acceded to your own proposal; if you intend to stay here, say so,
                  in the fiend's name," replied Matra, goaded beyond endurance by her taunting
                  tones. "Let me tell you a secret. I only take Clarice on speculation,
                  as I would do with any other piece of property that promised a good per centage. Stay here or go away, as seems
                  best to you, but I do not believe she will trouble you long by her presence in my
                  house."
               The old woman regarded him searchingly, and she slowly asked:
               "What do you mean? How can this penniless girl become the source of fortune to
                  you?"
               "That is my secret. Clarice will have money—money which I will clutch and use for
                  my own benefit, while she may go adrift if she refuses to pay the respect due to
                  the mother of her husband."
               "Ah—h, is it so, indeed? Then my suspicions are correct! I have often marvelled
                  how Bianca Marcante should have a daughter so fair and delicate in her looks as
                  this young girl. It was her infant that was buried with the foreign
                  woman, and Clarice is the Italian's child. How did you find it out, Baptisto? and
                  why was such an exchange made?"
               "Pooh! you jump to conclusions too quickly, Madam. I did not mean to say that such
                  an exchange was made. It may be my own fancy after all."
               His mother disdainfully said:
               "I will have no half confidence. Tell me all you know of this girl's origin, or I
                  will seek her, and tell her what you have betrayed; she will then refuse to become
                  your wife, and I should be glad to break the match even on those terms, for my
                  soul is darkened with fears as to its results to yourself. However fair may be the
                  promise of this marriage, it will bring dire repentance to you, I feel
                  assured."
               Matra listened with a vague feeling of fear, for his mother had infused all the
                  superstitions of his country into his mind, and he fully believed in the prophetic
                  power she claimed for herself. At that moment a lugubrious cry was heard, and the
                  discordant wail of an owl swept through the air.
               "There!" exclaimed the old woman. "That baleful cry comes as the warning echo to
                  my words. Listen, and beware!"
               Matra shuddered, and spoke in a subdued tone:
               "Mother, I will tell you all, and then you shall decide as to my future course. I
                  will yield to your judgment in this affair, for I begin to feel that it will be
                  better than mine."
               Thus ever ended the contests between the imperious mother and rebellious son, and
                  a grim smile of superiority flitted over her lips as she replied:
               "That is well; now unravel this mystery to me."
               In as few words as possible, Matra told all he knew, or suspected, of the origin
                  of Clarice, and placed before his mother the proofs of her claim to a large
                  inheritance. She listened in silent astonishment to the revelation, and as he
                  proceeded, her innate reverence for station and fortune overcame even her
                  antipathy to the idea of a young wife in the house. She forgot or repressed her
                  forebodings of evil, and she eagerly said:
               "Countess Ernesti in her own right, with lands and gold as her dower? Are you
                  sure—quite sure?"
               "As sure as I can be of anything."
               "Then of course you must marry her. Matters have gone too far to withdraw now, and
                  I take back my objections. Bring hither your high-born bride, and I will do all
                  that is in my power to make her contented in her new home. Oh, this is a very
                  different thing to giving your hand to a poor peasant girl. You can claim the
                  title and become a count yourself. Ha! that would be grand for your father's
                  son."
               Matra shook his head.
               "I have no hope of that. I only expect to win gold by this marriage; beyond that
                  my ambition does not soar."
               
               "Then you are a baser fool than my son should be," replied the
                  bitter, taunting voice which had goaded him on throughout his whole life. "Why
                  should you not be Count Ernesti, if you become the husband of the heiress? It will
                  be your right, and any but a craven spirit would claim and enforce it."
               "Let us not discuss that now, mother. The night is passing away, and we must both
                  gain a few hours repose before the important to-morrow comes. Retire to bed, and
                  dream of my future greatness."
               "Good night, then, my son. See how much better it would have been to take me into
                  your confidence from the first. It would have spared me many hours of bitterness.
                  I now understand your course and approve it; bring your noble bride hither, and I
                  will seek to make her home happy for her."
               "And the vision of blood, mother? What becomes of that?"
               The woman shuddered, for she had faith in her own previsions, and she reluctantly
                  said:
               "The red cloud was certainly over me to-night. Blood—blood will be spilled, but it
                  cannot be yours, my son, for your fortunes are at their culminating point. Good
                  luck is with you, and its prestige will not desert you at a moment's warning. I
                  will close my eyes, and ask of the Fates once more; their answer may be less
                  ominous of doom than the one I fancied I had received to-night."
               "Better close them in sleep, mother, and suffer your diseased fancies to rest in
                  the oblivion best suited to them."
               Matra left the apartment, and the stern, hard old woman threw herself upon a seat,
                  muttering:
               "A countess, truly a countess, with lands and gold. Who would have thought it? and
                  I, with all my foreknowledge, could not tell it. I must have lost my power, and
                  the bloody phantom was only a sham."
               Among her associates Senora Matra had the reputation of being a witch and a
                  vampire, for the common people of Corsica believe in the existence of both, and
                  they confidently assert that to such creatures belongs the power to transform
                  themselves at will, and assume the form of a beautiful virgin or of a cat. To
                  protect themselves from the power of such mischievous persons, the peasantry wear
                  relics or amulets, and as Matra went out his mother remembered that one of these,
                  was in her own possession.
               Wishing to guard him in every possible manner from the danger she apprehended for
                  him, she sought it with eager haste, and with a grim smile took from a drawer a
                  small, square stone, with yellow scales like iron rust imbedded in it. After
                  muttering a few words over this, she followed Matra, and stumbled over him in the
                  obscurity of the hall, prowling near the door of his guest.
               "Why do you watch here?" she asked.
               "I merely wished to see if Barnardo sleeps yet," he replied, with difficulty
                  repressing the execration that arose to his lips.
               The door was suddenly opened, and the light of the lamp within the room streamed
                  upon them. Barnardo, with a short laugh, said:
               "By Bacchus, we all keep late hours to-night. Pray what brings you to my door, my
                  friends? Is it customary with you to set a watch upon the sojourner beneath your
                  roof?"
               "By no means," said Matra, in some confusion. "I have only been to visit my
                  mother, and she followed me to say a few words more, I presume. What is it that
                  you seek, Madame? Let Barnardo hear that he may not unjustly suspect me of spying
                  upon him."
               "That would be far from the truth; you will think me very foolish, I dare say, my
                  good Barnardo, but I came out to place this charm around my Baptisto's neck. It
                     will protect him from evil, and I have
                  had heavy fears for him of late."
               "Why should you be so foolish, Senora? for everything goes well with your
                  fortunate son. Give me the charm, for I am one of the reckless sort
                  who need its protection sadly."
               He held out his hand as if to take the stone, but the old woman tenaciously
                  grasped it.
               "No, no—this came from Seneca's tower, and it has been blessed by the holy father
                  with a purification in holy water. Its virtues are beyond price, and it must lie
                  upon the breast of my son as a safeguard against evil. Here, Matra, let me place
                  it beneath your vest, where you may wear it safe and unsuspected. My heart will be
                  easier when I know you have it about you."
               "It is nonsense; but if you will be happier I cannot refuse you," said Matra, as
                  he held his head to permit the cord attached to the charm to be passed over
                  it.
               Barnardo laughed mockingly:
               "Will that scrap of stone render him bullet proof, old lady? It is a very simple
                  thing to possess such power, and if you own another talisman, I shall be glad to
                  claim its protection myself, for I lead a reckless sort of life, and often need
                  something of the kind. I have been to Seneca's tower on the sea-shore, and I had
                  no idea the stones the old sage walked over possess such virtue, or I would have
                  gathered up quite a collection of them. With the blessing of the church, I suppose
                  any of them would be as good as this one."
               The woman dubiously replied.
               "Perhaps they might: but this has been to Rome, and the Pope himself blessed
                  it."
               "Then place it on Matra's breast by all means, for he will need its influence in
                  his new career as the respectable head of a family. If it teaches him to be true
                  to his comrades, it will keep him out of danger of being turned on and crushed
                  before he can lift his hand to defend himself."
               There was such a depth of savage meaning in the tones of the speaker, that Matra's
                  cowardly soul shrank and quivered within him. He said, in a deprecating
                  manner:
               "You suspect me of evil intent toward you, Barnardo; but I swear to you that I
                  have told you the truth as to the cause of my presence on this spot. Sleep in
                  peace and safety, man, for I am no midnight assassin, nor would I stain my hand
                  with blood on the eve of my marriage."
               Barnardo disdainfully regarded him. He suddenly turned on his heel and closed the
                  door. As the mother and son were hastily retreating he again opened it, and
                  spoke:
               "The door has no fastening, as you well knew when you placed me here; but that
                  matters not. I sleep with my hand upon my carbine, and the lightest step arouses
                  me. Look to it, friend Baptisto, for I will not again be interrupted with
                  impunity."
               Muttering curses upon him, Matra sought his own apartment, and threw himself upon
                  his bed; but vainly did he court sleep. His mind was filled with schemes of
                  aggrandizement, in which but one idea held a prominent place—the acquisition of
                  gold, the sole idol of his mean nature. The wrong he was ready to inflict on the
                  helpless girl he was about to make his wife, did not for a moment weigh against
                  the advantages that must result to himself from the brief union to which he looked
                  forward. By fastening such bonds upon Clarice, he gained the certainty of a large
                  sum to release her from his power, and in his mean and sordid soul, he exulted in
                  the thought that the refined and lovely daughter of a noble house would belong to
                  him; that he could crush her spirit, and humble her soul to the dust, before he gave her back the freedom for which so
                  heavy a price should be exacted.
               At length he slept, but in a light and perturbed manner, for the warning of his
                  mother, and the scowling aspect of Barnardo, had filled his mind with vague fears
                  which he could not reason away. A pale phantom seemed to swoop down, and clutch
                  him in its suffocating grasp; and after a violent struggle, he awoke to find the
                  hand of a man laid upon his breast. His first thought was that Barnardo had come
                  to take his life, and he prepared for a death struggle, in which he felt that one
                  or the other must perish.
               To his infinite relief the voice which spoke to him in guarded tones was not that
                  of the captain:
               "Hist! Matra! awake, and make no noise, for I must speak with you. I shall do you
                  no harm, but you must hearken to what I have to say."
               Matra aroused himself and sat up on the bed. The moon-light streamed into the open
                  window, revealing the means of ingress found by the visitor. In his perturbation
                  he did not recognize the voice of the speaker, and he gruffly asked:
               "Who are you? and how have you dared to enter my house in this manner?"
               "I am Guilio Falcone, and I seek justice at your hands," replied the visitor.
               "In what have I wronged you, pray? We have nothing in common, and I desire to have
                  nothing to say to you."
               "Yet I was the betrothed of Clarice Marcante before you sought her, and I have
                  come hither to warn you that it will be best for you to resign her to me."
               "And if I refuse, what then?"
               "Judge for yourself; I am a Corsican."
               "Ha! dare you threaten me with violence?"
               "I use no threats. You are too mean and cowardly to be warred on by me. I do not
                  seek your blood; but I will not quietly submit to have the idol of my life cast
                  into the arms of one who will make her miserable. Clarice loves me;
                  why, then, do you seek to carry out your selfish views in making her your
                  wife?"
               "Upon my word, you have enough vanity and impudence for a legion. The captain of a
                  fishing craft proclaims himself my rival, and demands of me the
                  relinquishment of my betrothed bride! Is there anything else in which I can
                  accommodate you, my humble friend? Will you also have a dower bestowed on her you
                  so gallantly claim?"
               "Money gained as yours has been I would not accept, even if the offer were made in
                  earnest. I possess a clue to your true character, Baptisto Matra, and I advise you
                  to weigh my demand well before you refuse it."
               The listener quailed before this threat, but he calmly said:
               "My true character is that of an honest and peaceful trader, as every man and
                  woman in Isola Rossa knows. I can defy you there; and I will take such precautions
                  in the morning as will defeat any plan you may lay to snatch my bride from me.
                  There—you have your answer; and now leave my house, before I have you arrested for
                  entering it like a burglar. Should I do so, how could you prove that your object
                  was not to plunder, perhaps to murder me?"
               "I could not only prove that, but so much more which would affect the
                  honorable station you claim, that I would not advise you to make the attempt.
                  Luigni Roma is dead; I was with him in his last hours, and heard from him some
                  important facts in which you are deeply interested. The character of the Violante
                  and her commander are known to me, and I am in possession of such proofs of the
                  nefarious traffic you have carried on for years as must crush you at once, if they
                  are produced."
               The heart of the listener stood still, and the cold dew of fear burst forth upon his brow. His soul fainted
                  within him before the magnitude of the danger that threatened him, and he
                  faltered:
               "Who and what are you, that your charges against me should be
                  listened to? You have come hither to obtain, by falsehood and threats, what you
                  could not gain by fair means."
               "Not so, Matra. Accident enabled me to serve Luigni, and thus Providence has
                  placed in my hands the means of rescuing the girl I love from the wretched fate
                  you would give her. Relinquish all claim to Clarice, and your secret is safe with
                  me."
               "But I, too, love this girl."
               "And she loves me. A man worthy of the name will not take as his wife
                  a woman who would sooner embrace death than become his. If your plans for
                  to-morrow could be carried out, the bride you would force to the altar would be
                  found slain by her own hand, before she could be installed as the mistress of your
                  household. I speak calmly, though I know that I speak truly."
               "What proof have I that your assertions are not false? That you are not seeking to
                  impose on my credulity, that you may gain your own ends without danger to
                  yourself?"
               Falcone whispered a few words in his ear, and Matra reeled as if about to faint,
                  but he struggled to regain the mastery of himself, and after a pause, said:
               "You know too much to be defied. But what will the people of the town say, if I
                  give up my bride without a struggle?"
               "There can be an apparent struggle, in which it will be your business to make sure
                  that I and my party shall come off conquerors. All the forms of a Corsican
                  marriage are to be carried out, I understand, and I can easily seize the bride and
                  bear her away, while your friends shall believe that you would have kept her, if
                  you could have done so."
               "Let it be so; you have outwitted me," said Matra, with reluctance. "But you must
                  swear upon the cross that if Clarice becomes yours, you will never betray the
                  dying revelations of Luigni."
               "I swear it," and Falcone drew from his breast a crucifix of carved ebony, which
                  he devoutly pressed to his lips.
               "It is well thus far, and now for the morrow. How do you propose to carry out your
                  purpose?"
               "A wise strategist never betrays his plans, especially to the enemy," replied
                  Guilio, with calm decision. "Go on your way to the bridal, and leave me to swoop
                  down like my namesake, and snatch my white dove to my breast."
               "But—but, shall I be quite safe from harm?"
               A disdainful smile curled the lip of the youth:
               "I have already assured you that I seek not your blood. You know something of my
                  past life, and you also know that the captain of the fishing-smack stands fair
                  with men as one whose word is to be trusted."
               "Yes—I am aware of that; but answer me one question. Are you the sole possessor of
                  my secret?"
               "I alone heard Luigni's confession. When the priest came to him he was speechless,
                  and scarcely conscious of the last rites of the church."
               A sinister smile crept to the lips of Baptisto, and he quickly replied:
               "It is well. Make your arrangements to seize your coveted bride, and leave me in
                  security. It will be a good exchange for me, for my mother is opposed to the
                  entrance of a young wife into the house she has so long ruled; and where women
                  disagree there cannot be much peace."
               "You then pledge yourself to make no resistance to my attempt to carry Clarice
                  off?"
               "I do; and now let us part. Day is breaking, and there is much before us
                  both."
               
               Falcone glanced through the open window, and saw that the light of the moon was
                  fading before the rosy dawn of a brilliant day. He impressively said:
               "I trust to your pledged word, Matra, and if you attempt to forfeit it, the
                  penalty to you will be more terrible than you think."
               "I comprehend," growled Matra, "that both my life and fortune are held in your
                  hands. Take the girl as the ransom, and leave me in peace."
               "So be it," and Falcone passed rapidly from the room. A few steps brought him to
                  the entrance, but as he stepped from the piazza a lance whizzed past him and
                  buried itself in the body of a tree which stood in front of the house. The first
                  impulse of the young man was to rush back, pistol in hand, and punish this
                  dastardly attempt upon his life, but prudence conquered. He felt assured that he
                  held the events of the next few hours under his own control, and the cautious use
                  of the means at his command would secure to him the hand of his adored
                  Clarice.
               He called out:
               "Beware, Matra. Your treachery shall meet its just reward if you again attempt it
                  toward me."
               Before the words passed his lips he had placed himself behind the shelter of the
                  thick shrubbery; and, baffled in his attempt, furious against the audacious
                  fisherman, Baptisto muttered imprecations against him, and vowed in his heart to
                  circumvent his plans, and preserve his own respectability by compassing the
                  destruction of him who could impeach it.
               He turned from the open window, and beheld Barnardo standing within a few feet of
                  him. He sternly asked:
               "What does this mean? What has brought Guilio Falcone here at such an unusual
                  hour? and why have you made so insane an attack upon his life? I heard voices
                  engaged in conversation, and I came hither just in time to see the shaft thrown
                  after him."
               "How then did you know this intruder to be Guilio Falcone?" asked Matra,
                  suspiciously.
               "His voice is familiar to me—what does his parting threat mean? What power can
                     he have which can make you fear him?"
               "We are equally in his power. He was with Luigni Roma at the last; he is fully
                  aware of the character of the Violante and her commander, and he came hither to
                  make a strange compact with me."
               "I am interested; pray repeat to me all he said. Falcone is no vulgar fisher-lad,
                  but a free son of the mountains, who, for a season, submits to the drudgery of an
                  humble calling, that he may gain the means of independence. I have more respect
                  for him than I cherish for most men; and—but no matter. What brought him hither,
                  and what did he reveal to you, which nerved your cowardly soul to the task of
                  attempting his life?"
               "What will nerve your ruffianly one to the same effort," savagely responded Matra.
                  "Listen to me, and then say if I did not well to make the attempt to kill him,
                  even if it failed."
               Barnardo made an imperious gesture, and Matra went on to relate the particulars of
                  his interview with his rival with tolerable accuracy. He ended by saying:
               "He was fool enough to say that he is the only person in possession of Luigni's
                  dying revelations; and when he is settled with, we shall be safe. Give up my
                  betrothed, indeed! I shall do no such foolish thing. Let it be your task,
                  Barnardo, to see that this braggart boy is dealt with speedily, and my
                  marriage-feast without interruption."
               "And what shall be my reward therefor?" asked Barnardo, coldly. "Will it be
                  another attempt to put me where I shall
                  be powerless to injure you? Three times this night have you prowled at my door,
                  with fingers clutching the handle of the knife you would have driven home to my
                  heart had I been so unwary as to sleep; yet now you ask my aid to put a dangerous
                  rival from your path."
               Matra listened with a sinking heart, but he warmly said:
               "You malign me most foully, Barnardo; but I let that pass. Do me this last
                  service; enable me to claim Clarice as mine to-morrow, by removing this young
                  desperado from my path, and there is no demand you can make which I would think
                  too extravagant a reward for the service. Get rid of him in the only safe manner
                  for men implicated as you and I are, and name your own terms."
               Barnardo seemed to reflect a few moments, and then asked:
               "Does Falcone really propose to snatch the girl from you at the very altar?"
               "Such is certainly his intention, and unless you interpose, he will accomplish
                  it."
               "And you consented to this?"
               "Why, what else could I do, when I am so utterly in his power? You must take his
                  life this day, or we are both ruined. If you fail to do it, I shall lose the
                  brilliant alliance which is to make your fortune and mine."
               "How much is my interest in the stake you are playing for?" asked
                  Barnardo, significantly.
               Matra hesitated.
               "Let me see; a fourth of all I shall gain. That will be a noble bribe."
               "That may, or may not be, but I am not satisfied with it. We must go halves if I
                  undertake this dangerous counterplot. The danger will be mine, the gain must be
                  shared equally."
               Matra grew white with rage. He said:
               "Are you not equally interested in getting rid of this witness against our
                  traffic? You appear to forget that."
               "Aye—but our positions are different. I am a reckless dare-devil, who cares
                  nothing about the opinions of men; and I would as soon hoist the black flag
                  openly, as throw out the one that now floats over my craft; but you have your
                  respectability to care for, your comfortable home to preserve—perhaps even your
                  life. I can sail away to-day safe under my own canvas, but you must stay here to
                  abide the action of the law, or exchange the life of ease you love, for my
                  reckless, roving career."
               Matra shuddered at the possibility thus presented, for his was not that wild
                  Corsican nature which delights in action, and seeks atonement for every wrong in
                  the blood vengeance. He was essentially a man of peace, and he had also reached
                  that time of life in which repose was necessary to him. He reluctantly said:
               "I told you to name your own terms, and they shall be granted, provided you assure
                  me the possession of this young girl as my wife."
               "It is well. Make over to me the unconditional control of the Violante, and my
                  hand shall dismiss a soul to its account before the sun that is now rising shall
                  have descended in the west. Write down the terms of our agreement."
               Matra sat down by a table, on which lay paper and pens, and rapidly dashed off a
                  few lines to which he placed his signature. Barnardo scanned them carefully, and
                  with a strange smile, said:
               "Right, right; I am bound to take a life within the next few hours;
                  but whose shall it be? Ah—h! whose shall it be?"
               "Your enemy's, of course. What can you be dreaming of, Barnardo?"
               
               "Of Retribution," replied the brigand, vacantly. "It never fails, but
                  its instruments are sometimes strangely chosen. Good night, or rather good
                  morning, Matra, for there comes the sun. I must be acting, acting, if I would
                  redeem my pledge."
               "You will not fail me?" asked Matra, with solicitude, for there was something in
                  the manner of his companion which inspired him with distrust.
               "My hand never fails," replied Barnardo, with ominous emphasis; and
                  he stalked from the house without another word. When he reached the gate, he
                  turned and looked back at the palazzo, with its beautiful surroundings, and a
                  heavy frown gathered darkly over his brows as he shook his hand menacingly toward
                  it.
               "Fatal walls in which to bring a helpless girl to share the life of a concealed
                  brigand. For once I will aid the cause of justice, let what will come of it. Last
                  night that creature would have killed me had I slept while tarrying beneath his
                  roof; yet now he asks me to dye my hands in the blood of an innocent man, to save
                  him from the shame he merits. Aye, Matra, a life shall be taken, but
                  time will prove whose it shall be. A few hours more, and you and I will be
                  quits."
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               BRIDAL REVELRY. AN UNEXPECTED RESCUE.
               THE cottage of Dame Marcante displayed a scene of bustle and gaiety befitting the
                  importance of the event about to be celebrated. A triumphal arch formed of
                  evergreens and flowers, decorated with streamers of gay ribbon, was erected in
                  front of the house, and the friends of the family, dressed in their gayest
                  habiliments, were assembled there at an early hour to form an escort for the bride
                  to the residence of her future husband.
               The marriage ceremonies in Corsica are very striking and peculiar, and it was
                  Matra's intention to follow them in every particular. No expense had been spared
                  by him to render his bridal feast the most remarkable that had been given for
                  years among his class in the town. The keen trader knew that the liberal
                  expenditure of money would silence the mutterings of those who marvelled at the
                  rapidity with which he accumulated it, and he lavished his abundance without stint
                  on this auspicious occasion.
               The pale bride sat in her room listening intently to every sound from without, and
                  her poor heart alternately thrilled with hope, or sunk in the cold apathy of
                  despair. Ninetta was dressing her hair, and her dark, heavy features and
                  uncultivated expression, formed a striking contrast to the grace and natural
                  refinement visible in the colorless face brought in such striking comparison with
                  her own.
               The features of Senora Marcante's daughter were of the common Italian type, but
                  there was the beauty of youth and freshness in the full lips and ruddy cheeks of
                  the peasant girl. She wore a scarlet silk dress, the gift of the bridegroom for
                  this especial occasion, and was adorned with a profusion of gold jewelry, much of
                  which came from the same liberal donor. Ah! could the girl have known the history
                  attached to each one of these ornaments, with what superstitious horror would she
                  have shrank from permitting them to touch her innocent person.
               Ninetta wove in the last orange blossom, and marvelling at the apathy of Clarice,
                  lifted a filmy white robe from the bed, as she exultingly said:
               "See, Clarice, this dress is as elegant as the baron's daughter could afford. You are a silly girl to look
                  so white and wretched, when the rich Matra is ready to lavish all his fortune upon
                  you. Oh! I wish——"
               "Not that you were in my place, I hope, Ninetta," said the unhappy bride. "Matra,
                  in spite of his wealth, is no more a fitting mate for you than he is for me."
               "You mean he is too old for either of us, and that is very true; but mother says
                  that you must marry him because you are unfit to labor, and he can keep you like
                  the greatest lady in the land. Well, I confess that I love pretty things and fine
                  things, but if I must take a husband three times my own age to get them, I believe
                  I would rather let them alone, after all. Yet it's very grand, Clarice, to have
                  such a wedding as yours will be, and to wear such a dress as this. I declare you
                  are as beautiful in it as the Princess in the fairy tale."
               Clarice neither smiled nor blushed at this flattery. The painful tension of her
                  heart seemed to have locked the life current around it, and she scarcely
                  comprehended the prattle of her companion. She watched for some token from Guilio
                  that measures had been taken for her rescue from her threatened fate, and as time
                  passed on without bringing such assurance, her fingers mechanically wandered
                  toward the handle of the poniard which was concealed beneath the snowy folds of
                  her bridal robes.
               There was Roman resolution in the heart of that fragile girl, and her mind was
                  made up to escape the degradation of becoming Matra's wife by suicide, if no other
                  avenue opened before her.
               Ninetta opened a casket, and took from it a necklace of Roman pearls.
               "See," she said, "what a magnificent set of jewels Matra has sent, with the
                  request that you will wear them to-day. Oh! you must like him in
                  time, Clarice, for he is liberal as a prince. He will make you such a grand lady,
                  that I shall soon feel almost afraid to call you sister."
               "Child, do not speak thus!" exclaimed Clarice, impetuously. "When this man has
                  reduced me to the level of his wife, I shall be unworthy to lift my
                  head in the light of day. Then you may blush to claim me, but never—never think it
                  an honor to barter all that is precious in the human soul for the ease that wealth
                  may purchase. Ninetta, whatever my mother may do with me, I charge you never to
                  permit yourself to be bartered away as I have been. It is sinning before God and
                  man, to permit the priest to bless such a union as this will be."
               The girl looked into her pallid face, with her dark eyes blazing with excitement,
                  and almost shrank away—for she could not understand the nature she had to deal
                  with. While Clarice was uttering this passionate outburst, Senora Marcante entered
                  unperceived. She imperiously said:
               "He will seldom bless one that promises to be more fortunate. You do well in the
                  last hours left you beneath your mother's roof, to endeavor to instigate your
                  young sister to rebel against my authority over her. How have you fared in your
                  own efforts to do so? Ninetta can take warning by your failure, and learn from it
                  that I rule the destiny of my children."
               Clarice turned toward her, and the eyes of the two met in an unflinching gaze: She
                  firmly said:
               "If I believed in the validity of your claims upon me, I might be more willing to
                  yield obedience to your commands. Madam, the appeals of your daughter
                  would have been listened to, but I have been crushed into subjection, and no voice
                  allowed me in the arrangement which is to thrust me into a position of utter
                  misery. Oh, it is cruel, cruel, to outrage a human being thus!"
               
               The face of the listener was alternately flushed with rage and pale with
                  apprehension. Her black eyes flashed with passion as she stood in front of the
                  bride, and said:
               "I have done no more than every parent is bound to do. As my child, you belong to
                  me till I give you to the man I have chosen as my son-in-law. The idle fancy which
                  has fixed itself in your demented brain, may as well be laid at rest. You are but
                  the peasant girl of Isola Rossa, and the daughter of humble parents. Matra stoops
                  to lift you to his level, and it is my will that you go with him to his home. It
                  is disgraceful for a girl to proclaim her aversion to her bridegroom upon her
                  wedding morning."
               The eyes of Clarice gleamed with a singular light, and her white lips slightly
                  curled as she said:
               "What you may consider even deeper disgrace than that, may fall on you before this
                  day is passed, Madam. I make no idle threats, but I bid you beware of what may be
                  done by one driven to desperation as I am."
               "Stuff! you're trying to imitate Marie Montoni in her play-actoring, but it won't
                  do with me. I have all my wits about me, and I know that you can't help yourself
                  now. You are as safe to be made the wife of Matra as if the priest had already
                  pronounced the blessing. I came in now to tell you that the people are waiting,
                  and it is time to form the procession to Matra's house. Come, Ninetta, put the
                  pearls upon her neck and arms, and all will be ready."
               Thus bidden, the girl held up the rich necklace again; the eyes of Clarice fell
                  vaguely upon it. Two of the beads were slightly discolored, and she put back the
                  ornament with a shudder as she muttered:
               "No, no—it is stained with blood. See, the red spots have been partly removed, but
                  they still show plainly. They shall never touch me—never!"
               Senora Marcante regarded her as if she believed that insanity had really attacked
                  her. She said:
               "It was Matra's wish that you should wear them to-day, but it matters not. You are
                  at liberty to reject his gifts if they do not please you, but you shall not refuse
                  his hand. Come, then, your toilette is finished, and there is no need to wait
                  longer."
               "She has no bouquet," said Ninetta, hurriedly. "Marie promised to send one, but it
                  has not come yet."
               "Never mind; one can easily be made from the loads of flowers in the house.
                  Hasten, and bind one together."
               Ninetta went toward the door, but as she unclosed it, a girl presented an
                  exquisitely arranged bouquet, with the words:
               "From Marie Montoni to her friend Clarice, with assurances of hope and happiness
                  in the union before her."
               Clarice cast a lightning glance upon the flowers; a pale rose tint gleamed upon
                  her cheeks, and she pressed them to her lips and heart. Tears sprang to her eyes,
                  and after a brief moment of intense emotion, she turned toward the harsh woman who
                  was intently watching her, and said:
               "Pardon me for all my waywardness. I am ready now to join our friends, and go upon
                  the path to meet my bridegroom. My will has passed beneath the control of others,
                  and I submit to the decrees of fate."
               "Hum—I thought you would be reasonable when nothing but submission was left to
                  you. It's well that you have come to your senses at last, for I began to fear that
                  Matra would be compelled to put you in the lunatic asylum, sure enough. He is a
                  fine fellow, and you will soon find that you can be very happy with him."
               Clarice scarcely heard her words. Her whole form seemed transfigured by the new
                  hope breathed into her soul by the touch of the magic flowers. The solution of
                  this was, that Marie had agreed upon a
                  certain arrangement of them if the plan for her rescue promised success, and the
                  white rosebud that crowned the bouquet, surrounded by a circle of scarlet
                  geranium, informed Clarice that Guilio would snatch her from the fate she so
                  deeply dreaded.
               As she appeared, the women, in their gala dresses, crowded around her, offering
                  congratulations and wishes for her happiness and prosperity. These were received
                  with the modest grace which had ever characterized her in her intercourse with the
                  people of the town. With some effort she at last gained the door; on its threshold
                  stood a youth in the picturesque and highly-ornamented costume of the country, and
                  bowing lowly before the young beauty, he uttered the address prepared for him.
               "Fair pearl of Isola Rossa, why will you leave the home of your childhood? In your
                  new abode do you hope to find warmer hearts or truer joys than have been yours
                  beneath the tender care of a mother's love? What have you needed that her
                  generosity has not supplied to you? Flowers bloom around you, and friends cluster
                  on every side, yet you have elected to leave all these blessings, and seek
                  happiness in a new sphere. We cannot deny you this privilege, and we have gathered
                  here to-day to offer you our warmest wishes for your happiness in the new career
                  that opens before you; to bid you a most affectionate farewell before you change
                  your name and station."
               With forced composure Clarice listened to this address, and a few tears forced
                  themselves from her burning eyes. At its close she put forth her hand, and placed
                  in that of the speaker a small sum of money as a tribute to the commune, while she
                  gracefully thanked him for his kind wishes.
               He bowed profoundly over the fair hand, and stepped back to permit a party of
                  youths adorned with gay streamers of ribbon, to bring forward a horse, gorgeously
                  caparisoned, for her use.
               Clarice was placed upon the saddle, and with flowers, banners, and fluttering
                  scarfs, to the sound of glad music, she was escorted beneath a triumphal arch
                  formed of orange and myrtle boughs, toward the house of the expectant Matra,
                  followed in procession by the crowd, in whose dress the love of gay colors,
                  indigenous to a southern land, was brilliantly displayed. A wheel surrounded with
                  many spindles, and decorated also with long streamers of ribbon, was borne before
                  her toward the dwelling of the bridegroom. This was intended to indicate the
                  thrift and economy she was expected to practise in her new career.
               Once in the open air, the poor girl seemed to breathe more freely, and she looked
                  around with an eager, searching glance, in the hope that her bridle rein would at
                  once be seized, and herself borne away to a place of safety, before the crowds
                  that thronged the streets could behold her thus exhibited as the bride of
                  Matra.
               In spite of the assurance she had so lately received, her heart sank within her as
                  she saw no such indication, and summoning all her courage to her aid, she prepared
                  for the trying ordeal before her.
               The procession moved slowly forward, amid a continuous uproar, kept up by
                  mandolines and bagpipes, increased by the firing of guns at intervals. Wine had
                  been lavishly distributed at Matra's expense, and the air was full of rejoicings
                  and congratulations.
               At length they came in sight of Matra's villa, in front of which a magnificent
                  triumphal arch had also been erected, beneath which his friends stood to receive
                  the shrinking bride. No demonstration toward a rescue had occurred, and Clarice
                  felt as if the grasp of some terrible fate was upon her as her eyes fell upon the
                  dark, repulsive face of Matra, who stood
                  in the doorway, radiant with the certainty of a long cherished hope brought to its
                  fulfilment. Her senses reeled, and she felt as if she must fall from her saddle. A
                  voice breathed in her ear:
               "It is not yet too late—sustain your courage, Senora. All will be well."
               She glanced around, but saw no one on whom she could fix as her consoler in this
                  trying moment; but the assurance contained in his words revived her, and she could
                  smile on the two youths who rushed in hot haste from the bridal escort to contend
                  for the honor of presenting to her the key of her new home. The swiftest rider won
                  this privilege, and he triumphantly galloped back, bearing in his hand a flower as
                  a symbol of the key. Clarice received it mechanically, for in spite of the hope
                  she cherished, a cold dread crept over her that her fate would be sealed if she
                  entered beneath that detested roof as the pledged wife of its owner.
               As the party halted in front of the arch, a young man of great beauty stepped
                  forward, and offered her an olive branch bound with ribbons, and gave her the
                  usual welcome in a set speech.
               "We bring to you, oh! chosen of the noble Matra's heart, the symbol of peace. May
                  its gentle spirit dwell with you through all your wedded life; may every blessing
                  crown your happy future, and joy go hand in hand with prosperity."
               The speaker might have gone on, but he saw the expression of intense suffering in
                  the face of the poor victim, and he bowed profoundly, and made way for the other
                  actors in the pageant. There was no evidence of a stir among the crowd, and
                  nerving herself anew for endurance, Clarice passed beneath the arch, while a
                  number of women and girls showered upon her flowers, rice, and grains of wheat,
                  from the verandah on which they stood. The fruits of the season were thrown among
                  the escort, who eagerly caught and devoured them, while cries of welcome and
                  wishes for good fortune to the bridal pair, arose in shrill chorus.
               From the rejoicings, a stranger would have thought this the happiest and most
                  suitable marriage that had ever taken place in the town; but one glance upon the
                  pale, excited face of her who bore the chief part in the pageant, must have
                  revealed a very different story.
               Many knew the reluctance with which Clarice had been forced into this marriage,
                  and some speculated as to how it would end; for it was known to all present that
                  Giulio Falcone was not a man tamely to submit to have his promised bride given to
                  another at the bidding of her imperious mother. An old man who for the occasion
                  played the part of father to Matra, advanced to receive the cortège of the bride,
                  and thus addressed them:
               "Who are you, who have come hither bringing with you this fair girl? Shall we
                  welcome you as friends, or treat you as enemies? Are you the accepted escort of
                  this gentle lady, or have you carried her off by violence? You, however, look to
                  me like true and honorable men."
               The attendants of the bride replied:
               "We are gallant and honorable cavaliers, and we bring this beautiful and charming
                  virgin as a pledge of love and friendship. We have gathered the choicest flowers
                  as an offering for the happy bridegroom."
               "You are welcome, friends; enter and partake of the banquet prepared for our
                  guests."
               The old man then lifted the trembling Clarice from her horse, embraced her with
                  fatherly tenderness, and conducted her within the house. Here came the trial she
                  had hoped to be spared—the exultant bridegroom stood upon the threshold to receive
                  her, and she felt his coarse lips pressed upon her own, his polluting arm enfolding her form, with a fierce feeling of
                  repulsion which impelled her to snatch the stiletto from her breast, and thrust it
                  in his heart. The motion she made to effect this was detected by one who evidently
                  followed her footsteps closely, and the same voice which had before spoken to her
                  again softly breathed:
               "Watch and wait; help often comes at the eleventh hour."
               Clarice dropped her hand, and looked around; she beheld only the smiling faces of
                  friends and neighbors, from whom this warning could not have come; but she gained
                  courage to maintain her outward calmness in the certainty that the hope of a
                  rescue yet remained to her.
               Senora Matra came forward, pressed her icy lips to the brow of her new daughter,
                  and uttered a few sentences of welcome which she vainly endeavored to render
                  cordial. Clarice mechanically received them, and the old woman registered this
                  indifference against her for future punishment, for her bitter, hard nature had
                  again asserted itself, and she could not forgive the young girl for the possession
                  of the very advantages which had led Matra to seek her as his wife.
               A magnificent collation was served, and the health and happiness of the pair were
                  enthusiastically drank by the guests. Clarice could eat nothing, but she could not
                  refuse the wine that was pressed upon her at all sides; and the small quantity she
                  sipped from the overflowing bumpers filled for her, gave her strength to go
                  through with all that lay before her.
               It was now time to proceed toward the chapel, which was situated on Matra's land,
                  and stood within a grove a few hundred yards from his gate. Candles were already
                  lighted upon the altar, and branches of myrtle were placed on every available
                  spot.
               Again the procession formed, and Matra, with the air of a sultan towards his
                  slave, took the passive hand of his bride within his own. Its cold touch induced
                  him to glance into her face, and what he read there caused his swarthy features to
                  grow purple with rage. He could not resist the impulse that moved him to bend
                  forward, and hiss into her shrinking ear:
               "Never mind, Senora. You are now mine, and I will soon make you feel
                  that you shall fear me, if you will not love me."
               At the same moment he clutched her hand with such force as almost to compel her to
                  cry out. The helpless girl cast a bewildered glance around, hoping that some new
                  token might be given her of the presence of at least one friend near her; her eyes
                  fell upon the figure of a tall man with a priest's cowl drawn over his features.
                  He made a rapid sign with his hand, and she felt reassured in a measure, though
                  her heart beat rapidly, and a vivid blush succeeded the late paleness of her
                  complexion.
               Matra led her forward, and the bridal party issued from the house. The bridegroom
                  looked exultant, and his natural ungainliness seemed only increased by the gay
                  colors with which he had adorned himself. Diamond buttons glittered upon his broad
                  bosom, and his fat fingers also bore upon them more than one gem of price. His
                  insolent eyes sought those of Clarice, and she shrank and quivered before their
                  expression of exulting triumph, with the feeling that death would be preferable to
                  life as the slave of his caprices.
               As the cortège gained the open air, a party of horsemen, with brilliant housings
                  and fluttering ribbons, came sweeping across the lawn, followed by a band of
                  musicians playing upon the bagpipes so loudly that the tones of the softer
                  instruments that accompanied them were completely drowned.
               The leader of this band wore a mask representing the face of Neptune. In his hand he bore a branch of
                  seaweed, and sprays of the same hung over his breast and shoulders.
               This was a portion of the pageant which Matra had not commanded, and he looked
                  with some solicitude to see what the intentions of the new-comers were. As they
                  drew near, he recognized one form among them as that of Barnardo, and he had no
                  further fear of a hostile movement from them.
               The bridal party had gained the open space near the outer gate, when the horsemen
                  drew up their steeds in front of them, and their leader spoke in a loud voice, as
                  he bent forward and offered to the bride the seaweed he carried:
               "Maiden, I bring thee tribute from my domains, and the sea-nymphs ask to behold
                  their chosen sister once again. Shall they cry in vain, or shall the free life of
                  the ocean find favor above the caged one of the land? Speak now, for on your
                  decision rests your future happiness."
               He held out his strong hand, bent his lithe form suddenly forward, and in another
                  instant the light figure of Clarice was lifted to his saddle and placed before
                  him. One bound of his well-trained steed carried him beyond the reach of Matra's
                  immediate friends, and the party that accompanied him immediately closed upon his
                  rear in such a manner as effectually to protect him from assault.
               Pallid and foaming with rage, the baffled bridegroom called out:
               "It is Falcone; he has robbed me basely. A thousand scudi to him who brings back
                  Clarice to me."
               The crowd rushed off in pursuit. Matra, blind with passion and disappointment,
                  threw himself upon a horse belonging to one of his friends, and galloped away in
                  the forlorn hope of overtaking the daring abductor and his party. A few others
                  followed him, but he soon outstripped them, and suddenly found himself face to
                  face with a stalwart wart man in the garb of a priest, who wheeled into the road
                  before him from a coppice in which he had covertly awaited the appearance of his
                  prey.
               "Out of my way! Out of my way!" imperiously shouted Matra. "Why do you thus cross
                  my path when I have not a moment to lose?"
               "Because it will be useless to go further upon it. Falcone must reach his bark in
                  safety, and retain his well-won bride."
               "His bride! mine—mine," yelled the exasperated man. "Wretch! who are
                  you, that you dare to speak thus? Get out of my way, or I will kill you."
               He snatched a pistol from his breast, and pointed it toward the heart of his
                  opponent. As the man struck it up, the cowl fell from his head, and Matra
                  recognized the fixed, implacable face of Barnardo, as the flashing steel in his
                  unflinching hand was thrust again and again into his body.
               "Take that, and that, robber, brigand; and now the Violante is mine. Thus I avenge
                  the insults I have borne from you, miserable mass of selfishness that you
                  are."
               Matra fell forward, his horse reared, and turned back upon the path he had lately
                  passed over, and while the murderer fled toward the sea-shore, the gaily dressed
                  corpse of the bridegroom was dragged back amid his horror-stricken friends, at the
                  heels of his frightened steed.
               Wild cries and lamentations took the place of the late jubilant shouts, and
                  threats of the blood vengeance were heard on every side. There was but one
                  opinion, that Falcone had taken the life of his rival, and he must be held
                  responsible for the deed. This penalty in that land of the vendetta is a species
                  of social ostracism, for it cuts off a man from every enjoyment of civilized life,
                  and compels him to dwell amid the fastnesses of the hills, leading the
                     comfortless and uncertain life of
                  the outlaw. A bandit in Corsica does not always, nor indeed often mean a robber,
                  but simply a man under the ban of the law; and to such Falcone henceforth
                  belonged.
               The feet of the murdered man were released from the stirrups that held them, and
                  his blood-stained form was lifted by his friends and borne toward the home which
                  had been prepared for so different a scene.
               His mother, with glaring eyes and foreboding heart, stood upon the piazza, wildly
                  muttering:
               "My vision was true, oh woe is me! woe is me! They bring my son in their arms; he
                  is helpless; he is lifeless; and the stain of blood is upon his garments. Alas!
                  his life-current has ensanguined them."
               Her voice gradually arose to a despairing cry, which reached those who came slowly
                  and mournfully toward the abode so lately full of mirth. In sad silence they laid
                  the dead body at the mother's feet, and the oldest man of the group sternly
                  said:
               "The vengeance rests with you; let it be swift and sure."
               The old woman bent over her slain son, and stifled the cry of nature in her eager
                  thirst for retribution. She cried out:
               "Men, I have money, which I will liberally share with you, if you will grant me
                  your assistance in the stern task before me. Though the bandit has himself escaped
                  us now, the family of her through whom this calamity fell upon me, are still in
                  our power. The vendetta spares none of her blood, and Senora Marcante and her
                  children are in our midst. Strike, and spare not, that the base girl may drink the
                  blood of her kindred."
               In the suddenness of the escape, and the events which so rapidly followed it,
                  Senora Marcante had hitherto sat as one stupefied by something which she could not
                  comprehend. That all her plans of self-aggrandizement should have been thus
                  overturned, was incomprehensible to one of her dull, imperious nature. She sat
                  dumb and bewildered, till the words of the fierce old tigress aroused her to a
                  sense of the imminence of the danger that threatened not only her own life but
                  that of her children.
               Ninetta and the boy had crouched down beside her in extreme fright; for amid this
                  wild people no one could foretell what tragic turn events might take. At the words
                  of the bereaved mother, a few of their friends gathered in front of them, and
                  protested against any violence being used toward those who had entered the house
                  as honored guests.
               With great effort Senora Marcante recovered sufficiently from the first effects of
                  the shock, to arise, and with much excitement to speak in her own defence.
               "My friends, I never expected to tell this tale, but now I have no choice left me.
                  The young girl hitherto known as Clarice Marcante, is not of my blood, and I
                  proclaim myself and my children free from the penalty due to the crime she has
                  doubtless instigated. Clarice is only my adopted daughter, as I can soon prove to
                  the satisfaction of all here present."
               Amid the incredulous murmurs of the crowd, the widow spoke in her stern, hard
                  tones:
               "In my despair I had forgotten; it is true—Clarice is no child of hers. Had she
                  been, my son would have left her to her humble fortune."
               At these words Senora Marcante tossed her head defiantly, and cast a disdainful
                  glance toward the dead Matra, but her eyes were quickly withdrawn, and she
                  shuddered at the expression of hatred and despair indelibly fixed upon his
                  stiffening features.
               His mother stooped forward, lifted him in her arms, and with the assistance of others, bore him into the
                  house, and placed him upon a couch. Then kneeling beside his form, she tore from
                  his breast the blood-stained shirt, and fastened a portion of it upon her own
                  bosom. Then, in tones of piercing anguish, mingled with fiery passion, she
                  exclaimed:
               "I invoke upon his murderer, and on her who instigated the crime, the extremity of
                  vengeance. Vendetta to the last drop of blood flowing in their veins, I here
                  declare, and I devote the remnant of my life to its accomplishment.
               "Friends, sing those death-songs in which the vengeance of the murdered man's
                  relatives is shown to be a sacred duty."
               She bowed her head over the lifeless body, and a group gathered around the death
                  couch, and raised a wild, heart-piercing wail, which seemed the very outburst of
                  impassioned despair, with the fiercer cry of vengeance thrilling through the heart
                  of the melody as a fearful monotone.
               As the Marsellaise moved the heart of revolutionary France, so are those of the
                  Corsicans affected by their voceros; and few houses in that land of impulsive
                  passion and reckless vendetta have not resounded with them; for it is said that
                  from a population of less than three hundred thousand, two hundred annually perish
                  from the implacable blood-vengeance.
               The women who had come to witness a bridal, now removed their ornaments, loosened
                  their hair, and joining their hands, performed a death dance around the bier, to
                  the music of their own wild wailings, and soon the dramatic vivacity of the scene
                  became terrible to witness.
               One of the youngest girls present led the improvisation, and as her burning words
                  fell upon the ears of the listeners, their eyes gleamed with fury, while they
                  struck the palms of their hands together, rent their hair, and beat their breasts,
                  amid sobs and lamentations for the fate of the fallen man.
               When their excitement reached its climax, they threw themselves upon the couch,
                  and scattered dust upon their heads after the manner of the ancient Hebrews.
               At length, exhausted by the violence of their emotions, the actors in this
                  lugubrious scene threw themselves upon the floor, and sat as motionless as the
                  dead man whose fate they mourned; the wild wail died away in deep respirations,
                  for they were nearly breathless from the violent exertions they had made, and they
                  sat with bowed heads, and folded hands, in an attitude expressive of the deepest
                  grief.
               In the meantime, the friends of Senora Marcante deemed it advisable for her and
                  her children to leave the house of Matra, for their near connection with Clarice
                  must have incurred for them the hostility of all his family.
               A few young men, armed with carbines and the ever ready stiletto, formed their
                  escort upon the road over which they had so lately passed in triumph. Quite a
                  crowd followed them through curiosity to learn the truth respecting Clarice, and
                  some among them could well remember the stranger who had died in Senora Marcante's
                  cottage many years before.
               When they reached her door, the widow paused, and made an attempt to dismiss the
                  curious crowd, by saying:
               "Many thanks, my friends, for your company and protection; this is a sad ending to
                  a wedding, but I trust when my own daughter is married, no such
                  scandal will fall upon my respectable name. Clarice is not my child; for the
                  present, let this assurance suffice; and now good day, friends, for I must weep in
                  solitude over the grievous fault this poor girl has committed. She was dear to my
                  heart, though not of my blood."
               An audible murmur of discontent arose, and a small, shrewd-looking man stepped
                  forward, and said:
               
               "If our sympathy and protection are worth anything they are surely worth the
                  clearing up of this mystery. If Clarice is not your child, whose, then, is she?
                  and why has this deception been so long maintained? Your neighbors have looked
                  upon you as a respectable woman, Senora Marcante, but unless this affair is
                  satisfactorily explained, how shall you maintain that position? If no disgrace is
                  attached to the story, you need not shrink from revealing it. If there is, we have
                  a right to hear it, that we may know how to regard you in time to come."
               As this address proceeded, the widow flushed a fiery red, and then grew pale. She
                  saw no alternative remained to her, and her well-kept secret must become the
                  property of her friends. She replied, in a tolerably steady voice:
               "I request all to enter who are interested in hearing a simple story, which
                  reflects no discredit on me."
               Thus invited, the party crowded into the cottage, completely filling the central
                  room with eager faces, and ears thirsting for the development of the promised
                  mystery. After a pause, as if she was recalling the incidents of those days which
                  had so long passed away, Senora Marcante began:
               "My friends, it is now seventeen years since a worn and weary woman, carrying a
                  babe in her arms, asked at my door for a cup of milk, and a few hours' shelter
                  beneath the roof of the humble cabin in which I then lived as the wife of Pietro
                  the fisherman.
               "Both requests were granted, for I saw that the poor delicate creature was sinking
                  with fatigue; I took her infant from her arms, for it was the same age as my own
                  little darling that lay asleep in the cradle. I washed and nursed it, while the
                  poor mother looked on with a kind of quiet apathy, as if life and every interest
                  belonging to it had perished from her heart.
               "After resting an hour, she thanked me, and arose to go, but as she attempted to
                  cross the threshold she fainted and fell. I put her to bed, and Pietro and I did
                  the best we could by her, for my husband said we must never cast out the helpless
                  and sick wayfarer.
               "Besides, for I will not make out that we were better than we really were, in
                  undressing her, I discovered that her underclothing was of the finest material,
                  and concealed around her waist she wore a band filled with gold pieces. There was
                  more money in it than we had ever seen together before, and we felt certain that
                  whatever we might do for the stranger would be well repaid.
               "Well, to make a long story short, the lady never held her head up again, though
                  she lingered nearly a year before death finally took her away. In the meantime, a
                  malady that proved fatal among children broke out in Isola Rossa, and both the
                  little ones sickened with it. My child died, but after a severe struggle the
                  stranger's infant was spared. When I took it to her bedside, she looked on it
                  almost with an expression of regret, and said:
               "'I hoped she would have been taken before me, but such is not the will of Heaven.
                  Oh! Senora, what will become of this poor babe when I am gone?'
               "I do not know what impulse moved me, but I said:
               "'If you can do no better with her, let me take her as my own, in place of the
                  child which perhaps God has taken from me to make room for this one.'
               "I own that I thought of the gold, and I knew that it would more than repay me for
                  my care of the child. The poor lady instantly caught at the idea, and
                  exclaimed:
               "'Oh! if it can be done! if it can only be done without suspicion. Can you keep
                  the secret of this exchange? Can you baffle search, if such is made, and
                     always—always keep the child as your own?'
               
               "I thought I could easily do that, for I did not believe any one would suspect me
                  of taking the babe of the stranger as my own. There had been so much sickness in
                  the town that for weeks no visitor had entered my cabin; for in those days of
                  poverty and struggle we were not much troubled with company. The sick woman bade
                  me consult with my husband, and if he did not oppose the transfer, she would speak
                  with him on the terms.
               "Pietro had become attached to the little girl, and now our child was gone, he was
                  glad to keep her; so he said yes at once, and then the stranger bound us both by a
                  solemn oath to raise her as our own daughter, and never to permit her to think for
                  a moment that she was not our child. The mother said that she believed she would
                  be happier in our humble home than with those to whom she of right belonged.
               "When these matters had been satisfactorily settled, the lady gave Pietro gold
                  enough to buy himself a trading boat, and a small stock of wares, which laid the
                  foundation for his after-prosperity. By her orders, he purchased for her such
                  furniture as made her room comfortable, and we removed into this cottage, which
                  she also paid for; to her we owe all the prosperity that came to us, and I swore
                  to her that I would do by Clarice exactly as if she was my own child, and never
                  seek to discover her true origin. That I religiously kept my oath, you can all
                  bear witness, for until to-day no one has dreamed that the girl was not my
                  child."
               "It seems that Matra knew it, or he would not have sought her for his wife," said
                  one, who recalled the words of the bereaved mother.
               "If Matra knew it, he has gained no clue from me. As Clarice grew toward
                  womanhood, I saw how fair and delicate she was, and I naturally thought a rich
                  home would suit her better than a poor one. I insisted that she should accept
                  Matra, but now I begin to fear that I was too harsh. I should have listened to her
                  objections, and perhaps she would not have rushed upon the fate that now threatens
                  her."
               "Suppose she turns out to be some great man's child?" suggested one. "If she is,
                  her family will protect Guilio for her sake. Depend on it, Matra thought he could
                  serve his own interests well, or he would never have sought her."
               "Perhaps so; though a child of mine would have been good enough for such as Matra.
                  Let Clarice prove to be who she may, it can be of no benefit to me or mine, for I
                  disclaim all interest in her. The family of the murdered man shall have no cause
                  of vendetta against us."
               "Right, senora; that is the only safe course to pursue, for that old beldame is
                  vindictive as a tigress, and her vengeance will not stop short of every soul
                  connected by blood with those who caused the murder of her son."
               "She will find none to sacrifice that I know of, except Guilio and the girl
                  herself, unless she can ascertain her true family."
               "And she will spare no efforts to do that. Well, senora, you have honorably
                  performed all you engaged to do, and I trust that no evil will come to you from
                  any connection with this runaway bride. We are your friends at all events, and you
                  may count on us, should you need us to protect you."
               The widow warmly thanked the speaker, and declared that henceforth all intercourse
                  between her adopted daughter and herself was at an end. Neither she nor her
                  children would acknowledge Clarice as connected with them in any manner. Ninetta
                  and Pietra protested against this decision with tears, declaring that she had been
                  as a sister to them too long to be cast off in this summary manner. Their mother
                  frowned, and silenced them by saying:
               
               "Your only safety lies in giving her up forever. Clarice has forsaken us, not we
                  her. Let her go upon the path she has chosen, which I hope will be as far as
                  possible from that trodden by me and mine."
               The crowd at length departed to seek fresh excitement in learning what had been
                  the result of the pursuit after the fugitives, and the widow, crest-fallen and
                  deeply alarmed at the unlooked-for result of her ambitious projects, barred her
                  doors and windows, and retired to the solitude of her own apartment to meditate
                  upon the best means of ensuring the safety of herself and family from the enmity
                  of the murdered man's friends.
               Although innocent of any agency in bringing about the catastrophe of the day,
                  Senora Marcante knew that among a people so easily excited, and so reckless in the
                  vendetta, that she and her children were placed in a very critical position with
                  reference to the relatives of Matra. He had no brother to avenge him, but he had
                  nephews and cousins, who would equally consider it a sacred duty, by the Corsican
                  code, to sacrifice those implicated in any vital manner with the assassin of their
                  kinsman; and her knowledge of Senora Matra's character, caused her to feel that if
                  no other victims could be found, her family would surely be marked out for
                  destruction.
               Too late did she repent her hardness toward the poor girl who had caused all this
                  trouble, and wish that she had listened to her prayers to be permitted to give her
                  hand to him who claimed her heart. But it was too late now; the stamp of Fate was
                  placed upon the sad future, and she could only tremble and weep over the results
                  of her own harshness.
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               ALL FOR LOVE, AND THE WORLD WELL LOST.
               GUILIO clasped his bride to his heart, and fled like the wind, surrounded by the
                  faithful followers who had accompanied him on this perilous adventure. There were
                  ten of them dressed as sea-monsters, and as they fled they faced around every few
                  moments, with carbines unslung and ready for use, to keep their pursuers at bay.
                  These consisted of a confused crowd of the revellers who had hurriedly mounted,
                  and conspicuous among them were the two youths who had striven for the privilege
                  of presenting to the bride the key of her new home. The victor in the contest
                  shouted to those near him:
               "Follow me; I know a short cut to the strand, and we can intercept them before
                  they reach the boat."
               Obedient to his command, the party turned and rushed with headlong speed down a
                  narrow street leading toward the sea-shore. Two vessels lay there, a few hundred
                  yards apart; the smaller one was decorated with flags and streamers, and this was
                  recognized at once as the bark of Falcone; the men took such a position as must
                  intercept the abductors and their prize, and each one looked to the condition of
                  his arms, that he might be in readiness to give them a warm reception.
               They had but few moments to wait before Falcone and his friends appeared in view.
                  They did not falter at the sight of those opposed to them, but came sweeping
                  steadily forward to a point from which two paths diverged. One of these led to the
                  fishing smack, the other toward the Violante, which was slowly shaking out her
                  sails, as if preparing to go on her next voyage.
               
               A momentary halt was made, and a tall man wearing the dress of a monk galloped to
                  the head of the group, and spoke a few words. He then waved his hand toward the
                  felucca, and at the signal a boat shot from the further side, and rapidly
                  approached the landing. To the chagrin and surprise of Matra's friends, Falcone
                  and his companions rode swiftly in the same direction, dismounted, and before
                  their pursuers could come within gunshot, were beyond their reach. A few carbines
                  were fired on either side, but without effect, and Clarice, safe, and now quite
                  self-possessed, was placed upon the deck of the Violante.
               Her flag was run up, gay streamers thrown to the breeze, and a small cannon she
                  carried was fired both as a bridal salute and as a defiance to her enemies, while
                  the gallant little vessel glided swiftly from the shore.
               The sailors, in picturesque holiday attire, were drawn up on deck to receive the
                  bridal party, who were greeted with waving of caps and hearty cheers from these
                  hardy sons of toil.
               An awning had been spread, beneath which was a crimson carpet, on which seats for
                  four persons were placed. A temporary altar stood near the railing, on which
                  candles and myrtle blossoms had been placed, and beside it stood a barefooted
                  monk, telling his beads and repeating aves with his lips, while his eyes took
                  rapid note of all that passed before them. Flowers and gay ribbons were so
                  disposed as to give quite a festive air to the little vessel, and Marie Montoni,
                  with a smile of cordial welcome, came forward to receive the stolen bride.
               Clarice had regained her self-command, and although tears were in her eyes, the
                  color had again returned to her cheeks, and the heavy, painful throbbing of her
                  heart had changed to the glad tide of hope and happiness. As she arose from the
                  embrace of her friend, Guilio knelt before her and said:
               "Welcome, my queen of the mountains, to the friendly bark of one who has stood by
                  me in my need, in return for many important services it has been my good fortune
                  to be able to render him. Clarice, I have not won you to be the wife of a fisher
                  lad, but the companion of a mountain chief. Know that I am the son of that
                  Theodore Falcone who took to the mountains and became a bandit, because his
                  reasonable request to be allowed to obtain a substitute when drawn for the
                  conscription was rudely refused by those in authority. With his proud career all
                  our countrymen are familiar; his hand was stained with no crime, his soul with no
                  meanness; and when he perished, a victim to the basest treachery, he who had
                  reigned as a king over his banned and persecuted followers, laid down his life as
                  nobly as he had borne it. 'Tis no ignoble hand which claims your own, my dainty
                  fire-spirit, but one worthy to clasp with those of knights and gentlemen."
               Clarice listened to this address with many varying emotions. A brilliant flush
                  suffused her expressive features as she raised him from his kneeling position, and
                  the pride of her nature shone forth in the words of her reply.
               "Let us stand side by side, Guilio, free and equal, as husband and wife should be.
                  I am yours, for you have doubly won me this day by your gallant rescue from the
                  power of one I loathed. Let the vows be spoken which will bind us together for all
                  time, that if our enemies pursue and capture us, they can have no power to
                  separate me from the object of my choice. As the young fisherman, I preferred you
                  to the rich Matra, and as the King of the Mountain I am worthy to share your lot.
                  I ask no brighter, no better fate."
               "Noble and true heart, your words are worthy of your high nature. They give me
                  inexpressible happiness, my pearl of price," murmured Guilio with rapture. "We
                     will lose no time in having the
                  marriage rites performed, though there is little prospect of pursuit, and less of
                  being overtaken. The Violante is the fastest craft on these waters, and she
                  already begins to show her powers."
               While he was speaking the vessel glided gracefully out of the harbor, and Clarice
                  cast a long glance toward the home she was leaving, perhaps forever. At a sign
                  from Falcone, Captain Barnardo, now denuded of his monkish disguise, approached
                  the party. Guilio took his hand, and said:
               "This, Clarice, is my friend, as he was the friend of my father. He is the captain
                  of this vessel, and to him we are indebted for our present safety."
               Clarice grew pale as her eyes fell upon him. She nervously said:
               "And he is also the partner of Matra. I have seen you many times Senor, and I
                  trust that your presence here bodes us no evil. Pardon me, but so much—so much is
                  at stake for us."
               "Fear not, fair lady; my presence here insures your safety," replied Barnardo,
                  with an air of courtly gallantry strangely at variance with his calling. "Without
                  the aid I have afforded my young friend, you would now have been the wife of
                  Matra. That I have helped to rescue you from his power should be to you the best
                  proof that all bonds of fellowship between that ingrate and myself are forever
                  broken."
               With a bright smile Clarice extended her hand to him, and said:
               "Thanks, in both Guilio's name and my own. My debt of gratitude is one that can
                  never be cancelled."
               Barnardo fixed his eyes upon her varying features with a penetrating expression
                  that called a flush into her cheek. He abruptly asked:
               "Is it the immutable purpose of your soul to abide by Guilio Falcone, let the
                  future develop what it may with reference to yourself?"
               The flush deepened and the eyes sparkled as she quickly and fervently
                  responded:
               "It is, so help me Heaven! But this is a strange inquiry—what can it mean?"
               "Never mind; only answer me truly and faithfully, and all will be well. Will you
                  swear to maintain your allegiance through every temptation? Even if wealth and
                  high station must be relinquished by clinging to Falcone, would you still be true
                  to your wedded vows?"
               Clarice laughed scornfully:
               "Faith, truth, love, would be of little worth if they could be crushed beneath
                  temptation of any kind. Let the future bring what it may, Guilio is my king, I his
                  queen; and now, I trust, you are answered."
               Her slight form seemed to dilate; her eyes flashed with the fire of pride, and
                  Barnardo bowed lowly before her, as he said:
               "I am nobly answered, Senora. Now it only remains for Father Benedict to perform
                  his duty."
               The priest came forward, the lovers placed themselves before the altar, and the
                  sailors gathered around with uncovered heads while the mass was being said. Then,
                  with the cloudless sun flashing over the purple waves, the soft southern air
                  fanning her kindling cheek, unconscious of her birthright, the daughter of the
                  Ernesti plighted her vows to the man she loved, resolute in that hour to keep
                  them, whatever fate might betide her in the future.
               Barnardo looked on with a strange smile, and in his heart was the triumphant
                  thought that by this marriage he gained the power to strike a deadly blow against
                  one he loathed with that intensity which is born of rivalry in love, and which subsequent events had even
                  more deeply embittered.
               The captain had rescued Clarice from Matra because he felt that she despised him,
                  and would at once acquiesce in the efforts of her powerful family to break the
                  bonds that bound her to him; but in this tie, she linked her fate with that of one
                  to whom she would cling through good and evil report, in defiance of every effort
                  that might be made by her haughty father to separate her from him.
               As he gazed with piercing eyes upon the face of the bride, he marvelled that he
                  had not before been struck by her resemblance to the friend of his youth, for such
                  had Count Ernesti once been to him, widely as their paths had since diverged. The
                  straight, delicately cut profile, and the haughty mouth, expressing pride, energy
                  and strong will, were clearly derived from her paternal ancestry; while the deep
                  clear eyes, so full of tenderness and truth, as they rested upon her newly wedded
                  lord, were those of one he had loved in the days of his wayward and passionate
                  youth, with all the fire of a fierce, untamable nature.
               As Barnardo scanned this beautiful young creature with prophetic eye, he trusted
                  and believed that she would prove true in life or death to the allegiance she had
                  just plighted; that every temptation to swerve her from it would be resented as an
                  insult to her womanhood. Only thus could he make her the Nemesis to the man he
                  detested.
               Clarice received the congratulations of her friends with tearful grace. Marie
                  Montoni kissed her tenderly, and whispered:
               "You are the wife of a noble and true man, and I trust that your life will be free
                  and happy."
               Barnardo lifted her hand to his lips, and said:
               "Happiness and good fortune await the strong in heart. My young friend, Guilio,
                  has made a lucky choice, Senora, for in you he has gained beauty, worth and
                  love."
               The sailors lifted their caps, and joined in a hurrah that made the welkin ring,
                  while each one threw a handful of flowers which he carried for the purpose over
                  the dress of the bride. She thanked them with animation, and Falcone briefly
                  addressed them:
               "This is the happiest day of my life, my friends, and as I desire that you shall
                  all share in my joy, a feast has been prepared for you in the cabin below, at
                  which you will drink to the health of myself and my bride."
               Renewed vivas greeted this speech, mingled with the cry of—
               "Long live the King of the Mountain!"
               As they retired to the forward part of the vessel, Clarice turned her smiling
                  glance upon Guilio, and asked:
               "Is it really true that you claim this high-sounding title? Tell me who and what
                  you really are, Guilio, for I truly believed you to be a fisherman when I
                  consented to marry you."
               "Sit down beside me, Clarice, and I will tell you the wild tale of my life and
                  lineage. It has no stain of crime upon it, therefore am I ready to reveal all you
                  desire to know."
               Obedient to his wish, Clarice placed herself beside him, his strong arm enfolding
                  her waist, and thus sustained, the runaway bride felt as if she could bid defiance
                  to the world. Her soft eyes were lifted to his, as she whispered:
               "Caro mio, now proceed: tell me of your family,
                  your rearing, and, above all, why you came to woo me in a character beneath your
                  true one. Remember that the minutest incident concerning yourself is of interest
                  to me."
               "Thanks, my adored; and now listen to the sad tale of two noble hearts at war with
                  the fate that finally conquered them."
               After a brief pause, Falcone went on:
               "My father was a fiery and haughty son of this soil, and he esteemed the sacred rights of freemen above all
                  price. He was drawn for the conscription when he was on the eve of marriage with
                  one he tenderly loved. He asked the privilege of procuring a substitute, and his
                  request was refused in such terms as fired his pride and aroused his opposition.
                  He threw himself into the mountains, and took to the life of a bandit; he was not
                  a robber, mark you, but a free mountain chief, who levied a tax upon the rich and
                  cowardly, which he shared with the poor and oppressed.
               "Theodore Falcone was adored by the peasantry, and feared by men in power; for his
                  rule was that of nature and justice. He compelled the wealthy miser to contribute
                  his share toward the general welfare, and the recipient of government patronage
                  disgorged a portion of his spoils as an offering to the needy.
               "His betrothed bride followed him to the fastnesses of the mountains, where she
                  became his wife, and dwelt with him in an extensive cave which will soon witness
                  the wedded happiness of his son. I only ask to be enabled to emulate my father in
                  valor; to show the same magnanimity under misfortune, the same dauntless front
                  which rendered him the terror of the mean, and the admiration of his high-spirited
                  countrymen. I regard it as a proud distinction to be the son of a man so eminently
                  worthy of the name of a Corsican, and of a woman who shrank from nothing by his
                  side."
               "Thus true will I be to you," murmured Clarice, and Guilio pressed her more
                  closely to his heart, as he went on:
               "My father could not have merit without making bitter enemies. Among those
                  proscribed like himself, were persons who hated him for his preëminence above
                  them, and they only waited for a favorable opportunity to betray him to the
                  authorities. He fell ill, and fancying that the atmosphere of the cave was
                  injurious to him, he caused himself to be removed from his impregnable asylum to a
                  hut a few miles off.
               "An armed party came upon him without warning of their approach; they slew the
                  sick lion, but not without themselves being torn by his claws, for he died like a
                  Paladin with arms in his hands, which he used with good effect against his
                  foes.
               "I was then an infant in the cradle, and my mother snatched me from the fate they
                  might have given me too, and fled to her mountain retreat. Amid those fastnesses
                  she was safe from pursuit, and friends soon gathered to her assistance. The
                  loyalty of the country people to their self-elected king, was shown by the
                  voluntary offers of contributions still due him from some of the villages that
                  acknowledged allegiance to his authority. Theodore Falcone's name was widely
                  lamented, and his memory has been embalmed in song."
               "Ah, yes," replied Clarice, softly. "I have sung those voceros myself, little
                  dreaming that your father was their hero. Tell me of your mother; after her
                  husband's death, what could she do alone?"
               Guilio's voice took a tone of deep pathos, as he replied:
               "She too died; what else was left to her?"
               "What! by her own hand?"
               "No—not as a suicide; she was too brave for that. She slowly faded from the earth,
                  with the firm conviction that her husband continually called upon her to join him
                  beyond the dark river. My mother died of a broken heart in less than a year after
                  her husband perished; thus I was thrown upon the kindness of strangers."
               "And then?" asked the tender voice.
               A cloud passed over Guilio's face, and he said:
               "The life of an orphan child is seldom a happy one. I had no real claim on any
                  one, for the family of my mother had
                  disowned her for following her betrothed to the macchia, and my father was the last of his name. I was friendless
                  and homeless—a little waif thrown on the bleak shores of life, with no natural
                  protector.
               "But I was not suffered to perish. The contributions voluntarily offered after my
                  father's death, made a small fund for my support till I was old enough to do
                  something for myself. I was fortunate enough to attract the notice of Count
                  Rospoli, a wealthy and eccentric man, living not far from the scene of my father's
                  exploits, and he took sufficient interest in my fate to afford me some advantages
                  of education, of which I eagerly availed myself.
               "My patron would have made me a priest, but my nature revolted from the spiritual
                  bonds he sought to impose on me. I had no calling for that vocation, and I refused
                  to take vows which I felt that I could never keep. The count was deeply offended
                  at my refusal, and cast me off. Shall I tell you why I persisted in my refusal, my
                  Clarice? I had wandered in my childhood to Isola Rossa, had seen you there, and
                  children as we were, I loved you, and vowed within my soul to win you to become my
                  bride, and dwell with me as my mother had dwelt with her mountain chief in his
                  lonely home.
               "I knew the whole career of my father, and to emulate it was my irrevocable
                  determination. I too would pursue the brave and independent career which had given
                  him a place in the hearts of his countrymen. I adopted his belief—that he who
                  takes from the superfluities of the rich, to ameliorate the condition of the
                  suffering poor, is no robber, but a benefactor of his kind. God never meant that
                  the craft of the few should enable them to board and grasp the overflowing
                  abundance of the earth, while those who are equally his children, groan in despair
                  and destitution. The division is unfair, and I resolved to follow in the steps of
                  Theodore Falcone, and so far as lay in my power, endeavor to equalize the rights
                  of men."
               Clarice was too young and inexperienced to understand the fallacy of this
                  reasoning. To her it sounded noble and grand, and she said, with enthusiasm:
               "You are right, my Guilio, and I love you the more deeply for your benevolence.
                  But tell me how you accomplished your resolution, against the opposition of your
                  protector."
               A glow of pride swept over the face of her lover, as he went on:
               "I took the trusty carbine which had been the property of my father, and with a
                  free step sought the mountain wilds in which he had met his tragic fate. I won
                  your heart; but I knew that as the mountain chieftain, I could never claim you as
                  my bride. Then I assumed the character of a fisherman, though my lugger was really
                  engaged in a far different trade—but let that pass. My disguise enabled me to win
                  you as my bride, and I am truly blessed."
               "And Captain Barnardo? what is he to you?"
               "The best friend I possess. Barnardo has long been a free trader, though his
                  calling has not been known in the town from which we come to-day. It has often
                  been my good fortune to be able to give him information that was important to his
                  safety and success; and this morning, when he learned the strait we were in, he
                  sought me out, and offered me such assistance as rendered your abduction
                  certain.
               "At his suggestion, the plan I had formed was slightly altered, and in place of
                  taking you to my humble bark, he prepared to receive us on his felucca. We owe him
                  our deepest gratitude for the aid he gave me at a most critical moment."
               Barnardo here approached them, and with inimitable grace Clarice extended her hand
                  to him, as she said:
               
               "Receive my warmest thanks for your kindness to us, Captain Barnardo. As the
                  friend of Guilio, you must be mine also. I look upon you as having given me not
                  only happiness, but life, for I would never have lived through the day that made
                  me the wife of Matra."
               "I suspected as much when I undertook to aid my friend Guilio to spirit you away
                  from his rival. I am but a lawless rover of the sea, Senora, but I have some
                  natural sense of justice left within me, and I could not see a helpless dove made
                  the prey of a greedy cormorant, without putting out my arm to wrest her from so
                  dreary a fate. I have done evil deeds in my life, but I trust this one act of
                  retribution will lighten the account against me."
               He spoke with gloomy sternness, and Clarice timidly said:
               "Of retribution, Senor; I am afraid I do not understand you."
               "Nor is it necessary that you should, though I will in some sort explain. I owed
                  Matra repayment for many wrongs against myself and others, for he has been a
                  sneaking traitor to every one that trusted him. A plausible villain, living in
                  safety himself, while those who toiled that he might be rich, endured all the
                  hardship. Then, at the last, when I trusted him so far as to seek the shelter of
                  his roof, through trouble had arisen between us, he sought my door with the
                  purpose of murder in his craven heart. I was on my guard, for I did not trust him;
                  but from that moment his fate was sealed. I sought Guilio, and concerted with him
                  the means of wresting you from him. You are here in safety, Senora, and Matra
                  is——"
               He paused, and Clarice apprehensively exclaimed:
               "No evil has happened to him, I trust; he is free, and safe?"
               "Aye, free as air; never before so safe, for now he is powerless to injure any
                  other creature."
               Every vestige of color faded from her face, and she faintly said:
               "Oh! you cannot mean that blood has stained my bridal day! That violence purchased
                  my freedom?"
               "I do mean, Senora, that my wrongs are wiped out, and you, as a necessary
                  consequence, freed from the persecutions you have so long borne. Mine is an old
                  grudge, so you need take to yourself no portion of the blame for what I have this
                  day done."
               "But," gasped Clarice, "Guilio must bear the vendetta. My mother, Ninetta, Pietro,
                  what will become of them, thus left to the vengeance of Matra's family?"
               "Make yourself easy on that score, for Senora Marcante will deny that you are her
                  child, nay, will prove it, too, and for the treasure I have secured to him, the
                  King of the Mountains can well afford to take the responsibility of slaying his
                  rival."
               "You killed him, then?" syllabled the pale lips.
               "My aim is always true, and my carbine was levelled at his heart," replied
                  Barnardo, with gloomy pride.
               "And I? what can you mean by saying that Senora Marcante will prove me not her
                  daughter?"
               Barnardo cast a penetrating glance upon her as he impressively asked:
               "Senora, have you never looked into your mirror, and beheld reflected there a form
                  and face which are utterly unlike those to whom you were supposed to belong? Have
                  you not looked into your soul, and found there impulses which were equally at war
                  with theirs? Why, then, shall you be surprised to learn that you are not of the
                  peasant race to which you have been supposed to belong?"
               "Oh, yes—that is true; I have long felt that I had few sympathies with those I was
                  taught to consider as my relatives. But if not the child of Senora Marcante, to
                  whom, then, do I belong?"
               
               "That is a mystery which it remains with me to clear up, but not just yet. I
                  promise you that I will follow up the clue in my possession, and endeavor to
                  discover who the Italian lady was who came as a refugee to the hut of the
                  fisherman, Marcante, who died there, and left her daughter to be reared as his
                  own."
               Clarice turned toward her friend with clasped hands and flashing eyes.
               "Oh, Marie, hear this! Were not my conjectures true? Do you remember my words to
                  you last night?"
               "I do, and they are singularly confirmed. Senor Barnardo, will you enlighten us as
                  to how you have made this discovery?"
               "It is simple enough. Matra destroyed the agent who was sent to Isola Rossa to
                  trace a lady and her child. He possessed himself of the directions given to this
                  person, and came to the conviction in his own mind, that the Pearl of Isola Rossa
                  was entitled to something more of this world's goods than her reputed mother could
                  give her. Hence his determination to make her his wife at any sacrifice of feeling
                  on her part."
               "And the proofs of this?"
               "Are in my possession," and Barnardo drew from his pocket the embossed casket in
                  which Matra had displayed the papers to him on the previous night. He coolly
                  explained:
               "When Matra went forth to meet his bride, I entered his room and took possession
                  of these: they afford me a clue to your family, Senora, which I shall diligently
                  follow up till I am enabled to restore you to those to whom you rightfully
                  belong."
               Clarice instinctively clung more closely to her newly-wedded bridegroom, as she
                  said:
               "I belong now only to Guilio. Any claim that clashes with his will be repudiated
                  by me. Can you tell me who and what I am?"
               "To the latter question I can easily reply, Senora, for you are a most true and
                  devoted woman, but the first must remain unanswered until proper investigations
                  have proved your family to be what I suspect it—noble and wealthy."
               "And you, who know so much, can you not unravel that also?"
               "I only know that of which chance informed me, and I have imparted my knowledge to
                  you to ease your mind of fears for the safety of those you have this day
                  deserted."
               Guilio had listened with painful eagerness to these revelations. He clasped the
                  hand of his bride, and impetuously said:
               "Oh, Clarice! if I have marred your fate by linking it with mine! Yet I cannot
                  give you up. If those who have a right to claim you should attempt to separate us,
                  what would become of me?"
               She regarded him reproachfully.
               "If I were declared to be a princess to-morrow, I would refuse to accept both rank
                  and fortune, unless they could be shared with you. I am yours in mind, soul and
                  heart, and no artificial barrier shall ever arise to put asunder two whom God and
                  nature have united forever."
               Her pale cheeks flushed to the hue of the rose, and her clear eyes sought his with
                  an expression of such tender devotion that Guilio could not doubt her perfect
                  truth. With transport he exclaimed:
               "Thanks, my noble and true love! You shall never repent your trust in me while
                  life is granted me to defend and protect you."
               Barnardo's lip curled, and he cynically said:
               "Wait till the trial comes, Senora, and then see in what spirit it will be met.
                  Protestations pass for nothing till
                  temptation has tested them. Should you prove to be of high lineage and great
                  wealth, how can you remain true to a mountain bandit, who would be repudiated by
                  your family?"
               Clarice calmly said:
               "It is scarcely probable that I was born to so lofty a destiny, but if it should
                  prove so, the very elevation of my rank and the independence of my fortune would
                  enable me to lift my chosen one to my own level. I here declare my unalterable
                  resolution to cling to Guilio through weal or woe, and to walk in the valley of
                  humiliation with him sooner than soar even to the empyrean without him."
               "You swear this?" asked Barnardo, eagerly.
               "I swear it, as I hope for salvation hereafter," was the solemn response.
               Guilio with rapture caught her to his heart, murmuring thanks and blessings, and
                  Barnardo, with a flashing glance of triumph, bade her remember and abide by her
                  oath.
               "That I shall surely do," Clarice proudly responded. "With me, love and duty walk
                  hand in hand, and worldly distinctions shall never have power to sever them."
               All that was noble and true in Barnardo was touched by this scene. In revealing so
                  much of what he knew, he had been guided by an impulse that would not be
                  controlled. He had not intended to betray his own agency in the assassination of
                  Matra. His first design was to permit Guilio to bear the burden of the crime, but
                  some chord in his better nature was touched by the devotion of these two untried
                  hearts, and reckless equally of the past and the future, he resolved to assume the
                  responsibility of Matra's murder, and leave them free from the claims of the
                  Vendetta, to find such brief happiness as their union promised.
               It was not his purpose to betray to Clarice the extent of his knowledge with
                  regard to her family. No—he would first seek his detested foe, strike a deadly
                  blow upon his pride, and then leave to him the task of revealing to the young
                  bride the dire necessity of sacrificing the truest and tenderest love to the
                  requirements of station. Yes—this devoted pair should have their dream. It could
                  not last, but what does last in this world of change and suffering? A
                  brief glimpse of happiness, as evanescent as the arrowy flash that plays upon the
                  threatening cloud, is all that is vouchsafed to the most fortunate of earth's
                  children.
               One day of bliss at least these hopeful dreamers did enjoy, as cradled on that
                  purple sea, the vessel glided smoothly toward her destination. They put the
                  thought of Matra's tragic fate far from them, for they were Corsicans, and he had
                  been slain in lawful vendetta by his foe; then wherefore should they grieve? The
                  free hills should be their home, and for them love should wing the hours in
                  harmony and peace.
               The Violante kept within sight of the shore, and with every mile of her progress,
                  some new beauty was unveiled in the island they had just left. Olive groves lined
                  the shores, and from the deep umbrage of forest leaves gleamed the white walls of
                  a chapel, or a villa, or the ostentatious mausoleums of the rich, crowned with
                  cupolas, after a custom of the country.
               Occasionally an abandoned watch-tower falling to ruins, with the wild vines of the
                  forest trailing over its desolate walls, crowned some picturesque point from which
                  a good lookout over the sea was once kept; for these structures were erected
                  centuries ago by the different Italian governments which successively held sway
                  over the island, to protect the coast from the invasion of the Saracens, and give
                  warning of the approach of a hostile fleet.
               On the other side, glowing in the radiant atmosphere, lay the islands of Elba,
                  Caprea and Monte Christo, contrasted
                  with the lofty mountains and verdant valleys of their own beloved Corsica. On the
                  slopes of the hills villages were nestled, the church always the most conspicuous
                  building in them, from its lofty spire and the cloisters which were often attached
                  to the sacred edifice. Shepherds pastured their flocks upon the verdant meadows,
                  and wherever a valley opened toward the sea a watch-tower was sure to be found,
                  guarding a deserted harbor in which a few small craft were at anchor.
               By the care of Barnardo, fruits of luscious quality, and wine of a pure vintage,
                  were offered to his guests beneath the awning on deck. The priest had preferred
                  the companionship of the sailors below at their more substantial repast, and the
                  four friends sat together and partook of the offered refreshments.
               The position of Clarice was discussed, and every effort was made by Guilio to
                  discover the full extent of Barnardo's information, but the caution of the latter
                  baffled him completely. Not yet would he betray his secret, and he protested that
                  he only possessed a clue which might lead him aright, or might yet baffle him. The
                  captain professed the deepest interest in the happiness of the lovers, and pledged
                  himself to do nothing toward separating them, let his investigations end as they
                  might.
               Barnardo possessed a subtle power of persuasion when he chose to exert it, and the
                  two who now listened to him as to an oracle, believed that in him they had secured
                  the best friend they had ever known. He pledged his word to visit Italy without
                  delay, and seek there such information as would enable him to discover the family
                  to which the young bride belonged. Then he would return to the pathless region of
                  Niolo, in which lay the mountain home of the newly wedded pair.
               Barnardo knew the character of that wild land, the eventless less solitude in
                  which the greater portion of their existence must henceforth be passed, and he
                  gazed with compassion upon this young girl, so full of life and passion, so gifted
                  with beauty and fascination that even he, rugged as he was, could feel, and asked
                  himself how long her resolution to abide by the man of her choice would endure
                  amid the life of wild desolation she was about to embrace?
               The wilderness of Monticino, lying between Tox and Mount St. Appiano, is covered
                  with dark primitive forests, which have never resounded to the blows of the axe,
                  and the whole country is overgrown with thickets of myrtle, scrub oak, and heaths
                  so matted together as to be almost inaccessible.
               Gloomy ravines through which the mountain torrent roars, offer precarious footing
                  to the hapless outlaw who finds a home in the clefts of the rocks, and lives at
                  war with every other man save his companions in misfortune. These rarely exceed
                  two, for the Corsican bandits do not herd together in companies as do the banditti
                  of other lands for predatory purposes. Theirs is a brotherhood of vengeance, not
                  of spoil, and the wild freedom of their daily life is their only compensation for
                  exile from friends and family.
               To Clarice, who had passed her life under the stringent rule of Senora Marcante,
                  there was something extremely captivating in the new existence opening before her.
                  She revelled in the thought of solitude and freedom, with her adored Guilio as her
                  protector, and Marie Montoni as her friend; for she intended to retain the latter
                  near her, if it was possible to do so. She loved Guilio with one of those childish
                  passions which made the sacrifice of all that women usually most covet seem light
                  to her, if by giving her all she secured the privilege of being near him while
                  life should be granted to her. She dreamed not that the hour could ever arrive in which her heart would swerve from
                  its allegiance. Strong in her self-confidence, Clarice defied temptation or
                  weariness to change her toward her mountain chief; and in this belief she cradled
                  her heart in happy dreams, and watched the gliding panorama with a sense of calm,
                  unutterable happiness which was seldom a portion of her restless nature.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               A FAIRY PALACE, AND AN EVIL GENIUS.
               AS the sun was sinking toward the west in a flood of crimson glory, the Violante
                  glided into a cove at the base of overhanging cliffs which seemed ready to topple
                  down and bury the little craft in the waves below.
               A figure appeared descending the rugged path, whose dress and air seemed
                  singularly out of keeping with the desolate grandeur of the scene of which he
                  formed a part. He was a man of remarkable personal beauty, of which he seemed
                  perfectly conscious, for the striking style of his costume set it off to the best
                  advantage. His tall, lithe figure was clad in a scarlet caftan richly embroidered
                  with gold, beneath which appeared Moorish pantaloons; and his small feet were
                  cased in boots of yellow morocco. On his head he wore a Spanish hat, with a long,
                  drooping plume, which mingled with the curls of his raven hair. In his belt was
                  stuck a pair of highly ornamented pistols, and a scimetar hung at his side.
               The person who was thus imposingly attired was a man of twenty-eight or thirty,
                  with a clear dark Italian complexion, through which the rich blood glowed upon the
                  cheeks and lips with almost feminine beauty—a light moustache, daintily curled
                  upward, revealed the delicate curve of a haughty lip, and the fire of the large
                  dark eyes showed that however beautiful his person might be, he did not lack the
                  nerve and daring of manhood.
               The face was not noble, with all its statuesque beauty; but it possessed a
                  wonderful power—a magnetic attraction that others felt without being able to
                  analyze. When those intensely black eyes flashed with pride, or softened with
                  love, those on whom they were bent felt a strange thrill tingling in every nerve
                  of the body, and the old superstition of the evil eye involuntarily suggested
                  itself to the mind. But this was soon lost sight of in the fascination of a manner
                  which was equally the gift of his subtle organization.
               When half way down the pathway, he paused as if uncertain of the propriety of
                  approaching the strange vessel, for at a glance he saw that it was not the lugger
                  of Guilio; but a signal from the deck reassured him, and he came as lightly and
                  gracefully over the rough road as a boy of eighteen might have done. A bright
                  smile flashed over his features as he saw Guilio standing upon the deck with a
                  fair girl beside him. He knew that the object of the voyage had been accomplished,
                  and with expressions of cordial greeting he advanced to the edge of the shore to
                  meet the new-comers.
               The vessel had scarcely touched the strand when Guilio sprang toward his friend,
                  and grasping his hand with warmth, said:
               "Thanks, Benedetto, you have been true to your promise, and all is in readiness
                  for us. That you have assumed your gala dress to welcome us, is sufficient token
                  of that. See my beautiful Clarice; is she not as lovely as an houri?"
               As he spoke he drew forward the blushing girl, and placed her hand in that of the
                  friend and companion of his solitude,
                  for such Benedetto had been to him for many months. Those deep eyes, with their
                  fathomless power, were fixed upon the charming face of the young bride, and those
                  of Clarice were raised to meet them; both started as their hands also met,
                  conscious of a magnetic thrill which passed like a shock of lightning through the
                  frame. With her it was almost repulsion—handsome as he was; with him it was a
                  sudden intoxication—a bewildering delight at the presence of so enchanting a
                  being, after being so long banished from the society of lovely and refined women.
                  At least that was the solution of his emotion which Benedetto rendered to
                  himself.
               A deep flush mounted to his brow as he said, in a voice of singular depth and
                  melody:
               "Beautiful and bright as the angels of Heaven are represented, is the bride you
                  have won, my Guilio. May you be happy with your queen of the mountains is my
                  sincere prayer."
               He lifted the hand he held to his lips, and pressed it lightly to them; again that
                  electric shiver ran through her frame, and she shrank away as if some prescience
                  from the future came with its shadowy folds to settle around her heart even on
                  this her bridal day.
               The name of Benedetto was familiar to her as that of the friend of Guilio during
                  the past year—as one from whom the latter had learned much that was valuable to
                  him; for the outlaw was an Italian who had mingled with the world of business, as
                  well as that of letters; and he possessed the rare faculty of imparting to others
                  the wealth of his own resources, without humiliating them by a consciousness of
                  their own inferiority to himself. That he was only under a temporary cloud, and
                  must at some future day return to his native land to resume the position from
                  which he had been for a season hurled, Benedetto fully believed himself, and
                  Guilio, with implicit faith, looked forward to the day which would restore his
                  friend to his own.
               At first Benedetto had opposed the marriage of Guilio because he feared it would
                  interfere with the perfect freedom from restraint in which they lived in their
                  mountain fastness; but when he found how strongly his friend's heart was set upon
                  the village maiden, he consented to aid him with his cultivated taste and intimate
                  knowledge of the habits of women, in preparing his home for the reception of his
                  bride.
               If this girl was mad enough to give up all that is ordinarily dear to woman, to
                  lead the wild life of an outlaw's wife, why should he object—especially since her
                  presence would give a charm and a variety to the cavern they inhabited, which it
                  sadly lacked? Thus reasoned Benedetto, and now, in his deep heart, he
                  congratulated himself that this lovely waif had been cast, as it were, at his
                  feet; beneath the power of that imperious nature which hitherto had carried all
                  resistance before it, for this dangerous man truly boasted that he had never
                  failed to win anything on which he had once set his heart.
               Barnardo and Marie were presented to him, and after a few graceful words to each,
                  he said:
               "I have been waiting your arrival for the last hour. Our mules are safely secured
                  behind the bushes, and we can soon mount to the Eagle's Nest, where everything is
                  prepared for your reception, Senora, in the best style our means afford."
               "I doubt not I shall be charmed with my new home, and its surroundings," replied
                  Clarice, with a blush she would have given much to repress, but the tell-tale
                  blood would leap to her cheek in spite of her efforts to be perfectly unmoved.
               Benedetto merely bowed, and turned to Barnardo:
               
               "Senor, I salute you, and I remember you well. Your vessel once afforded me
                  shelter when the sbirri were on my track, and I shall not speedily forget you for
                  the service you then rendered me."
               Barnardo fixed his eagle glance upon him as he replied:
               "I remember; you came on board at Naples, just as we were leaving the harbor, and
                  paid me nobly to refuse to return at the command of the police. It was not my
                  business to inquire the cause of their anxiety to secure you, so I brought you to
                  this coast, and landed you here at your own request. Have you remained with Guilio
                  Falcone from that time?"
               "I have not returned to Italy," replied Benedetto, significantly, "and my time has
                  been chiefly spent in these mountain solitudes. You did not suffer for your
                  kindness to me, I hope."
               "Not seriously; there was some little investigation made on my return to Italy,
                  but I found means to satisfy the authorities," replied Barnardo, carelessly.
               Benedetto regarded him with a glance that seemed piercing enough to read his very
                  soul, but the impassive air assumed by the captain baffled him. He slightly
                  frowned as he said:
               "It was well; there was no cause why you should have been held to account for
                  befriending me. I had done nothing to merit arrest."
               While they thus spoke together, several mules, gaily decorated with streamers of
                  ribbon, were brought from the shelter of the thicket, and Clarice and her friend
                  mounted without delay. After many thanks to Barnardo for the services he had
                  rendered them, they took their leave of him with the assurance on his part that
                  within a month he would return with some definite information concerning the
                  family of Clarice. The crew of the Violante assembled on deck, and gave the
                  travellers a parting cheer, which roused the echoes of the cliffs, and died away
                  in long swells of sound. A few moments afterward, the light craft glided from her
                  moorings, and skimmed as a white-winged bird toward Caprea.
               The travellers commenced the ascent of the mountain path that wound around the
                  side of the cliffs, but the last words of Barnardo had cast a chill over the
                  susceptible heart of Clarice. He said to Guilio:
               "In your quiet nest be as happy as you can, for no man knows when the end of his
                  joy will come."
               She replied by a look of confiding love toward her lover, and waving a graceful
                  adieu to the captain of the smuggling craft, made the sign of the cross in the
                  Corsican fashion by crossing her thumbs, and then inclined her head toward Guilio,
                  with an expression that plainly said:
               "I am his in life and death; beware how you permit any one to attempt to divide
                  us."
               Barnardo turned away, muttering:
               "Poor girl! she believes it now, but who can tell how she will bear the sad life
                  before her? The time may come when she will be glad to escape from it, even
                  without the temptation that will surely assail her. Now for mine ancient
                     friend, to breathe into his ear a tale that will crush his
                  towering pride to the dust; and make me feel that my vow of retribution has been
                  fulfilled. Ho! Ernesti, now has my turn come, and sternly will I anatomize your
                  heart, and see wherein it is accessible to human suffering."
               The road taken by the bridal cortége soon struck into a gorge closed in by
                  mountain ridges on either side, through which roared a rapid stream, its waters
                  flashing over impediments of rock, and sending forth jets of spray in its
                  impetuous progress toward the sea. The sure-footed mules moved along a narrow and
                  precipitous ledge, which often overhung
                  the abyss in the most frightful manner. Guilio held the bridle of Clarice, and
                  sustained her by frequent words of encouragement, while Benedetto, with careless
                  grace, performed the same service for Marie, who rode along like one in a vague
                  dream, thinking of a far-distant time when she had thus ridden over mountain
                  paths, escorted by the beloved one who now belonged to another sphere of
                  existence, while she wandered on in desolation.
               Marie was not envious of the happiness of the two who had just plighted themselves
                  to each other, but she could not repress a sigh when she contrasted her own lonely
                  and blighted existence with the united faith of those devoted lovers, happy with
                  each other in spite of the frowns of fortune.
               Gradually the path opened upon a forest of pines and larches—the broad,
                  tassel-like crowns of the former, and the gnarled and knotty trunks of the latter,
                  affording a picturesque contrast. An undergrowth of blossoming myrtle, boxwood,
                  and erika, spread their balmy odors upon the atmosphere. Clarice expressed her
                  delight at this prospect; but the scene soon changed again, and the monotonous
                  rush of water, and the screaming of falcons, was alone heard amid the rugged
                  mountain hights toward which they approached. The change in the temperature caused
                  the young girl to shiver, and Guilio tenderly said:
               "A few more turns, my love, and we shall be at the end of our journey. Then my
                  Clarice will behold the unique home I have prepared for her reception."
               She smiled brightly, as she replied:
               "My heart is not chilled, Guilio, though the mountain air feels keen to my bosom.
                  With you by my side, its sharpness is more welcome than the soft breezes of Isola
                  Rossa when breathed alone. Oh! Guilio, we shall be very happy in our mountain
                  solitude."
               "I trust so, my angel. I should be wretehed indeed if you found the exchange you
                  have made an unhappy one."
               "Have no fears of that, my Guilio. I have no hope that is not centred in you; no
                  joy can come to me unshared by you."
               "And I ask no higher fate than the power to make you happy. God will surely be
                  good to two young creatures like you and me, who only ask to live a united and
                  contented life."
               "Yes, Guilio; I truly believe He will send his blessing upon us, for we have done
                  no evil to any one, nor wished harm to any living creature. The blood that was
                  shed to-day was not at our command, and retributive justice will exact from us no
                  penance for it. Speak, Guilio, will it not be so?"
               "I surely believe it will. Man may seek to do us evil; but God, who knows the
                  truth, will protect us from their wrath. Let us be happy, Clarice, and put far
                  from us all care and regret. This is the summer of our life and joy, and if we do
                  not make the most of its sunshine, life will afford us no equivalent for its
                  loss."
               "True, love. I give myself up to happiness and peace, for in our secluded home we
                  shall certainly be able to command the last. Isolated from the outside world, in
                  each other we shall find all that is necessary to our perfect content."
               Thus in the egotism of their love they prattled as they travelled onward. Suddenly
                  the shrill whistle of a goatherd echoed through the ravine, and a tall,
                  shaggy-looking figure, dressed in the brown woollen cloth manufactured on the
                  island, bounded into the path before them. He took off a red woollen cap, finished
                  with a heavy black tassel, and bowing lowly before the two, said:
               "Welcome to the King of the Mountains and his fair Queen! Angelo, the humblest of his friends, offers
                  them the homage of his loyal heart."
               Guilio held out his hand cordially as he said:
               "Many thanks, my faithful Angelo. My queen will soon learn to appreciate so true a
                  heart as yours at its full value."
               Clarice also placed her delicate hand in the rough clasp of the shepherd, who
                  lifted it toward his lips, but with a delicacy scarcely to be expected from him,
                  refrained from pressing them upon it.
               As Angelo turned upon the path, and preceded them with light and agile tread,
                  Guilio explained that a portion of his fortune consisted of flocks of goats and
                  sheep, of which Angelo was the herdsman, while his wife was the housekeeper and
                  manager of the domestic affairs of his wild home.
               They rode slowly forward to a point from which the path suddenly descended toward
                  the brink of a rapid stream which leaped down a ravine several hundred feet in
                  depth. The crags had been splintered by the force of the torrent, and huge rocks
                  lay piled in Titanic confusion around.
               Over this scene of wild grandeur the impenetrable forest threw its dense shade,
                  the mountain pines and larches which grew on opposite sides of the chasm nearly
                  meeting overhead. The rays of a fire flashed out upon this gloom, and looking
                  toward it, Clarice beheld the entrance to a vast cavern which seemed to have been
                  hollowed from huge blocks of granite by some terrible convulsion of nature.
               The wide entrance revealed the overhanging roof blackened by the smoke which
                  curled in faint spiral wreaths around the rugged walls, seeking some avenue of
                  escape. Beside a bright fire sat a middle-aged woman in a blue dress faced with
                  scarlet, and a gay-looking head-handkerchief worn as a mandille, or turban, around
                  her head. A cradle with a sleeping infant in it was placed near her, and her air
                  of watchfulness plainly indicated that she was looking for the return of her
                  husband, accompanied by the travellers.
               At the sound of their approach she started up, and came forward to take a first
                  look at her new mistress, not without a feeling of repulsion at the thought of
                  owing allegiance to one, but the sweet, girlish face that met her flashing black
                  eyes reassured her, though her brow again clouded as she saw Marie Montoni
                  dismount, and accompany Clarice when she entered the cavern.
               The two paused in astonishment at its unusual extent, for the rude and sombre
                  walls swept back in the distance to what seemed an almost interminable extent, and
                  bright eyes, like sparks of light, gleamed from every crevice. For an instant
                  Clarice was appalled at what seemed to her something supernatural, but Guilio
                  hastened to explain that those shining orbs belonged to the animals which were
                  huddled at night into the dark recesses found in this vestibule to the temple she
                  was henceforth to inhabit.
               "Lisa makes cheese from their milk," he added, "and you will find her a most
                  excellent manager."
               Thus extolled, the woman came forward with a more gracious air, and offered
                  welcome and congratulations to her employer and his bride. She took a rude lamp
                  from a shelving rock, and said:
               "Let me show the Queen of the Mountains to her regal home. It was built by the
                  gods, and is grander than any palace made by the hands of man."
               At these words the two strangers looked around the dismal sheep-fold, and wondered
                  if this was indeed to prove an ante-chamber to an Aladdin's palace, and rather
                  repelled by glimpses of the imperfectly lighted recesses from which eyes gazed
                  upon them in meek wonder, rendered so luminous ous by the light that flashed upon them as to be
                  almost terrible to an imaginative person. To such the cavern might have typified
                  Hades, with the eyes of accusing spirits bent in reproach upon those who entered
                  its shades.
               Guilio and Benedetto offered each an arm to his charge, and the former
                  whispered:
               "Keep up your courage, love, for this is not like our dwelling-place."
               Following the lead of Lisa, the party wound through a narrow pathway worn in the
                  rock, and at length stopped in front of what seemed to the strangers a portion of
                  the solid wall. The woman flared the light before it, and said, in a tone of
                  triumph:
               "Look well, Senora, and judge if the sbirri are likely to find those who seek a
                  refuge in these walls? Can you see any means of ingress? See—see how solid it
                  seems," and she held the lamp close to the dark, precipitous walls of rock, over
                  which tiny jets of water slowly trickled.
               Clarice examined the dreary looking walls, and faintly said:
               "I see nothing that indicates a passage, but I suppose there must be a concealed
                  entrance to the apartments beyond."
               "You may well say that, Senora. Yes, yes, there are rooms fit for a queen to
                  inhabit. You shall see—you shall see. Look, now, what a Titan my good man is."
               Angelo, with a gay laugh, raised his arm, and pressed with all his force upon a
                  spring concealed behind a jutting point of rock. A square frame filled in with
                  earth and stones, in exact imitation of that which surrounded it, fell back,
                  revealing a narrow defile lighted by a swinging lamp. This passage was about ten
                  feet long, and opened into a second room, the jagged sides of which were made to
                  serve as rude shelves, on which rested vessels filled with milk, and many round
                  cheeses placed upon freshly gathered leaves.
               Lisa waved her hand in triumph toward these evidences of her thrift and good
                  management, and said:
               "The Senora sees that I understand my business, and that the interests of the
                  master do not suffer in our hands. Angelo herds the sheep and goats, and helps me
                  to milk them, but I make the cheeses that are sold in the markets in the valley.
                  In the days of King Theodore, tribute was levied upon the people below, but now we
                  manage to make a living without that, though we do break the laws by giving aid
                  and protection to those who flee from the blood vengeance."
               Clarice smiled as she replied:
               "I have no doubt of your industry and capacity, good Lisa, and I trust that we
                  shall soon learn mutually to understand and value each other."
               The woman tossed her head with an expression of doubt, and walked forward to a
                  second wall, apparently as impenetrable as the one through which they had lately
                  passed. Before this Angelo kneeled, and pressed his strong hand upon the floor. An
                  irregularly shaped stone slowly lifted itself, and a flight of rude steps cut in
                  the solid rock was before them; Angelo took the lamp from his wife's hand, and
                  went down to the first winding, and then turning, threw the light backward to
                  guide them in their progress.
               Guilio gently said:
               "Come, my Clarice, the way is rough, but it leads to our bower of bliss, and you
                  will soon see that I have a dainty cage in which to place my dove of peace."
               She smiled serenely, for such was her confidence in Guilio, that the heart of
                  Clarice did not falter as she descended the dark and dreary-looking staircase.
                     Her lover almost lifted her tender
                  feet from the rugged stones as he stepped over them with firm, familiar tread, and
                  at every turning their guide halted, and held the light till the others stood
                  around him.
               In this manner they descended about thirty steps, which terminated in a grotto
                  filled with stalactites, on which the light threw brilliant prismatic hues.
               An exclamation of delight burst from the lips of Clarice, and she said:
               "It is the ante-chamber of the fairies. See how beautiful are those fluted columns
                  wreathed with flowers."
               Guilio smiled with triumphant pleasure.
               "This is nothing, my love, to the beauties beyond. Let us waste no time in
                  examining what is so inferior to that which is to come. Open, Angelo, and let my
                  queen behold her domain."
               At his command, the wall behind an irregular arch of white, glittering spar, slid
                  back, revealing the interior of what seemed indeed to be a fairy palace
                  brilliantly illuminated by concealed lamps.
               There seemed to be a suite of apartments communicating with each other, the
                  divisions being made by heavy crimson drapery, which was now drawn back and held
                  in loose folds by thick silken cords.
               The first apartment was about sixty feet in length, filled with pointed arches,
                  massive capitals, and delicate carvings, such as might have been designed by some
                  gothic architect in a moment of inspired frenzy. A cross and prayer-book lay upon
                  an altar of irregular shape, but most exquisitely adorned, and the ivory from
                  which the crucifix had been sculptured with much labor by human ingenuity, looked
                  yellow and discolored beside the brilliant spar of which the altar was
                  composed.
               This was indeed a temple not made with hands, most worthy of dedication to the
                  Supreme Architect who, in the silence of ages, had thus fashioned and adorned it.
                  Moved by the same impulse, Clarice and Marie kneeled before the altar, and
                  repeated a prayer. They then arose, and with vivid interest prepared to follow
                  Guilio, who had dismissed Angelo and his wife, and himself assumed the office of
                  cicerone.
               He lifted the prayer-book, and reverently said:
               "This was once my mother's. The cross also belonged to her, and I have placed them
                  here as fit offerings for my wife."
               Clarice pressed her lips to the sacred emblem, and said, with tender emotion:
               "Thanks, my Guilio, they shall be treasured as relics, and used with
                  reverence."
               "Let us go on, for the day draws to a close, and I wish to reveal to you all the
                  wonders of your elfin palace before it becomes night."
               "Day and night are of little consequence here, for we must live by lamplight,"
                  said Marie, looking around the brilliantly lighted chapel.
               Guilio smiled mysteriously, and said:
               "Come and see."
               They passed beneath the folds of drapery into a circular room, with irregular
                  columns, ornamented with every fantastic device the imagination can conceive,
                  grouped in such a manner as best to sustain the arched dome above, while the
                  artistic eye was gratified by their chance arrangement.
               A recess between two of these was draped with rose-colored silk, over which hung
                  lace curtains, partially concealing a bed with a snowy covering upon it. A tablet,
                  which reared its glittering form close beside it, was converted into a
                  dressing-table, and a mirror with an ebony frame hung above it. Crimson cushions
                  were piled in every recess to be used
                  as seats when needed; and a large coffer, ornamented with steel, stood at the foot
                  of the bed. Guilio lifted the lid of this to show Clarice the wardrobe he had
                  caused to be prepared for her use, and her vain little heart bounded at the sight
                  of silks, laces and jewels, such as she had never believed herself born to wear.
                  She was but a young and untried girl, conscious of possessing remarkable beauty,
                  to which the aids of the toilette must give added power to charm; and who can
                  blame her innocent joy in the possession of a beautiful wardrobe? She spoke, with
                  rapture:
               "Oh, Guilio, I am indeed as happy as a queen! I seem to be walking in a delightful
                  dream."
               "Which I trust will end in a waking reality of perfect bliss, my precious Clarice.
                  If you are only happy here, all my care will be rewarded."
               "Happy! ah! if I am not so, I shall prove myself an ingrate."
               Guilio kissed her hand, and then lifted a curtain that had not been fastened back
                  like the others. This afforded a glimpse of a smaller apartment, which had been
                  prepared as a dressing-room, and a lounge was placed within it.
               "This," he said, "must be given to Marie as her bower of rest till a chamber can
                  be prepared for her. Now we will pass to our dining and reception room."
               A passage about six feet in width, descended slightly a few yards, and terminated
                  in an irregular rotunda; in this there was a large fissure overhead, through which
                  the light of day penetrated into the cavern. Immediately beneath it stood a table
                  covered with a white cloth, on which fruits, bread and wine were placed.
               Wild vines from without had made their way through the opening in the roof, and
                  spread their clinging arms over the precipitous sides of the cavern, till it
                  presented a mass of verdure and flowers, whose subtle perfume filled the
                  atmosphere. Four chairs were placed around the table, and Guilio led his bride to
                  the seat of honor at its head, and then placed himself opposite to her. Benedetto
                  and Marie took the places on either side, both smiling and amused observers of the
                  innocent delight of Clarice at the novel and unexpected splendor that surrounded
                  her. Yet the two were moved by very different feelings. Marie Montoni enjoyed her
                  surprise, and augured well for her future happiness from this auspicious
                  beginning; but the companion of Guilio had in his heart already forsworn all
                  allegiance to the friendship which had so lately united them.
               A passion as violent as it was uncontrollable had sprung into sudden existence,
                  and he watched the lovely being before him with his fathomless eyes, resolute to
                  read the secret of her nature, and bring all its hidden impulses of vanity and
                  pride to aid him in the treachery his heart had already matured.
               But in spite of this the smile of Benedetto was not less frequent, nor his wit
                  less pleasant than Guilio had hitherto found them. As they seated themselves he
                  took up a bottle, struck off its head, and poured the red wine into Venetian
                  glasses, which stood ready to receive it. Then with a low reverence to Clarice, he
                  said:
               "Welcome, and happiness to the Pearl of Isola Rossa, now it is transferred to its
                  granite setting. May she never wish to exchange her diadem as Mountain Queen, for
                  the bonnet of the Parisian dame."
               While Benedetto thus spoke, Guilio lifted a wreath of the laurel-rose, which lay
                  upon a basket of luscious-looking grapes, and placed it upon the brow of Clarice.
                  She blushed and smiled brightly, as she replied:
               "I should scarcely gain by such an exchange, Senor, and I accept the only kingdom
                  over which I am ambitious to reign—that
                  of Guilio's heart and home. I have made my choice, and will abide by it to the
                  last, let what will befall me. I pledge you in this wine, Guilio, and give you
                  leave to match its ruby hue with the life-blood from my heart, when it proves
                  false to you."
               "I accept your pledge!" exclaimed Guilio, with enthusiasm; and the true Corsican
                  spirit flashed from his eyes as he put forth his hand, and clasped the delicate
                  one extended to him across the table.
               Marie spoke with much emotion, and she became deadly pale as her eyes fixed in a
                  kind of tranced horror upon some vision that flitted before her.
               "Forbear! forbear! It makes my heart quiver to hear you speak thus. Clarice, give
                  him no such right; the heart may change—who knows? but the life, the life, belongs
                  only to the God who gave it. 'Tis not yours to pledge, nor his to take. Beware
                  what you do, for I see—I see stretching before me a vista that—"
               She paused convulsively, and covered her eyes with her hands. Clarice imperiously
                  spoke:
               "Silence, Marie. I will have no croaking on this my bridal day. Look at this
                  yellow flower, which blooms against the wall; it is the sympathetic helianthus;
                  and when a single twig is torn away, all the blossoms drop from it. It is a type
                  of my life; torn from Guilio, every hope, every joy would perish, and my
                  life-blood may flow at his command when the heart it animates proves treacherous
                  to him."
               Marie could say no more, but her pallor became more deadly, and she sank back with
                  closed eyes and clasped hands.
               Benedetto watched her with strange interest. He was aware that among the common
                  people she was regarded as a kind of seeress, and although by nature skeptical, he
                  was curious to learn what her gift of second sight enabled her to behold in the
                  future of Clarice. He said:
               "Senora Montoni, you have blanched the cheek of our fair bride, and have caused
                  Guilio's heart to feel its first jealous pang, by hinting a
                  doubt of her fidelity to one she has braved so much to join. Surely your familiar
                  spirit must deceive you. Speak—do away with the sad impression your words have
                  made."
               With a convulsive sigh, Marie aroused herself from her semi-trance, and said:
               "Come, let us eat, drink, and be merry. Do not heed me; I am only a bird of evil
                  omen, and not fit to sit at bridal feasts. But for the loneliness of Clarice
                  without me, I should not have come hither; let not my sadness mar the joy of this
                  hour, which should be dedicated to the union of two devoted hearts. Give me wine,
                  wine, that I may pledge you. I drink the ruby nectar, and may its crimson hue be
                  matched by that of the life-blood of the heart that proves recreant to its vows.
                  Yes—such is the irrevocable decree of fate."
               There was a wild glitter in her eyes, and a feverish restlessness in her manner,
                  as she snatched the goblet and quaffed its contents. Clarice looked earnestly at
                  her, and a thrilling feeling of fear and foreboding entered her heart. She asked
                  her secret soul, if after all she had misinterpreted her own nature? Could time or
                  circumstance so change her, that she could ever become untrue to the present idol
                  of her heart? Impossible! Away with such thoughts. It was treason to dream of such
                  sacrilege toward the religion of her heart, her intense devotion to her beloved
                  Guilio."
               Yet with all this self-confidence, Clarice was but seventeen, and the woman's
                  nature lay folded in the germ of the girl's heart. Into what it might develop
                  remained to be proved in the future. For the present let her dream remain unbroken. She loved—was beloved in return,
                  and that must suffice.
               A look of such tender confidence passed between the lately wedded lovers, as
                  showed how little they apprehended change or estrangement. With a smile radiant
                  with her newly-found happiness, Clarice said:
               "Let us partake of our bridal feast, Guilio, without permitting an ominous shadow
                  to fall over us. We have endured enough to obtain the felicity of being united, so
                  let us enjoy the certainty of our present bliss."
               "Yes," murmured Marie, vaguely. "Enjoy it, my beloved Clarice; pardon me, and
                  forget what I have said. A strange cloud falls over me at moments, and I speak
                  without sufficient thought. Your nature is true and noble, then wherefore should I
                  doubt your future?"
               With the exquisite tact which was the birthright of the fair bride, she glided
                  into sprightly conversation, and performed the honors of the table so gracefully
                  that the momentary cloud soon passed away, and their hearts were tuned anew to
                  enjoyment. As they arose from the repast, Guilio said:
               "And now I will show you the crowning wonder of my subterranean home. Follow, and
                  behold."
               He turned toward a recess at the back of his seat, and lifting the heavy screen of
                  matted vines which fell to the floor, revealed a door concealed behind them. This
                  opened at his touch, and a narrow passage with large recesses on either side,
                  which seemed to be used as storehouses, descended abruptly about twenty feet to a
                  rocky platform which jutted over the sea, thus affording a wide view over its
                  waters, stretching away toward the opposite coast of Italy. In the rear, the
                  mountain peaks rose so abruptly as completely to isolate this little lookout, and
                  from below, the beetling crags projected over the water in such a manner as to
                  preclude all possibility of access from the sea below, which dashed its vexed
                  waters against the granite cliffs with a continuous roar that came with softened
                  echoes to the spot on which they stood.
               The white sails of vessels gleamed upon the purple waves over which the evening
                  sun was setting in all the golden radiance of an Italian sky; Guilio pointed to a
                  felucca in the distance, and said:
               "Yonder flies the Violante; Barnardo has lost no time in going on his voyage."
               Clarice kissed her hand, and wafted it toward the vessel as she spoke with
                  enthusiasm:
               "May a blessing go with him for his kindness to us. Ah, dear Guilio, this is a
                  paradise to which he has been instrumental in transporting me. How have you been
                  able to keep your secret so well as to take me so completely by surprise?"
               Her lover smiled fondly on her, as he replied:
               "I wished to woo you as one of your own caste; then show you all the beauty of my
                  lonely home, and reveal to you that I am rich enough to support you in comfort;
                  aye, even in a species of barbarian luxury, if you can school your mind to the
                  solitude in which we must live. Benedetto is my comrade and sworn friend—Marie is
                  yours; beside these we shall see no one, except Angelo and his wife, when their
                  services are needed."
               "That will be charming! I shall enjoy this life of love and seclusion above all
                  things."
               "I hope so," he seriously said; "for I shall be wretched if it should prove
                  otherwise. But I have not yet revealed to you all the mysteries of our singular
                  abode. Here we are completely isolated from the outside world, for nothing can
                  reach us from without, unless a balloon should poise itself above us and drop down
                  upon our platform. From a concealed
                  cealed entrance to one of the caverns we passed in coming hither, opens a narrow
                  path, by which escape to the hills above may be secured, if, by any chance, the
                  situation of the cave should be betrayed. From another of them winds a flight of
                  steps—cut in the rock, ages ago, by some barbarian invader—which lead to a
                  submarine grotto of such marvellous beauty as will make all the adornments of our
                  cavern seem poor and commonplace in comparison."
               "Let us visit it at once," said Clarice, eagerly. "Can we not go without
                  delay?"
               "It is too late now, my love, and the events of this busy day have already wearied
                  you and your friend sufficiently. You will be compelled to descend a rough passage
                  several hundred feet before we reach the sea, over a road by no means adapted to
                  ladies' feet. To-morrow you will be rested and refreshed, and then we will go
                  below."
               "To-morrow let it be then. I shall begin to believe myself indeed a mountain
                  queen, and to love with more intense devotion the dear hand that bestows so much
                  upon me."
               She took his hand, and would have lifted it to her lips, but Guilio imprisoned
                  both her own and kissed them playfully. Clarice blushed and struggled to free
                  them, and, in so doing she caught the expression of Benedetto's face, as he looked
                  upon this little by-play with a fiery gleam in his black eyes, that thrilled her
                  soul with a nameless dread. She fervently wished that this man was not upon her
                  path, though she could not have explained to herself why she feared him, and a
                  sudden chill fell over the warm exuberance of her feelings. She drew her hands
                  from the clasp of Guilio's, and stood calm and collected beside him.
               After a pause she said:
               "If there is an outlet toward the hills, we can sometimes walk on terra
                  firma."
               "Oh, yes; every path in this vicinity is well known to me, and it shall be my
                  pleasure to introduce you to them. I will teach you how to use a light carbine
                  which my mother once carried, and we will share our pastimes together."
               "That will be charming. Yes—I feel that I was formed for this wild, free life, and
                  with you for my guide and companion, I shall be truly blessed among women."
               "Yet, senora," said Benedetto, with a touch of sarcasm in his tones, "I should say
                  that so rare and delicate a creature as yourself would flourish far better in the
                  perfumed atmosphere that surrounds a court. The highest civilization alone
                  deserves to claim such beauty as yours; and a spirit so capable of asserting
                  itself, and maintaining its true position, should have a sphere befitting its
                  loftiest aspirations. If you hope to confine a soul of fire, such as I see in you,
                  to the narrow boundaries of this cavern, you understand yourself but little."
               With an expression of chilling reserve, the young bride replied:
               "You misjudge me, senor. Time proves all things; among the rest, its progress will
                  show you that I have read my own heart aright, and found through its teachings,
                  that exceeding love sufficeth for all things to those who are capable of feeling
                  it."
               Benedetto bowed lowly before her, as if convinced by her words; but in his heart
                  lay folded the purpose to test the strength of that love, and assure himself that
                  it was indeed a shield of adamant against his subtle power.
               Clarice turned to Guilio and quickly said:
               "Let us go in; I feel the chill of the evening air, and Marie is actually
                  shivering."
               Guilio offered her his hand to guide her steps, and followed by the others they
                  soon regained the dining-hall. During
                  their absence the table had been cleared, and by the light of a lamp suspended
                  from a projecting cornice, Clarice saw that the national dish broccio was served
                  for their supper. This is a species of flat, white cake, made from coagulated
                  goat's milk, which on this occasion was eaten with wine and sugar. After tasting
                  and commending the delicate preparation, Clarice said:
               "What fairy played the part of waiting maid in our absence? I hope Lisa does not
                  have to descend those dreadful stairs every time she is wanted here?"
               "Oh, no; the hill entrance is known to Lisa, and her own apartments are near it.
                  She comes by that way to attend to her domestic duties."
               When supper was over, Clarice and her friend retired to the inner chamber, while
                  the two comrades lit their long, Turkish pipes, and talked over the late incidents
                  in which they were interested.
               Of course, the two girls made a thorough exploration of the apartment of Clarice,
                  and everything in it was duly admired by those who took so keen a personal
                  interest in all its details. In their progress, a mandolin in excellent tune was
                  found, and Marie touched it with her usual skill, accompanying the music
                  occasionally with her voice in a strange, wild chant, improvised as she
                  proceeded.
               The echoes caught up the strain, and filled the lofty columned recesses with weird
                  and thrilling melody, that seemed to die in the distance in faint swells of music,
                  as if the spirits of the air were bearing it away upon their viewless wings.
               Clarice heard and thoroughly enjoyed the grand refrain, but she paid no heed to
                  the words, for her mind and heart were too deeply occupied with reviewing the
                  incidents of the day; and she devoutly returned thanks to heaven for her great
                  happiness in escaping the odious love of Matra, to be elevated to the position in
                  which she was now placed.
               Ambition, the sin for which angels fell, was a leading trait in her character, and
                  she thought with triumph that her love for the lowly fisherman had given her to
                  one she considered so far above the station she had lately occupied. She thought
                  of those she had abandoned forever to follow him, and she rejoiced that Senora
                  Marcante's family possessed no claim upon her, that she was free to follow her
                  mountain lord whither fate might lead her.
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               A PATRICIAN HOME, AND ITS GLOOMY MASTER.
               THE scene changes to the vicinity of Genoa, once the proud, now the fallen, but
                  still a noble Italian city. The residence of the ancient family of Ernesti was no
                  modern villa, but a castle of the middle ages, built upon the side of a hill which
                  overlooked the sea; and the grounds in the rear of the mansion were terraced to
                  its summit. From this point, the scene was grand and beautiful, for it commanded a
                  view of the shore beneath, dotted with picturesque villages; with the gleaming
                  waters of the bay stretching off into the open sea, while in the far distance the
                  snow-crowned Alps reared their summits toward Heaven, glittering in every variety
                  of light and shadow.
               The castle was approached through an avenue lined with boxwood hedges, and shaded
                  by rows of magnificent trees, which opened upon a circular area adorned with
                  statuary, and filled with lemon and orange trees, bearing both fruit and flowers.
                  From this a grape trellis stretched to the foot of a flight of marble steps
                  leading into the first floor of the immense pile, which bore upon its mildewed
                  surface the evidence of its own antiquity.
               
               The grounds were not devoted alone to ornamental purposes, for on the wide
                  terraces, grape covered walks extended in every direction, offering both shade and
                  fruit to those who paused to rest upon the seats of sculptured stone placed at
                  convenient intervals among them.
               From a wide entrance hall with a tesselated pavement, a second flight of marble
                  steps led upward to a grand reception-room, ornamented with old paintings,
                  heir-looms in the ancient family of the Ernesti; and stately rooms filled with
                  antique carved furniture, and gilded hangings, carried the imagination back to the
                  days of grand old emprise and renown, when stately dames and lordly chevaliers
                  held their revels in those walls.
               Now the silence of desolation reigned over this grand old pile, for no voice of
                  mirth was ever heard within its halls, and joyless had been the existence of its
                  lonely master for many, many years. Yet everything was kept in the most rigid
                  order. The servants glided like spectres upon their silent rounds of duty,
                  attending with scrupulous care to the commands of a stern and exacting master, who
                  tolerated no laxity of discipline among those under his control.
               Like most men of his high rank, Count Ernesti had served in the army in early
                  life, and in his retirement he carried with him the habits of the military
                  martinet. He had lived almost alone for years, wrapped in his pride of station,
                  and the misanthropy which had been the offspring of events he shuddered to recall,
                  yet which he could never cast into oblivion, for conscience will at times make
                  cowards of us all.
               A chapel, upon whose shrine many votive offerings were laid by the stern lord of
                  the castle, occupied one wing of the building; and a white-haired priest, now very
                  infirm from years, had a suite of rooms allotted to him, and a pension from the
                  count for officiating at its altar. Yet the two men rarely met; at stated
                  intervals, Ernesti confessed to Father Gregory, received his absolution, and
                  parted from him in solemn silence.
               The repentant man and the simple-hearted priest had little in common, and they did
                  not attempt to play a part toward each other. Self-sustained and stern, Count
                  Ernesti asked neither for sympathy nor compassion; his pride was as indomitable as
                  the granite hills on which his castle stood, and Prometheus-like he could feel the
                  vulture gnawing at his heart without betraying to the looker-on the anguish he
                  endured.
               In early life this man had been impulsive, impassioned, and romantic; though his
                  best qualities were marred by a vein of cruelty which is too often found among his
                  countrymen. Harsh and hard things were whispered about him, and it was even
                  asserted that crime had darkened the days of his youth, for which he was now
                  bearing a lifelong penance. Let his misdeeds have been what they might, Count
                  Ernesti was atoning for them in the silence and desolation of a life as joyless as
                  that of the monks of La Trappe.
               In the wing of the castle opposite to that which contained the chapel, was a suite
                  of rooms occupied by the master, and there, severed from sympathy or association,
                  Count Ernesti passed the days of his weary life. His sitting-room, in which his
                  meals were usually served, was fitted up with extreme simplicity; and in it were
                  found only such articles of furniture as were absolutely necessary for daily
                  use.
               The library, which joined this apartment, was a large, shadowy-looking room, with
                  windows opening to the floor, and heavy carved bookcases filled with volumes in
                  every modern language, and on every conceivable subject, either of science,
                  literature, or art.
               Beyond this, was a room which no footstep save his own ever entered; and he only
                  sought it on days of humiliation and
                  confession, when tears of blood were wept within its seclusion.
               Yet there was nothing rich or grand in that simple apartment. It only contained
                  the humble furniture from a peasant's cottage, which had evidently seen good
                  service, for it was worn and scarred in many places.
               In contrast with its meanness, was a magnificent inlaid dressing-case, on which
                  the name of Ginevra was enamelled in gold; this was placed upon a stand of common
                  wood, with drawers, which were pulled open by steel rings. In place of the mirror,
                  which seemed to have been broken, a portrait hung over it in such a position as to
                  give the figure it represented the appearance of bending forward in an attitude of
                  supplication.
               This idea was carried out by the imploring expression of the face and the clasped
                  hands of the dark-eyed girl it represented. She wore the costume of a peasant, and
                  the white muslin mesure worn by the lower orders of Genoese women, in place of a
                  bonnet, was laid in soft folds upon her shining black hair, and descending thence
                  in flowing lines, was gathered with natural grace over the neck and shoulders in
                  the form of a shawl.
               The face was singularly lovely, but in spite of its pleading expression, both will
                  and the power of resistance were seen in the curves of the red lips, and in the
                  veiled fire of the deep dark eyes. They revealed a nature that would bear much,
                  but once aroused to desperation, she would be capable of any sacrifice sooner than
                  bow the pride of her soul before her oppressor.
               A decaying shutter permitted a ray of sunshine to penetrate the dim room, and it
                  played in golden light upon the head of the portrait, lingering as a halo around
                  its exquisite loveliness. At that instant the door of the apartment slowly
                  unclosed, and feet that seemed reluctant to perform their allotted penance,
                  crossed its threshold. The visitor paused, and looked slowly around, and he
                  started as his eyes fell upon the illuminated face, whose speaking eyes looked
                  into his own with that imploring expression so long since stamped upon his heart
                  in living characters of fire.
               Count Ernesti, with pale lips, muttered:
               "Ah! how like, how fatally like that fascinating serpent, who bent but to conquer.
                  Oh, Ginevra, Ginevra, loved beyond expression, punished beyond example, whither,
                  whither didst thou flee to baffle me so completely? Years have merged in the vast
                  sea of eternity since that fatal night, and no clue is yet fonnd—none! none!"
               The speaker sank upon his knees in front of the picture, and clasped his hands in
                  an attitude of passionate anguish.
               Count Rinaldo Ernesti had scarcely passed his fortieth year, yet his hair was
                  white as a snowdrift, and his brow bore marks which sixty years would scarcely
                  have stamped there, if those years had been spent in the calm enjoyment of the
                  blessings to which he was born. His high station and noble fortune had only proved
                  fairy gifts to him, for the ill use of which a grievous price had been exacted.
                  Ernesti had been a singularly handsome man, and his marked features bore the stamp
                  of patrician blood in the clearly cut curves of the thin nostril, the short upper
                  lip, and the finely moulded chin, but the expression was stern, haughty and
                  relentless, and even in his present attitude of humiliation, his carriage was more
                  that of a Roman senator in the days of Rome's palmy pride, than that of a penitent
                  who implores pardon for his sins.
               An hour was passed in prayer, and then he arose, gave a last mournful look to the
                  face of her he had once madly loved and fearfully punished, and left the room,
                  closing the door softly and carefully behind him.
               A recess in front of one of the library windows was shaded by the waving branches of umbrageous trees,
                  and in this was placed a small antique stand, on which stood a carafe of
                  ice-water, a cut glass goblet, and a sevres china plate filled with dates. This
                  was the only refection the count allowed himself upon that sad anniversary of the
                  life-wreck which had overtaken him.
               He threw himself upon the chair in front of the table, and with clasped hands,
                  gloomy brow, and writhing lips, recalled the anguish, crime and despair of all
                  those years, flowing from one cause, jealousy, fed, fired, and confirmed by one he
                  had believed his friend, yet who had strangely urged him on to the commission of a
                  crime which could scarcely be paralleled in the annals of civilization.
               A crime that made him thrill and shiver with a nameless dread when its
                  recollection swept across his conscience in those hours of solitude of which he
                  passed so many. No wonder was it that his hair was white, that his features bore
                  the stamp of premature age; the wonder was that reason had not long since reeled
                  beneath the ghastly burden of his fatal secret.
               Ernesti, with his wasted hands clasped over his face, seemed absorbed in gloomy
                  thought; half an hour passed thus, when a faint, timid rap was struck upon the
                  door. He started violently, looked angry and astonished, and when the knock was
                  repeated, asked in a harsh tone:
               "Who dares to disturb me on this day?"
               A deprecating voice from behind the closed door replied:
               "It is I, Jacopo, my lord, and I bring to you a letter of such importance as
                  demands immediate attention."
               "Let the letter wait till to-morrow," was the stern response. "It is well known to
                  all my household that on this day I attend to no secular affairs. Take it away at
                  once."
               This was uttered in his most imperious tone, but the man again ventured to
                  speak:
               "My lord, the bearer waits. He insists on seeing you without delay, and—and—oh, my
                  lord, believe your faithful Jacopo, it will be best to see him, but
                  before doing so, it will be necessary to read the few lines I bring you."
               There was so marked an emphasis on a portion of his words, and the voice of the
                  speaker sounded so tremulous, that his agitation communicated itself to the
                  listener. His cadaverous face grew yet more livid, and he staggered from his seat
                  as if moved by a sudden impulse of fear.
               Hurriedly opening the door, his steward, an elderly man of respectable appearance,
                  stood before him, holding a package, which bore upon it the seal of the Pope. It
                  was marked:
               "Important—to be delivered to Count Ernesti without delay."
               The authority of the head of the church is still held in great respect in Italy,
                  and Ernesti thought he understood the source of the steward's extreme anxiety to
                  fulfill the mission intrusted to him. But if he had glanced at the man's face, he
                  would have seen that his emotion had a deeper source than respect for the church;
                  its usual purple hue had changed to a leaden pallor, and his eyes had in them a
                  wild expression of terror that might have startled the most casual observer. But
                  Count Ernesti only snatched the letter, and without a glance at the bearer,
                  briefly said:
               "I have broken my vow thus far, but the messenger must await my pleasure; I cannot
                  see him to-day."
               The steward did not venture to reply. He bent his head respectfully, and the door
                  was closed upon him. But the man did not go away; he staggered against the wall,
                  waiting and listening with breathless impatience to be recalled, for he knew that
                  the bearer of that missive must be received, even upon the day dedicated to
                  penitence and prayer.
               The door was no sooner secured within than Ernesti tore open the envelope, and gazed with stupid terror
                  upon its contents. There was a single folded paper, on which a faint pencil sketch
                  was traced, representing a vault, a bound man, a pile of stones, and a tub of
                  mortar, but they were awfully suggestive to him whose eyes now glared upon them,
                  as if the dread phantom of his life had suddenly assumed form and substance.
               Beneath was written:
               
                  "The avenger is upon your track. Will you receive him alone, or will you force
                     him to blazon your crime to the world? Decide quickly, for on this anniversary
                     I choose to perform my mission. I must see you without delay, for I have that
                     to communicate which no third person should hear. If you refuse to hearken to
                     it in the privacy of your library, it shall be proclaimed aloud before your
                     menials. Choose for yourself."
               
               There was no signature, but the Count recognized the writing, and he also
                  remembered the implacable nature of the man who had traced those lines. With a
                  deep groan he struck his hand upon his brow, and bitterly said:
               "Better had I died myself than have listened to the voice of him who pretended to
                  be my friend, while he urged me on to that terrible sacrifice. I hoped the wretch
                  was dead, but he comes after years of silence to torture me again; and see—he has
                  dared to use a false seal representing the authority of the head of the holy
                  church. Sacrilegious wretch! this merits severe punishment, if I durst mete it out
                  to him; but I dare not, for I am fatally in his power, and he knows it."
               He hastily swallowed a goblet of the ice-cold water, and then with shaking hand
                  rang the silver bell that rested on the table. It had scarcely vibrated when he
                  heard the sound of the lock turning; but he had fastened it on the inner side, and
                  with unsteady steps Ernesti approached it, and again stood before his steward with
                  a face so changed that even Jacopo was appalled. Making an effort to steady his
                  voice, he said:
               "Let the bearer of this letter come to me. It is more important than I thought,
                  and the Pope will give me absolution for attending to his commands even on the day
                  I have dedicated to penance."
               "Undoubtedly, my lord," replied Jacopo, with a strange expression on his
                  frightened face, and he hurried away upon his errand.
               Ernesti walked to and fro with perturbed steps and frowning brow, and when the
                  measured tread of him who was approaching fell upon his ear, he waited in
                  breathless expectation till he stood upon the threshold.
               The steward stepped aside, and a tall figure in the dress of a priest, with his
                  shovel hat pulled over his brows, stood with folded arms in the doorway calmly
                  surveying the agitated man he had come to visit.
               Making a violent effort for self-control, Ernesti advanced a step, and hoarsely
                  said:
               "Enter and let us confer together as briefly as may be, and then—"
               "And then?" interrupted the deep-toned voice of the stranger. "What then, Rinaldo
                  Ernesti? Wait till you have heard me, for I bring tidings of great importance to
                  you. The good Jacopo will leave us alone, for his complicity in your other affairs
                  does not entitle him to hear the communication of which I am the bearer."
               Ernesti waved his hand to the steward, and he immediately stepped back and closed
                  the door behind the visitor, though he did not remove himself far from the spot;
                  on the contrary, he used his utmost ingenuity to overhear what was passing within the room. In this, however, he
                  was baffled; for the Count led the way to the farther end of the long apartment,
                  and pointed to a seat near the table.
               The visitor sank into it, helped himself to a goblet of water, and with a laugh,
                  said:
               "Lenten fare this, and poor welcome to a long absent friend, ha!
                  ha!"
               There was something so sinister in the sound of his laugh that the listener
                  shuddered. He said:
               "Can you jest while you crush me! Friend! I once madly believed you such,
                  Barnardo, but in the years that have gone by since that fatal night I have gained
                  a more accurate perception of your true character. I have even, at times, doubted
                  if all you revealed to me was true; I have feared that you had some purpose of
                  your own to gain in urging me on to the commission of a deed that has filled my
                  days with remorse, and my nights with dreams of horror."
               The Count paused with the cold dew of suffering bursting out upon his brow. With a
                  sardonic smile, Barnardo laid aside his hat, as he replied:
               "So—in spite of my disguise, you know me?"
               Ernesti pointed impressively to the pencil sketch.
               "Who but you could have sent me that reminder? You announced yourself as legibly
                  as if your name had been written upon the paper."
               "A priest, through the confessional, might have gained the same power, and I
                  thought it possible that I might play a part for a season; but it does not matter.
                  Since you know me, you also know that I have come on business of serious import,
                  for I never trifle."
               "Speak—I listen. What has brought you to me after the lapse of so many years?"
               "A discovery of vital consequence to you."
               "Of what nature?"
               "Have you not of late revived the search for the retreat of the wife who fled from
                  your roof on the night of—of the sacrifice?"
               The Count shivered, and a livid pallor overspread his convulsed features, but he
                  retained sufficient command of his voice to say:
               "You are right. I wish to reclaim my daughter; the girl has become important to
                  me, and I must receive her as my child."
               "Why so? I must be enlightened as to the causes of your anxiety to reclaim the
                  daughter you have so long permitted to remain in obscurity."
               "She is the heiress of my name and fortune, and she is now of a marriageable age.
                  Are not these sufficient reasons for wishing to discover the hiding-place of
                  herself and her mother?" replied the Count, evasively.
               Barnardo fixed his searching glance upon him.
               "They seem to be, but there is yet another motive. Speak; unveil the whole truth,
                  for I must know it. Count Ernesti, you are no mystery to me; like the ostrich that
                  hides its head in the sand, and believes itself invisible to its pursuer, you make
                  shallow efforts to deceive me, but I warn you that I see through and baffle them.
                  Why was Luigni Roma sent on this errand to Isola Rossa, with such pressing
                  instructions to follow up the clue which you believed you had at last found?"
               "Ha! you know that? Where, then, is Luigni? and why have I heard nothing from him
                  for more than two months?"
               "Because he has gone to his account, and his credentials have fallen into my
                  hands. Here they are," and Barnardo produced the papers he had purloined from the
                  house of Matra.
               "From these I learned that Count Ernesti wishes to reclaim the daughter he has so long virtually cast
                  off. Now, knowing you as well as I do, I am certain that some interest, is to be
                  served by claiming this child. What is it?"
               At this abrupt demand the Count changed color, and his eyes sank before those of
                  the brigand, which were bent unflinchingly upon him. He made no immediate reply,
                  and Barnardo went on:
               "The title you bear cannot descend to your daughter; you may have saved a dower
                  for her from your income, but of that I am doubtful; for your offerings to the
                  church, as an atonement for your crime, have drained your coffers. If the girl
                  comes back to you, is it your purpose to immolate her as a sin offering also? Have
                  you thought of making her a nun?"
               "No—I have no such intention. You speak the truth with reference to my affairs,
                  though how you have kept yourself so accurately informed of them I cannot imagine.
                  Since you insist upon it, I will tell you the truth. A brother of my wife went to
                  the island of Barbadoes, and settled. He there accumulated an immense fortune,
                  which he has bequeathed to my daughter on the sole condition that she is
                  acknowledged by me, and restored to her true position as Countess Ernesti. She
                  will be a millionaire, and I have no right to defraud her of her inheritance. I
                  have bitterly repented of my precipitation, and I fear that I treated my wife with
                  unjustifiable barbarity. Look at me—see how I have suffered, and pity me. If you
                  know aught of this child, give me the power to atone for the past. It is the only
                  expiation I can now make."
               While he thus spoke, Barnardo surveyed him with an inexplicable expression, in
                  which aversion and contempt were blended with other and deeper feelings. His voice
                  rang out clear as a clarion—deep as a death-bell:
               "So—o, Count Ernesti, suffering has taught you a lesson, and you at last feel that
                  you may have been unjust to the wife you crushed as never was woman crushed
                  before. Now listen to me, and believe that a spirit from the Inferno
                  has been sent hither to tempt you, to torture you; finally, perhaps, to destroy
                  you. I have no mercy in my heart, Count Ernesti, for I am a Corsican, and the
                  vendetta was sworn by me against you in those years when we stood together, in the
                  morning of life, seeming friends, but on my part, in reality we were deadly
                  foes."
               The count raised his hand to his head, and tried to carry his memory back to the
                  days of their youth; but his thoughts grew bewildered, and he feebly said:
               "I felt no enmity toward you; on the contrary, I trusted you, I followed your
                  counsels, and see to what they have brought me."
               A smile of bitter meaning played over the features of Barnardo, and he said:
               "It has brought you exactly to what I intended it should. Listen, count, noble,
                  senator, to the story I have to relate, and then dare to judge me as one
                  prosecuting an unjust vengeance."
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               A SAD TRAGEDY—UNDYING HATE.
               BARNARDO paused an instant, and then, with relentless voice, went on:
               "My father was a man of brilliant talents and impulsive temperament; the last gave
                  his deadly foe an advantage over him which threw him into a dungeon, where he
                  perished of that hopelessness which wears into the soul of the prisoner. Ten years of his life were wasted in that
                  dreary abode, and during every hour of those years he invoked retribution upon the
                  head of him who caused him to suffer thus. The author of those sufferings was
                     your father."
               The count made an effort to speak, but Barnardo waved his hand, and rapidly
                  proceeded:
               "Hear me out, for I cannot be interrupted. With the subtle precaution of his
                  Italian nature, Ernesti concealed his own agency in these persecutions, and
                  thought to disarm future vengeance by pretended kindness to the son of his victim.
                  I was received into his palace, educated with his heir, and treated as an
                  equal—for I, too, was of noble blood.
               "The story of my father's wrongs was sedulously concealed from me, and I grew to
                  manhood in the belief that Count Ernesti was the best friend that an orphan boy
                  ever possessed. I was nineteen years of age, when a package from the secret
                  archives of the Inquisition was delivered to me. The priest who attended my father
                  in his last moments, pledged himself to communicate to me the facts of his arrest,
                  his long imprisonment, and final death in the cell in which he had passed so many
                  years of agony. A copy of all the proceedings against him was among the papers,
                  and from them I learned that the man whose bread I ate—to whom I was indebted for
                  a home, education, everything that made me what I was—had basely destroyed my
                  father to the slow tortures of despair, because he was a political rival that he
                  feared and hated.
               "To thrust him from his own path, he had given him ten years of living anguish,
                  and to complete the wrong, he had won the gratitude and affection of that victim's
                  child. Yes—hard and reckless as I now am, I loved your father once. How unworthy
                  he was of that love, you now know; how strong the feeling was, is proved by the
                  fact that it withheld held my hand when it was raised to strike the venerable head
                  I had so long revered.
               "When this revelation came to me, Count Ernesti lay upon his death-bed, and I
                  spared him the few days God yet granted him on earth; but I savagely repeated the
                  assurance that 'the sins of the father shall be visited upon his children,' and
                  bided my time."
               The listener shuddered, and his chilled heart grew yet heavier as he regarded the
                  speaker. He said:
               "Yet for years after that time you played the part of my friend."
               There was a touch of feeling in Barnardo's voice, as he replied:
               "True—and until after events stamped their impress upon my life, I shrank from the
                  retribution I believed it my solemn duty to exact."
               "And those events—"
               "Have patience; I am coming to them. The record is not very long, but it is very,
                  very terrible."
               The count again drank from the iced water, and Barnardo watched him with a kind of
                  diabolical triumph in his dark, burning eyes. He arose, and pointed through the
                  open window toward a village lying on the edge of the bay, which was indistinctly
                  seen through the foliage of the trees.
               "In yonder hamlet dwelt a lovely girl belonging to the better class of the
                  peasantry. Ginevra Vivaldi was the toast of the whole country; but I need not tell
                     you how fair she was. We both saw her, we both loved her."
               The count would have spoken, but his voice died away in an indistinct murmur, and
                  Barnardo went on as if no interruption had been attempted.
               "Ginevra was already betrothed to one of her own caste, a handsome youth, who
                  expected to lead her to the altar on the next festival day. The bridal presents
                  were made, the trousseau was prepared,
                  when I entered her bower of bliss, and whispered that beauty such as hers should
                  never be concealed in a peasant's cottage.
               "The girl was ambitious; she listened to my flatteries, and slighted her lover,
                  though I saw through all, that her heart really preferred him. When I thought of
                  Ginevra, the madness of a first passion fired my heart, and rendered my brain
                  dizzy. She bewildered me, fascinated me, and made me wild to tear her from her
                  promised husband, even while I knew that in secret her heart clung to him.
               "You know the sequel, Ernesti; yet I will retrace it for you. You heard me rave of
                  Ginevra's charms—you sought her out, became equally enamored of, her, and offered
                  as a bribe the station of a countess. Her weak heart yielded to the temptation;
                  she cast aside both her former lovers, and pledged herself to you.
               "In my deep soul I felt that she was too worthless to contend for; but the sting
                  of mortified pride, and wounded affection, gave the needed impulse to the purpose
                  of my vengeance which had so long slumbered. From the hour in which you stepped
                  between me and the woman I wildly loved, there was deadly vendetta between us. But
                  I was too wary to betray the fury that filled my heart; you were powerful, I was
                  weak; and I knew that only by secret machinations could I succeed in gaining that
                  vengeance which, from that hour, I was resolute to make the cherished purpose of
                  my life."
               Barnardo paused here, but the count only motioned to him; the words he attempted
                  to utter died away upon his lips, and he listened in appalled silence to this
                  long-delayed revelation.
               "You succeeded in winning Ginevra from her betrothed, yet you deferred for months
                  the marriage which was to repay her for the sacrifice of her affections. I found
                  it easy to arouse the suspicious jealousy of her brothers, and make them believe
                  that you were trifling with her. I trusted that it might indeed prove so, for then
                  I could renew my pretension to her favor, but your love proved stronger than your
                  pride, and sooner than relinquish her, you gave her your name, and elevated the
                  peasant girl to your own rank.
               "Ginevra Vivaldi became Countess Ernesti, and her elder brother, with a sum of
                  money advanced by you, emigrated to the West Indies, where, it seems, he
                  eventually grew rich. You employed masters for your new toy; you sought to
                  cultivate her natural graces, that, in time, she might adorn the station to which
                  you had raised her, but you could not give her happiness.
               "The silly child had imagined that a stately home, with servants at her command,
                  would supply all the needs of her nature, but she too soon discovered that to her
                  passionate soul this brilliant home was but a desert of tinsel and marble, amid
                  which she walked in dreariness of heart, and she prayed for forgiveness for having
                  deserted the man she loved, to gain them.
               "I had watched Ginevra from a distance from the time of her marriage, but at this
                  crisis I again appeared upon the scene. I would have lured her from her allegiance
                  to her wedded lord, but she indignantly refused to listen to my avowals of love,
                  and threatened to reveal to you that I had dared to make them. That threat sealed
                  her fate. I became more guarded in my conduct toward her, but I hoarded the anger
                  that burned fiercely within me, till it would be safe to display it."
               The count muttered:
               "Oh, God! to what does all this tend? What, what is coming to annihilate me at one
                  fell blow?"
               "Listen, and you shall hear," replied Barnardo, with sardonic coolness. "I kept my
                  eye on Guiseppe, the discarded lover of
                  Ginevra. I knew that in his despair at the perfidy of his betrothed, he had gone
                  into the forest, and become the companion of outlaws and desperate men. I also
                  knew that he had twice penetrated to the grounds which surrounded this castle, and
                  each time had found means to see and speak with the object of his undying
                  affection.
               "I kept this knowledge to myself, with the resolution to use it at the proper
                  moment for the furtherance of my own purposes. This man had become a sanguinary
                  bandit; his life was forfeited to the laws, for he had twice committed murder with
                  his own hand since he fled to the forest. I regarded his sacrifice as of small
                  moment, if by that means I gained over you the power I yearned to possess.
               "I would make you the agent of vengeance upon Guiseppe, and when the heart of your
                  wife was turned from you in loathing and horror, I would again breathe into her
                  ear the tale of my devotion, and show her that her only refuge from the authority
                  of him who had so outraged her nature, was the protection I offered her."
               "Fiend! wretch! how dare you thus coolly trace out the diabolical plan which had
                  such an ending!" exclaimed Count Ernesti, with feverish impatience. "This is
                  torture more consummate than any inflicted by tyrants."
               Barnardo calmly replied:
               "So you may think, but the man who suffered ten years of solitary
                  confinement, shut out from all sympathy with his kind, might not agree with you if
                  he were here to speak for himself. But I must proceed with my narrative, which I
                  perceive has a powerful interest for you, my lord, though its chief incidents are
                  already so well known to you."
               Ernesti only made a faint gesture in reply; all the sternness, the haughtiness of
                  his real nature, seemed crushed out by the dominant presence of this man. Barnardo
                  went on:
               "The birth of her daughter seemed to give a new impulse to the life of the
                  countess. You were disappointed that an heir to your name was not given, but she
                  was perfectly contented with the little morsel of humanity which seemed to win her
                  back to happiness. I began to fear that she would reconcile herself to the lot she
                  had chosen, and in time, even learn to return the affection you lavished upon
                  her.
               "Until then I had not thoroughly hated you, but that thought made me a madman. I
                  sent you anonymous accusations against your wife. I poisoned your mind till you
                  were frantic with jealousy; I proved to you that your idol had met her former
                  lover, on more occasions than one, in the grape walk, which ended in a
                  summer-house overlooking the sea. I learned that the young mother had made an
                  appointment to meet him there for the last time, to show him her infant treasure,
                  and entreat him, by the tender helplessness of this new tie that bound her to her
                  wedded lord, to leave her in peace to reconcile herself to the splendid monotony
                  in which she lived.
               "I warned you of the meeting. You took the vindictive measures counseled by me;
                  you and your tool, Jacopo, concealed yourselves near the scene of the meeting; you
                  sprang upon Guiseppe, disarmed and bound him. You then bore him to the chapel,
                  while I conveyed the fainting Ginevra to her own apartment. When she regained her
                  senses, she clung to me with such passionate entreaty that I could not deny her
                  prayer. I led her to the chapel to behold the awful scene enacting there."
               The count arose, threw his arms above his head, and exclaimed:
               "Enough! enough! I cannot bear more. Do not recall the horrors of that night, or I
                  shall go mad."
               "But to do so is necessary to the completion of my story," replied Barnardo, with
                  composure. "You must hear it, for it is
                  a portion of your allotted penance, and it is not for me to spare you
                  a single pang, for in this interview, the hoarded bitterness of years has found
                  its outlet."
               The count bowed his head in his hands, and the brigand resumed:
               "Guiseppe, gagged and bound, lay helpless upon the floor, and a niche in the wall,
                  which had been laid open, revealed the awful fate awarded him. Jacopo, at that
                  time a stone-mason in your employment, stood by him with trowel in hand, ready to
                  fulfill your commands, for he had the promise of the stewardship he has since held
                  if he served you faithfully, and kept your secret well.
               "Ginevra, with eyes dilated by terror, and a soul rent with anguish, rushed to
                  your feet, and implored the life of her lover. You—cold, hard as the marble pillar
                  against which you leaned—bade her look upon the punishment of the serf who had
                  dared to come between a noble and his bride; who had breathed his unhallowed
                  passion into the ears of a wedded wife. He must die! that was the
                  only atonement he could now offer.
               "At these stern words the pale woman arose, and threw herself between you and your
                  victim. With her frail arms she sought to protect him, but with savage violence
                  you tore her from his side; you held her with a grasp of iron, and forced her to
                  look on while Jacopo lifted the bound form as easily as if it had been one of the
                  senseless blocks of stone he was in the habit of handling daily. Holding him with
                  one hand in an upright position, he fastened a leather belt which was worn about
                  the waist of his prisoner to sustain his pistols, to a strong iron hook that had
                  been placed in the centre of the niche in which he was to be immured alive.
               "I looked on with the certainty that Guiseppe was a criminal who merited his fate,
                  and I felt that, after all, his agony would be brief, while the living death of
                     my father had extended over ten years of anguish. If you could
                  thus outrage your wife with the insane idea that you were wiping from your brow
                  the stain of this plebeian love, it was no concern of mine. Let the bandit perish,
                  and I would reap the reward of your crime. To me Ginevra must now turn as her only
                  friend, and she should not turn in vain."
               "It was with you she then fled?" said Ernesti, in a tone of intense bitterness.
                  "Is that what you have come to reveal to me?"
               "No; for until within a few weeks past I was as ignorant as you of her place of
                  concealment."
               "Go on, then. Since I can only get the sequel of the story by listening to all
                  these horrible details, I must even nerve myself to bear them."
               "Ginevra, half dead with terror, cowered at your feet, with her wild eyes gleaming
                  from amid her dishevelled tresses, gazing in dumb despair upon the helpless form
                  of her lover, which was covered with blood from a severe flesh wound he had
                  received in the struggle for his capture. In the presence of the awful fate that
                  menaced him, Guiseppe seemed paralyzed by fear and loss of blood. He made feeble
                  efforts to escape from the bonds that secured him, but they were too tightly drawn
                  to permit a chance of success, and after a few convulsive struggles his limbs
                  ceased to move, the pallor of death settled over his features, and his head
                  drooped forward as if fainting.
               "Impassive and relentless, you motioned to Jacopo to commence his allotted task.
                  From the feet upward the wall was slowly reared, and carefully cemented, and with
                  each successive layer a pair of pale, clasped hands were lifted in supplication
                  toward you, a faint, dying voice pleaded for mercy—mercy for him, for her. But you
                  sternly repeated:
               "'He must die!'
               
               
               "Gradually the aperture narrowed; the chest of the living man was enclosed, the
                  head alone remained uncovered. He seemed scarcely to breathe, but his eyes
                  unclosed and fixed themselves upon her for whose punishment this terrible doom had
                  been awarded him. Ginevra sprang toward him, threw her arms around his neck, and
                  shrieked:
               "'Let me die with him! for him have I alone loved! Count Ernesti, destroy us both,
                  and live yourself to remorse and retribution. I bequeath them to you.'
               "She passionately kissed the pale brow of the imprisoned man, assured him of her
                  undying devotion, and uttered against his murderer such frantic maledictions as
                  women in extremity of anguish can alone express."
               "Yes, yes—I recall it all," whispered the Count, in husky tones. "She was right;
                  remorse and retribution have been my lot from that hour to this, and your words
                  only assure me that my punishment has but commenced."
               "Ha! you begin to comprehend that? It is well—let me proceed:
               "Guiseppe, bound and gagged, could give no other sign of emotion except through
                  his large black eyes, but they were opened to their full extent, and their
                  expression will haunt me to my dying day. Love, anguish, despair shone through
                  them, flashing into an expression of defiance as you approached him, and tore the
                  arms of your wife, ha! ha! your wife, from the head she would have
                  sheltered and saved at the sacrifice of her own life.
               "The stone that shut out his features was lifted to its place, and Ginevra sank
                  lifeless at your feet. I sprinkled over her water from the holy fount, and when
                  she again unclosed her eyes, I raised her to her feet, and would have conducted
                  her from that fearful spot, but you, inflexible in your cruelty, turned her face
                  toward the wall which now presented a solid mass of stone, and said:
               "'It is finished, madam. Behold how Ernesti punishes the wretch who dared to come
                  between himself and the love he claims as his just right.'
               "Ginevra faintly replied:
               "'In time that love might have been yours, for I wished to be faithful to the vows
                  I have plighted to you; but now, Count Rinaldo, a wall of fire is built up between
                  us which no tears may quench, no repentance wash away. Farewell forever.'
               "She would not permit you to touch her, and I assisted her to her room; I then
                  retired to my own apartment, oppressed with a weight of horror at the dreadful
                  scene of which I had been a passive spectator. Yet mingled with this was the
                  exulting certainty that Ginevra was forever separated from the man who had so
                  cruelly outraged her. In her desolation I was the only protector to whom she could
                  appeal for aid to fly from the presence of the husband I knew she must henceforth
                  loathe.
               "Toward morning I at length fell into a perturbed slumber, which must have lasted
                  several hours, for the sun was shining broadly into my room, when I was aroused by
                  a commotion in the castle. I started up, dressed myself hurriedly, and went forth
                  to inquire its cause. A frightened servant informed me that both the countess and
                  her child were missing.
               "I rushed to Ginevra's room to assure myself that his words were true. Her bed had
                  not been slept in; the cradle of her infant was empty, and on examining her
                  drawers, it was found that the fugitive had taken with her a considerable sum of
                  money, and a few valuable jewels.
               "Like a madman you sought for her everywhere in the home so lately hers, and also
                  in the village. When convinced that she was concealed nowhere near you, large
                  rewards were offered for any information concerning her. But all your efforts were baffled—strange as it
                  seems, the slightest clue to her retreat was never gained. A woman in the garb of
                  a peasant, carrying an infant in her arms, had been seen at daylight in the
                  village below, but whence she came, or whither she had gone, was a mystery that
                  was never solved till the death of Tomaso Vivaldi threw his papers into your
                  hands.
               "From a letter among them, you learned that your long-lost wife had taken refuge
                  in Corsica.
               "From her death-bed she wrote a letter to her brother, revealing the fact that she
                  had given her child to the peasant woman in whose house she spent the last months
                  of her life; and she conjured him to leave that child to be reared by those to
                  whom she had confided her. She assured Tomaso that, after all she had suffered at
                  the hands of her husband, she could never believe that her daughter, although the
                  heiress of his name and honors, would be welcome in the house of her father.
               "Tomaso was absorbed in money-making, and he took no measures to restore the girl
                  to her birthright; but it seems that when he came to die, he bequeathed his
                  earnings to his sister's child, on the condition that she shall be acknowledged as
                  your daughter. This news broke the apathy in which you had long lived, and you
                  dispatched an agent to Isola Rossa to endeavor to trace her. Am I not right in
                  these last statements?"
               The count bent his head in assent:
               "Perfectly right; but it remains to be explained how those papers fell into your
                  hands, and to inform me what has become of my messenger."
               "He is dead, as I before intimated. It matters not how he died; suffice it, that
                  he met his fate while endeavoring to execute your commands. The casket containing
                  his instructions fell into the hands of a trader of Isola Rossa, who was on the
                  eve of seeking a wife. From this waif Matra learned the rank and probable fortune
                  of the supposed peasant girl. He knew facts concerning a beautiful creature in the
                  town which tallied with the revelations contained in the papers; moreover, he had
                  accidentally seen the blood-mark which is the heirloom of the Ernesti from the
                  days of the Crusades, when Rinaldo of the bloody hand thrust his dagger through
                  the heart of the pacha's wife, and wounded her to death."
               "And what then?" asked the count, haughtily and impatiently. "I trust the girl is
                  free; that no plebeian alliance shackles her to the base set of churls it has been
                  the sad fortune of my child to be reared among."
               "Patience—patience, my lord Count, and you shall hear. This Matra formed a scheme
                  to marry her himself. He was passing rich, and the foster mother listened
                  complacently to his proposal. Clarice, for such is the name given to your
                  daughter, rebelled against her decision, and refused to receive the trader as her
                  future husband. But her objections were scarcely listened to, and——"
               The Count here burst in, his cold eyes gleaming with suddenly aroused passion:
               "And she—she is the wife of a plebeian trader! she—the daughter of my ancient
                  line, the heiress of such a fortune! Gods! this is too much! I will snatch her
                  from him, and thrust him down to the obscurity to which he belongs!"
               "Calm yourself, Count, and receive my assurance that, thanks to my interference,
                  Clarice did not become his wife. On the eve of the marriage, I discovered the
                  secret of Matra's anxiety to secure her hand, and at the same time a clue to her
                  family was gained. I have led a wild life, as you know, Ernesti, and I have had
                  many strange friends. This Matra was one of them; he had grown rich by selling
                  smuggled goods with which I furnished him, and thus he was in my power. Yet at the last, I only saved your
                  daughter from this infamous alliance by taking the life of the bridegroom on the
                  day of the marriage."
               "I owe you thanks for that; though how or why you came to perform so hazardous an
                  act of friendship for child of mine, I do not yet understand."
               "I risked nothing for your daughter, believe me," replied Barnardo,
                  with bitter emphasis. "It was for the sake of the mother, whose retreat I had
                  sought for years, with the mad hope that, lost, ruined as I was, she might yet
                  return my love. Wait, Count Ernesti, till you know all, and then you will be
                  better able to judge if you owe me thanks for the part I have taken
                  in the affairs of your heiress."
               "Go on—go on. I am trembling with impatience. What new turn of evil have you been
                  able to do me? for that it is evil I read in the exultation upon your brow and
                  lip. Yet methinks time might have exhausted your hoarded venom long ago."
               Barnardo scarcely heeded the import of Ernesti's words, for now he was about to
                  strike his most deadly blow upon the towering pride of his foe. He impressively
                  proceeded:
               "Clarice had another suitor; he was young, handsome, and devoted to her; therefore
                  she loved him, even as Ginevra once loved the plighted bridegroom of her youth. I
                  favored their union; I arranged the means of escape for them, and Guilio Falcone
                  tore his bride from Matra almost at the altar, and bore her away to the mountain
                  solitude in which he lives."
               The listener became even paler than before, and he gasped:
               "Mountain solitude! you have not then permitted the daughter of my house to wed
                  with a bandit? an outlaw, as your words seems to portend; for I know enough of
                  Corsican life to be aware that only that class of men dwell among the hills."
               "You are very astute, Count, to have guessed the truth so quickly. Falcone is the
                  son of the celebrated Theodore, with whose exploits, twenty years ago, the whole
                  island rang. The vendetta is his birthright, but Guilio is a gallant fellow, and
                  has inherited his father's noblest traits."
               "Which are his only inheritance, I presume, except the infamy of his descent,"
                  said the count, with an accent of supreme scorn. "Truly, you have consummated your
                  long-cherished scheme of vengeance by giving my child to such a fate as this. But
                  I will rescue her from it; I will tear her from this low-born husband, and place
                  her in her true position, as the heiress of my ancient name, and the possessor of
                  a brilliant fortune."
               "Suppose she should refuse both rank and wealth, as the price of her separation
                  from the chosen of her heart?" asked Barnardo, tauntingly.
               "Then I will take her from him by force; compel her to wear the trappings of her
                  station, and having worn them a few brief months, she will be no true daughter of
                  Eve if she is willing to relinquish them for the life of poverty and privation she
                  must lead as the outlaw's bride."
               "But I assure you that such will not be her fate. Falcone inherited a sufficient
                  sum to enable him to embark in a most lucrative employment, and he has acquired
                  sufficient wealth to enable him to surround his wife with a degree of luxury to
                  which she was never accustomed in her cottage home. He inhabits a cave among the
                  hills, the entrance to which has hitherto baffled the keenest sbirri; and if
                  Clarice can endure the solitude of her mountain home, she will find there all that
                  is needed for her happiness."
               The count passionately said:
               "And how did the father acquire the means of which you spoke? Did he not levy
                  black-mail upon the people of the valley, as any other robber does? It is true,
                  that he lavishly gave what was so
                  easily gained; but his liberality cannot conceal the infamy of its acquisition.
                  Oh! degradation! to think that child of mine should share such ignoble spoil!"
               "Bethink thee, Count Ernesti; are your own skirts so clear that you can afford to
                  scorn such a man as Theodore Falcone was? Condemned to the life of an outlaw for
                  no crime of his own, in a state of society unparalleled in any other country in
                  the world, he was celebrated for his gallant daring, and his open-handed
                  generosity. The inheritance of his son was the produce of voluntary contributions,
                  paid after his death by the people of the valleys, over which he had reigned as a
                  king.
               "This sum was well managed by Count Rospoli, a nobleman, who took the boy under
                  his protection, and would have educated him for the priesthood; but Guilio
                  rebelled against this fate, and fled to the macchia. But the count was faithful to his voluntary stewardship,
                  and a sufficient sum was paid over by him to enable his former protégé to embark
                  in such speculations as have made him rich enough to live in elegance in the
                  mountain home he has chosen. Clarice is happy with the husband she loves. Let her
                  remain in peace, and I bury the vendetta. 'Tis the only atonement I can now make
                  to her unhappy mother for the suffering my selfish passion inflicted upon
                  her."
               The count regarded him sternly and coldly:
               "You speak thus because you know me too well to suppose for an instant that I will
                  yield assent to your proposal. Bear the burden of your own sin, without seeking to
                  make such atonement as this; and I also will bear mine. It can become no heavier
                  than it already is, and no inducement can be held out to me to give up my only
                  child to such a fate as she has embraced. Clarice must be separated from the man
                  who claims her as his wife, in as brief a time as possible. Was it your purpose in
                  coming hither to show me the means of doing this? or was it only to hurl this
                  wretchedness upon me, and then leave me blindly to seek the clue to her present
                  retreat?"
               "I had no purpose beyond that which has been made sufficiently apparent. Count
                  Ernesti, you took to your home the only woman I have ever loved, to trample on and
                  crush her. Your high station was a lure to her weak heart, but I truly believe it
                  will be none to her child. Yet I know not; were she mine, I would leave her to the
                  lot she has chosen, for I believe she will find happiness in it, if the sleeping
                  demons of vanity and pride are left untempted. Yet, if it is your will to drag
                  Clarice from her husband's protection, I will not say you nay. I can gain for you
                  such access to the ear of your daughter as will ensure her knowledge of all you
                  can offer in exchange for the sacrifice of true love and simple faith."
               "But that involves delay, and I must at once tear her from this infamous alliance,
                  and bring her hither, where the low-born serf who claims her dare not come," said
                  the count, imperiously. "Not a day, not an hour shall she remain with him, after
                  my emissaries have reached her."
               "Wait till they do reach her, Count," replied Barnardo, significantly. "You seem
                  to forget how inaccessible are the mountain fastnesses of Corsica, and if your
                  daughter chooses to do so, she can baffle you for years, perhaps altogether, for
                  she is keen of wit, and passionately devoted to Guilio. Receive him as her
                  husband, and she will come to you without hesitation."
               "What! accept the bandit as my son!" exclaimed the haughty noble, with undisguised
                  contempt. "It is much that I am willing to take back the daughter he has degraded
                  by his infamous love, without also receiving him in my home as an equal. No; the
                  girl must be reclaimed, because the fortune of Vivaldi is too large to be
                  forfeited, and only as Countess Ernesti
                  can Clarice claim it as her own. But for that, I should scarcely seek to regain a
                  child who has been unknown to me from her infancy. Doubtless Clarice has in her
                  manners and appearance much that will be repulsive to me, reared as she has been
                  among low-bred people."
               "In that you are mistaken. Clarice has inherited the grace and beauty of her
                  mother, and the haughtiest of your race could not be more aristocratic in bearing
                  than this little waif of Isola Rossa."
               The count listened eagerly; he slowly said:
               "She has also the stamp of the Ernesti—the mark of the bloody dagger. It is a
                  strange freak of nature, that after the lapse of ages this family heritage should
                  reappear at stated intervals. Three strokes of the dagger were given to a
                  defenceless woman, and on every third generation does the birth-mark stamp its
                  bloody impress upon the old crusader's descendants. Do you know the history of
                  those who have borne it?"
               His voice sunk almost to a whisper as he asked this question.
               "It has been tragic, I believe," replied Barnardo.
               The count shuddered.
               "It is a curse which has not yet been expiated. Four of my male ancestors have
                  borne the fatal mark, and they all perished by violence. But one woman before my
                  daughter inherited it; she fled from her father's roof with her lover, was pursued
                  by her brother, and with her own hand fired the pistol that destroyed him. She
                  thus saved the life of him who was destined, in time, to become her own murderer,
                  for in a paroxysm of mad jealousy, her husband stabbed her to the heart a few
                  years after her flight from her paternal home, and thus fearfully was expiated her
                  fratricidal act. So you see that Clarice bears the doom of her race upon her."
               "Then leave fate to work out its own purposes," said Barnardo. "Severed from you,
                  perhaps she may escape the evil; drag her hither against her will, that she may
                  claim wealth she does not need, and the end may be fatal. I came to you, Count
                  Ernesti, to triumph over your fallen pride; but an impulse I cannot resist impels
                  me to plead in behalf of the tender and true heart I so lately saw pledged to
                  follow the fortunes of her mountain king. Leave your child to obey the noble
                  instincts of her nature, and she will lead an innocent and happy life. Bring her
                  hither, surround her with the allurements of wealth; corrupt her heart with
                  ambitious hopes and worldly schemes, and the doom of your race may follow her,
                  because she will then become unfit to escape it."
               The proud lip of the listener curled.
               "Truly an innocent and respectable life she will lead as the wife of the banned
                  outlaw, who will doubtless take up the trade of his father, and live on the forced
                  contributions of those who fear to refuse his demands. Such a life does not
                  comport with my ideas of respectability, and my child shall be rescued from it at
                  all hazards. My neglect of her has hitherto been involuntary; for I would long
                  since have claimed her if I had known where she was hidden; now I shall lose no
                  time in taking such measures as are necessary to restore her to her true rank in
                  life."
               "So be it, then," replied Barnardo, with an expression from which it was difficult
                  to tell whether regret or exultation was the predominant feeling of his mind. He
                  felt a strange interest in the happiness of Clarice; yet the wild, unsated longing
                  for vengeance upon his foe lay coiled in his heart like a venomous serpent, ready
                  to rear its crest and hurl a deadly blow with the slightest hope of finding a
                  vital spot on which to strike.
               What to him was the daughter of Ginevra, that he should shield her from the evil that threatened her? Had
                  not her mother slighted, deserted him for another? Had she not preferred her
                  peasant lover before both himself and the man to whom her weak heart had been
                  tempted to pledge itself in marriage? At the tragic climax of her fate, had she
                  not baffled him, and so successfully concealed all traces of her flight that his
                  eager, despairing search had proved utterly unavailing? Why, then, should he spare
                  her child? Let the harsh, cold father assert his power over her fate; let him tear
                  her from her new-found happiness, and doom her to a separation from him to whom
                  she had given herself. Yes, he would aid Ernesti in carrying out the cruel intent
                  that was in his heart, and thus would his cherished plan of vengeance be assured,
                  for dire would be the evil that must result from such a course.
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               AN AWFUL RETROSPECT. THE FUTURE OF CLARICE SETTLED.
               BARNARDO had humiliated his enemy by aiding the marriage; he would now crush him
                  by helping him to break it; leaving to the outraged husband the vendetta a
                  Corsican would be sure to exact for his rifled home and stolen bride.
               Count Ernesti asked:
               "Am I then to understand that you will assist me to regain possession of my
                  daughter?"
               "If such is your unalterable purpose, I answer yes. But, remember that, sworn
                  enemy as I am to your house—outlaw as I have long been—I would have relented; that
                  I would have turned from my path of retributive justice; but you urge me on
                  against your own child; for it is against her dearest interests to tear her from
                  her husband."
               "Of that I am the best judge; and it is my inflexible determination to wrest her
                  from her plebeian lord. I will take instant measures to have the marriage
                  dissolved by the Pope himself, and bestow her hand on one in her own sphere of
                  life. Aid me to find her, and I shall easily accomplish the rest."
               "Be the sin then on your own head. By your own hand shall my vendetta be carried
                  out; retribution is often slow, but is always certain."
               "And why shall it not also fall on you?" asked the count, with stern emphasis.
                     "I have merited no evil at your hands. My father may have wronged
                  yours, but I was ignorant of the evil he wrought. I stepped between you and the
                  woman who loved neither of us, and bitterly have I been punished for taking to my
                  heart a being who was tempted by my rank and fortune to bear my name. It was a
                  fatal step for both of us, but Ginevra found wretchedness in our union, and it has
                  bequeathed to me years of remorse and anguish."
               "Yet they do not seem to have softened your nature, Count Ernesti," said Barnardo,
                  significantly. "Neither have the memories of that awful night had such an effect
                  on mine. Since the hour in which my father's cruel fate became known to me, I have
                  led the life of an Ishmael; my hand against every man, and every man's hand
                  against mine. Vengeance has been the only cry to which my heart has responded, for
                  it is the fatal heritage of my countrymen; but ages of oppression and wrong have
                  made us what we are, and I am not accountable for the evil transmitted to me
                  through both blood and laws. I act according to the traditions of my native island, and the wild
                  impulses of an untamed nature."
               The count regarded the reckless speaker with sorrowful composure. He said:
               "I would that the sacrifice of half my fortune could purchase for me immunity for
                  the one crime that seems to rest so lightly on your soul. I daily pray before the
                  niche in which that ghastly skeleton is walled up, but the presence of my victim
                  follows me wherever I go. I hear his sighs in the whispers of the wind; I behold
                  the fixed look of anguish and defiance that gleamed above those heavy stones, as
                  they rose slowly—slowly, shutting out life, light, breath! Oh, my God! I see him
                  before me now! I see him! I hear her agonized cries ringing in my
                  ears!"
               The speaker covered his face with his hands, as if to shut out the phantom shape
                  evoked by his own fantasy, and steeled as the nerves of Barnardo had long been to
                  shocks of every kind, he glanced around half apprehensively, wondering if there
                  could be reality in the vision that seemed to be so palpable to his companion.
               The large, shadowy room was unoccupied save by themselves, and with a feeling of
                  contemptuous pity, the brigand said:
               "No wonder that your hair has silvered before its time, if you have suffered such
                  fancies to gain the mastery over you. The wretch whose life you took richly
                  merited his fate, for he had murdered in cold blood, and the law would have
                  condemned him to execution. We but played the part allotted to us by Fate, then
                  let Fate bear the burden of the crime. Come—time presses, for I must go on my path
                  before the sun declines in the West. If you desire to claim your daughter, at once
                  arrange with me the means of communicating with her."
               "Can I trust you implicitly, Barnardo?" asked the count. "You have avowed yourself
                  my enemy, how then shall I expect you to aid me in accomplishing the wish that is
                  dearest to my heart?"
               Barnardo sneered:
               "I thought I had clearly demonstrated to you that, by assisting you, I am best
                  serving my own ends, even if they should aim at nothing less than the utter
                  extinction of your house. Since it is your will to claim Clarice, I pledge you my
                  word—and you know that a Corsican ever redeems that pledge—that I will aid you to
                  the best of my ability to restore her to her birthright, though in so doing you
                  tear-her from all that renders life valuable to her. Come—what more can you ask of
                  me than that?"
               "Nothing—it is sufficient. And now, how can I send a letter to my child, in which
                  I shall explain the causes of her long estrangement from my heart and home; in
                  which I shall plead with her to return to me of her own free will, and abjure the
                  wretched lot which her ignorance of her real station induced her to accept. Oh! a
                  father pleading with his only child cannot surely fail. Her heart must yearn over
                  the loneliness and desolation of my life, and she will not refuse to brighten my
                  future by her presence."
               "Be as sentimental as you please, my lord," said Barnardo, with that cynical
                  hardness which is the characteristic of such men; "but I warn you that it will
                  take much more than that to undermine the love of this young girl for Guilio
                  Falcone. Your only chance of success lies in her vanity and pride. Clarice is
                  beautiful, and she knows it; she has the fiery pride of your race, and may be
                  wrought on to consider her present position as degraded as you would have her
                  believe. I can furnish you a plan which will probably serve your purpose. Shall I
                  develop it?"
               "If you please; you can aid me materially, I doubt not."
               "Guilio Falcone, like most Corsican bandits, has a chosen friend and companion, who is so well fitted to
                  become the agent in this conspiracy against your daughter. Guilio is not
                  acquainted with the previous history of Benedetto, but I am; for a year ago I took
                  him from Italy, a refugee from justice. His crime was a political one, which it is
                  needless to refer to. The rank of this man is high, his family powerful, and the
                  government will finally pardon and restore him to his estates."
               "And the man himself?" eagerly asked the count. "What is he like? Can he
                  win——"
               He paused, uncertain how to go on, but Barnardo finished the sentence without
                  scruple.
               "A woman's heart? Aye, my lord, for he is handsome as Apollo, insinuating as
                  Lucifer himself, and the complete master of every wile that can reach the feminine
                  heart. Were she restored to her birthright, this man would be a fitting match for
                  your daughter, and I will furthermore tell you what my keen observation showed me
                  in the few brief moments I beheld them together. I saw, from the moment that
                  Benedetto's eyes rested on Clarice, that one of those wild, resistless passions
                  was lighted by her beauty, which stops at nothing till all obstacles are removed
                  to the possession of its object. With so many perils besetting her steps, how
                  shall this young creature escape? With the glittering temptation of rank and
                  fortune held before her by you, a fascinating lover, madly enamored, and ready at
                  any moment to wrest her from the arms of her husband, in the hope that she will
                  eventually share his life and fortune. Ah! as Clarice is but a feeble girl, I fear
                  the result of all these machinations. Poor Guilio will be thrust to the wall, and
                  the Countess Ernesti will give her hand to the Duke of Evoli, for such I foresee
                  will be the termination of the poor child's dream of eternal love."
               The count started, and a red flush crossed his pale brow. He rapidly asked:
               "Did I hear you aright? Is this refugee really the heir of Evoli?"
               "As truly as I am here, is the Duke of Evoli in the cavern, domesticated with your
                  daughter, and doubtless becoming more madly intoxicated with her charms with every
                  passing hour. Fate seems to have played into your hands, and given you almost
                  certain means of success in the undertaking you meditate. It will be a great
                  treachery against your child; but if you choose to carry it out, it is no concern
                  of mine."
               "I shall carry it out, be sure of that; and what you have just
                  revealed only gives additional strength to my determination. As Duchess of Evoli,
                  the rank of Clarice will be so brilliant as to cast into the shade this unhappy
                  entanglement with the obscure outlaw with whom she so unfortunately eloped. Enlist
                  the young duke in my interests, and offer as his reward the hand of Clarice
                  endowed with Vivaldi's wealth. Let him entice her from her place of refuge, throw
                  her into my power, and I pledge myself that she shall never again behold her
                  mountain home, nor the serf who has so degraded her in bringing her to his own
                  level. In the meantime, I will use my influence to have the attainder removed from
                  Evoli, and the bonds that bind Clarice to Falcone broken. Both these ends
                  accomplished, I can see my way clear to a brilliant future for my child."
               The count spoke as calmly and decisively as though no hopes were to be riven, no
                  hearts crushed in this struggle. He saw the end to be attained; the means were of
                  trifling moment in his estimation, though in wielding his power, he should destroy
                  the sweetest and most precious dreams that nestle in youthful and loving hearts.
                  Barnardo said:
               "I believe we fully understand each other now. You can write your letter while I
                  stroll around the place, and renew my acquaintance with some of my old friends. In
                  a month you shall have a reply. By the
                  time I see her again, the honeymoon will be over, and Clarice will have had ample
                  time to weary of her lonely life. Then, perhaps the voice of the tempter may be
                  heard; but if not quite so soon, be patient yet a little while, and the serpent
                  will not vainly have entered her Eden. In education and accomplishments, Evoli is
                  of course far superior to Guilio, and I feel assured that he will spare no pains
                  to render Clarice fully conscious of this fact, while he will make every effort to
                  arouse in her soul a consciousness of undeveloped powers, which only lack a field
                  of brilliant display to win recognition and appreciation. The demon of discontent
                  will thus enter her paradise, and then the way is open to you. You can lay your
                  hand upon her fate, and mould it to your will, but I warn you to beware of the
                  forsaken husband."
               "He can easily be dealt with," said the count, haughtily. "He has few claims,
                  either on the score of courtesy or humanity. I have removed one serf from my path
                  by violence, then why shall I be so considerate toward another, especially when
                  there is so much at stake in the future welfare of my daughter."
               Barnardo regarded the speaker almost with a shudder:
               "Truly," he said, "I have been a reckless, desperate man, for I have taken life
                  both in cold and hot blood, but I should hesitate at the consummation of such a
                  crime as this against my own child."
               "I act for her benefit alone," replied the count, with gloomy hauteur, and he sat
                  down to write his appeal.
               Barnardo walked carelessly toward the farther end of the library, unclosed the
                  door, and found himself, as he anticipated, face to face with Jacopo. The steward
                  started back, grew even paler than before, and hastily retreated toward his own
                  domains.
               The pretended priest drew his hat over his eyes, clasped his hands devoutly, and
                  followed him with quick, firm steps. When they gained a spot out of hearing from
                  the library, the stern voice of Barnardo spoke:
               "Halt there, and answer a question I have to put to you, senor stone mason."
               Jacopo sharply turned, and said:
               "Ha! you know my former calling? I was not, then, mistaken in thinking your face
                  is known to me. Senor Barnardo, what has brought you hither, in that dress? Have
                  you really taken the vows, or do you wear the priestly garb as a disguise?"
               Although he made an effort to speak jocularly, his voice was slightly tremulous,
                  and Barnardo significantly replied:
               "That is no concern of yours, Jacopo. The last time we met you plied your trade to
                  some purpose, I remember. Your services on that night secured you a fat office,
                  and I dare be sworn that the count's coffers are none too full under your
                  administration."
               The listener evidently trembled, and he gasped:
               "You were as deeply implicated as my lord or I; why, then, shall you speak of what
                  happened then in such a tone as you now use?"
               "Because I have no fear of the consequences of the crime, and you have everything
                  to dread. Are you aware that your lord is about to reclaim his daughter? Did you
                  overhear the information I came hither to give him? that the place of concealment
                  found by his wife has at last been discovered."
               The eyes of the steward opened to their fullest extent, and he asked:
               "And my lady Countess—will he also reclaim her?"
               "Death has spared him that necessity. She died within a year after her flight, but
                  her daughter lives; she will return to the paternal home, to reign over this
                  castle as its lawful mistress. It is
                  necessary to the accomplishment of my plans to know all that happens in this house
                  in which your young lady is interested, after she is received beneath its roof.
                  You know me of old, Senor Jacopo, and I tell you that on you I depend to keep a
                  journal of events and forward it to me in the manner I shall indicate."
               "But this is asking me to become a spy in the house of my master," faltered the
                  steward.
               "It matters not; the service must be performed, and faithfully, too, or you may
                  find yourself unpleasantly brought to account for a faultless piece of mason-work
                  performed in a certain chapel at the hour of midnight."
               Jacopo wiped the cold drops from his brow. He looked into the stern, fierce face
                  of the speaker, and humbly said:
               "I only obeyed the orders of my lord, and I am not responsible for his crime. It
                  seems to me that we are all in the same boat, and what will be fatal to me will be
                  equally so to you and my master."
               "Aye—but I am a poor wretch knocked about from pillar to post, and have no stake
                  in the world, while the Count has his rank, his fortune and his daughter; you have
                  a snug farm which you have bought with the pickings out of your stewardship, and a
                  tidy little wife. You see I have kept up with you, Senor Jacopo, and I know how
                  the land lies. Now, as you value these worldly possessions, I advise you to take
                  heed of my words. Do you enter my service, or do you risk a refusal?"
               Jacopo said with surly emphasis—
               "When a bandit claps a pistol to your head, and cries 'your money or your life,'
                  there is not much hesitation as to which shall be given; and that, I apprehend, is
                  my case now. I have no choice but to obey you, so enlighten me as to what I am to
                  do."
               "So—o—you're reasonable at least. You are to send me a monthly bulletin of all
                  that happens to the young Countess after she arrives here. You must tell me of her
                  employments, her pleasures, her lovers, and how she receives them: of the state of
                  her health, and spirits. In short, everything that concerns her."
               Jacopo listened intently, and he bluntly asked—
               "Senor, do you love the daughter as you did the mother, that you are so anxious to
                  follow all her movements? It was a passion that proved fatal to Senora Ginevra; do
                  you seek to become equally the evil genius of her child?"
               "That is no concern of yours," replied Barnardo coldly. "Act as I command you
                  without asking questions; all I require of you is fidelity in the task you have
                  undertaken to perform. Your reward shall be immunity from punishment for the
                  nameless deed of long ago, and a sum of money that will seem large, even to so
                  covetous a person as you are."
               At the mention of reward the eyes of the steward gleamed with sudden interest; he
                  said—
               "Oh, if anything is to be gained in serving you, of course I am your man."
               Barnardo laughed harshly:
               "Oh man! thou art indeed to be bought with a price! Remember our compact, Jacopo,
                  and bide your opportunity to increase your store. Benedicite, my son; may the Lord have you in his holy keeping! Here
                  comes the confessor; I must escape before his piercing eyes fall upon me, lest he
                  sees at a glance that I am a wolf in sheep's clothing."
               The approach of Father Gregory through one of the alleys leading from the chapel
                  was seen through an open window, and the steward hurriedly said:
               "It is the hour of my lord's confession, for this day is usually devoted to
                  prayer, and penitence. The holy father is on his way to him now."
               
               "Detain him until I have time to get a letter which the Count is writing. I have
                  no wish to meet the priest, for he knew me in other days, and may chance to
                  recognize me even in this garb."
               The speaker hurried away, and, obedient to his commands, Jacopo addressed the
                  venerable man who drew near to him, and held him in conversation till Barnado came
                  forth and passed out of a side entrance in full view from the spot on which they
                  stood. Father Gregory looked surprised, and asked:
               "Has my lord the count departed from his usual custom so far as to receive a
                  stranger in his sanctum on this day?"
               "He has done so, your reverence, but this man came on business of such vital
                  importance that he could not be refused admittance, even on this morning. I
                  ventured to carry his credentials to my lord, and they were sufficient to entitle
                  him to the grace that has been awarded him."
               "He must indeed have come on an extraordinary mission," muttered the old man, and
                  he passed straight on to the door of the library and knocked. It was immediately
                  opened, and the count, in his usually severe voice, said:
               "Come in, holy father, and learn that at last the curtain is lifted from the
                  mystery that has so long shrouded the fate of my wife and child. I am at length
                  granted the means of expiating the wrongs of that fearful night."
               "In what manner, my son? Does Ginevra yet live? Can atonement be made to one who
                  was so fearfully punished? Alas! your wife is not worthy of atonement in any
                  shape, if she is willing to accept it at your hands."
               The face of the listener clouded, and he impatiently replied:
               "That record is closed. God comprehended the justice of my vengeance, and He
                  leaves me no humiliating acknowledgment of wrong to make to her. Ginevra has slept
                  with the saints many years, but her child yet lives; she can be reclaimed, and the
                  noble fortune which has fallen to her will not go out of my family. The millions
                  of the Vivaldi will go to enrich my descendants."
               An expression of pain, faint but distincly marked, flitted over the features of
                  the aged priest, but he instantly checked the feeling, and said:
               "God be praised for this restoration of a long lost daughter to her father; but it
                  involves disappointment to one in whom you are aware I have taken deep
                  interest."
               "I know, I know," replied the Count, with a haughty wave of his hand. "Liutenant
                  Vivaldi is a protége of yours, I believe, and he hoped to claim this large estate
                  as heir-at-law. I regret that his ignoble blood forbids such a union, or he and
                  Clarice might jointly have enjoyed this fortune. As it is, my daughter must wed
                  her equal."
               "There would have been a yet stronger bar than inequality of rank," said the
                  priest, meekly. "Vivaldi is already betrothed to one he adores; and I am sadly
                  afraid that the loss of wealth will cause her parents to refuse their sanction to
                  the marriage. The uncertainty of your daughter's existence, led them to believe
                  that his claims upon the inheritance would never be interfered with. If, as you
                  say, you have found your child, Vivaldi is again but a poor lieutenant of Hussars,
                  his sword his only fortune."
               The Count shrugged his shoulders.
               "It is but the tide of life; a wave lifts one man to prosperity, while it engulfs
                  another with his all in irremediable ruin. Who is the chosen bride of young
                  Vivaldi?"
               "Her father is a French exile, living on the remnant of his fortune near Bastia.
                  Lucille inherits noble blood from her mother, but her father was a man of the
                  people; one of those among the higher classes of the bourgeoisie who, in the days
                  of the republic, distinguished themselves in science. M. De Villeray was implicated in Bonapartist
                  affairs, and on the restoration, his property was confiscated, and himself exiled
                  from France. He took refuge in Corsica with such resources as he had saved from
                  the wreck of his fortune, and at Bastia, where Vivaldi was stationed, he made the
                  acquaintance of the family."
               "You seem never to have lost sight of the lad," said the Count, with a half
                  sneer.
               "True, my lord, for once known this young man is not a person to be forgotten.
                  Really, Tomaso Vivaldi has not done well in dealing so unequally by his nephew and
                  niece. Both stood in the same degree of relationship toward him, yet he has given
                  all his possessions to the female representative of the family, and left nothing
                  to the male."
               "You mistake," said the Count, superciliously. "It was not to the representative
                  of his family that the estate was left, but to the Countess Ernesti;
                  and only when acknowledged as such, can she claim it. The plebeian millionaire was
                  willing to spend his days in adding coin to coin to uphold the dignity of the
                  house into which his sister had been received as a bride; and he proved how little
                  value he set upon his own blood, by passing over his nephew, who certainly has
                  merit, if he possesses neither family nor fortune. Clarice must deal liberally by
                  her cousin, and provide him with a pair of colonel's epaulettes as speedily as may
                  be after her own reinstatement."
               "The lad can make his own way to military position easy enough," replied the
                  priest. "It is the loss of the inheritance which will mar his hopes of happiness
                  in a union on which his heart is set. But we are strangely forgetting the duties
                  of this day in the discussion of secular matters. Let us recall the occasion, and
                  put on our garments of sackcloth and ashes, as did the men of old."
               "I will make confession as usual," replied the count, with cold gravity, "for such
                  is my duty; but I feel that the anger of a just God is appeased, for He permits
                  the light of a new hope to dawn upon my dreary existence. Let us also return
                  thanks to Heaven, that she who was lost is found; that she will be restored to her
                  own."
               "Truly, my son, I trust that your recovered daughter may prove a blessing to you,
                  and deep cause have you to return thanks for the great mercy vouchsafed to you. I
                  trust that the wrath of God is indeed turned from your house."
               "Yes, yes—I feel it to be so, father," replied the count, with an expression of
                  defiant pride very unlike his usually subdued and humble demeanor before his
                  spiritual counsellor. "My own career has been a failure: that of my child shall
                  compensate for my disappointments. The coronet of a duchess shall grace her brow,
                  homage shall wait on her steps, wealth shall wrap its siren blandishments around
                  her, and she shall look back to the humble home of her childhood with the proud
                  distaste of the nobly born for that which is unworthy of their state."
               His pale face glowed, his eyes flashed with pride, and the priest, in a low,
                  warning tone, said:
               "My son, do not indulge in sinful visions of vanity and vainglory. Tell me, does
                  not your daughter bear the mark of the doomed ones of your race? By what means,
                  then, do you hope to exalt her to such grandeur?"
               The features of the count collapsed, and an expression of livid rage and fear
                  overspread them. He hoarsely said:
               "It was not given to her as a mark of doom, but to enable me to claim
                  and identify the child that was stolen from beneath my roof while yet an infant. I
                  recognize the purpose of Heaven in sealing her with the bloody cross; but it was
                  not a fatal one. Oh no! Clarice must live; for she is the last of my race, and
                  with her would perish an ancient and
                  honorable house, that has been known in the land since the palmy days of Roman
                  power."
               "I trust that you are right, my son," replied Father Gregory, seriously; "but if
                  it is the will of God to cast down the high places of the earth, who can stand
                  against Him? Let us pray that evil may pass from you and yours. When our devotions
                  are ended, then will I ask you to explain to me how this discovery has been
                  brought about, and we will return thanks that God has at last remembered
                  mercy."
               Vainly did the penitent endeavor to bend his mind to the duties before him.
                  Naturally overbearing, haughty and defiant, the seclusion in which Count Ernesti
                  had lived for years was caused as much by the insufficiency of his fortune to
                  maintain the brilliant state in which he desired to live, as from the feelings of
                  remorse that preyed upon his mind. He had caused his wife to be diligently sought
                  after, from the fear that she might reveal the terrible crime he had perpetrated,
                  but to the recovery of his child Ernesti had scarcely given a thought, until the
                  bequest of wealth to her rendered her important in his eyes.
               Then the long dormant family pride again sprang up, and impelled him to seek and
                  claim her who was not only the heiress to his barren title and decayed estates,
                  but the owner of untold gold, wherewith to renovate the lustre of the falling
                  house from which she sprang.
               The possibility that Clarice might refuse to claim her uncle's fortune at the
                  price of wedded happiness he refused to entertain, and in the subsequent
                  revelation of the position in which she stood, Ernesti carefully concealed from
                  the priest that his daughter was the bride of a man she had voluntarily chosen.
                  Through Father Gregory, application was immediately to be made to the Pope to
                  annul the ignoble marriage into which he asserted Clarice had been betrayed
                  trayed, and Ernesti doubted not that the joint efforts of the priest and himself
                  would obtain the decree as soon as there would be any necessity to use it.
               When the father arose to leave him, he said:
               "I will, as you desire, write to Cardinal Monti, but if God has joined these two
                  hearts together, will it not be better to permit them to remain as one, even if
                  the husband is not of noble blood?"
               The count proudly replied:
               "God does not join together those who are unfitted in birth and
                  fortune as mates for each other. It is my will to rescue my child from an
                  unsuitable alliance, and I consult her best interests in so doing. Do your part,
                  father, and I will do mine, with the hope that the blessing of Heaven will follow
                  our efforts."
               "I trust it may be so, my son," and the old man bowed profoundly and went to
                  perform his errand.
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               "THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE NEVER DID RUN SMOOTH."
               THE little city of Bastia lies around its harbor in the form of an amphitheatre;
                  on the right the bay is enclosed by a gigantic rock bearing so striking a
                  resemblance to a rudely carved lion as to have received that name. On this rock
                  stands a gloomy fortress, built by the Genoese while they claimed rule over the
                  Island of Corsica. From the water, the city rises in a succession of terraces, and
                  its tower-like houses crowded closely together, and ornamented with balconies,
                  impart an oriental air to the place.
               Back of these extends a range of green mountain hights, covered with luxuriant groves of olive, lemon,
                  orange, and almond trees, from the shade of which gleam abandoned monasteries, and
                  houses of less pretentious appearance, belonging to the proprietors of the
                  orchards.
               In the garden of one of the last, upon a spot which overlooked the town and the
                  bright waters of the sea, studded with its beautiful islands, sat two persons, who
                  were evidently lovers. The young man was twining a wreath of fresh orange blossoms
                  for the brow of his companion, and his dark lustrous eyes were full of tenderness,
                  as he said:
               "How long shall it be, Lucille, before I may wreath the bridal vail with these
                  fragrant flowers? Your parents scarcely treat me well, for since the death of my
                  uncle, there has been no excuse for deferring our marriage."
               The person who thus spoke was a man of twenty-three-or-four, dressed in the
                  becoming uniform of a French hussar, and his dark, handsome face was of the purest
                  Italian type; the features were clearly and beautifully cut; the dark waving hair,
                  and jet black moustache, served to set off the masculine beauty of a head that
                  might have served as a model for a youthful Mars. His figure was light and
                  vigorous, with that expression of power in repose which is gained by accurate
                  military training.
               The girl who listened to him with a smile and a blush, was petite, almost
                  fairy-like in person, with a complexion of delicate fairness, and a profusion of
                  blonde curls hanging almost to her waist. She raised her violet blue eyes to his
                  face, and said, with an accent of gentle sweetness:
               "I am the only child of my parents, Francesco, mio, and they are naturally averse to the thought of giving me away.
                  We are very happy as we are, and why then shall we be in a hurry to change our
                  present agreeable relations toward each other?"
               A cloud swept over the face of the lover, and he seriously said:
               "Then I am afraid you do not love me as you should, Lucille. My heart cannot fully
                  accept its happiness until it is assured. I feel as if something may happen to
                  snatch you from me yet, and I would fain have the absolute right to claim you as
                  mine before God and man."
               "Well, in good time you shall have it; but the daughter of a lady who, in her day,
                  was a queen of fashion, cannot be permitted to marry with as little ceremony as a
                  peasant girl. My mother has ordered my trousseau from Paris, and until the laces,
                  silks and jewels arrive that are to adorn me as a bride, you must learn to possess
                  your soul in patience."
               "This is folly!" exclaimed the impatient lover. "Do you think I shall prize you
                  more highly in a brocade dress, than I do in the simple muslin you now wear?
                  Listen, darling, to my idea. Let us be married at once, without asking any of our
                  friends to witness the ceremony; get into a travelling carriage which I will have
                  in readiness, and make a tour through some of the picturesque regions of the
                  island. A friend of mine has a bachelor's establishment in a lovely valley among
                  the mountains, of which he has offered me the use for the first charming weeks of
                  our wedded bliss. We can wander through the walks around his villa, sail upon the
                  sea near which it stands, and enjoy that delicious calm which will enable us to
                  know and appreciate each other more fully than we have ever done before. There we
                  shall learn how divine a thing is perfect wedded love, with no intrusion from the
                  outside world to mar its unity."
               These words brought to the lips of the young girl a smile of tender triumph, and
                  her eyes were lifted for a brief moment to the flashing ones that rested upon her.
                  She said, in soft accents:
               "You have sketched a beautiful picture, Francesco, which we will realize in time;
                  but—"
               She paused, as if uncertain how to complete her sentence, and the fair cheek
                  flushed as she averted her face.
               
               "But—well, what is it, my angel?" asked Francesco, impatiently. "Why shall my
                  dream not be realized at once? While we enjoy our reality of bliss, the ship will
                  arrive with the finery your mother considers so indispensable; and on our return,
                  you will be ready to eclipse the gayest butterflies that flutter in the public
                  square. At the same time, the carriage and horses I have ordered will arrive, and
                  I flatter myself that our turn-out will be something of which even Madame Villeray
                  will be proud."
               Lucille regretfully said:
               "My mother is fond of splendor, as you already know, and she will appreciate the
                  display of which you speak. But—but, are you sure, Francesco, that you are
                  justified in this extravagance? Is it beyond a doubt that you will inherit the
                  wealth of your uncle?"
               Vivaldi flushed, and then grew pale.
               "I have permitted myself to think so. But is the slight uncertainty that attends
                  this inheritance the true cause of the delays your parents have caused to the
                  celebration of our marriage?"
               There was a tremulous tone of wounded feeling, mingled with pique, which dictated
                  this question, and Lucille raised her eyes pleadingly to his excited face, as she
                  replied:
               "You know that I loved you before the prospect of fortune came to you; that my
                  parents opposed my choice till you were supposed to be the heir of your rich West
                  India uncle. They then yielded, on the condition that you shall be proved the
                  owner of the estate before my hand is given to you."
               "True, Mademoiselle; but to what is this prelude to lead?" asked Vivaldi, in a
                  constrained tone. "Tomaso Vivaldi is dead; I am his only living relative, and
                  therefore entitled to the fortune he left."
               "So I hope and believe; but my father is not quite satisfied fied of the fact. He
                  has written to Genoa to have enquiries made, which will either establish the
                  validity of your claims, or—"
               She paused, and her lover bitterly replied:
               "Or set them aside forever. I too have written to an old friend of my family,
                  Father Gregory, who is now private chaplain to Count Ernesti. The will of my uncle
                  bequeaths the whole of his fortune to the only daughter of the Count, provided she
                  is acknowledged as the heiress of his name and honors. There is a painful and
                  humiliating story connected with this bequest. The mother of this child was the
                  sister of my father; dazzled by the Counts station and fortune, she married him,
                  although her heart was given to one in her own sphere of life. She was miserable
                  in her splendid home, and finally eloped from it, carrying with her her infant
                  daughter.
               "That child has never been traced; after the laspe of so many years, it is
                  scarcely probable that she will now be found. I look upon my accession to the
                  property as certain; and in fact, as several months have passed since Count
                  Ernesti was notified of the provisions of the will, and his daughter is yet
                  undiscovered, I consider myself as the bona fide
                  possessor of the Vivaldi estate. The agent so regards it, and the income will
                  shortly be paid to me as the heir-at-law. I am assured that Count Ernesti has
                  moved every power at his command to regain the child for whom he cared so little
                  till she inherited wealth, as to leave her to the chances of fate. Now, the clue
                  is lost, and the will is void. I think I can set your father's doubts at rest by
                  showing him a letter from Father Gregory, which reached me a few days ago. In that
                  he states that the agents sent in pursuit of the young countess had all been heard
                  from, save one. They had failed to trace her, and he regarded the quest as
                  hopeless. What more can your parents ask, Lucille?"
               
               She faltered, and after a moment's hesitation, said:
               "I am afraid that my father will not permit the day of our marriage to be named
                  till he has received a reply to his own letter of inquiry. Not that he mistrusts
                  your assurance, but he is a man of method, and he clings to his own manner of
                  doing business. He dreads the thought of giving me up, and avails himself of every
                  excuse to defer the hour of separation. Ah! you do not know how much it costs this
                  noble Spartan to relinquish his petted darling to the guardianship of another! He
                  would be supremely happy if I would give up all thoughts of ever marrying. It was
                  with much effort that his consent to our union was at last wrung for him, and he
                  must really appreciate you very highly, or he would never have given it."
               "I believe he does; but since M. Villeray has given it, since he has
                  consented that I shall become his son, it is now too late to retract under any
                  pretext. Even if my cousin is found, and restored to her rank, a father who really
                  values the happiness of his child will not rescind the contract in which the hopes
                  of two hearts are so deeply implicated. For me, Lucille, life has no future worth
                  striving for, if it is not to be shared with you. If I am not Tomaso Vivaldi's
                  heir, I am still a man who has the energy to carve his own way to fortune, whose
                  heart beats only for you, and with you clasped to it, is equal to any fate that
                  Heaven may send."
               With an involuntary motion Lucille raised her clasped hands, and placed them in
                  those of her lover, as she tearfully said:
               "And I swear fidelity to you, Francesco, through every trial, for my heart is
                  yours alone. But my own love, you must never exact from me disobedience to the
                  wishes of my parents. An ungrateful daughter can never become a faithful wife; to
                  no other will I give my hand, but on you I cannot bestow it without the full and
                  free consent of my father and mother."
               "Has it not already been given, my angel?" he impetuously asked, "and am I less
                  worthy of so sacred a trust, even if my supposed fortune should slip from my
                  grasp? Your father is not a sordid man; he has known reverses himself, therefore
                  he comprehends how they can be borne by a brave soul. I will seek him now, and
                  entreat his consent to our immediate marriage."
               Lucille shook her head dubiously.
               "He is not prepared for such a proposal, and my mother will oppose it. She has set
                  her heart on the éclat of a magnificent wedding, and she will not consent to
                  forego it. Under any circumstances, my father will wait till he hears from Genoa;
                  but, dear Francesco, I entreat that you will not take umbrage at the inquiries he
                  has caused to be made there. It was his duty, as he understands it, to render my
                  future as safe as possible. Alas! it is because he has known bitter reverses of
                  fortune, and felt them keenly, that he is so anxious to secure wealth to me in the
                  marriage I may make."
               Vivaldi listened with a clouded brow and pained heart. He knew that in the event
                  of his supposed inheritance being claimed by another, Madame Villeray would use
                  all her influence to break off the proposed marriage, for he was aware that she
                  was intensely worldly in her views. Nobly born herself, she had played a brilliant
                  part in the court of Napoleon. She had been an elegante, a fashionable manœuverer,
                  and a keen politician. The fall of the empire destroyed her own prestige and
                  ruined the fortune of her husband; but the retirement in which Madame Villeray was
                  henceforth condemned to live, had not destroyed her love of power nor the yearning
                  desire to regain her lost position, which filled the heart of this ambitious and
                  disappointed woman.
               
               With sighs she looked into her mirror, and beheld the evidences of her faded
                  beauty and increasing years, but the consoling thought came that through her
                  daughter she might renew the triumphs of her youth, and restore the tarnished
                  lustre of her fortunes. Lucille was an exquisite creature, lovely as a dream, but
                  full of womanly impulses, and tender to a fault. The last must be corrected, the
                  first made to serve her purposes, if the right kind of training was given to the
                  possessor of such charms.
               The subtle mother bent all her energies to the accomplishment of her wishes, but
                  in spite of the worldly maxims she sought to impress upon the mind of her child,
                  truth and nature baffled her. Lucille developed into a charming girl, with a clear
                  perception of right and a truthful simplicity of character which all the efforts
                  of her mother failed to warp.
               This was due in a great measure to the mental training she received from her
                  father. A philosopher, and a man of rare scientific attainments, M. Villeray
                  believed in God only as the interpreter of nature till misfortune fell upon him
                  with heavy force. Then he felt the need so vital to all humanity, of the All
                  Father to whom we may carry our sorrows, and from whose divine assistance we may
                  be enabled to bear the burdens of our earthly lot. Thus he also became a
                  Christian, and it had been his determination from the beginning that his daughter
                  should not struggle through the chaos by which he had arrived at the truth. Upon
                  her opening mind he would impress the wisdom he had slowly and painfully gathered,
                  and it should be to her a guide throughout her future life.
               Lucille was the youngest of six children, and the only surviving one. Her father
                  loved her with the utmost tenderness, and looked forward to her future with a
                  degree of solicitude proportioned to his affection. As she grew in grace and
                  beauty, the thought that a man younger, more attractive tive than himself, would
                  step between himself and this darling of his life, that he would win her deepest,
                  fondest love, was gall and wormwood to the father's heart.
               Yet M. Villeray knew that his daughter must marry, and he also knew that to so
                  sensitive a nature as hers there could be no happiness in such a relation unless
                  her heart was unreservedly given to him on whom her hand was bestowed.
               From the wreck of his fortune he had only saved a life annuity which enabled him
                  to live in comfort in the island to which he had come as a voluntary exile. From
                  his income he could save nothing, and with his own life the slender provision
                  ceased. He was already in the vale of years; his health was precarious, and his
                  tenure of existence probably brief, therefore he must sacrifice his feelings to
                  the interests of his child.
               She must enter society, and meet there those who would be likely to be attracted
                  by her extreme loveliness. The city of Bastia did not afford many eligible
                  alliances for a girl with such antecedents as those of Mademoiselle Villeray, but
                  among the young nobility a parti might be found
                  that would not be quite unworthy of her acceptance. Under the guardianship of the
                  worldly-wise mother, M. Villeray thought Lucille might safely be trusted to thread
                  her devious steps toward a proper settlement in life.
               The young débutante was soon surrounded by a bevy of lovers; several of them were
                  cadets from the best families in the island, but unfortunately they were not
                  endowed with fortune to sustain their ancestral honors. This, in the estimation of
                  Madame Villeray, was indispensable. She had seen the prestige of wealth eclipse
                  that of birth; the nobility of the sword and the banking-house had in her day
                  taken precedence of the most ancient blood. Therefore, with the shrewd mother, money must be possessed by
                  the son-in-law she would accept.
               Among the officers attached to a company of hussars stationed in the city, was a
                  young lieutenant of singular advantages of person, and a degree of refined culture
                  both of mind and manners, not often found among any class of men. Lieutenant
                  Vivaldi belonged to a family that was well connected it was asserted, and he was
                  the supposed heir of a wealthy uncle living in the island of Barbadoes.
               He soon became deeply enamored of Mademoiselle Villeray, and for a season her
                  mother received him with favor; but by some means it came to her knowledge that
                  Vivaldi would probably be passed over in the will of his uncle, and the Ernesti
                  family, into which an only sister had married, would inherit his fortune.
               The diplomatic mother withdrew her smiles from the lately favored lover, and gave
                  him distinctly to understand that his attentions were no longer desirable. But it
                  was too late; these two fresh young souls, created for each other, had each
                  already recognized its counterpart, and a passion as fervent and true had sprung
                  up between them. Opposition only increased its power, and the poor father found
                  his fears realized. He saw that the cherished darling of his heart loved a
                  stranger better than father or mother.
               M. Villeray could not bear this, and glad of an excuse to oppose the marriage, he
                  eagerly listened to the sage maxims of worldly prudence uttered by his wife. She
                  declared that Vivaldi was honorable and true, but he was no match for Lucille, for
                  his humble origin could not be overlooked unless it was concealed by the gilding
                  of fortune. He was not the undoubted heir of his uncle, therefore his claims must
                  be ignored, and the gallant officer was informed that his want of fortune was an
                  insuperable bar to his success with the object of his affections.
               But from Lucille herself Vivaldi received the assurance that on no other would she
                  bestow her hand, and the lovers hoped on through a season of trial which chafed
                  the proud spirit of Vivaldi, while it deepened the trust of the heart that clung
                  to him through all the efforts made by her mother to convince the young girl that,
                  situated as she was, there was an absolute necessity that she should marry for
                  position and fortune.
               One day a letter came from Barbadoes which stated that Tomaso Vivaldi was dead,
                  and if a niece who had been spirited away from her father's house seventeen years
                  before, could not be found, Francesco Vivaldi was the heir-at-law to immense
                  wealth. Months passed away, and the Countess Ernesti was still unfound; the agent
                  for the estate opened a correspondence with the heir-at-law, and transmitted to
                  him such intelligence as enabled him to take the initiative steps toward claiming
                  the inheritance.
               Such news reached Lucille forthwith, and Madame Villeray made the notable
                  discovery that Vivaldi was the son-in-law she would have chosen in preference to
                  every other aspirant to her daughter's hand. He only lacked fortune, and that was
                  now supplied. The father listened to her words with a sigh; he must give up his
                  child, yet he clung to her more fondly than ever. He consented that Lucille should
                  marry her lover, but not before his claim to his uncle's estate was assured. The
                  cousin might yet be found and it was evidently the duty of Lucille's friends to
                  prevent the marriage from taking place till Vivaldi was actually in possession of
                  his fortune.
               He was received as the betrothed, and treated as the future son of the family; but
                  every hint of a speedy marriage was put aside with such coldness as showed the
                  unwillingness of the father to give his daughter to the keeping of another as long
                  as it could possibly be avoided.
               
               Letters came from Father Gregory, the early patron and steady friend of Vivaldi,
                  assuring him that the young countess was still unfound, and in all probability
                  would never be reclaimed by her family. The priest stated that the count himself
                  had almost despaired of success in the search he had caused to be made, and
                  admitted the validity of the young heir's claims.
               Thus encouraged, Vivaldi renewed his entreaties for a speedy marriage; but
                  availing himself of the slight excuse for delay, M. Villeray required time to
                  write to Genoa himself, promising that if the inquiries he wished to make were
                  answered in a satisfactory manner, he would no longer withhold his consent to the
                  immediate union of the lovers.
               Madame Villeray did not wait for the replies; confident beforehand that they would
                  be favorable, she despatched orders to Paris for a trousseau for the bride-elect
                  suited to the supposed fortune of her betrothed husband, and in anticipation
                  revelled in the splendor that would in future surround her daughter.
               The lovers were perfectly happy; yet when Lucille saw how much it cost her father
                  to behold her attachment to one he could only regard in the light of a rival in
                  her affections, she almost shrank from the thought of giving herself to another
                  while he yet lived.
               She asked why could not Vivaldi be satisfied to bask in the sunshine of their
                  present happiness, and look forward to their future union with the complacent
                  belief that it would certainly take place in good time. But Vivaldi was too much
                  in love, and of too impetuous a temperament to bear patiently a delay which he
                  believed to be unnecessary. He had no intention of removing Lucille from her
                  parents. He would establish a home suitable to the fortune he had inherited, and
                  in its ample halls a suite of apartments should be fitted up for M. Villeray and
                  his wife with every luxury and elegance that could charm the heart of the latter,
                  while the peculiar tastes of the former should be consulted in the books and
                  philosophical apparatus with which his library should be furnished.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               A CRUSHING BLOW.
               AFTER a constrained silence, Vivaldi at length spoke.
               "Since you desire it so much, Lucille, I will consent to wait till the letters
                  from Genoa arrive; but patience has its limits, and if they announce that my
                  cousin is still unfound, I will submit to no further delay. Your father must make
                  up his mind to give me your promised hand at once, or take from me forever the
                  only hope that makes life valuable to me."
               Before she could reply a quick, imperious voice called from the window of a tower
                  that overlooked the garden.
               "Lucille, come hither, I have news for you, and your father has letters to show
                  Senor Vivaldi."
               There was something in the tone that jarred on the hearts of both listeners, and
                  Lucille became a shade paler, while Vivaldi flushed, and his breath came quicker
                  as the prescience of evil fell upon him.
               The voice of Madame Villeray was a good index to her feelings; when pleased, it
                  was smooth and honeyed; when annoyed, it took a cold, sharp inflexion which cut as
                  keenly as highly-tempered steel. Lucille grasped her lover's hand, as she
                  whispered:
               "The letters have come, and—and I fear——"
               Her voice died away in a faint murmur, and Vivaldi, with some effort, replied:
               
               "Fear nothing, my beloved—my own, for I swear to you that
                     nothing shall now separate us. Your parents have deemed me worthy
                  to become their son, and no mere worldly reverse can give them the right to sever
                  us from each other. I consider you as truly bound to me as if the priest had
                  already pronounced his blessing over us. Come, my love, let us go and see what is
                  in store for us."
               The two passed from the garden, crossed a small lawn hedged in by oleanders in
                  full bloom, and shaded by a few pine trees. From this they approached a circular
                  room, fitted up as both library and laboratory. A large window on one side opened
                  to the floor, which commanded a view of the town beneath and the sea beyond.
               M. Villeray, a tall, slender man, with grey hair worn away at the temples, and an
                  anxious, weary expression in his deep-set eyes, sat in a large chair, beside a
                  table on which several newly arrived letters were lying.
               He held an open one in his hand, which he was perusing with a singular mixture of
                  annoyance and satisfaction upon his features, while his wife uttered exclamations
                  of anger and dismay, to which he paid not the slightest attention.
               Madame Villeray, in an elaborate morning toilette, which she flattered herself was
                  perfect both in taste and fashion, flushed more highly than the rouge she wore, as
                  she tapped her jewelled hand impatiently upon the edge of the table and
                  exclaimed:
               "This is too bad! All this time lost, and now the scandal of a broken marriage to
                  end the affair! It will injure Lucille's prospects irreparably. It was bad policy
                  from the beginning to encourage the hopes of Francesco unless he was
                     sure of the estate. I wish we had been more prudent."
               "Madame," replied her husband, with stern gravity, "the match will not be broken,
                  it will only be deferred till Vivaldi can place himself in a position to claim my
                  daughter's ter's hand. I am not so mercenary as to ask my child to give up the man
                  I know she loves, because fortune has proved unkind to him. Let them be lovers
                  still; to constant hearts, the time for reward will at last arrive."
               "What, give my beautiful child to a beggarly lieutenant, whose sword is his only
                  fortune! Monsieur, you have lived among your books until you have no idea of what
                  is necessary to enable a girl to make a respectable marriage. In this match, I
                  thought I had secured everything that is desirable, and here it is a wretched
                  failure, as all my other plans have proved. I was born under an unlucky star, but
                  this is the most bitter blow of all."
               "Madame," replied M. Villeray with calm decision, "you permitted the acquaintance
                  of these young people; under our joint sanction has ripened an affection that I
                  feel cannot now safely be trifled with; therefore we must accept the result
                  without useless murmurs. Vivaldi has lost the chances of fortune, but he is not on
                  that account less worthy of our daughter; therefore I refuse to break the
                  marriage. I only defer it, till it can with propriety be celebrated."
               "I understand you very well, Monsieur," and the voice of the speaker took its
                  sharpest inflexion. "So you keep your darling to yourself you are indifferent to
                  her future. Lucille may grow old, lose her beauty, and with it all chances of a
                  suitable settlement in life; and at your death, we may both starve, for I see
                  nothing else before us. But what do you care for that, provided you can carry out
                  your selfish plan of keeping my daughter by your side as long as your life lasts?
                  Oh! I promise you, I see through you clearly enough."
               M. Villeray listened to this voluble flow of words with less than his usual
                  indifference to his wife's tirades, for he felt that she spoke the truth. He
                  hastily said:
               "Here come the young people. Let future events take care of themselves, Madame, and do not seek to
                  separate these lovers by a sudden and violent wrench; for I warn you that it will
                  prove a fatal experiment. If you can undermine faith and truth, make the attempt
                  with all the subtle power of your sex; for only by such means can you hope to
                  succeed in the evil deed you contemplate. For the present, beware how you express
                  yourself toward this high-spirited young man; at such a crisis as this, he will
                  not easily forgive a slight, or an unkind word."
               Thus warned, Madame Villeray impatiently bit her lip and slightly frowned as the
                  lovers came in with their hands clasped together, and stood an instant upon the
                  threshold, apprehensive of some evil, yet evidently firm in their allegiance to
                  each other.
               "Francesco, your letters have arrived," said M. Villeray, and his voice grew
                  tremulous as he spoke. "I also have received one from Genoa, and from its tenor I
                  am afraid that your bright prospects are about to be overclouded. Read and see for
                  yourself. Come hither, my daughter, and look over these pages, for you are more
                  deeply concerned in them than I am."
               A blinding mist seemed to fall over the eyes of the young girl, and for an instant
                  she stood as one smitten by a sudden blow; but Vivaldi strode forward with
                  impetuous haste, and snatched up a letter addressed to himself which he saw bore
                  the writing of Father Gregory upon it. He hurriedly tore open the envelope, and
                  with a heart that almost ceased its beating, read the following lines:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "MY SON:—The blow may as well fall without any circumlocution, for
                              words can never make it less heavy. The lost is found; the heiress
                              will probably claim her own, and you, the beloved child of my
                              adoption, must lose the wealth which should at least have been shared
                              equally with you.
                           "Count Ernesti has at last received such information of his daughter
                              as will enable him to claim her, and restore her to her true rank in
                              life; for he is resolved that the fortune of Tomaso Vivaldi shall not
                              be lost to his family. But for this windfall, the young girl might
                              have lived and died in obscurity; but since fortune has chosen her for
                              her favored child, the father's heart has opened toward her, and steps
                              have been taken to gain control over the heiress to this magnificent
                              inheritance.
                           "But despair not, my Francesco, for all hope for you is not yet lost.
                              The history of the young Countess is most singular and romantic, and
                              the chances are that she may refuse both rank and
                              fortune, to remain with a husband with whom she has lately eloped to
                              the mountains of the very island on which you reside.
                           "It seems that when your unfortunate aunt fled from her home, she took
                              refuge in the hut of a fisherman at Isola Rossa, where she died. From
                              that place, a few weeks ago, her daughter, ignorant of her rank, gave
                              her hand to the son of an outlaw, who was once known as the King of
                              the Mountains. You are probably familiar with many of his exploits, as
                              Theodore Falcone became distinguished throughout Corsica for his wild
                              daring and lavish generosity.
                           "It seems that the son has decided to follow the same wild course of
                              life, and the young creature who has given him her hand, declares that
                              she will share his lot with him be it for good or for evil. The Count
                              will leave no means untried to gain possession of her, and once in his
                              power, her brigand lover will never be permitted to approach her
                              again. Already has application been made to the Pope to cancel the tie
                              that binds the heiress to Falcone, and I have no doubt that it will be
                              promptly attended to by the Holy Father.
                           "But for some revelations I have almost wrung from the Count, I think it possible his daughter
                              may resist to the bitter end, and refuse the position that must be
                              purchased at the sacrifice of her affections. Yet, on reflection, I
                              strongly doubt her power to do so; great wealth and high rank are too
                              great temptations to be resisted by a frail daughter of humanity; nor
                              can I believe that the life led by a bandit's bride will, after its
                              first novelty is over, be found endurable by a mercurial and beautiful
                              woman.
                           "Let what may happen, I regard your chance as good, to become the
                              eventual possessor of your uncle's estate; for by the tenor of the
                              will it reverts to the Vivaldi family if the Countess dies without
                              children of her own to inherit. She bears upon her breast the
                                 mark of the doomed ones of the house of Ernesti. For ages,
                              of all who have been stamped with the bloody cross, not one has
                                 left a living descendant, and all have perished by
                              violence.
                           "Thus you see that if the present enjoyment of the estate is denied to
                              you, its reversion will be yours; and if your betrothed is worthy of
                              the love you have given her, she will not shrink from your side
                              because of this reverse. Neither do I think that her parents have the
                              right to withdraw the consent which has once been given to your union
                              with their daughter. It will be tampering too cruelly with the most
                              sacred rights of humanity.
                           "Count Ernesti professes the most liberal intentions towards you, and
                              you may feel assured that his daughter shall in due time be fully
                              informed of the full extent of your claims upon the inheritance of
                              which she deprives you. I will inform you of the result of this
                              singular struggle between parental authority and that of the humble
                              husband the heiress has chosen, as soon as I am myself aware of it.
                              May the saints have you in their holy keeping, is the sincere prayer
                              of your friend and preceptor,
                           
                              "GREGORY."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               With many conflicting feelings was this letter read by Vivaldi; yet, amid his
                  bitter disappointment, hope was the predominant feeling in his heart.
                  Independence, an honorable future career, would doubtless be secured to him by the
                  liberality of his unknown cousin; and what right had any true man to ask more of
                  Fate? The parents could not be so unreasonable as to refuse Lucille to him, even
                  if the prospect of great wealth was denied him.
               In the meantime Lucille had regained sufficient composure to read the few lines
                  which her father's letter contained. They were:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "MONSIEUR VILLERAY:—Your inquiries respecting the succession to the
                              Vivaldi estate came just at the right moment for a satisfactory reply.
                              Count Ernesti has at last discovered the retreat of his daughter, and
                              taken such steps as will lead to her restoration to the rank in which
                              she was born.
                           "Of course, the estate of Tomaso Vivaldi then goes according to the
                              provisions of the will, and his nephew gets nothing, unless the
                              heiress is liberal enough to remember his claims, and to help him
                              along in the career he has chosen.
                           "Hoping it is not too late for this information to be of service to
                              you, we are respectfully yours,
                           
                              "VANNANNI & SONS."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               The small hand that rested on M. Villeray's shoulder trembled, and the tremor
                  crept to the heart of the old man, for he felt that the whole future happiness of
                  his darling was staked upon the issue of this interview.
               The two men looked into each other's eyes, and each read the soul of the other,
                  but the clear, cold voice of the mother here interposed.
               
               "Well, you have both read the news, and you understand the position into which we
                  have all thrust ourselves. If I had not considered this estate as good as your own
                  already, Senor Vivaldi, I should never have permitted you to dream for an instant
                  of winning the hand of my daughter. As a man of honor, I call on you to relinquish
                  all pretensions to her at once."
               "Mother! oh, mother!" burst from the pale lips of Lucille, in deprecating accents,
                  and Vivaldi, white with passion, said:
               "Every impulse of truth and honor forbids me to pursue the course you demand,
                  Madame. Your daughter loves me, I adore her, and my position is not such as
                  renders me an unsuitable match for Mademoiselle Villeray, even without the fortune
                  of my deceased uncle. My pay is sufficient for a respectable support, and I shall
                  doubtless obtain promotion before very long."
               "Respectable support!" repeated Madame Villeray, in accents of
                  supreme scorn; "and do you suppose that a young girl of noble descent, of
                  transcendent beauty and brilliant accomplishments, is to throw herself away on one
                  who can only offer her a respectable support? Truly, my laundry-maid
                  or cook might be satisfied with such a prospect, but not the daughter of Pauline
                  de Rochefort. Your supposed wealth, Senor Vivaldi, was all that, in my estimation,
                  lifted you to an equality with my child. Without that, you are simply a lieutenant
                  in the French service, and the penniless cadet of a bourgeois Italian family.
                  Thus, as a man of the world, you must see how impossible it is that your
                  pretensions can be sustained a single moment after your true position is
                  understood."
               The lovers turned their eyes imploringly upon the father, but he seemed wavering
                  between respect for the opinions of his wife, and fears for the future happiness
                  of the trembling girl who clung to him as her last anchor in this struggle between
                  avarice and honor. Vivaldi proudly said:
               "If not of noble blood, I at least have had the training of a gentleman, and no
                  man can say that, either in manners or morals, would I discredit the lineage of a
                  prince. As a man, the mere possession of wealth could not render me
                  more worthy of the heart I have won. Madame, I warn you that such love as exists
                  between Lucille and myself cannot be thwarted with impunity. If we cannot live for
                  each other, we can die for the sake of that love. I in the battle's front, for I
                  will throw away the life that is forbidden to be passed with her; she will perish
                  in solitary pining, because the light of her life is extinguished."
               "Bah! sentimental nonsense! I know how much such words are worth. You will seek
                  and find a wife dowered with the money you need, and Lucille will give her hand to
                  one at least in her own sphere. If he possesses wealth, so much the better, but
                  both fortune and birth cannot be dispensed with in her future husband."
               Vivaldi offered her the letter of Father Gregory as he haughtily said:
               "Read this, Madame, and learn that I have not yet lost all chance to inherit my
                  uncle's estate. Two throws in my favor are still upon the dice; one soon to be
                  decided, the other must be left to the chances of the future."
               The worldly-wise woman eagerly grasped the letter, ran her eyes rapidly over its
                  contents, and after a moment of indecision, said in her hardest tones:
               "There can be but one course taken in a matter of this kind. No woman in her
                  senses can doubt what the decision of the heiress will be. On one side rank,
                  wealth, and luxury; on the other, the dreary privations of an outlaw's home. She
                  would be mad to hesitate a moment. The writer of this letter is superstitious, and
                  he thinks that a hereditary curse
                  clings to this young girl because she bears a family mark which has hitherto been
                  regarded as fatal to its possessor. On these grounds, Father Gregory believes that
                  the Vivaldi estate may yet be yours; but should this prove true, your cousin is
                  younger than you are; she may outlive you, even if she leaves no direct heir to
                  claim the inheritance. What I desire, what I must have for my child, is actual,
                  tangible wealth that can be enjoyed now; I am not satisfied with a
                  vague promise in the future. I have not deceived you, Senor, for I did not
                  encourage you to hope to win the hand of my daughter, until I was assured there
                  could be no doubt that the fortune of your uncle would descend to you. Do not
                  accuse me of being mercenary, when I am only prudent. It is my duty to take care
                  of my daughter's future."
               The lovers, seeing no hope from this quarter, turned toward the irresolute father.
                  Vivaldi asked:
               "Is this also your decision, M. Villeray? Have you no sense of justice toward us?
                  Your affection for your child should teach you that her happiness must not be
                  sacrificed in this arbitrary manner."
               "I—I cannot quite agree with Madame Villeray," he slowly replied. "We are equally
                  bound to consider the future welfare of our daughter; but I do not find it in
                  great wealth, as my wife seems to do. Your marriage must be postponed, but it is
                  not broken off. When your promotion is gained, we will then see."
               Lucille pressed his hand tenderly, but with a clouded brow, Vivaldi said:
               "Since I can gain nothing more, I must even accept this concession as gratefully
                  as I can; but if I did not love your daughter better than my life, I would at once
                  break off an engagement which may drag on for months, or even years, till all the
                  life and freshness of our being is exhausted, and only the lees left for wedded
                  happiness. M. Villeray, have I your distinct pledge that when my promotion is
                  secured, you will no longer refuse me the possession of the hand I have so long
                  been permitted to consider as my own?"
               M. Villeray looked helplessly toward his wife, but she thought she had spoken
                  quite plainly enough, and gave him no further assistance. After a pause, he
                  said:
               "If you both remain unchanged, and still desire the marriage, I answer, yes."
               With a glad smile Lucille held out her hand; Vivaldi clasped it in both his own,
                  and placing it over his heart, fervently said:
               "This hand I hold as sacredly mine as if the church had already bestowed upon us
                  its nuptial blessing; and I here declare that no earthly power shall break the
                  bond of union between Lucille and myself. We belong to each other, and woe betide
                  him who may seek to sever us."
               The sharp voice of Madame Villeray interposed:
               "I presume, senor, that you will at least allow my daughter the liberty of
                  retracting should the bond prove a galling one, as it is not unlikely to become in
                  the future."
               "Madame, when the heart of my betrothed recoils from the contract, she has only to
                  signify as much to me, and I free her from that instant," replied the lover with
                  defiant pride, for his trust in the object of his affections was as deep and firm
                  as it was tender.
               The mother smiled triumphantly.
               "All is right, then. We shall see—we shall see, whether silly sentimentality or
                  common sense in the management of affairs, is to carry the day yet. Good morning,
                  Senor; my best wish for you is speedy disenchantment and a return to the sober
                  realities of life. Come with me, Lucille; I wish to have your company in my own
                  room."
               Thus commanded to depart, the young girl pressed her lover's hand, looked beseechingly in his eyes, and
                  unwillingly accompanied her mother to a conference she dreaded.
               Vivaldi remained closeted with M. Villeray some time longer, but he finally left
                  with a gloomy brow, and a defiant curl of the lip which proved that the facile
                  father, much as he was attached to his daughter, had not sufficient nerve to set
                  the stronger will of his wife at defiance, and pursue the only course that could
                  secure the happiness of the lovers.
               Poor Lucille, with a sick heart and despondent hopes, listened to a long lecture
                  on the proprieties of life, which ended with the assurance that among them the
                  marriage of a well born and beautiful girl with a penniless officer was not
                  included. She was assured that she must make up her mind to give up her lover, and
                  the sooner this was done the better it would be for all parties concerned in this
                  unfortunate imbroglio.
               Lucille never opposed her mother in words. She was too gentle and too dutiful for
                  that; but hers was that silent, passive resistance to the unjust assertion of
                  authority, which is unyielding as a wall of iron. While Madame Villeray flattered
                  herself that she was convincing the reason of her daughter, and submission to her
                  dictates must soon follow, the heart of Lucille, in every resolute throb, held
                  fast her faith and truth to the lover she had chosen.
               Life and hope might perish in the struggle, but true to her plighted vows she
                  would remain, in defiance of every effort to render her unfaithful to them. From
                  her mother she had inherited the very strength of will which was now set against
                  her wishes; and when two such natures come in direct collision, it was easy to see
                  that neither would yield an inch of vantage ground. The elder lady from obstinacy,
                  and the preconceived idea that she had a right to settle the destiny of her child,
                  would persist to the last; the younger one, from the deep sense of honor which had
                  been the gift of her father, would maintain the position she had assumed in
                  defiance of every attempt to alienate her from Vivaldi.
               At the conclusion of her harangue, Madame Villeray looked at the pale, set face of
                  her daughter, and added:
               "You see it must be so, Lucille. Young love, and romantic dreams, are well enough
                  in their way; but they will not give you a villa, servants, and a carriage. These
                  are things to which you are entitled, and the man that marries you
                     must possess them. Senor Vivaldi is attractive and interesting, I
                  admit; but he is too poor to look so high. You fully comprehend me, I hope,
                  child."
               There was a sharp accent in her voice which Lucille understood very well; she only
                  said, in a low tone:
               "Yes, Madame, I believe I do; and now, if you please, I will retire to my own
                  room."
               "Go then; I am tired of talking, and after all it's not of much use. You will
                  learn from the future that I am perfectly in earnest, and mean every word I have
                  said."
               Lucille merely bowed her head as she glided from the room, but in her heart was
                  the rebellious thought that she too was in earnest, and had not the slightest
                  intention of being dragooned into relinquishing her betrothed.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               THE WARNING.
               THE days passed as a happy dream to the enchanted Clarice; and, truly, no princess
                  in a fairy tale could have had more bewildering surprises than awaited the Pearl
                  of Isola Rossa in her new abode.
               
               Accompanied by Guilio, she learned to scale the mountain hights; to fire a light
                  carbine, which even her delicate hand could soon wield with the skill of a
                  practised sportsman, though, to tell the truth, her lip quivered, and her eyes
                  filled with tears, when her first feathered trophy fell fluttering and wounded at
                  her feet.
               Hers was a tender woman's heart, and death by violence to the meanest creature God
                  has made was painful to her.
               Benedetto, or Evoli, as we now know his true name to be, remained but few days
                  with the newly-wedded pair; unwilling to witness a happiness in which he could not
                  share, he wandered away on some expedition of his own, leaving the lovers to enjoy
                  that bliss which he had already determined should not be very lasting.
               Evoli was the sworn comrade of Guilio, yet the first glance he had cast upon his
                  bride had kindled in his undisciplined nature a passion as violent and
                  irresistible as were all the impulses of his being. Born to almost princely rank,
                  in a country in which fiery will is ever dominant over principle, to wish and to
                  act had ever been his custom; and now the slight barrier of his friendship for
                  Guilio interposed but a trifling obstacle to the consummation of the treachery he
                  meditated.
               Implicated in a political conspiracy, which for a season compelled him to remain
                  in hiding, Evoli knew that steps had already been taken to restore him to his
                  former position. He now impatiently awaited the arrival of that hour of freedom,
                  as his restoration to rank and fortune would enable him to offer such temptations
                  to the object of his passion, as he believed no daughter of Eve would possess
                  firmness to resist.
               Evoli believed that with his beauty of person, his power to charm every one that
                  approached him, he could win the heart of this lovely creature from the crude,
                  unformed youth to whom she had given herself; he would bear her to his splendid
                  home, and surround her with the elegance she was formed to appreciate and adorn.
                  That he should succeed, he did not permit himself to doubt, for had he not
                  hitherto proved himself irresistible to every woman he had desired to please? He
                  knew that in his seductive voice, graceful accomplishments, and devotion to the
                  sex, he bore with him a fascination which had hitherto carried everything before
                  him. No—he would not be baffled now; struggle as she might, Clarice should surely
                  be separated from her mountain lord, and become the companion of his flight from
                  Monté Rimbombo, as they had named their cavern, from the constant reverberations
                  of the waves which dashed against its base.
               During the following weeks, Evoli came and went at intervals, always making
                  himself charming on his return, and carefully timing his departure in such a
                  manner as to leave regrets behind him. Already he saw the first repulsion Clarice
                  had evidently felt towards him was quite overcome, and he confidently looked
                  forward to the time when those soft eyes would light up with tender welcome at the
                  sound of his approaching footsteps.
               Marie Montoni, on one of her dreamy spells, followed the steps of her young
                  friends, taking no part in their pastimes, nor often conscious of their
                  occupations. The anniversary of the loss of her lover had come around, and she
                  spent her days in wandering about after Clarice, carrying a rosary in her hand,
                  over which she muttered prayers for the repose of the soul of her lost one, and
                  gazing afar off into space, as if seeking his impalpable form in the mists which
                  floated around the mountain hights. She rarely spoke, and ate so little that it
                  was marvellous how her strength was sustained. Occupied with each other, Guilio
                  and his bride suffered Marie to wander at her will, and indulge her dreamy
                  reveries without interruption.
               
               Clarice did not forget the promise of Guilio to reveal to her the wonders of the
                  grotto that lay at the base of the cavern, and with every visit her delight
                  increased. Three weeks had passed away since her arrival at Monté Rimbombo, and
                  the young bride had not yet experienced an emotion of lassitude or weariness. She
                  believed her happiness would always be as great as now—her enjoyment of the
                  passing moment as vivid and as fresh as at first.
               Clarice was too young and inexperienced to dream of disenchantment; and she was
                  thus far fortunate, that once in her life at least she enjoyed a period of
                  cloudless happiness more like the radiant dream vouchsafed to our first parents in
                  the garden of Eden, than the usual dull realities of existence. She quaffed the
                  wine of life from an overflowing goblet in which the pearl of joy and hope was
                  dissolved.
               The day had been one of unusual brightness, and as the dazzling sun dipped toward
                  the western horizon, Clarice arose from her afternoon siesta, and proposed to
                  Guilio to seek the cool shadows of the grotto. He gladly acquiesced, for he had
                  been impatiently awaiting her awakening to propose the same thing. Marie declined
                  accompanying them, on the plea of the fatigue of the descent; and leaving her in
                  possession of their leafy dining-hall, the pair passed through one of the
                  adjoining caverns to an entrance hollowed in the floor.
               A heavy rock turned upon a pivot, and revealed a narrow flight of steps even more
                  rugged than those which led into the cave from above, and Guilio took a lamp to
                  light them on their way. The pathway had evidently been excavated through the
                  solid rock by infinite labor, and a tradition existed that it had been done ages
                  before by Saracen invaders, who thus sought to open a communication between the
                  marine grotto and the caverns above. But they were discovered just as they had
                  nearly completed their labors, driven back with great slaughter, and such
                  precautions taken as effectually concealed the entrance from the sea.
               Accident revealed its existence to Theodore Falcone, and its knowledge had
                  descended to his son through an old comrade of the renowned outlaw. The passage
                  was barely wide enough to admit the form of a large man, and in many places the
                  steps were mere notches cut in the rock, which gradually sloped downward till the
                  lower aperture was gained.
               Clarice, by this time familiar with the rugged way, lightly followed her husband,
                  only needing the aid of his hand occasionally, when the steps were unusually steep
                  and broken. When they gained the last one, Guilio placed the lamp in a niche on
                  one side, pressed his hand upon a small knob, and the way opened before them into
                  a scene of fairyland.
               They stood upon the threshold of a temple magnificently arched and ornamented with
                  pendant stalactites of infinite beauty and variety. It was lighted by a rift in
                  the wall above, through which the clear blue sky shone down upon the translucent
                  water which formed the flooring of this marine grotto, and reflected the various
                  gleams of color thrown upon its surface. In one place it was of a pale green tint,
                  in another it was shaded to a deep black, in other spots gleaming with azure and
                  rose-colored tints, blending with each other in wondrous harmony.
               The water was so transparent that away in its depths were seen sea shells and
                  grasses, with fish swimming among them as if conscious of their safety from the
                  arts of the angler in this sheltered retreat. Through the aperture in the roof,
                  the luxuriant verdure of the climate had found its way, and long tendrils of the
                  picturesque grape vine, mingled with flowering creepers, drooped down the sides of
                  the grotto, and twined themselves around the glittering columns, thus offering a type of architectural
                  grace and elegance which mortal man must despair of excelling.
               Near the edge of the water, successive ledges of rock afforded a safe pathway for
                  the visitor when the sea was calm; but when a storm raged, the waves dashed above
                  them, and gave no place of refuge to human feet. On this evening not a breath
                  rippled the calm surface, and Clarice gazed with silent rapture upon a scene that
                  so strongly appealed to that sense of the beautiful which was the most salient
                  feature of her mind.
               A light boat, gaily painted, was moored close to the entrance, and crimson
                  cushions lay piled up in it, which had been placed there for the accommodation of
                  the young bride. While Guilio loosened the chain which secured his fairy shallop,
                  Clarice looked back into the gloomy passage by which they had just descended, and
                  with a deep breath, said:
               "Coming hither is like passing through Hades to gain Heaven. Can anything on earth
                  be more beautiful than this temple made by a viewless architect, who puts all our
                  proudest efforts to shame?"
               "Yes, it is grand and noble," replied Guilio, "and I always feel, on entering this
                  place, as if we should raise a hymn of praise to Him who created it. Benedetto
                  sings magnificently; he and Marie must come hither with us, and give us a grand
                  refrain which will wake up the mermaids from the ocean depths, and draw them into
                  our enchanted hall."
               "That will indeed be magnificent. When does Benedetto return?"
               "I look for him with every passing hour, nor do I know what detains him from us.
                  He is probably watching for the return of Barnardo, who is to bring us such grand
                  news of your family and fortune."
               "He is very kind, if that alone takes him away," murmured Clarice. "But so far as
                  I am concerned, it is of little consequence. I have chosen my lot, and I am
                  contented with it, which I fancy is not the case with many of earth's
                  children."
               "Thanks, love, but you are becoming quite a little philosopher. Benedetto does not
                  go to meet Barnardo on your account alone. He came from Italy, and it is now many
                  months since he joined me here. Of late he has become very restless, and anxious
                  about news from his friends."
               "Who, then, is Benedetto?" asked Clarice, abruptly. "He possesses a grace of
                  manner and beauty of person I have not remarked in any other man, and his
                  accomplishments are singularly varied."
               A faint shadow swept over the brow of Guilio, but it was instantly chased away,
                  and his clear eye met that of Clarice with a roguish twinkle, as he said:
               "So, Senora Eve, you have proved your relationship to the first woman already, but
                  I hope your curiosity will not be gratified at the cost of hers. Your shrewdness
                  has detected what I do not care to conceal from you. Benedetto is a man of high
                  position, and when he regains his own, he will prove a powerful friend to you and
                  me."
               "He is, then, noble?" she asked, with a sudden flush of color as she propounded
                  the last word.
               Guilio laughed, and teasingly replied:
               "Is it not enough to know that he is noble in nature, without caring to hear of
                  the long descent to which men attach such importance?"
               "True—yet still we involuntarily render more respect to those doubly endowed by
                  birth and fortune, than to the most nobly gifted ones without these adventitious
                  aids. Ah me! mean as it is, I am afraid I am not quite free from this weakness
                  myself."
               
               Guilio sorrowfully regarded her as he slowly said:
               "And with this weakness, Clarice, if you should prove to be a woman of rank and
                  fortune yourself, what is to be the end of our dream of bliss? Temptation has not
                  yet assailed you; when it comes, how will you meet it?"
               Clarice had spoken in a half dreamy manner, but Guilio's words startled her into
                  full consciousness of the effect her words had produced. She slightly stooped
                  forward, pressed her lips upon the brown hand that was extended to assist her into
                  the boat, and with an accent of inimitable grace, said:
               "Under any, every circumstance, you are king of my fate, lord of my heart, my
                  Guilio. No fortune can be too high to be shared with you, no temptation great
                  enough to sever me from you. I ask nothing, will accept of nothing, that is not
                  equally yours. Benedetto is handsome and elegant, but you are true and beloved.
                  See, I do not compare you with each other, for in my heart there is no room for
                  such a thought."
               The passing shadow flitted away, Guilio clasped her tenderly in his arms, and
                  lifted her into the boat. With loving care he arranged her cushions and placed her
                  upon them; then, taking a pair of oars from a nook in the rock, he pushed his
                  fairy bark out upon the waters.
               With that love of effect which was innate with Clarice, she had thrown over her
                  light dress a white lace veil that fell in filmy folds around her neck and
                  shoulders. As she reclined against the crimson cushions in an attitude of
                  exquisite grace, her striking face, with its marble white complexion, large,
                  lustrous eyes, and wealth of burnished hair bound in heavy braids around her
                  elegantly moulded head, offered a picture as rare as it was beautiful to the eyes
                  of her fascinated and adoring lover.
               A more patrician looking creature could not have been imagined, and there was in
                  the proud curve of the lips, in the veiled fire of the eyes, the unquenchable
                  spirit of ambition and love of power which now lay latent in her untried nature.
                  Untempted, it might never have been developed, but with the opportunity to grasp
                  the glittering prizes of life once offered to her acceptance, who could say what
                  the final result might be? To such a nature, dire would be the struggle even
                  between her love for Guilio, and the brilliant lures of wealth and high station,
                  in that world her fancy pictured in all its attractiveness to youth and
                  inexperience.
               Possessing that voluptuous temperament which loves to lap itself in luxury; a
                  grasp of mind which already felt that the gifts of nature had been poorly
                  cultivated in the humble sphere in which she had been reared, Clarice felt that if
                  justice had been done to her natural gifts, she would have been something far
                  superior to her present self. With her quick intuition, she saw at once that Evoli
                  was a being of different grade from those with whom she had hitherto been cast,
                  and as day after day unfolded to her the certainty that the elegance and luxury
                  with which she was surrounded resulted from his taste, and his efforts to prepare
                  the cave for her reception, she learned to regard him as a superior being, gifted
                  with the power of the genii to produce magical effects. In his perfect confidence
                  in his friend, Guilio lavished praises upon him, and unhesitatingly revealed that
                  to Evoli's taste and skill he had implicitly trusted in making his preparations
                  for the reception of his bride.
               Evoli had now been absent nearly a week, and both husband and wife began to look
                  forward to his return with a degree of pleasure which neither would have been
                  willing to admit to the other. In truth, the first glamour of passion was past;
                  they had conjugated the verb to love in all its phases, and in the calm which
                  followed the transport of a perfect union, the monotony of their secluded
                     existence began to be vaguely felt,
                  and both unconsciously desired the return of Evoli from the outside world with
                  tidings of what was passing in it, though neither would willingly have
                  acknowledged that in the society of the other all was not found that was needed
                  for happiness.
               Eden itself did not content the first man and woman, though they were fresh from
                  the hand of God, and ignorant of evil; why, then, should we hope that two beings
                  of passionate impulsive southern temperament, could find, even in this romantic
                  solitude, that perfect contentment for which humanity has vainly sighed?
               Clarice began to think of her unknown family and fortune; to build castles in the
                  air which were always inhabited both by Guilio and herself; but in those visions
                  she was ever a lady of high degree, with vassals at her command, and wealth
                  wherewith to maintain her lofty state.
               As she now floated over the lucent waters, and idly played with them with her
                  white fingers, a gorgeous dream of future grandeur arose before her fancy, and she
                  yearned for the arrival of Barnardo, that she might learn the actual position she
                  was henceforth to hold in that busy world whose hum had faintly reached her in her
                  cottage home.
               Guilio, too, began to be restless, and anxious for his return, but from a
                  different cause. He feared the development that might be made concerning the rank
                  of his bride, for he knew enough of life, of the pride of the nobles, to feel
                  assured that Clarice would be compelled to choose between himself and the station
                  to which she was born. He did not for an instant doubt her decision, but he asked
                  himself how he should atone to her for what she must relinquish to remain with
                  him?
               To Guilio's generous nature this was a painful question, and as he looked on her
                  now in her pride of beauty, he felt deep in his exacting soul that if she wavered
                  in her choice, in his jealous frenzy he would be capable of the most terrible
                  vengeance even upon her. He shivered and checked the thoughts that arose within
                  him. Why should he dream of evil on this evening, when everything around him was
                  attuned to happiness? Clarice should see no cloud upon his brow, no mistrust in
                  his manner, for that, in this crisis, would deeply wound her loving heart.
               He shook off the weight that was falling upon him, raised a clear, melodious
                  voice, and sang a barcarole as he rowed the boat from point to point, that Clarice
                  might see the tiny rills of water slowly trickling down the walls, which in the
                  progress of ages had slowly hardened into the sparry incrustations of every
                  variety of form that now ornamented them.
               The grotto was an irregular ellipse, enclosing an area of many hundred feet. The
                  outlet toward the sea was so low, and so matted over with vines and shrubbery,
                  that from without its existence was unsuspected, save to the few who were aware of
                  its locality. At low tide, by lying down in the boat, the rowers could pass
                  through it, but when the sea was as its highest mark there was only a faint line
                  of light which revealed its position to those within the grotto. Such was now the
                  case, and when Guilio rowed close to the outlet, Clarice, with all her efforts,
                  could only obtain a glimpse of the sea beyond. She impatiently asked:
               "When will you take me through this entrance, Guilio? I wish to see the Titanic
                  grandeur of the rocks piled as a barrier against the waves, of which you have told
                  me."
               "Whenever it is safe to do so, my angel. The tide is coming in; hear the billows
                  how they dash and roar against the granite barrier of our fairy palace, while we
                  sit calmly within our shallop, gently rocked by their
                     undulations."
               "Ah! it is a grand refrain, and better suited to this spot than any music with
                  which we can fill its stately walls. To
                  render the place perfect, Venus should rise from the sea in her shell of pearl,
                  surrounded by beautiful mermaids who would join their voices with the grand chorus
                  of ocean spirits that seem ceaselessly to wail the fate of those given as a prey
                  to the remorseless deep. Ah! I can almost fancy I behold them rising from the
                  transparent water!"
               Guilio laughed gaily.
               "I do indeed see Venus, though the attendant nymphs are wanting; but it matters
                  not to me, Clarice, mia; the goddess suffices in
                  herself."
               "Yes—I know I am your goddess now, but how long will my divinity last? The moon of
                  bliss has almost waned, and when that is gone, the wine of life has lost its first
                  exquisite flavor," she pensively replied.
               "Not with us shall it be thus," earnestly responded Guilio. "Our love shall
                  brighten and grow stronger as we walk hand in hand upon the path we have chosen to
                  tread together. Only let us be true to each other, my Clarice."
               "That I am sure we will be through every trial, every temptation," was the
                  emphatic response, and Clarice believed sincerely that she spoke the truth.
               Guilio replied to this assurance by an eloquent glance of confidence and perfect
                  love, and again the delicious calm of undoubted faith in each other cast its ægis
                  over those two hearts that might have lived in perfect union but for the
                  disturbing influences that were drawing near even during those moments of serene
                  happiness.
               Clarice at length said:
               "I am surprised that the existence of this grotto has not become known to
                  smugglers, and been used by them to conceal contraband goods."
               A deep flush mounted to the brow of Guilio, which was succeeded by a momentary
                  paleness. He compressed his lips, as he glanced searchingly at the face of his
                  companion ion. She was not at that moment looking at him, but appeared absorbed in
                  contemplating the beauties of the scene around her. With slight effort he
                  said:
               "There are caverns situated near this better suited to such a purpose, which are
                  known to be used by them. But the entrance to this one is so well concealed that I
                  have no reason to suppose its existence is known, save to myself and two faithful
                  friends. But even if chance should reveal it, the outlet toward our own eyrie is
                  too well concealed to afford any clue to our stronghold. We are as safe in our
                  mountain home, as if we had emigrated to the moon."
               "I am thankful for that, for at times I have fears that the relatives of Matra may
                  seek to avenge on you the sad event of our bridal day."
               "I'll not be troubled on that score, Clarice; for I am free from the crime of
                  blood-guiltiness, and the Madonna will not send its punishment upon me. Twilight
                  begins to deepen around us, love; shall we ascend, and seek Marie once more?"
               She sighed and looked around, as she replied:
               "I could spend hours in dreaming in this exquisite place. I am never willing to
                  leave it, but I suppose we must go, or Marie will think we have too long deserted
                  her."
               With slow and gliding motion, Guilio propelled the boat to the spot from which he
                  had taken it, and after fastening the chain that secured it, said to Clarice:
               "Examine the wall, and see if you, who are aware of the existence of the entrance,
                  can find where it is situated."
               She gave a minute survey to the rugged surface, and said:
               "It is impossible to point out the exact spot in which it is situated. I can never
                  find it without your assistance."
               "Nor I, without this landmark," replied Guilio, pointing to a small notch cut into
                  the rock near the edge of the water. "A
                  line carried from this mark in a direction ten feet toward the left, will point to
                  the outlet. See," and he proceeded in the direction named, placed his hand upon
                  the spring which held it fast, and the door unclosed, showing the abrupt passage
                  faintly illuminated by the lamp which had been left within it.
               After a toilsome ascent they reached the upper cavern, and found Marie sitting
                  upon the platform which looked toward the sea. Her dreamy air was gone, together
                  with the rosary which of late had been her constant companion; a faint color
                  gleamed upon her cheeks, and with an appearance of re-awakened interest she
                  pointed to a white-winged felucca in the distance.
               "There comes Barnardo. He brings you news of your family, Clarice. I feel that a
                  change is about to fall upon us, but whether for better or for worse my prescience
                  does not enable me to foresee. Ah! why is this clouded vision given to me? It
                  would be better to live like others in the dark than have imperfect and deceptive
                  gleams of light vouchsafed to me."
               "Do not give way to your strange fancies, then, Marie," said Guilio, bluntly. "Any
                  change to Clarice and myself must be for the worse, for are we not perfectly happy
                  as we are, and ask for nothing that Fate has not given us? Is it not so, Clarice,
                     mia?"
               "Assuredly," and Clarice smiled softly upon him; but still her heart throbbed
                  tumultuously at the approach of Barnardo with tidings of such importance to
                  herself.
               The three watched the swift motion of the vessel, and calculated the time that
                  must elapse before the sailor could reach the trysting place appointed for a
                  meeting between himself and Guilio; for the latter had no idea of betraying to the
                  smuggler the secret entrance to his mountain home.
               He brought out his pocket telescope, and found that Marie's keen eyes had not
                  deceived her; the Violante was flitting toward the coast, and no time was to be
                  lost in setting out for the point at which he was to meet Barnardo. Clarice
                  entreated for permission to accompany him, but this Guilio gently yet firmly
                  refused, with the assurance that the distance was too great, and the way too rough
                  for her to walk without extreme fatigue.
               As Guilio was preparing to leave, Marie, who had retired to her own apartment,
                  re-entered, wrapped in her black faldetta, and said:
               "My mind is made up to return to Isola Rossa by the first opportunity. From there
                  I must go to Bastia, to visit one who was a friend to me in the darkest days of my
                  misfortunes. Something tells me that sorrow has entered his house, and I must go
                  thither to satisfy myself if such is the fact."
               "And leave Clarice without a female companion?" asked Guilio in dismay. "I have
                  hoped and trusted that you would remain here as our friend and sister, Marie."
               "I will return again, and that soon; but Clarice knows that I cannot abide long in
                  one place. Since—since I was crushed by sorrow, change of scene has become
                  necessary to me. I have stayed my time out here, and now I must go."
               Clarice looked pleadingly at her, and would have added her entreaties to those of
                  Guilio, but something in the face of the half demented woman warned her that she
                  spoke the truth. The cavern had become a prison to her, and she must wander over
                  the free earth, until the necessity for repose again led her wandering steps to
                  its shelter. She resignedly said:
               "I see it is inevitable, Marie, and for a season I must give you up. But you must
                  return as speedily as may be, for I shall sadly miss your companionship."
               "One is coming who will more than fill my place," replied the girl in a low, significant tone. "Be
                  careful, Clarice, darling, how you hearken to his tempting voice lest it may lead
                  you astray."
               "Impossible!" was the indignant response, uttered with crimsoning cheeks and
                  flashing eyes. "How can you suspect me of being capable of such baseness?"
               "I only warn you, my friend. Keep the faith you have plighted pure and bright, and
                  all will be well."
               Guilio was filling his pockets with figs and bread, and he advised Marie to follow
                  his example, for they had a long walk before them, over a road rugged enough to
                  sharpen any appetite. This she did, and after a tender parting from Clarice, the
                  two threaded their way to the upper cavern.
               It was not yet dark, and the goats and sheep were coming in, in pairs, driven by
                  the herdsman. A few words from Guilio informed him of whither they were bound, and
                  with a gay smile, Angelo said:
               "I hope, Senor, that you will bring back the Senor Benedetto with you. His
                  handsome face and cheery voice are missed by us all when he stays away longer than
                  usual."
               "I think it probable he will return with me, Angelo," and they passed on their
                  way.
               "It is strange," said Guilio, after a long pause, "what a charm Benedetto seems to
                  carry with him. Every one he approaches seems ready to fall down and offer him
                  homage."
               "Some persons possess that fatal kind of magnetism," replied Marie, gravely. "I
                  trust in his case that it will be used to no evil purpose."
               "Evil! Marie! Benedetto is the soul of honor. He is hiding from no taint of crime,
                  or dishonor. It is only a political difficulty that keeps him here."
               "Then, as I suspected, he is a man of rank. Guard well the dove of peace that now
                  nestles in your bower, Guilio, and let no high-born gallant lure it from its true
                  home."
               Guilio flushed deeply, and he fiercely asked:
               "What can you mean, Marie, by seeking to infuse suspicion into my mind against the
                  two beings I love best on earth?"
               "I only warn you against possibilities—nothing more. Take my words as they are
                  meant, Guilio, and do not get angry with me for speaking what I am impelled to
                  utter."
               Guilio glanced at her colorless face, with its fixed expression and wild vague
                  eyes, and he mentally said:
               "Why should I heed her? She is evidently demented, and my wife and friend are,
                  thank Heaven! too far above suspicion to be watched by me. I would sooner lose
                  both than mistrust them."
               In silence they walked forward, too deeply occupied with their own thoughts to
                  take much heed of the wild scenery amid which their pathway lay. Marie said in her
                  own heart:
               "I will come back soon. I must watch over them, since he disdains to do so."
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               THE AVENGERS OF BLOOD. TREACHERY.
               DURING this interval, Evoli had nominally taken charge of Guilio's felucca, which
                  although believed by the people of Isola Rossa to be engaged in the fishing trade
                  was fitted up with a degree of luxury that was strangely at variance with the
                  supposed calling of its master. The new commander left everything on board to the
                  care of the mate, and only used the vessel as the means of making such excursions
                  as he desired, and on his first trip, he landed at a point on the coast from which he could easily reach
                  Isola Rossa.
               His excuse for going thither was to learn all that had taken place after the
                  flight of Guilio, and the death of his rival. A terrible blood-vengeance he knew
                  would be exacted for the deed, and deep in his heart lay the scarcely acknowledged
                  thought that Guilio might easily be removed from his path if he chose to give the
                  clue to his hiding place.
               But this must not yet be done. He must have time to win his own way to the heart
                  of the charming creature for whom he had conceived so sudden and violent a
                  passion, to bask in her smiles day after day, in the security of the position he
                  held as the friend of her husband, and under cover of that character, undermine
                  the loyalty of Clarice to her wedded lord, while he filled her heart with
                  discontent at the inferior lot awarded to one of such peerless endowments.
               This done, the rest was easy of accomplishment, and the past experience of Evoli
                  led him to believe that success was certain in the double treachery he meditated
                  against the happiness and life of his chosen friend. He had received kindness and
                  protection from the man he was about to wrong in this fearful manner, but every
                  obligation of duty and honor fell before the wild passion that raged in his
                  breast. He had loved before, or thought he had, but with nothing like the
                  all-absorbing flame that sprang into existence as if by magic at the first glance
                  from the dark, lustrous eyes of the beautiful Clarice.
               The few days he had remained within the sphere of her enchantments had only
                  deepened the charm, and Evoli fled from the presence of the wedded lovers, lest he
                  should prematurely awaken the jealous fears of Guilio, and put the attached wife
                  upon her guard against the wiles he so well knew how to use. Though, as we have
                  already stated, he returned at intervals, remaining only long enough to make his
                  absence regretted, and his reappearance looked forward to with pleasure. It is our
                  purpose to follow him in the first of these excursions, as what occurred then is
                  of importance to the development of our story.
               Laying aside the striking costume he usually wore, Evoli assumed the garb of a
                  working man, and landing a few miles from the town, walked towards it and entered
                  its streets at an early hour of the morning. The house of the deceased Matra was
                  opened for the performance of the funeral ceremonies, and thither he proceeded,
                  guided by the people who were crowding toward it conversing on the exciting topic
                  of the late murder.
               The women of the town were gathering to the audare alla
                     gridata, the outcry or howling usually held in Corsica over the body
                  of a murdered man. This is made on the morning of the funeral, before the
                  death-brothers come to remove the corpse for interment. Evoli passed the open
                  portal, and looked with interest upon the lugubrious scene presented by the death
                  chamber.
               The corpse of Matra had been placed upon a tola or table, with a pillow beneath
                  the head, on which a red Phrygian cap was drawn, its gay color contrasting
                  strangely with the pallid and distorted face of its lifeless wearer, and a narrow
                  strip of cloth was bound around the face to prevent the features from falling. The
                  childless mother, with a stern, set face, sat at the head of the corpse, and in
                  her iron mouth and darkly flashing eyes could be read a tale of purposed vengeance
                  that might well cause the blood of a stranger to thrill and quiver with
                  apprehension. A tiger crouching for a spring upon its prey, could not have shown
                  more deadly fierceness in his glance than that which now blazed from those eyes of
                  intense, rayless blackness; and her fingers worked convulsively, as if sharpening
                  themselves for the death grip upon the destroyer of her son.
               
               The leading improvisatrice of the town, a tall, dark-browed woman, led the
                  mourners to the spot on which sat the bereaved mother. At their approach Dame
                  Matra raised her head and looked sternly upon them, as they bowed solemnly and
                  reverently before her. The mother returned their salaams with equal stateliness,
                  and this ceremony was continued for about half a minute, when a cousin of the
                  deceased invited the assemblage to mourn for the untimely death of their
                  friend.
               The guests arose with one accord, and formed a circle around the tola, singing, or
                  rather howling, in a most lugubrious manner, while they swung around the bier, at
                  intervals separating their joined hands, and again clasping them with the wildest
                  demonstrations of grief.
               Each performer in this weird scene seemed to act on and increase the dramatic
                  vivacity of her neighbor, until their ecstacy was almost terrible to behold. The
                  women loosened their long hair and suffered it to flow in dishevelled masses upon
                  their shoulders; their eyes flashed with the fires of vengeance, their black
                  mantles fluttering wildly as they madly whirled around, uttering wailing cries,
                  striking the palms of their hands against each other, beating their breasts,
                  rending their hair, and sobbing with emotion.
               At the climax of the lamentation the mourners threw themselves upon the tola and
                  scattered dust upon their heads after the manner of the ancient Hebrews. At
                  length, exhausted by the violence of their action, the women threw themselves upon
                  the floor, and sat motionless as the dead man over whom they poured their lament.
                  Their wild wails died away in deep respirations, for the actors in the scene had
                  exhausted themselves in the rapid evolutions they had made, and now sat with heads
                  bowed upon their breasts in an attitude expressive of the deepest grief.
               The stranger looked with a thrilling interest upon the fearful contrast offered by
                  the wild death-dance, with its stunning howls and almost superhuman activity, and
                  the grim, stark form which lay stretched before them in the immobility of death.
                  As he looked critically at the mourning women, with their dishevelled locks, he
                  likened them in his own mind to a company of Gorgons.
               The stillness of death succeeded the wild uproar which had recently filled the
                  apartment; the women sat motionless wrapped in their sombre mantles, with bowed
                  heads, as if grief, exhausted by expression, had sunk into that torpor which ever
                  follows excess. Evoli was beginning to weary of this silence, and wonder when it
                  would end, when suddenly a young girl sprang from the circle of mourners, and
                  commenced a wild recitative, in which she detailed the leading incidents of
                  Matra's life. At the end of each strophe the wailing chorus of woe! woe! woe! was
                  raised by the whole crowd, and prolonged into a cry of indescribable horror.
               With passionate power, the improvisatrice described the love of the dead man for
                  his perfidious bride; how he had stooped from a higher state to lift her to his
                  side, and the reward he had met for his devotion. Every power was invoked to
                  avenge the perfidy of which he had been the victim. The singer was a genuine poet,
                  and truly the horrible and the beautiful have rarely been so blended as in that
                  thrilling cry for the blood-vengeance upon him who had stolen Matra's bride, and
                  given doom to himself.
               The face of the girl glowed, her eyes flashed with the fires of vengeance, and as
                  she swung around in her frantic dance, her long hair, which fell nearly to her
                  feet, seemed like black snakes twining about her lithe form. At intervals the
                  elder women joined in the chorus, with the force and vivacity of a company of
                  veritable furies.
               After the first thrilling effect of the scene passed away, Evoli began to wish himself safe out of the crowd,
                  which momentarily became more dense. He looked around to see if escape were
                  possible; but when the interest of the spectator began to slacken, the tall form
                  of the stricken mother arose.
               She cast her hard eyes over the assemblage, and waving her hand
                  for silence, took from her bosom a fragment torn from the bloody shirt of her
                  murdered son. With a cry more like that of a wild animal, than the outburst of
                  human anguish, she exclaimed:
               "Sons of Corsica! behold the life current of your brother, which stiffens this
                  fragment of cloth! The blood you here behold lately flowed through the heart of my
                  only child; it was poured forth by violence, and I demand Corsican justice against
                  the murderer and all his race. I devote Guilio Falcone and his bride to the
                  blood-vengeance, and I call on all those who claim kindred with me, to aid me in
                  the accomplishment of this holy duty."
               In answer to this demand, two tall, powerfully-made men, with hard and sinister
                  faces, separated themselves from the throng, and placed themselves beside the
                  bereaved mother. They simultaneously lifted their hands and responded, in deep
                  stern tones:
               "We reply to your call, mother of our kinsman. We dedicate our lives to the
                  pursuit and immolation of Guilio Falcone and his stolen bride. Their blood shall
                  atone for the crime which has been perpetrated. Hearken to our vow, childless
                  mother, and be consoled."
               Dame Matra laid her hands in theirs, and sternly replied:
               "It is well; you have vindicated your claim to belong to his race. My husband's
                  nephews, I accept your pledge, and I shall look to you to redeem it to the
                  letter."
               "We swear to do so."
               A murmur of applause greeted these words, and again a solemn silence fell upon the
                  crowd. The mother sunk into her seat, and the two avengers stood scowling beside
                  her.
               Before this silence became too oppressive, a stir at the door announced the
                  arrival of the death-brothers to remove the body to the church for interment. The
                  lament was again raised, and continued while the priests slowly marched in,
                  clothed in black, with their cowls drawn over their heads. They surrounded the
                  bier, lifted the corpse from the table, and the crowd formed itself into a
                  procession, while the whole company joined in the vocero which filled the air with
                  its mournful melody.
               With slow and measured steps they left the house, and proceeded toward the church,
                  which had been prepared for the reception of the dead. Here the body was solemnly
                  blessed before being taken to the burial ground, to the same weird national music
                  which is so strangely calculated to arouse the deeper passions of the listener,
                  while it conveys to the soul a message of doom and despair.
               As Evoli listened to its stirring cadences, well aware as he was of the character
                  of the deceased Matra, he could scarcely resist the feeling that his death merited
                  atonement, and it was no crime in this wild people to take into their own hands
                  the vendetta which is the only law to which they yield implicit obedience.
               At the close of the ceremonies, the elder of the kinsmen who had pledged himself
                  to accomplish the blood-vengeance, gave a pressing invitation to the crowd to
                  return to Matra's house, to partake of a funeral banquet, which, it was whispered,
                  was to be of unusual splendor. Cakes were distributed among the death-brothers,
                  and the people, talking in suppressed tones, returned to the villa of the
                  deceased.
               During these ceremonies, Evoli was pondering in his own mind the course he should
                  pursue. Was it yet advisable to open a communication with the avengers of blood?
                     This could be done at any moment
                  when their assistance became important to him, then why act precipitately? Yet
                  what had brought him to Isola Rossa but that very purpose, and why should he
                  shrink from the initiative steps in the treachery which must be consummated before
                  he could hope to gain possession of Clarice?
               Yes—he would lose no time in the indulgence of scruples which must ultimately give
                  way before the necessity of action. He would hold the threads of future events in
                  his own hands, and guide them at his will, thus gaining the power to deliver up
                  his rival whenever it became expedient to do so.
               Stifling all sense of honor and faith beneath the insane passion that burned
                  within him, Evoli curbed his impatience, and returned to the villa to partake of
                  the death-feast.
               Though the guests preserved the solemn gravity of demeanor appropriate to the
                  occasion, their appetite did not seem to suffer from the indulgence of their
                  sorrow, for more complete justice was never done to a lord mayor's banquet than to
                  the luxurious viands and wines provided to console the friends of Matra for his
                  untimely demise.
               The two cousins especially regaled themselves, and the quantities they ate and
                  drank were almost incredible. The impatient Italian watched them keenly, and he
                  wondered if they would never be satiated; he finally resigned himself with the
                  thought that all things must come to an end, even a death-banquet at the expense
                  of the departed.
               At length the company began to disperse; the wailing women, who had quaffed as
                  much wine, and eaten as liberally as if grief had no part in the ceremonies of the
                  day, took their departure with the others, leaving the childless mother to
                  solitude and thoughts of vengeance. After bidding her adieu, the stalwart form of
                  the elder Matra was seen to rise and advance toward the door. The Italian lost no
                  time in following him, and when they gained a cross-street leading toward the sea,
                  in which few people were seen, Evoli hurried forward, and addressed him in a
                  friendly tone:
               "A fair day, Senor, for so solemn a business as that to which we have just been
                  attending. A terrible crime has been committed, and I, although no Corsican, can
                  sympathize with the feeling that dictated your pledge of this morning to the
                  bereaved mother."
               Matra cast a sharp glance toward the speaker, and gruffly replied:
               "Though no Corsican, an Italian knows the laws by which we are ruled: 'an eye for
                  an eye, a tooth for a tooth,' was the ancient code, but we simplify it, and say a
                  life for a life. It is just: who shall gainsay our right to settle our own
                  quarrels in our own manner?"
               "Not I, for one, my friend; but in this case it seems to me you exceed your claim,
                  for you propose to take two lives in payment for one. This is going beyond your
                  own requisition."
               "By no means, Senor. With us, where the outrage has been excessive, whole families
                  have often been devoted to the Vendetta. This is a case of that kind. Falcone has
                  no relatives that we are aware of, and the girl whose fatal beauty instigated the
                  crime, must pay the penalty of her faithlessness with her life. If I find her, I
                  shall have no mercy for her."
               There was a fixed and stern resolution in the tones of the speaker, that made
                  Evoli shiver. He, however, calmly said:
               "But it is necessary, first, to find the criminals, and if I am rightly informed,
                  they have escaped to the macchia."
               "That is true enough, but patience, in the end, always clutches its victim. Sleepless as jealousy—untiring
                  as the sleuth-hound on the track of his prey—will I prove in this death-quest, for
                  Guilio Falcone is the son of a man who once trampled on and insulted me, and
                  therefore I am not likely to forego my promised vengeance."
               "So-o, you have a double hate to satisfy," replied Evoli, slowly. "You are the man
                  I seek, and I think we can come to terms with each other."
               The person thus addressed paused and turned toward the speaker, that he might take
                  a more careful survey of him. Though wearing the disguise of a peasant's dress,
                  the handsome, resolute face and daring expression of Evoli revealed to the shrewd
                  Matra that he was speaking with a person of no common stamp. His manner instantly
                  changed from rude carelessness to one of respectful deference, as he said:
               "You, too, are interested in this affair, Senor. Can we be of mutual assistance to
                  each other?"
               Evoli slightly flushed at the equality implied in this inquiry, and he hurriedly
                  said:
               "Perhaps it may prove so; but let us seek a more private spot in which to hold a
                  conversation. I may render it to your interest to fulfill a part of the pledge
                  given this morning, but it must be in my own time and on my own terms."
               "The last will be liberal, Senor?"
               Evoli nodded in reply, and Matra merely said:
               "Follow me at a convenient distance."
               He walked rapidly forward till he gained, the edge of the town, and then turned
                  into a road bordered by trees, which led to a wine shop much frequented by the
                  lower classes of the people. It was yet too early in the day for many guests to be
                  assembled at this rendezvous, and when Matra asked for a private apartment in
                  which to rest after the fatigues of the morning, the landlord showed him into an
                  apartment partitioned off from the public room.
               Beckoning to the stranger to join him, the two went in together, and closed the
                  door. The curious landlord listened at the keyhole, to discover, if possible, the
                  cause of this secret interview; but the guarded tones of the speakers completely
                  baffled him, and he soon retired in disgust.
               For more than an hour the two were closeted together, and when they were about to
                  part, the bravo put a heavy purse into his pocket, as he respectfully said:
               "I hold myself pledged to your service, Senor. At the moment you send the promised
                  directions, I shall be ready to undertake the enterprise. After all, Falcone is
                  the only criminal, and the girl may be permitted to escape."
               "Her life must be held sacred," was the emphatic response. "For her
                  sake I have interfered, and to purchase immunity for her, I betray her lover. I
                  assure you that except through treachery it is impossible that you shall ever gain
                  access to the retreat of Falcone. Only through me can you hope to come within
                  striking distance of your enemy."
               "I understand, Senor, and our compact shall be binding. The girl is safe, but how
                  long must I wait before I have leave to clutch my quarry?"
               "You must wait my pleasure, but you may be assured that it will be signified as
                  soon as it is safe to do so, for I love the woman whose life I have bargained
                  for."
               "And she? Is she doubly treacherous?"
               "No—she is now devoted to Falcone, but women do not always remain constant even to
                  a chosen lover. When I appear before her as her saviour from a terrible fate, she
                  will soon learn to love me in my turn."
               "That will be a very natural result, Senor; I shall be careful to follow all your
                  directions to the letter."
               
               "It is well. Examine this ring, that you may recognize the validity of the message
                  which accompanies it when I send it to you with such instructions as will enable
                  you to carry out the enterprise."
               He drew from his finger a cameo with a Satyr's head cut upon it, beneath which
                  were his own initials. Matra held it in his clumsy fingers, and turned it in every
                  possible light before returning the jewel to its owner. A crafty smile came upon
                  his lips, as he said:
               "I shall know the bauble again, and when it reaches me I shall act without delay.
                  You may depend upon me, for the old dame gives the half of her son's estate to the
                  kinsman who first succeeds in carrying out the laws of the Vendetta against his
                  murderer."
               "Adieu, then; within three months the reward shall be yours, together with a
                  duplicate of the sum I have paid you this morning."
               Matra rubbed his huge hands together, as he said:
               "This has been a lucky day for me, for my fortune is as good as made. Many thanks,
                  Senor, for your confidence in my discretion. You may be sure that I shall remember
                  the Satyr's head, and look for its appearance with impatience."
               "It will certainly reach your hands in the time specified, if I am still numbered
                  among the living."
               The two issued from the room, called for wine which Evoli liberally paid for, and
                  then departed in different directions.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               A SERPENT ENTERS A FAIR EDEN.
               BY this time the sun was sinking toward the west, and Evoli pursued his way toward
                  the cove at which he had landed. The commander of the lugger had been ordered to
                  hover in sight of the spot ready at any moment to obey his signal to take him on
                  board, and in reply to a wave of his handkerchief, a boat at once put out from the
                  vessel manned by two stout rowers.
               In a few moments the Italian stood upon her deck, and received the cordial welcome
                  of these rough men, for Evoli's unrivalled powers of fascination had enthralled
                  even those rude sons of Neptune. He possessed the rare power of placing himself
                     en rapport with those with whom he has
                  thrown, and the songs, stories and jests, with which he helped to beguile the
                  tedium of a sailor's life, soon rendered him the idol of the crew. There was not a
                  man among them who would have hesitated to imperil even his life for the pleasure
                  of Senor Benedetto.
               After a short and successful cruise the lugger again entered her usual harbor, and
                  Evoli hastened to the cave to intoxicate himself more deeply with the charms of
                  Clarice, and strengthen the purpose already fully formed, to tear her from the
                  protecting arms of her husband. Yet his wonderful self-command enabled him to
                  repress all outward sign of the passion which gained intensity with every passing
                  hour. He did not speak of his visit to Isola Rossa, nor of the scenes there to
                  which he had been a witness. Falcone must be well aware of the Vendetta which
                  would surely be declared against him, and it was no part of his policy to betray
                  his own interest in its fatal result.
               
               A few days sufficed to convince him that he could not live so near Clarice and see
                  her lavish tender smiles and fond words upon her husband; the atmosphere of the
                  cavern became stifling to his soul, and he again escaped from it to the open sea.
                  After a brief cruise, he twice returned before the arrival of Barnardo was
                  expected, but in these visits the eye of Marie Montoni was upon him, and in spite
                  of his efforts to conceal what was passing within him, she dimly comprehended the
                  threatened danger, though the two lovers were too much occupied with each other to
                  suspect that the serpent had indeed entered their Eden.
               Evoli wished to secure an interview with Barnardo before a meeting with Guilio
                  took place, and for that purpose he again took temporary command of the lugger,
                  and cruised between Corsica and the island of Monti Christo, keeping up a keen
                  lookout for the Violante.
               At length the white-winged felucca for which he had so impatiently watched made
                  her appearance, bearing toward the coast of Niolo, and the lugger was steered at
                  once toward the same point. She reached the cove first, and with a promise to
                  report their progress to Guilio, Evoli resigned his command to the mate, and
                  recommended him to proceed immediately upon his voyage. This was promptly done,
                  and as the vessel moved out of the harbor, the Violante glided in, and dropped her
                  anchor in the same spot she had just vacated.
               As Barnardo stepped on shore, Evoli came forward to meet him, and a cordial
                  greeting passed between them.
               "Where is Guilio?" asked the captain. "I have been delayed on my voyage, and have
                  so little time to remain that I hoped to find him here awaiting me."
               Evoli shrugged his shoulders significantly as he replied with a laugh:
               "What can you expect of a man so absurdly in love as poor Falcone? He forgets
                  everything but the fair face of the girl he has brought to his mountain home."
               "Yet it is to her I bring most important tidings, and I thought her husband would
                  be most anxious to hear them. I must go on, I suppose, to the point at which I
                  agreed to meet him, but as I am behind my time, I hoped Guilio's impatience would
                  anticipate my arrival, and I should find him here."
               "He will meet you at the spot agreed on, so we had better go on at once. We shall
                  find mules awaiting us in the ravine behind the cliffs."
               "Let us be off at once, then, for in two hours I must leave this landing. My
                  vessel has been pursued, and I risked much to deliver my letters to Falcone and
                  his bride."
               While the two spoke they rapidly ascended the cliff, and on turning an abrupt
                  angle found a shepherd holding a couple of mules by the bridle, ready caparisoned
                  for the road. He touched his ragged cap and said to Evoli:
               "You have come at last, Senor. This is the third day I have watched for you with
                  the mules as you bade me."
               "It is well—here is your reward," and he gave him a piece of money.
               The two mounted and proceeded up the gorge in silence till they were beyond the
                  hearing of the peasant. Barnardo then turned to his companion, and briefly
                  asked:
               "You were evidently watching for me, Senor. What is your purpose in seeking to
                  gain this interview before I meet Falcone?"
               "I merely wish to inform myself of the result of your mission, that I may bear it
                  to Guilio in case he is prevented from meeting us."
               "Has he then sent you hither as his ambassador?"
               "By no means," responded the Italian, with some hauteur. "I am not at the beck and
                  call of any man, not even of him who styles himself the King of the Mountain."
               
               Barnardo bowed respectfully as he replied:
               "I am well aware that the Duke of Evoli was not born to obey the commands of one
                  so far his inferior in rank as poor Falcone, though accident has thrown him on his
                  hospitality."
               The listener flushed deeply, and he rapidly said:
               "Ha! then I am known to you. How have you discovered my name and rank?"
               "That was easy enough to a person of any acuteness. I suspected your position when
                  you took refuge on my felucca. On my return to Italy, a few judicious inquiries
                  revealed the fact that a political refugee of importance had evaded the sbirri.
                  His name was readily learned, and I no longer doubted his identity with that of my
                  passenger."
               "And on your last visit to this spot you did not betray my secret. For that I owe
                  you thanks, Captain Barnardo, and if, in all things else, you will be as true to
                  me, I shall owe you something far more substantial which shall duly be paid."
               "In what can I serve your excellency?" asked Barnardo, impressively. "I am a
                  citizen of the world, battling my own way through it, and with such a patron as
                  you can prove to me when once you are restored to your own, I should feel as if
                  fortune has indeed smiled on me at last."
               "And I shall be restored. The aspect of affairs in Italy is changing even now, and
                  it will soon be safe for me to return there even before my sentence of exile is
                  reversed."
               "Perhaps so; but powerful friends are moving in your behalf, and doubtless before
                  many months have passed, you will be permitted to return to your castle, and
                  resume possession of your princely inheritance."
               "Such is now my dearest hope. Political affairs may rest in oblivion forever, if I
                  can only succeed in obtaining that on which my heart is now set."
               "And that, I presume, is the love of a woman; for men do not usually relinquish
                  the ambition of a life without some such delusive allurement. Better let the sex
                  alone, my lord, and make fame your goddess. It is a safer pursuit, and does not
                  end, as passion is apt to do, in satiety and disgust."
               "Perhaps I may find it to my interest to do so," coldly responded Evoli. "But what
                  tidings have you brought the fair Clarice? Have you discovered her family as you
                  pledged yourself to do?"
               "It was a pledge easily kept on my part, for I already knew to what house she
                  belongs. It matters not how I obtained my information, but I thought it best not
                  to betray my knowledge to Guilio till I had communicated with his wife's father. I
                  have done so, and I bear with me the result of my mission."
               "And the girl?—who is she? what is she?"
               "A far more fitting mate for yourself, my lord, than for him to whom fate has
                  given her."
               Barnardo's keen eyes were fixed penetratingly upon the face of the deeply
                  interested listener, and the sudden flash of exultation that swept over Evoli's
                  face revealed to him all he desired to know. He merely said:
               "Then Clarice is of noble descent?"
               "She is the daughter of Count Rinaldi Ernesti, and if her claim to her true rank
                  is established, she comes in possession of a magnificent fortune."
               "Can it be possible! And she, high-born, lovely as a dream, is thrown away upon a
                  mountain brigand! What can be done to rescue her from such a fate?"
               "It is the lot she has chosen," said Barnardo, drily. "I thought you were the fast
                  friend of her husband, but you too seem ready to turn traitor toward this young
                  couple. The father of Clarice refuses to acknowledge her unless she gives up her husband. He will sacrifice the wealth
                  bequeathed to her on certain conditions, sooner than receive the low-born Guilio
                  as his son."
               Evoli haughtily replied:
               "And Count Ernesti only acts as a man of his caste should. But pray tell me all
                  the particulars of this singular story, that I may understand the exact position
                  of this young creature, who it seems must choose between love and fortune."
               "Such is the inexorable necessity of her position; but I have one soft spot in my
                  rough nature, and I am silly enough to hope that love may conquer, and her heart
                  prove true to the allegiance it has plighted. I plead guilty to a feeling of
                  strong sympathy for this attached young couple."
               "Sympathy—yes, as long as their dream of happiness lasts it is well enough to
                  encourage such feelings; but the reaction must come. Clarice is not formed for the
                  wild and dreary life of an outlaw's wife. She will soon recoil from its monotony,
                  and then the offer of her father will be all-powerful to lure her to his side.
                  Will you reveal all the facts connected with this singular affair?"
               "As much as it is necessary for you to know, I will reveal at once," and Barnardo
                  briefly related the history of Ginevra's marriage, and her subsequent flight from
                  the home of her husband, though he was careful to give no clue to its true cause.
                  He lightly sketched the interview between himself and Count Ernesti, and when he
                  ceased speaking, Evoli asked, with much interest:
               "Do you consider the decision of the Count as final? Will his daughter find it
                  impossible to move him from the determination he has expressed?"
               "I am certain that he will prove as firm as iron on that point. His pride of
                  family is such that no entreaties will induce him to receive the son of a Corsican
                  bandit as the husband of his daughter. The pretty bride must choose between
                  worldly grandeur and loyalty to her plighted lord."
               "And who can doubt what her decision must eventually be? Clarice does not yet know
                  herself; there are depths in her nature which have never been sounded, and when
                  her ambition and love of luxury have been fairly brought into play, the decision
                  must be against the humble lover who has given her his all. Yet all Falcone
                  possesses, or ever hopes to win, are far inferior to what she has the right to
                  claim. With such immense stakes in his favor, Count Ernesti must win the
                  game."
               Barnardo half sighed. As he had said of himself, he was not altogether evil, and
                  in this game in which happiness and hope were the counters to be won or lost, he
                  would have been glad if Guilio could have been the winner without any serious
                  injury to himself. As it was, Evoli was too powerful a patron to be thwarted, and
                  he saw plainly enough that his heart was set on effecting a separation between
                  Clarice and her husband. As to his own share in the affair, he had warned the
                  count of the results likely to ensue from his overweening pride; and, like Pilate
                  of old, he washed his hands, and refused to bear the burden of the
                  blood-guiltiness which might be incurred by others. He said:
               "I am sorry that such a temptation has come to this poor girl. She will sacrifice
                  her happiness, and gain no fair equivalent in return for it."
               Evoli smiled significantly as he replied:
               "Clarice is ambitious; she has an inborn love of the beautiful; she possesses
                  refinement of taste, and an appreciation of luxury which will render her more
                  liable to temptation than a person of a different organization. Besides, the
                  imperious blood of the Ernesti will show itself, and the desire to regain her true
                  rank in life will spring from the certainty that it is in her power to do so. Love
                  will be trampled under foot, as of
                  little worth in comparison with the distinctions which will court her acceptance.
                  Ah! you will see that I understand the riddle of this woman's nature."
               "I could almost hope that your predictions may prove false, Senor; but end as this
                  affair may, I have pledged my word to Count Ernesti to deliver a letter to his
                  daughter, in which he sets forth the only terms on which she will be received by
                  him. He allows her four months in which to make her decision, as the will of the
                  uncle from whom she derives her fortune provides that she shall be reinstated in
                  her rank, and the inheritance claimed within one year from the death of the
                  testator. Several months have already been consumed in vainly seeking her, and
                  when I arrived at his castle the count had almost given up the hope of reclaiming
                  her in time."
               "There are other heirs to contest the possession of this fortune, then?"
               "Only one; a nephew of Vivaldi, who is an officer in the French service, and is
                  now stationed at Bastia. Poor lad! it will be a sad disappointment to him, I
                  fancy, when he hears that the heiress has been found."
               "And what is the amount of the inheritance?"
               "Five millions of scudi."
               "So much! Then the affair is settled. No woman in her sane mind can hesitate in
                  such a choice as this!" said Evoli, decisively.
               "Yet I have an idea that this woman will do more even than that. If left to
                  herself, Clarice will remain true to her husband; and she will soon even cease to
                  regret the sacrifice she will be called on to make for the man of her choice."
               "We shall see," replied the Italian, with a slight curl of his handsome lip. We
                  are drawing near the point at which Guilio was to meet us, and before we join him
                  I wish to arrange with you the means of communicating with my friends in Italy. I
                  have with me a package I have prepared, and if you deliver it safely, I pledge
                  myself to reward the service at some future day in a manner befitting the power
                  and liberality of one born to my station."
               "I can ask no stronger pledge from one of your name, my lord," replied Barnardo,
                  deferentially. "Your commands shall be obeyed, and on my return hither I will
                  bring with me such replies as will show you that your friends have not played the
                  laggard in your service."
               "It is well. Where shall we meet without the knowledge of Guilio? You know the
                  entrance to the smuggler's cave, beneath the rocks a few miles south of the cove
                  in which your felucca lies."
               "Certainly; for I have often concealed contraband articles there; but it is
                  difficult of access, and is not often visited by us."
               "Come to it again, and leave my letters for me, if I am not there to receive them
                  myself. I will keep a look-out for your vessel, and if possible I will be on the
                  spot when you reach it."
               "I shall not forget, but if you can do so you had better meet me there. You know
                  the avenue leading to it from the hills?"
               Evoli nodded.
               "And of late I have used it to good purpose. You are on this coast every month, I
                  believe. Enable me to keep open the communication between us, and before the four
                  months named by Count Ernesti have passed away, you will bear back his daughter to
                  his protection. Her father will reward you nobly, and for myself, I pledge my
                  honor that you shall name the payment due from me for such good service."
               Barnardo reflected a few moments, and then said:
               
               "If the young countess goes of her own free will to place herself under the
                  protection of her father, I will undertake the service; but no force must be
                  used."
               Evoli proudly replied:
               "You mistake me greatly, Barnardo, if you suppose I would resort to such means. If
                  I cannot win the consent of Clarice to claim her birthright, she shall remain as
                  she is for me. It is but fair to her, however, to place before her all the
                  advantages she must sacrifice in relinquishing her rank, and I intend to be the
                  friend who will show her what she will gain in claiming it."
               "And you will win," involuntarily responded Barnardo, as he looked upon the
                  handsome face and confident expression of the speaker.
               "I believe so," was the tranquil response, and after a few more turns in the road,
                  they reached the point at which they were to meet Guilio. He and Marie were there
                  awaiting their arrival, and a cordial greeting passed between the four, in spite
                  of the treachery which had just been agreed upon between Evoli and his companion.
                  Guilio eagerly asked:
               "What news have you, Barnardo? Do you bring anything satisfactory to me and my
                  queen?"
               "I am the bearer of all I undertook to bring; but it may not prove very
                  satisfactory to you, my poor lad."
               Guilio changed color as he held out his hand, which perceptibly trembled.
               "Give me your letter," he faltered, "for I presume you have brought one. I will
                  wait to see Clarice before I learn the facts you have gathered."
               "It will be as well, perhaps. Here is the letter; it is important, I assure you,
                  and reveals a very strange tale."
               "It is one I wish could have remained untold," replied Guilio, with a constrained
                  smile, "but since my wife is so deeply interested in it, I must hear it, I
                  suppose."
               He took the package which Barnardo offered, saw that it was secured with a heavy
                  seal on which armorial bearings were impressed, and in spite of his efforts for
                  self-control, he became deathly pale as he said:
               "It is, then, as I feared; Clarice is the daughter of a noble house, and I—I—" his
                  voice died away in a husky whisper, and Marie Montoni took his hand, and loftily
                  said:
               "And you are the chosen of her heart, Guilio. Bear up—have courage; respect
                  yourself as a man, and all will be well."
               Her words inspired him with new courage, and he recovered his outward composure. A
                  few words sufficed to inform Barnardo of Marie's wish to be landed on the coast
                  near Isola Rossa, and the smuggler at once took her under his protection. After
                  arranging to return to the cove in three days for the answer of Clarice, the four
                  parted, and as Marie gave her hand to Evoli, she impressively whispered:
               "Be true to friendship and honor. Remember the warning of the sibyl that evil will
                  come to you, greater evil to her you seek, if you follow the thought that is in
                  your heart. I read and comprehend it, but if acted on, it will bring to you wo!
                  wo! wo!"
               She turned hurriedly away, and the Italian thought:
               "Confound the woman! One would think that she is echoing the refrain of one of
                  those terrible death-wails so popular in this blood-stained island. Idle words
                  have never turned me from my purpose, nor shall they now."
               "Shall we go on, Guilio?" he asked loudly, as he observed the absorbed air and
                  motionless form of his friend, who was leaning against a tree, as if he felt the
                  need of its support. He passed his hand vaguely over his brow, and muttered:
               "Go on? of course—of course. The car of Fate rolls on forever, crushing everything
                  in its way, then why should we stand
                  still upon the path appointed us? Tell me of your last cruise, Benedetto."
               Evoli dismounted, and threw the bridle of his mule over his arm, and as they
                  walked rapidly forward he gave his companion an amusing sketch of the life he had
                  led upon the lugger. Guilio scarcely listened to him, though at intervals a
                  hollow, forced laugh replied to his sallies—the package he carried in his breast
                  seemed to burn into his very heart, but with singular reticence he did not ask if
                  Barnardo had communicated to his friend the information he bore with him to
                  Clarice.
               Guilio was certain that Evoli was aware of the true station of his wife, yet he
                  would not ask it, for he wished to put off till the last moment the knowledge of
                  what he intuitively felt was to pain him so deeply, probably to prove fatal to the
                  happiness which had become so precious to him. This feeling did not spring from a
                  loss of confidence in Clarice, but his generous nature feared the magnitude of the
                  sacrifice she was called on to make for his sake, and when it was completed, how
                  should he ever be able to repay her for all she must surrender to share his
                  isolated lot?
               The conversation almost ceased before they reached the entrance to the cavern, for
                  each one became too deeply absorbed in his own thoughts to give further expression
                  to mere common-places. A warm greeting from the shepherd and his wife showed how
                  glad they were to welcome the blithe-hearted Italian again, and it was with some
                  effort that he at length escaped from them and entered the passage leading toward
                  the apartments of Clarice.
               As they passed through its dimly-lighted windings, Evoli repressed the tumultuous
                  throbbings of his heart, and composed his mobile features for the approaching
                  interview. He felt that he must betray none of the emotions that surged within
                  him, for it was all-important that Clarice should not prematurely suspect the
                  passion that thrilled in every nerve of his frame, and made him almost tremble at
                  the thought of again standing in her presence.
               He felt that there was a lack of delicacy in intruding himself upon the husband
                  and wife at such a crisis, but he could not resist the power that impelled him to
                  follow Guilio too closely to permit a word to pass between the two unheard by
                  himself. He must be present when that revelation was made, and watch the flitting
                  expressions of feeling which would sweep over the tell-tale face of Clarice, for
                  she was transparent as a child, and too impulsive to conceal any emotion that
                  strongly moved her. Yes—the tempter would read her heart at the moment this
                  brilliant destiny was offered to her acceptance, and judge of his own chances of
                  success to fulfill the pledge he had given Barnardo.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               AN IMPORTANT LETTER. HOW IT WAS RECEIVED.
               AS Guilio and his companion approached the cavern, a strain of soft music echoed
                  through the arches of the chapel, which came to these two enamoured hearts as a
                  melody from heaven. Clarice was singing a hymn to the Virgin which Evoli had
                  taught her during his last visit; she had no knowledge of music, and little skill
                  in execution; but her natural taste was exquisite, and her sweet, girlish voice
                  was full of tender pathos.
               Tears sprang into the eyes of Guilio, although he was not one to yield often to
                  the melting mood, but those of Evoli flashed with triumph as he thought:
               "She sings my melodies in my absence, though she has also learned
                  many from Marie."
               
               The chapel was faintly lighted, and the curtains were closed over the interior
                  apartment. As Guilio lifted them a flood of radiance flashed upon the two, and
                  they beheld Clarice seated upon a large chair in the centre of the floor; with
                  cushions piled upon it until it resembled a throne. She wore a becoming evening
                  costume—a delicate rose-colored muslin fell in soft folds around her form, with a
                  fall of fine lace upon the bosom and arms. The abundant hair was knotted
                  gracefully upon her neck, and a crown of flowers, woven together with much skill,
                  was placed upon her head. In her hand she carelessly held a sceptre also wreathed
                  with flowers, and a smile of radiant triumph rested upon her lips.
               The two stopped, spell-bound, and she gaily said:
               "Approach, my lieges, and offer due homage to the Queen of the Mountain. Guilio, I
                  greet you. Senor Benedetto, welcome again to our quiet retreat."
               Guilio seemed at once to enter into the spirit of the scene. He sprang gaily
                  forward, kneeled before the mimic royalty, and pressed his lips upon the hand she
                  extended, while murmuring his rapture at the grace with which she maintained her
                  assumed state.
               Evoli also approached, bowed his stately head, and sinking on one knee, took in
                  his own the hand which Guilio had relinquished. He lifted it to his lips, but he
                  did not touch it with them, for he feared that his passionate caress might betray
                  more than he cared to have suspected just now. As he arose he lifted one of her
                  long curls to his lips, and breathing through its silken sheen a repressed sigh,
                  said:
               "To the queen of beauty I gladly offer the homage of a faithful subject. Claim me
                  henceforth as your prime minister, or your slave. In either capacity I am ready to
                  serve you."
               "Thanks, my lord," she replied, with pretty coquetry. "I fairly warn you that I
                  shall prove the most exacting and capricious of mistresses. To dedicate yourself
                  to my service will be to possess no sinecure, I assure you."
               "So much the better, fair lady. To serve you is the sincerest desire of my heart,"
                  replied Evoli, in a low voice.
               "Thanks, Senor; with two such faithful knights as you and Guilio, I am more
                  fortunate than most queens, however genuine their claims to their rank may
                  be."
               This little scene struck Guilio painfully, and for the first time he contrasted
                  the singular elegance of Evoli's person and bearing with his own. He knew that he
                  was handsomer than most men, but he felt that when brought into comparison with
                  the Apollo-like form of Evoli, he was but an ordinary-looking person. He recalled
                  the words of Clarice concerning him, and the first pang of jealousy shot through
                  his heart. In a tone so grave as to be almost stern, he said:
               "You have then assumed this mimic state to receive the revelation I bring you. Ah!
                  Clarice, was it well so soon to show me the wide distance between us?"
               Clarice sprang from her throne, and casting her crown and sceptre at his feet,
                  exclaimed:
               "My Guilio, how wilfully you misinterpret my intentions. I only meant to show you
                  that, as your mountain queen, my station is loftier than any which fortune may
                  offer to my acceptance."
               "Pardon me, my best beloved! my angel of sweetness and goodness! I am a wretch to
                  doubt your devotion," and Guilio, penitent for the momentary suspicion, pressed
                  his lips to the cheek now pale with emotion, and wet with tears.
               "I forgive you," she faintly murmured, "and now tell me the result of your
                  mission."
               "Let me first place you on your throne, my queen, and restore the baubles of your rank; then I will
                  deliver the dispatches from our foreign correspondent, which, I am assured, are
                  most important."
               As he uttered these playful words, Clarice submitted to be placed amid a pile of
                  cushions, on one of which her crown and sceptre were thrown beside her.
               "Now I am quite ready to learn all that is to be told," she eagerly said. "Where
                  are my letters, Guilio? We have wasted time enough in this mimic royalty, which
                  after all you could not comprehend without an explanation. Where are my
                  letters?"
               "Your letters? True, they are yours, Clarice; then wherefore should I
                  feel annoyed that you so imperiously claim them? Here they are."
               He held the package toward her, with the seal turned down. Clarice scarcely
                  glanced at it, as she said:
               "You seem determined to misinterpret all I say and do to-day. Something strange
                  has come over you since you left me this afternoon."
               "Read your dispatches, and then, perhaps, you will see why I am in this state,"
                  replied Guilio, with emotion. He then more passionately went on: "Oh, Clarice,
                  darling of my life, promise me——Yet, no,—I will owe all to your love, or lose
                  all."
               "Guilio, you cannot doubt me!" and her voice had in it a faint
                  inflexion of irritation, that, after all, he could not implicitly trust to her
                  honor, even if love had less to say on so momentous an occasion.
               She cast her eyes upon the package which was addressed to "Guilio Falcone, to be
                  delivered to her who was lately known as Clarice Marcante." She flushed deeply at
                  this implied insult to Guilio; the writer would not even address her as his wife.
                  When she turned it, and saw the immense seal with the crest of a noble family
                  impressed upon it, she became very pale, but there was a gleam of proud triumph in
                  her eyes, while she breathlessly asked:
               "Is this indeed from my father?"
               "I believe it is. Open, and see what he says. This suspense is terrible to me;
                  though, alas! I anticipate the contents of that letter, and dread the effect they
                  may have on you."
               She regarded him reproachfully while she broke the seal, but for the next ten
                  minutes her face was worth studying even by one less interested in watching its
                  varying changes, than were the two who lost not a shade that swept over it—each
                  one desirous of putting an opposite construction upon her emotions.
               A folded paper addressed to Clarice, Countess Ernesti, met her startled gaze, and
                  she exclaimed:
               "Is it true? can this really be for me?"
               "You were really born to that rank, and you may reclaim it if you see fit to do
                  so," replied Evoli, with a smile. "Read, Senora, and learn on what terms your
                  lordly father will restore you to your birthright."
               "I shall also have terms to make," she said, with some hauteur. "My father has too
                  long deserted me to have strong claims upon me now. My own heart shall be the
                  arbiter of my destiny."
               Her eyes sought those of Guilio, and a glance of tender mutual affection caused
                  the heart of Evoli a sudden pang of doubt as to the result of all his
                  machinations.
               Clarice at length unclosed her letter, and with breathless interest, read the
                  following lines:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "CASTLE ERNESTI, October 20, 18—."
                           
                           "MY DAUGHTER:—At length I am permitted to address my long-lost child;
                              lost to me through no lack of care on my part, for you were very dear
                              to me in your infancy, in spite of my disappointment that an heir had
                              not been granted in place of a feeble girl. I recall you now, with
                              baby curls upon your brow, and with the clearest, softest eyes; during
                              many hours of my lonely life I have dreamed of that tiny image, and
                              yearned to know what had been its fate, with a hungering of the heart
                              for the love of my only child which at times was hard, hard to bear.
                              Yet have I lived through it; but when you see me, you will behold in
                              my saddened face, and prematurely whitened hair, evidences that I have
                              suffered deeply and bitterly from the wretched events of my early
                              life.
                           "My daughter, you will naturally ask why you have been permitted to
                              pass your childhood and early youth in the obscurity of a peasant's
                              cottage, while your station was lofty, and your natural gifts such as
                              might have filled a father's heart with pride. Blame me not for this,
                              my child, for until very lately I knew not whither to turn to seek
                              you. Your mother took pains to conceal you from me; but on my part,
                              there has been no desire to disown the child who bears upon her breast
                              the stamp of her race. The bloody cross is the heirloom of the
                              Ernesti, and you are the last descendant of my ancient house. Thus you
                              are doubly important to me as the child of my pride and my
                              affections.
                           "It is necessary to reveal to you enough of the past to enable you to
                              understand the anomalous position in which you are placed.
                           "Your mother was a daughter of the people; her family was respectable,
                              but not noble. Her beauty was transcendent, and fatally enamored of
                              that, I overlooked the fact that she was attached to one in her own
                              sphere of life. At the bidding of pride and vanity, he was cast to the
                              winds, for Ginevra Vivaldi could not resist the attraction of my
                              fortune and title, and in an evil hour for us both, she gave me her
                              hand.
                           "I soon saw that she was not happy. I fathomed the depths of her weak
                              nature and found there the image of my rival, a man of peasant rank
                              and little culture, for whom I had a sovereign contempt; yet this
                              woman, who was dearer to my soul than all else in this breathing
                              world, had endowed him with the royal gift of her affection.
                           "I had madly hoped to win them from him; that my devotion must meet
                              its fitting reward; but soon the wretched conviction was forced upon
                              me that she barely endured my presence; that the luxury with which I
                              surrounded her, was loathsome in her sight. For this she had sold
                              herself, and now it became her bitterest punishment; for amid the
                              leisure afforded her in my sumptuous home, she had time to dream and
                              to regret.
                           "I now know that I should have removed Ginevra to the city, and
                              plunged with her into the excitements of social life; thus she would
                              have learned to value the position I had given her, and have found
                              other employment for her vacant hours than thinking of the lover she
                              had relinquished.
                           "I would have done this, but the education of my idol was defective,
                              and my pride was such that I wished her to acquire certain
                              accomplishments, usually considered indispensable to a lady before I
                              introduced her to my friends. I wished her to become known to them
                              with all the charms of a highly cultivated and beautiful woman; but,
                              unfortunately, Ginevra possessed little natural taste for study, and I
                              believe my efforts to improve only wearied her.
                           "Whether the cause of our continued estrangement lay in myself, or in
                              the tenacious hold her early attachment still maintained over her, I
                              know not. I only know that the gulf between us widened, until even the
                              birth of our child could not bridge it over. In the passionate
                              outgushing of her heart over our babe, I saw that her nature was not
                                 cold. Oh no! only to
                                 me was the fountain of her affections sealed.
                           "Ah! it was gall and wormwood to me to behold her caressing thee,
                              unconscious infant, while I stood by yearning, hungering for one such
                              look, one such tone, as were so profusely lavished upon you.
                           "My daughter, I cannot tell you all the depth of that dumb agony, for
                              no soul can comprehend my suffering that has not felt it in all its
                              bitterness. To say that I adored this woman would be to speak in tame
                              and commonplace language of that to which no words may do justice. A
                              fiery deluge of rage, passion and despair rolled over my soul in those
                              hours of torture, but above it arose the certainty that she was the
                              only Eve, and if not my twin soul, earth held no other I cared to
                              win.
                           "One year we lived together—a year, every hour of which bore with it
                              some blissful hope or some blighting agony to my poor storm-tossed
                              heart. Yes, I did try to win her love, how unsuccessfully
                              you shall hear.
                           "Your birth afforded me a faint hope of final success, to which I
                              clung with the tenacity of despair, for I felt that this was my last
                              chance to gain a place in the heart of my child's mother. But soon
                              whispers came to me that Guiseppe, her former lover, had been seen
                              haunting the grounds around my castle—that a woman, whose size was
                              similar to that of the countess, had joined him, and walked with him
                              through the vine-covered alleys upon the hill-side. I was warned to
                              watch, and see for myself if this was my wife.
                           "How I lived through the day on which this information came to me, I
                              cannot now tell. It was one long dream of agony and suspense, but I
                              would not accuse my wife till I felt assured of her perfidy. It was
                              not my nature to act on bare suspicion; I must have
                              proof of the wrong, and then the spring of the enraged tiger is not
                              more deadly than would be my clutch upon the wretch that had injured
                              me.
                           "I concealed myself near the door which led to the terraced walks, and
                              watched for the appearance of the woman I had loved as man seldom
                              loves—who had been honored as the wife of my bosom, going forth to
                              meet one of whom now even to think with tenderness was a degradation
                              and a crime.
                           "Ginevra came slowly and wearily, not as one flying to meet the
                              beloved of her heart, but as a victim going to the sacrifice. I
                              stealthily followed her; I saw them meet—saw the accursed peasant
                              clasp her to his breast, and press his polluting lips upon her brow.
                              Then they walked beneath the shelter of the vines, and talked God
                              knows of what! I did not know, nor did I care to learn. For me it was
                              enough that my wife had so far violated her marriage vow as secretly
                              to meet this man, and thus keep alive in her heart the passion that
                              was destroying all hope of happiness in the union she had formed.
                           "I did not betray my presence to them; till I had matured my plan of
                              action, they should not know that I was aware of their perfidy. That
                              Ginevra should be separated forever from her lover, I was resolute,
                              and I took measures to secure his punishment as a bandit and a
                              murderer, for since her marriage with me he had become both. Another
                              meeting was arranged, of which I was duly warned by one I then
                              believed my friend; this time the countess took her infant with her,
                              to show the heiress of the Ernesti to her brigand lover. I suffered
                              her to pass to the place of meeting, for my measures were too securely
                              taken to apprehend defeat in the purpose before me.
                           "Ginevra had scarcely joined Guiseppe when I sprang upon him, and with
                              the assistance of my steward I mastered and bound him. I cannot dwell
                              upon what followed; suffice it, the bandit was delivered over to
                                 justice, and met the punishment due to his crimes against the
                                 State.
                           
                           
                           "Guiseppe was executed, and in the madness of that night on which his
                              fate became known to the countess, she fled from my home, carrying our
                              child with her.
                           "Every effort was made to trace her. For years I did not cease to hope
                              that she would yet return to me, but no sign came from her, and at
                              last I resigned myself in dumb despair to the loss of that I had most
                              valued on earth.
                           "I did not give up all hope of tracing you, my child, for you at least
                              I could call my own, and I possessed the right to claim you, even if
                              Ginevra refused to return to the home of her wedded lord. But for
                              seventeen long years all my efforts to recover you were baffled, and I
                              lived a disappointed, embittered, unhappy recluse.
                           "At last a ray of light dawned upon me. A clue to my child was gained,
                              and my old age would not be left desolate. How joyfully I hailed that
                              hope you cannot know, my Clarice, for you are young and untried in the
                              sorrows of life. How sweetly it looms before me as I write, assuming a
                              form of grace and beauty, with the pleading eyes and low-toned voice
                              of her I loved so fondly, you cannot comprehend.
                           "Oh, Clarice! if you disappoint me—if you refuse to come to me, I
                              shall sink into the apathy of despair. But you will not—you dare not.
                              After all I have suffered, this crowning disappointment will not be
                              added to the bitterness of my wasted life.
                           "A new impulse was given to my researches by the reception of
                              important news from a brother of your mother. Tomaso Vivaldi had
                              emigrated to the island of Barbadoes, where he accumulated a large
                              fortune in trade. At his death this was devised to my daughter,
                              provided she was acknowledged as Countess Ernesti within one year from
                              the day of his decease. Enclosed with the copy of the will, which was
                              forwarded to me, was an old letter from Ginevra to her brother. It was
                              dated from Isola Rossa a few months after her flight, and was written
                              from her death-bed.
                           "At her earnest entreaty Vivaldi had kept concealed from me the asylum
                              of my daughter, but it seems that he caused an annuity to be paid
                              anonymously to the woman who reared you, with the understanding that
                              you were to have such advantages of education as the town
                              afforded.
                           "Vivaldi had loved his sister very tenderly, and in his will her
                              daughter was named as his sole heir, provided I would also do my part,
                              and acknowledge the child so long severed from me as the heiress of my
                              name and honors. If this is not done before the expiration of the
                              year, the estate falls to the heir-at-law, a nephew of his own name,
                              to whose future he seemed indifferent, for he has left him only the
                              petty sum of five thousand scudi out of an estate of five
                              millions.
                        
                     
                  
               
               Clarice paused here, looked up from her letter, and exclaimed:
               "Oh, Guilio! only think! I am actually the heiress to an estate of five millions!
                  If I am to have all that money, I fancy I can do pretty much as I please. So, you
                  see, you need not look so doleful because of my good fortune."
               Guilio made an effort to smile, as he replied:
               "I trust it may prove so, Clarice; but go on with your letter. Your face is like a
                  mirror, for I can read in it every fluctuation of your feelings."
               Before he had ceased speaking Clarice was again buried in her father's epistle;
                  but soon the fair brow began to cloud, the red lips to compress themselves, and
                  her cheeks to flame or grow pale, as conflicting emotions alternately assailed
                  her.
               The letter continued thus:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "And now, my daughter, comes the painful part of my communication.
                              Reared as you have been, among people with whom my child
                              should never have been thrown, your ideas are probably confused as to
                              the relative positions of
                              the higher and lower orders of society. In fact, I have every reason
                              to suppose them rather democratic; this is the inevitable result of
                              your education, but it may be corrected in time.
                           "With inexpressible regret I have learned that you evaded the
                              unsuitable marriage arranged for you by your foster-mother, by eloping
                              with a person entirely unfit to match with one of your high rank and
                              brilliant fortune. I will say nothing disparaging of the young man to
                              whom you have given your hand, for he is the son of a gallant and
                              chivalrous chief, though, in fact, I can only regard him
                              as a generous robber, who took from the rich to relieve the poor. No
                              high-toned gentleman could live upon the contributions of others,
                              whether they were given voluntarily or exacted at the point of the
                              sword. I merely say this with reference to your deceased
                              father-in-law, to show you how impossible it will be for me to receive
                              his son as my own.
                           "I wish to be explicit, Clarice, for I cannot bear contention, and if
                              you elect to come to me it must be on my own terms. Only
                              as the acknowledged heiress of my house can you claim any portion of
                              the inheritance that has fallen to you, and I firmly refuse to claim
                              you as my child unless you come to me freed from all ties, and ready
                              to assume the brilliant position I offer you.
                           "Your marriage at this crisis was a great misfortune to both of us, as
                              it entails regrets upon you that might have been avoided, and gives me
                              the trouble of applying to the Pope for a special decree annulling the
                              ignoble alliance you formed while in ignorance of the high station to
                              which you were born. But of the last I do not complain, and I shall
                              immediately take steps to free you from the tie that binds you to
                              Falcone.
                           "Four months of the allotted year are yet unexpired, and by the time
                              they have run their course I confidently anticipate cipate seeing you
                              the ornament of my ancient halls, and the pride of my isolated heart.
                              Thus you will have ample time to discover that all for love and the
                              world well lost, is not a safe doctrine for those who are born to the
                              brilliant prizes in the lottery of life.
                           "Your fortune entitles you to match with the highest in the land, for
                              even a prince might take to his heart the drughter of the Ernesti
                              without feeling that he had made a misalliance.
                           "It is not my wish to outrage your heart, my daughter, for at your
                              impulsive age it is tender and truthful, but your dream of love can
                              only be a dream at best, and the last dregs of its sweetness will have
                              been exhausted before many months have passed away. Then be wise,
                              Clarice, and accept the brilliant future I offer you. If Guilio
                              Falcone really loves you, he will not stand as a shadow upon the path
                              which, but for him, would be one of unclouded prosperity.
                           "Write no appeals in his behalf to me. My nerves are too much shaken,
                              and my mind too firmly made up on this subject to harken to them. You
                              must come to me as my daughter, not as the wife of any
                              man, or you must decide to forfeit both rank and fortune. The world
                              shall never know that my child is found, if she is to become known to
                              it as the bride of an outlaw.
                           "You may think this hard and stern—perhaps it is, but I am what time
                              and isolation have made me, and if you refuse your gentle
                              ministrations to soften the nature which suffering has indurated, my
                              heart may wither, and hope decay in the stern penance to which I shall
                              devote the remainder of my days.
                           "Captain Barnardo has pledged himself to deliver this, and bring me
                              back your reply. Your first impulse will probably be to refuse every
                              offer that does not include a recognition tion of your husband's claims. I shall
                              expect that, and therefore your first reply will not be considered
                              final. That which reaches me four months hence I shall so regard, but
                              in the meantime I shall go on in my arrangements for the future as
                              regularly as if certain of finally reclaiming you on the terms
                              proposed.
                           "I will not permit myself to doubt this, for you are unlike your
                              mother if you are destitute of vanity and love of splendor; unlike
                              your father if you have no ambition lurking in the depths even of your
                              feminine nature.
                           "Adieu, my Clarice; write to me as to a friend who is deeply
                              interested in your welfare, and do not hesitate to express your
                              opinions even if they differ widely from my own, for I can recall my
                              own youth, and make every allowance for your feelings. Remember one
                              thing, though: that the love of no human creature is worth the
                              sacrifice of a whole life, and the humiliation and extinction of a
                              house which dates from the era of Rome's greatest power.
                           
                              "Your affectionate father,
                              "RINALDI ERNESTI."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Clarice looked up with flashing eyes and curling lip. Portions of the count's
                  letter had deeply moved her, but its conclusion hardened her heart against this
                  unknown father, and she clung more tenaciously to Guilio, because Count Ernesti
                  appeared to consider it impossible that she should remain true to the vows she had
                  plighted to him. She offered him the letter, and as he took it, she clasped his
                  hand in both her own, and looking pleadingly in his face, said:
               "It will wound you, Guilio, but my love shall heal the wound this hard old man
                  inflicts. Read Count Ernesti's letter, then burn it, and forget that it has been
                  written. I regret now that I cannot believe myself the daughter of Senora
                  Marcante. Noble birth is of little value if it forces one into mean actions. I am
                  required to make a decision in four months, but I make it now. I elect to remain
                  with the husband of my choice, and all else may go. If Count Ernesti continues to
                  refuse to receive you as his son, he must live without his daughter."
               Guilio rapidly ran his eyes over the closely written pages, and Clarice, in her
                  turn, watched the variations of his face; but it was better guarded, and did not
                  reveal as much as hers had done to his scrutiny. But over that portion which
                  referred to himself, his breath became short and his cheeks blanched, while his
                  hand involuntarily grasped the paper with a clutch of iron.
               At these indications Clarice drew near him, and leaning her head upon his
                  shoulder, whispered.
               "The scorn of the haughty father is more than balanced by the tender love of his
                  daughter. Guilio, mio, look kindly upon me, or I
                  shall believe that I have a share of your wrath against him."
               "Never! oh, my angel, you can never think that. What Count Ernesti says of me is
                  of trifling consequence, but the contempt with which he speaks of so noble a man
                  as my father stirs all the evil that is within me. Theodore Falcone maintained the
                  state of a free mountain chief with a degree of chivalrous honor that has never
                  been surpassed, and here he is called a robber! Ah! it is very hard to bear."
               "Then, do not think of it, my love. Let us burn the letter, and bury its contents
                  in oblivion; they only bring heart-burning where happiness has erected her
                  altar."
               "No, Clarice," responded Guilio, sadly. "We must not destroy this letter, for its
                  contents should be deeply pondered, and its offers weighed, before I can permit
                  you to decline the advances of your father. You must sacrifice too much for me to render my conscience easy if I
                  accept your first impulsive offer to relinquish your splendid birthright for such
                  a future as I can offer you."
               Clarice started away from him, all the fire of her nature at once aroused.
               "Then you are beginning to weary of me already. You wish me to accept the destiny
                  that severs me from you! Truly, I shall not forget this."
               Guilio seized her hand, but she withdrew it from him, and snatching up the crown
                  and sceptre which had been twined for so different a purpose, she threw them upon
                  the floor, and crushing them with her foot, said:
               "Thus perish the symbols of the mimic royalty which I would have preferred to any
                  state unshared by you. But you do not choose that I shall have that privilege; you
                  assume to be my lord and master, and you issue the decree that
                  separates us. Remember throughout all your future, that you refused
                  the sacrifice I offered you. Wealth, position, all sunk into insignificance in
                  comparison with the love I have felt for you, but you must consider my
                     interests, forsooth! Ah, well, senor, in what can I aid you after
                  I am restored to my birthright, or have you no ulterior ambition to serve? Or am I
                  cast off simply because you are tired of me?"
               This torrent of passionate words was poured forth so rapidly that Guilio could not
                  find breath to interrupt her. He had always known that Clarice was quick-tempered,
                  but he had never expected such a flash as this from lips that had hitherto only
                  breathed love and sweetness. But he saw that she misunderstood him, that she was
                  wounded to the soul, and he forgave her. He earnestly said:
               "You cannot seriously doubt my love for you, Clarice, nor can you believe that a
                  few brief weeks of perfect happiness can have rendered me indifferent to her who
                  bestowed it upon me. I consider you as pledged to remain with me under any and
                  every circumstance that may arise, nor will I waive one tittle of my just claims
                  as your husband, at the bidding of the greatest noble in the land. You are
                     mine, and while life lasts mine you shall remain. I refuse
                  to burn this letter, merely because I wish to keep it as a reference for facts
                  that may be imperfectly remembered. I cannot bear to strip you of both rank and
                  fortune, and perhaps a way may be found to preserve the latter, or at least as
                  much of it as may be necessary to us. Count Ernesti refuses to acknowledge you
                  unless you relinquish your allegiance to me, but we can offer to share your
                  uncle's fortune with the lawful heir, and unless he is a miser, he will not refuse
                  such a compromise. See, love, I do not consent to part from my precious pearl,
                  only to save it for a fitting setting."
               Truth and love beamed from his dark eyes, and Clarice subdued, ashamed of her
                  sudden burst of passion, placed both her hands in his as she penitently
                  murmured:
               "Forgive me, Guilio. You love me, then, as your soul, as your life, and I—"
               Overcome by her emotion, she bowed her head upon his breast, and burst in tears.
                  Guilio soothed her, and spoke such tender words as reassured her momentary doubt,
                  while Evoli looked on with anger filling his heart, though a cool, sarcastic smile
                  flitted over his handsome mouth.
               "Give me but three months in which to work my spells, and then we shall see how
                  much all these professions are worth," was his thought, but he spoke very
                  differently.
               "Dear friends, permit me to congratulate you on issuing from this trial as gold
                  from the refiner's fire. Such love is so rare on this planet, that Fate itself
                  should smile upon its continuance."
               Clarice lifted her tearful face and smiled upon him as she held out her hand.
               
               "Senor, you have witnessed our first quarrel and its reconciliation. Pardon us
                  that we were so absorbed in our own feelings as to forget the presence of a third
                  person."
               Evoli took the proffered hand, pressed it respectfully to his lips, and replied
                  with an air of chivalrous deference with which she was struck even at that
                  moment.
               "Senora, I am glad that I came hither at this time, for the scene I have witnessed
                  proves to me that in one woman's form, at least, dwells the spirit of an angel. My
                  friend Guilio is indeed a king, and his empire is that of a noble and true heart.
                  Your disinterestedness, your noble self-sacrifice, must be appreciated by him at
                  their full value."
               "Yes," said Guilio, proudly. "My Clarice has the ring of the true metal, and I own
                  that I doubly prize her since she has proved that love and true faith are of more
                  worth than worldly distinctions. Now let us soberly sit down and discuss the
                  count's letter, and the necessity of action on our part which arises from it."
               He again placed Clarice upon her cushions, and throwing himself beside her,
                  motioned to Evoli to occupy a divan in front of them.
               "Benedetto, we elect you our counsellor. You have seen more of the world than I
                  have, and you can probably afford me such assistance in this matter as will be
                  useful."
               "Speak your wishes, Guilio, and be assured that I am entirely at your
                  command."
               "Barnardo has doubtless informed you of all the facts concerning this inheritance,
                  which has at last reminded Count Ernesti that he had a daughter. Is it not
                  so?"
               "He did; but what can I tell you that the count's letter has not revealed?"
               "He alludes to the nephew of Tomaso Vivaldi, but affords no clue to where he is to
                  be found. Who is he, and where shall I seek him? Can you tell me that?"
               "I believe I can. Lieutenant Vivaldi is at this time stationed at Bastia, and a
                  letter addressed to him there will safely reach him. I think it very probable that
                  he will grasp at the hope of a compromise."
               "Then I will write immediately, and find a sure messenger to bear my proposal to
                  him."
               "That will be well. Confide your letter to me, and I will send it by one whose
                  fidelity I have before tested," replied Evoli, with tranquil assurance, for he
                  felt that the trustful nature of Guilio, and his entire confidence in himself,
                  placed his fate completely at his mercy.
               The offer was gratefully accepted, and Evoli soon after departed under the pretext
                  of sending for the person he wished to employ as a messenger; but in truth, he
                  could no longer remain in the presence of Clarice, and with unmoved features see
                  her tender eyes seeking those of Guilio, as if deprecating all memory of the storm
                  which had lately swept over them.
               For the present, he felt that the bond which united them had gained additional
                  strength, yet he believed that, with time and opportunity, he would surely sever
                  it. So long as Clarice clung to her husband, he would not complete the measure of
                  his intended treachery: at the moment she wavered in her allegiance to him, she
                  herself would strike the death-knell of Guilio. At the first indication of a
                  preference for himself, the fate of his rival would be sealed; Guilio could not be
                  permitted to live, for the terrible strength of passion breathed into his tones
                  and gestures when he claimed his wife as his own forever, showed Evoli that his
                  own safety could only be secured by the sacrifice of his former friend.
               In his career, Evoli had broken hearts, and trampled on tender ties, but hitherto
                  his hand had been unstained by blood, and his soul free from such treachery as
                  bans a man even in the unscrupulous
                  world to which he belonged. It would be wronging him to say that he did not shrink
                  a little from the part he had undertaken to play, and at moments he was ready to
                  fly from the deadly temptation, and permit these attached lovers to live alone for
                  each other.
               Then the enchanting form and face of Clarice would arise before him, and his blood
                  thrilled with the violence of the passion she had inspired. No—he could not
                  relinquish her. She must—she should be his. Such was his final
                  determination, and his mind once made up, no marble could be harder, no iron more
                  inflexible.
               He muttered as he rode along:
               "It was a shrewd thought of Guilio's to seek out the heir and divide the
                  inheritance, but I will baffle him there, as I will at every point. He is no match
                  for me in subtlety or power, and Clarice shall yet be mine. I love her madly, and
                  her hand will bring me the wealth I sadly need to fill my coffers.
               "Why should I hesitate? Fool! cast doubt to the winds, and grasp fortune at its
                  culminating point. What if one I once called friend, is crushed by my triumphant
                  chariot wheels? Is it not the history of life? One man sinks upon the road, and is
                  trampled in the mire, while another rises upon his ruin."
               Thus Evoli endeavored to stifle the last remains of principle and remorse, yet he
                  felt that the enormity of the crime he meditated against the man who had sheltered
                  him, who had confided in his friendship, could not be palliated by the utmost
                  sophistry of a nature skilled to deceive itself where self-interest was the
                  impelling motive.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               A FALSE FRIEND TRUSTED.
               LEFT to themselves, Guilio and Clarice renewed their tender protestations of
                  eternal fidelity, and both believed that nothing could ever again shake their
                  confidence in each other. At length, Clarice said:
               "Let us write our letters without delay; I do not wish to defer mine, though I
                  have not much to say to Count Ernesti in reply to his long epistle."
               "You remind me of my own duty, for I must write at once to Vivaldi; but there is
                  no need to hurry about yours. Barnardo will not return for your reply under three
                  days, so you had as well take time to think it over a little."
               "No—as I said before, not a day, not an hour, will I reflect on my decision. I
                  will write at once, and tell my lordly and indifferent father that I refuse his
                  name and station on the degrading terms offered me. That I will cling to my
                  husband through good and evil, and glory in sharing the fortunes of my Mountain
                  King."
               Guilio was enchanted with her spirit, as much as with her devotion to himself. He
                  replied:
               "Do so then, my darling; and be sure of one thing—that you have this day, by your
                  noble renunciation of fortune and station, for my sake, bound me to you with bonds
                  of iron strength. Now, I defy any one to separate us. Write your letter while this
                  fervor of feeling lasts, and Count Ernesti will comprehend that a tender woman's
                  heart is stronger than his pride, more immovable than the granite hills she
                  chooses as her home, in preference to his stately halls. My Clarice, my heart
                  exults in your devotion, and I accept the sacrifice you make, with the certainty
                  that it will never be regretted by your generous nature."
               
               "I can never regret what gives me entirely to you, Guilio;" and both expressed the
                  faith that was in them.
               Guilio brought out writing materials, and set himself to the unusual and rather
                  difficult task of composing a letter to Francesco Vivaldi, for he was not much in
                  the habit of writing to any one.
               Clarice, with the facility of her sex, soon accomplished her task, and brought the
                  result of her labor to be read by her husband, who ran over the following
                  lines:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "MY LORD AND FATHER—I have read your long letter with intense
                              interest, and I will own to you that portions of it moved me very
                              deeply. I mourned for your sorrows, and for a few brief moments
                              indulged the hope that I might be permitted to bring back joy to your
                              desolate life. But as I read on this hope was cruelly dashed, for you
                              coldly set before me the only terms on which I may be
                              received in my ancestral home.
                           "Those terms, my lord, are harsh, hard, impossible to be complied
                              with. Yes, my father, impossible, for my heart and hand
                              are equally pledged in the contract into which I have entered. It is
                              not my purpose to break it, for I love Guilio Falcone with all my
                              heart—I respect the memory of the father of whom you have so
                              contemptuously spoken, and I see no disgrace in the manner of his
                              life. Theodore Falcone fled from persecution, and assumed the state of
                              a feudal chieftain over willing vassals. If his course
                              was disgraceful, so also was that of the warlike barons from whom I
                              learn that I am descended.
                           "Of my husband I will only say that I love him, and he loves me, as
                              you once loved your adored Ginevra. Knowing this, ask yourself if we
                              are likely to give each other up at the bidding of caste and
                              cupidity?
                           "No, my lord; keep your name and fortune, if for them I must pay the
                              price of a broken heart and a dishonored marriage vow. Forget that
                              your long-lost child yet lives, since she is forever dead to you
                              unless you accept as your son the man to whom she has pledged her
                              life, her love, all that is dear to the heart of woman.
                           
                              "CLARICE FALCONE."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Guilio was charmed with this reply. He thought it could not be amended, and
                  Clarice, elated by his approbation, sealed and directed it at once.
               Guilio still continued to ponder over his task; excitement had wearied Clarice,
                  and she buried herself in her cushions to review the incidents of the day, and
                  reconcile herself to the dissolution of the airy fabrics she had unconsciously
                  been erecting during the past few weeks of her life. They had fallen in glittering
                  ruins around her, and the first crash had been so stunning that she had no power
                  to realize its effects. Obedient to her first generous impulse, she had felt all
                  she spoke to Guilio, but now the reaction came, and regrets bitter, though
                  unexpressed, filled her heart as she thought that with noble birth, wealth within
                  her grasp, she must yet be doomed to live in her mountain eyrie, because a stern,
                  proud father held her fate in his hand, and refused to yield her birthright except
                  at the sacrifice of her husband.
               She felt that Guilio was most dear to her, but her evil angel would whisper that
                  she had indeed paid dearly for him; the devotion of his whole life could scarcely
                  repay her for the immense sacrifice she had made; and the imperious nature which
                  was veiled beneath the charming grace of a beautiful and idolized woman, began to
                  assert itself into a power most potent for influence upon her future life.
               The world she had renounced arose before her in all its brilliant attractiveness
                  to the young and untried; in the halls of fashion and pride she might reign a
                  queen indeed, lapped in luxury, lulled
                  to forgetfulness of the past by the syren voice of flattery. All that civilization
                  has garnered of intellectual and artistic wealth was opened for her; things which
                  the native refinement of her soul rendered dear and precious to her, in spite of
                  her imperfect culture, might be hers but for the tie that bound her to Guilio. Ah!
                  why did her father not find and claim her before she became his wife? but having
                  now mingled her fate with his, it was too late to retract. Every feeling of honor,
                  as well as every impulse of affection, bound her to his side for ever. She must
                  content herself with the future she had voluntarily embraced, and she would do so;
                  but her heart sank at the prospect of life passed in those caverns, cut off from
                  social intercourse, her sole intimate companion a man who could not elevate her
                  above her present standard; for Clarice felt that much as Guilio loved her, he was
                  not her superior either in manners or acquirements, and the great need of her life
                  was to advance. She stood upon the threshold of fate, full of noble and true
                  aspirations, gifted with that power which in perfect development is called
                  genius—with an intense longing for the purest and most refined enjoyments of life,
                  yet when the door of the fairy temple was unclosed far enough to permit one
                  tantalizing glimpse within, it was suddenly closed by her own hand.
               Oh! hard fate! thus to be compelled to renounce what was so necessary to her
                  future well-being, and bitter was her resentment toward her relentless father for
                  forcing this choice upon her. A few burning tears were shed, but when Guilio
                  arose, and put aside his writing as if to rejoin her, she stealthily wiped them
                  away, and throwing her arm over her face pretended to be sleeping calmly.
               "Poor child," he murmured, as he knelt beside her, "she is exhausted by the
                  violence of her emotions, and like a tired infant has fallen asleep. Oh, Holy
                  Mary, who has given to my keeping this thy fairest daughter, enable me to be all
                  in all to her. Let her not regret the worldly distinctions she has renounced for
                  my sake; she gives up much, oh, holy Mother of God, and I pray thee to grant me
                  the power to repay her by such loving care as will render her happy."
               Clarice heard this simple, heart-felt prayer, and was deeply touched by it, but
                  she did not cast herself upon his bosom, and tell him how much she was moved. Two
                  natures seemed to be warring within her; the better one bound her to Guilio; the
                  baser one pointed to the brilliant future which might be hers if she could bring
                  herself to repudiate the tie that bound her to him. She shuddered as the
                  temptation assailed her, and put it aside, but the evil thought had found a place
                  in her heart, into which it would surely again intrude.
               Evoli returned in time for their usual supper of broccio and cream. He seemed in high spirits, and presently
                  said:
               "A bright thought has struck me, Guilio. I found Bandolo, the messenger of whom I
                  spoke, ill in bed, and as he cannot leave home for several days, I have concluded
                  to save you the annoyance of waiting so long, by going to Bastia myself. I have a
                  friend there who will receive and conceal me, and under the disguise I shall
                  assume I can communicate with Lieutenant Vivaldi with perfect ease."
               "Thanks, my dear Bendetto," replied Guilio, with animation. "This kindness is so
                  like your unselfish care for others; but are you sure that you are not going on
                  this journey solely on my account?"
               "By no means; for I assure you that I have business in Bastia that is important to
                  myself. Senor Baliera, the banker there, is my agent, and an old friend
                  besides."
               Guilio laughed frankly.
               "Yes—I comprehend the pressing nature of the business, and the sudden desire to visit your friend; but I
                  will not refuse your offer, Benedetto, mio; you
                  wish to serve me, and I will not disappoint you, for you are the best agent in
                  this affair that I could employ. Clarice and I give you carte blanche to make terms with Vivaldi."
               "I think I shall succeed in my object," replied Evoli, evasively. "At least
                  zealous efforts on my part will not be wanting," and the last scruple of
                  conscience vanished as Clarice sprang from her seat, and grasping his hand in both
                  her own, said, with the impulsive grace of her nature:
               "Oh, Senor, you are our good angel! In every emergency, you have proved yourself
                  the best and truest of friends. If we had only known this a few hours earlier,
                  Marie could have been the bearer of Guilio's letter, for she has also gone to
                  Bastia; or you could have accompanied her."
               "Perhaps it is well as it is," replied Evoli, quietly. "I can enter the town alone
                  without observation, but the escort of a person so well known as Marie Montoni
                  might have to account for himself to the authorities."
               "True—I had forgotten that you are an outlaw, though one not subject, thank
                  Heaven, to the Vendetta. Oh, Senor, when I think of all that happened on my bridal
                  day, I thrill and quiver with fear for Guilio's safety."
               "And for his alone? Are you not equally in danger, Senora?"
               "I did not think of myself, for when death reaches him I shall share it. Our fates
                  are one."
               "Count on more than one defender, Senora. Side by side with Guilio, would I
                  protect you with my life. But let us not speak on this sad subject; rather let us
                  discuss the brilliant prospects that open before you, and the use Guilio may make
                  of the fortune I go to secure for him, in placing you both beyond the reach of
                  Matra's family."
               "Can that really be done?"
               "Nothing is impossible to will and money. With the half of your uncle's fortune,
                  added to what Guilio himself possesses, you will be rich. He can change his name,
                  emigrate to France, and either in Paris, or in the country, lead such a life as
                  will be suited to your tastes."
               Clarice listened in an ecstacy of delight.
               "That is charming! We will live in Paris, by all means; and I will study music,
                  drawing, languages, and all other accomplishments in which I so ardently desire to
                  excel. We will also have a chateau for the summer, and Guilio can keep a yacht, in
                  which to make excursions to this spot at least once a year. Oh, yes—I have been so
                  happy here, that I must always love it best of any place on earth."
               A faint cloud passed over Evoli's face, but he replied, with a smile:
               "You have the aspirations of a princess, Senora. The half of your fortune, if
                  saved to you, will scarcely enable you to keep up two establishments in France; as
                  expensive a toy as a yacht, and a third home among these hills. To possess all the
                  grandeur your tastes covet, you must reconsider your father's offers."
               "That I will never do," replied Clarice, with an expression of hauteur. "I am only
                  surprised that you should refer to them, after what you witnessed here
                  to-day."
               "Pardon me, Senora, I spoke without thought. Behold in me not only the humblest of
                  your servants, but the most devoted of friends."
               "We comprehend that, Benedetto," said Guilio, a little curtly, for he began to
                  think his comrade rather too profuse of offers of service to his bride. Evoli read
                  the feeling, and instantly checked himself. He turned calmly toward the speaker
                  and asked minute directions for the successful transaction of the important
                  mission he was about to undertake.
               
               Guilio confided to him the letter he had written, and also gave him such
                  credentials as would prove beyond a doubt that Evoli was the agent appointed by
                  himself to arrange this business. Clarice wrote a few hurried lines to Marie,
                  begging her to return as soon as possible, as she already found the cavern lonely
                  without her, and she dreaded to look forward to the days when Guilio must leave
                  her alone in these vast echoing chambers, to assume the command of his lugger.
               These things settled, Evoli laid aside all business cares, and played the part of
                  the cultivated and elegant gentleman. His varied information, fine colloquial
                  powers, and light gaiety combined, formed a manner unrivalled for its fascination;
                  and both his companions were equally charmed with him. At Guilio's solicitation he
                  sang, and his fine voice floated away among the caverned halls, and came back in
                  broken echoes of sweetness, as if the imprisoned spirits of the air had suddenly
                  been aroused from their silence to answer each other in snatches of melody.
               At length he arose to take his leave, saying that he should depart at early dawn,
                  and within a week he hoped to return with a good report of his success. Wishing
                  him God speed upon his journey, the lovers parted from him with perfect confidence
                  in his good faith, and Clarice resolved to content herself as well as possible in
                  the interval; for the lure held out to her by the wily schemer, of a residence in
                  Paris, had operated as he had hoped, and intended it should. This evanescent hope
                  quenched, a vague discontent must arise in her mind, and then his spells must, in
                  time, work their fulfilment. The web he was slowly but surely weaving around her,
                  should bind, at first, by threads of gossamer, but in the end prove fetters of
                  steel, from which she could no more escape than can the bird once lured from the
                  greenwood bough to shelter itself in the cage prepared for it.
               As Evoli went forth he stopped in the upper cave, where he found the wife of the
                  herdsman awaiting him. A smouldering fire burned in the circle of stones
                  appropriated to it, and a feeble lamp, whose light only served to render the vast
                  extent and dreariness of the place more visible, flickered near her. Evoli
                  approached quite close to her before the woman was aware of his presence; Lisa sat
                  with her hands strongly clenched together, and in the eyes that were bent upon the
                  dying fire, burned a spirit as fierce and quenchless as the element on which she
                  gazed, when it is unchained and sweeping onward in its might. He paused and keenly
                  surveyed her, and the feelings that were surging through her heart were as legible
                  to him as the page of an open book, and he smiled with triumph as he read them.
                  When he at last spoke, Lisa started and turned toward him with the fierce gesture
                  of a tiger suddenly aroused from slumber.
               "So, Lisa, you did not fail me. I thank you for your punctuality."
               "And well you may, Senor," she gloomily replied, "for I had a world of trouble to
                  get away from Angelo and the child. My husband is sleeping now, but if he should
                  awake and find me gone, I should find it hard to account for coming back to this
                  place at so unusual an hour."
               "Tush! tell him that the goats were fighting, or something had not been attended
                  to. You're no true woman if you cannot find an excuse that will satisfy a
                  good-natured dullard like Angelo."
               "Perhaps I might," said Lisa, with sombre contempt, "for he is good, and has faith
                  in me, although I am plotting to deceive him. But dull as he is, Senor, if he
                  fathomed our plans, he would kill us both."
               "Ah, that is supposing an extreme case. He will not fathom
                     my designs, nor yet will he have the chance to destroy either of
                  us. I will make your fortune, and his too, if you will only serve me faithfully. You have thought on
                  all I said to you, and you agree to aid me so far as lies in your power?"
               For a few moments the woman seemed buried in a gloomy reverie, she at length
                  said:
               "I know that I risk everything to obey you, but the temptation is irresistible. I
                  am weary of this hard life. I wish to escape from it, and I see no justice in the
                  fate which makes me a slave, and her a dainty creature to be served
                  and waited on as if she were indeed a princess. I believe I almost hate her."
               She pointed in the direction of the interior cavern, and a thrill of apprehension
                  shot through the heart of the listener as he saw the baleful fire in her deep
                  black eyes, but he lightly said:
               "This is nonsense, Lisa. What has Guilio's bride done to arouse such bitter
                  feeling on your part?"
               "What has she done?" repeated the woman, in a tone of intense bitterness. "She has
                  stepped between me and my foster-child; she has made him regardless of everything
                  but her caprices, her comfort. She has rivalled my daughter, who is still in her
                  convent completing the education which I fondly hoped would make her his equal and
                  his wife. See—is not this enough to make me hate her? Then she treats me as a
                  menial—she talks only with the half crazy woman that went away to-day, and thinks
                  I am well repaid for all my services by a few words of thanks."
               "Well, well—things will mend now. Marie is gone, and your turn has come. You will
                  be with her more, and you will begin to understand each other better."
               "I understand her well enough already. She is a vain little butterfly, with no
                  thought but for her own fantasies, no fitness for the wild life she has adopted.
                  How long do you think she will be contented to live in that place you fitted up
                  like a palace, and deck herself in the finery you placed there for her use?"
               "Not very long, I trust, and in that lies your hope, too. Listen, Lisa, and with
                  your usual intelligence comprehend how necessary we are to each other in this
                  business. When Clarice wearies of her mountain life, I will, with your assistance,
                  bear her far away from this spot, and your daughter can assume the place she now
                  holds."
               A flash of exultation shone in the eyes that were turned upon him; she said:
               "You, Senor? She loves Guilio, then how can that be accomplished?"
               "Leave that to me. I will answer for the end, if you will aid me in the
                  beginning."
               "And Guilio? Will he be unharmed? Will you answer for his safety?"
               "He shall be well cared for; have no fears for him," replied Evoli, with apparent
                  frankness. Guilio is my friend; he has sheltered and befriended me; therefore he
                  is only to be released from his wife when she ceases to regard him as the dearest
                  of creatures. Indifference always follows passion, and the love on which such
                  large drafts are made will quickly exhaust itself. Clarice shall reign in my
                  palace, while the fair Gulietta assumes her place here in the heart and home of
                  the mountain chieftain."
               "In your palace, Senor? Then my suspicions are true, and you are a man of
                  rank?"
               "Well, yes—I spoke thoughtlessly, but I confess that I am of a higher station than
                  you probably suppose. To men like me, no barrier is too high to be overleaped. To
                  will and to do, to wish and to possess, is our birthright; so now are you ready to
                  serve me?"
               "At any and all times," was the prompt reply, and Lisa held out her hardened,
                  toil-worn hand to seal the compact.
                  Evoli took it in his slender white one, and held it firmly as he said:
               "Then when my myrmidons come to seize upon my prize, and bear her
                  away, you will give no alarm. You will place over the entrance of the concealed
                  passage a mark which will point out to them the exact spot, that not a moment of
                  precious time may be lost."
               "But if the sbirri discover the entrance, we shall never be safe again," she
                  cried.
               "Tush! I shall not send the sbirri on this errand. The men who come hither will be
                  friends of my own, who will return with me to Italy. Your seclusion will be safe
                  as ever for they will be sworn to secrecy."
               After a pause, Lisa slowly said:
               "In that case, I may safely promise. Yes, if you will take far from me the fair
                  face that has bewitched my Guilio, I will do as you wish."
               "Then it is understood, but you must breathe no hint to Angelo."
               "Ah, he would destroy me if he only suspected me of such treachery! I dare not let
                  him know, and even now I risk much in staying here so long. Hark! what sound was
                  that?"
               They listened an instant, and Evoli said:
               "It is nothing; but it is time that we should part, lest Angelo should awake and
                  miss you. In three months you shall be mistress here again."
               "Three months? That is a long time, Senor."
               "They will soon pass away, and you will see me often. When the time for action
                  arrives, I will warn you in time to prepare you for the part you must play. At
                  dawn I leave, but I shall shortly return to use all my arts to accomplish your
                  wishes and my own. Addio, my good Lisa, and
                  consider your fortune as made."
               Evoli moved lightly away, but the woman, forgetful of her recent terror lest her
                  husband should discover her absence, sat cowering over the fire, indulging in
                  sombre memories, and maturing future plans.
               Lisa had been twice married, and at the time that Theodore Falcone perished, she
                  lived among the hills as the wife of a small farmer. Her husband had often acted
                  as one of Falcone's inferior agents, and when the broken health of his widow
                  compelled her to seek a nurse for her infant, the charge was confided to Lisa,
                  whose daughter was then only a few months old. After the death of his mother,
                  Guilio remained under her care until he attracted the notice of Count Rospoli, who
                  then took upon himself the charge of educating and protecting him.
               Lisa loved the boy with passionate fondness, though her violent temper prevented
                  her from making his childhood happy. With extreme reluctance she gave him up,
                  though she was not separated from him. The convent into which he was received as a
                  pupil was in the vicinity of her cottage, and Guilio was often found beneath its
                  shelter. The attraction that drew him thither was his foster-sister, a dark-eyed
                  gipsy, full of life and passion, who alternately pouted at or petted him.
               Lisa's husband was now dead, and it became the dream of her life to see those
                  children united when they arrived at years of maturity, though she was politic
                  enough to conceal her wishes from the parties most interested in them. Guilio did
                  not fall in love with Gulietta, but she conceived for him one of those passionate
                  attachments known only to people of southern blood in all their vivid power. Lisa
                  was left with very limited resources, but she toiled night and day to gain the
                  means of educating her daughter in such a manner as to fit her to become the wife
                  of her favorite.
               Gulietta was placed in a convent to be instructed, and the poor widow almost denied herself the means of
                  living to keep her there. At length Guilio spurned the control of his patron, and
                  took possession of his mountain strong-hold. He proposed to his foster-mother to
                  take charge of his housekeeping, and she readily consented to do so; but to her
                  extreme disappointment, he did not extend the invitation to Gulietta, who still
                  remained in her convent.
               A few weeks after her establishment at the cavern, Lisa married the herdsman,
                  Angelo. She managed everything to suit herself, and looked forward with certainty
                  to the future establishment of her daughter as the mistress of the eyrie and its
                  master. How suddenly this dream was dispelled by the announcement of his intended
                  marriage, how bitterly she resented preparations for the reception of his bride,
                  made on a scale of elegance of which she had never before dreamed, it is needless
                  to relate.
               From the hour in which she first looked on Clarice, she hated her, and the fond
                  devotion of Guilio only added bitterness to her dislike. Her daughter, in place of
                  assuming the position of Mountain Queen, was forced to remain in her convent, and
                  accept the humble position of a lay-sister till something better offered
                  itself.
               Gulietta wrote bitter and passionate reproaches to her mother for not better
                  guarding her interests; and every word thus uttered only added intensity to the
                  dislike of Lisa for her new mistress.
               Clarice felt the repulsion, and made some efforts to overcome it; but finding that
                  they were treated with a degree of coldness bordering even upon contempt, she
                  assumed the privilege of her superior station, and treated Lisa with the distant
                  civility which marks the intercourse of high-bred natures with those they consider
                  as their inferiors.
               This was adding insult to injury, and the quick temper of Lisa resented the
                  assumption of Guilio's wife to rule over his foster-mother as her mistress. Thus
                  the way lay open to the tempter, and he was not slow to avail himself of it, as we
                  have seen.
               When Lisa at length arose and prepared to retire, she had made up her mind to the
                  course she would pursue.
               "Yes," she muttered, as she slowly wound her way to her own portion of the cave,
                  "now the mad woman is gone, I will send for Gulietta to help me, for there is more
                  to do than I can attend to. Together, we shall be more than a match for this poor,
                  silly, white-faced thing that Guilio was mad enough to prefer to my bright-eyed
                  darling. Ah, yes—Gulietta shall be Queen of the Mountain yet."
            
            
               CHAPTER XIX.
               AN UNEXPECTED REVELATION.
               IN spite of the understanding between Vivaldi and the parents of Lucille that he
                  was still to be considered as the betrothed of their daughter, Madame Villeray
                  contrived to render the position of the lovers as wretched as possible. She
                  treated Francesco with the coolest contempt, laughed at his claims upon her
                  daughter, and proclaimed everywhere in society that the marriage would certainly
                  never take place. M. Villeray had antique notions of honor, and he insisted that
                  loss of fortune did not entitle them to repudiate the tie they had so lately
                  sanctioned, but time works wonders, and it must soon convince even him that people
                  could not live upon nothing, or next to it. Ergo, Vivaldi and Lucille must give up
                  their insane notion of marrying for love.
               Madame Villeray forced her daughter into society, and encouraged the renewal of attentions on the part of
                  her old admirers. They were not slow to take the hint, for the lovely young French
                  girl was greatly admired among the cavaliers of her set, and poor Lucille, with
                  sinking hopes and a preoccupied heart, was doomed to the persecution of listening
                  to flatteries that were odious to her, while, at the same time, they rendered
                  Vivaldi jealous and wretched.
               Her position was a very trying one, for it required all her efforts to keep peace
                  between her mother and her lover, while her own heart was torn with anxious doubts
                  and fears as to the future that lay before her. The exact circumstances in which
                  her family were placed were pitilessly paraded before her by her mother; the utter
                  destitution in which they might be left by the sudden demise of M. Villeray, was
                  dilated on at length, until the poor girl grew half wild over the dismal
                  possibilities of the future.
               In addition to this, the expensive trousseau which had been ordered for the
                  intended bride of a millionaire arrived, and with it the enormous bills which were
                  expected to be at once discharged. This was the more resolutely insisted upon by
                  the agent, as Mademoiselle Villeray no longer had such brilliant prospects before
                  her. It was nothing to him that the trousseau might not be needed at all, it must
                  be paid for all the same, and the utmost resources that M. Villeray could command
                  barely enabled him to settle for all this finery which would now be worse than
                  useless.
               The boxes were brought home, and Lucille sighed and wept over the charming
                  toilettes in which she might have been so beautiful and so happy, had not a
                  perverse fate thwarted her hopes. Her mother was alternately in ecstacies of
                  delight over the exquisite dresses, and of despair that their fashion would have
                  passed away before they could be put to their legitimate use. She consoled
                  herself, however, with the thought that the jewels, laces and linen would still be
                  as fresh as ever, and whenever her daughter did marry, these things would not be
                  again to provide.
               Madame Villeray never wearied of inspecting these feminine treasures, and morning
                  after morning was spent in looking them over, and criticizing the taste of the
                  milliner, who had really spared neither expense nor skill in the selection of a
                  trousseau worthy of so lovely and fortunate a bride as the betrothed of a
                  millionaire was, of course, supposed to be.
               Lucille listened with a sick heart, and almost loathed the sight of follies which
                  she knew must so severely tax her father's slender resources. In the weeks that
                  had elapsed since her chateaux en Espagne had
                  been shattered, she had grown listless and indifferent. She passively opposed the
                  resistance of a tenacious will to the evident intentions of her mother, but she
                  was so quiet in her opposition that Madame Villeray thought her on the point of
                  yielding to the force of her constantly repeated arguments against the folly of
                  maintaining an engagement which could never be fulfilled, even when every emotion
                  of her daughter's heart rose up in rebellion against her worldly maxims.
               Lucille knew that it would be useless to argue with her mother. She would go
                  around a circle, and come back precisely to the point from which she had started.
                  There are people who never listen to the reasons of others when they clash with
                  preconceived opinions of their own, and Madame Villeray was of this class.
               She was now standing in front of her daughter's mirror, trying the effect of a
                  magnificent head-dress which had been sent for her own use. Lucille was gazing
                  dreamily through an open window which commanded a view of the bay, and as the sun
                  flashed upon the restless waters, she thought of that morning beneath the lime
                  trees where she had been so happy, of the change that so suddenly came over her young life, just as a cloud
                  was now sweeping up from the horizon, soon to overshadow the bright promise of the
                  day.
               Her mother's voice aroused her from her reverie, and she turned to see her bed
                  covered with dresses, and Madame Villeray, with a gathering storm upon her brow,
                  exclaiming:
               "I declare it is shameful of that modiste! She has sent me a cap that is exquisite
                  to hold upon the hand and examine, but its effect upon the face is dreadful. Look!
                  It makes me some ten years older than I really am."
               Lucille saw at once that the extreme delicacy of the ribbons and flowers no longer
                  harmonized with the faded features of her mother, but she possessed too much tact
                  to say so. She quietly removed the soft spring flowers, substituted roses of a
                  deeper tint, and then replaced it upon her mother's head. Madame Villeray was
                  enchanted, called her a fairy, and then actually kissed her. Lucille returned the
                  caress, and turned again to the window, but her mother peevishly said:
               "I wish you would attend to what is going on around you, Lucille, and not stare
                  out of the window in that half-demented way. We must attend Senora Baliera's ball
                  to-morrow night, and I wish you to select one of these dresses to wear. I am
                  really sorry that the bridal robe is ornamented with orange blossoms, or you could
                  appear in that. It will be long enough before it can be put to its legitimate use,
                  and it is too beautiful to be laid away to grow yellow with time and neglect."
               These words thoroughly aroused the young girl, and with flushing cheeks and
                  tremulous voice, she said:
               "Can you suppose that I will ever permit that dress to adorn me
                  unless I wear it as the bride of Francesco? Truly, I must have fallen very low in
                  your opinion, ma mère, if you think I can be
                  induced to parade myself at a ball in the robe consecrated to so different a
                  use."
               "Stuff! nonsense! You have all your father's high-flown notions about life and
                  conduct. Here is a charming wardrobe; you are a young girl in society, without the
                  means of providing another. The things are paid for, and must be worn, so it is
                  useless for you to attempt to play the heroic about them. If you do not choose to
                  wear the bridal robe just yet, here are others. This rose-colored crape, with
                  these emeralds, will be lovely, and they just suit your style."
               "But I do not wish to go to the ball. I have already been forced to go out many
                  times when my heart recoiled from it. Francesco does not like it, and my father is
                  so lonely when we are away."
               "Nonsense! Your father retires to bed at ten, and we seldom leave home before that
                  hour. As to M. Vivaldi, I am not particular about pleasing him. The sooner he
                  understands that everything between you must come to an end, the better it will be
                  for you both."
               "But he does not intend to understand anything of the kind, neither is it my
                  intention to permit him to do so. I have promised you never to marry Francesco
                  without your consent, but I have not consented to give him up."
               "They are equivalent to each other, you ungrateful child, for I will
                     never consent to give your hand to a man whose sword is his only
                  fortune."
               Lucille sat down with a resigned air. She had said all she considered necessary at
                  the present moment, and she did not wish to exasperate her mother by any further
                  display of feeling. She knew her own resolution to be immovable, and she could
                  wait till a fairer prospect opened to her lover.
               At that instant the door unclosed, and Madame Villeray's maid said:
               "Madame, there is a visitor with M. Villeray, and he requests that both you and
                  Mademoiselle will come down immediately."
               
               "A visitor, Rosetta? Is it a gentleman or a lady?"
               The girl hesitated as if uncertain how to class the individual referred to.
               "It is a tall, dark woman, madame, wrapped in the ugly black thing the women of
                  this island are so fond of wearing. M. Villeray seemed very glad to see her."
               Lucille started up with animation, and exclaimed:
               "It must be Marie Montoni, and by a singular coincidence I have been thinking of
                  her all the morning. I will go to her at once."
               Madame Villeray did not seem greatly pleased—she coldly said:
               "I hope that half crazy creature has not really come back, to put more fantastic
                  notions in your head than you already have there. Ah! there you go, without
                  stopping to listen to me. If it was one of my friends, you would not
                  be in such a hurry to welcome her."
               The last words were unheard by Lucille. She was already out of the room, and in a
                  few moments was in the library with Marie in her arms, for the young girl had
                  known the poor wanderer in brighter days, and during the darkest hours of her life
                  M. Villeray had been her firm and unfailing friend.
               "Dear, dear Marie, how glad I am to see you again! How long you have been away,
                  and how worn you look."
               "And you, my pretty white rosebud, look as if the sunshine has not visited you of
                  late," replied Marie, holding Lucille off, and gazing into her fair face with an
                  expression of solicitude. "I dreamed that something has happened here to make you
                  unhappy, and I came to see if it is so."
               "As visionary as ever, Marie," said M. Villeray, with a forced smile. "Do not
                  begin to sympathize with Lucille, or she will believe that her old father has
                  wronged her, though God knows he has acted for the best."
               "Then there is something wrong, and Lucille does not look so pale
                  without cause. Oh! is happiness to be found upon this earth? Must blight and
                  disappointment fall on all its children? My sweet Lucille, I trusted, might escape
                  the doom of her sex, for if the evil of the father shall be visited upon his
                  children, surely the good he has done should also descend on them as a blessing.
                  If this were so, how richly dowered with happiness and good fortune
                     your child should be, M. Villeray. Kind friend, my heart has
                  folded in its deepest recesses the memory of all you did for me when life was
                  dark, and hope lay dead within me."
               "No more of that, Marie. I only did for you what any man worthy of the name would
                  have done in my place. I trust that happiness and good fortune will indeed attend
                  my darling Lucille, for they are likely to be the only dower she will possess.
                  Come, sit down, and tell us of yourself. Where have you been wandering all these
                  months, and why have you kept away from your old haunts so long?"
               Marie still gazed wistfully upon the face of her young favorite, but Lucille
                  smiled brightly, and the flitting color that gleamed upon her fair cheek partially
                  reassured her friend. She accepted the offered seat, and commenced a rambling
                  account of her late adventures. They were of little interest to her hearers, until
                  she came to the marriage and subsequent elopement of Clarice from Isola Rossa.
               With a few graphic touches, Marie described the romantic home of the newly-wedded
                  pair, and dwelt on the devotion which led them to believe that life could be
                  contentedly passed together in the solitude of their mountain fastness. Lucille
                  listened with eager interest, and tears filled her eyes as she said.
               "It is beautiful. It is noble. Oh, I trust that no cloud will ever come between
                  these two faithful hearts. The vendetta will surely not be permitted to reach
                  them."
               
               Marie shuddered.
               "I saw the mother of Matra as I passed through Isola Rossa, and she thinks
                  vengeance has already been too long delayed. She is wild to gain a clue to
                  Guilio's retreat, and take not only his life, but that of his bride. She offered
                  me a large bribe to betray the secret of their retreat to her kinsmen, that they
                  may invade it and wreak their vengeance upon its inmates."
               "It is a dreadful state of society in which such things are tolerated," said M.
                  Villeray, gravely. "In some of their habits, I am afraid, the Corsicans are half
                  savage yet. But what became of the family of this young girl, and how have they
                  escaped the fury of Matra's relatives?"
               "That is the most singular and romantic portion of the story. To save herself and
                  her children, Dame Marcante was forced to confess that Clarice is not her
                  daughter. This she proved to the satisfaction of Matra's family, and thus was
                  freed from the blood-vengeance."
               "Romantic, indeed! Since the bride was not her child, to whom then did she
                  belong?"
               To the surprise of her two auditors, Marie suddenly asked:
               "Do you remember the handsome lieutenant of hussars, who used to admire you so
                  much, Lucille? With Senor Vivaldi the fate of my friend Clarice is singularly
                  linked."
               Lucille became very pale, as she faltered:
               "Then your friend is the long lost cousin of Francesco. Yes, yes, it must be
                  so."
               Marie fixed her penetrating glance upon her.
               "Then you know this story? You call this young man Francesco; I see it now. You
                  favor his suit, but fortune frowns upon you. Hope is not dead, Lucille, and the
                  flower of your love may yet revive beneath the revivifying influences of a golden
                  shower."
               "When the shower falls, it will be time enough to consider that question," said
                  the sharp voice of Madame Villeray, who had entered the room unperceived.
               Marie arose and received her welcome, which was given as coldly as politeness
                  would permit. When they were again seated, Madame Villeray said:
               "What is this about Lieutenant Vivaldi? Do you know the cousin who has come
                  between him and his fine inheritance? What sort of a person is she? Will it not be
                  the best thing the young man can do to go and marry her at once?"
               "She is already married, Madame; but Clarice is noble and generous by nature, and
                  I am sure she will act a liberal part toward her kinsman if she should claim the
                  inheritance."
               "If she claims it," repeated Madame Villeray, with a sneer. "I fancy
                  there cannot be much doubt about that?"
               "But in this case there is much doubt, Madame. The father of Clarice refuses to
                  acknowledge her unless she gives up her husband; this, I am sure, she will never
                  do, so Lieutenant Vivaldi may yet claim his uncle's fortune."
               At these words Lucille clasped her hands so warmly, the cloud of care so visibly
                  cleared from the brow of M. Villeray and Madame looked so astonished and pleased,
                  that Marie needed no words to enlighten her as to the state of affairs. She
                  said:
               "My news affords you happiness, though I little dreamed that you had a vital
                  interest in it when I began to relate this strange story."
               Lucille leaned her head upon her shoulder, and whispered:
               "You have brought back life and happiness to me, Marie. When we are alone, I will
                  tell you all."
               M. Villeray audibly said:
               "Thank God for all his mercies;" and his wife fluttered about the room in a state of excitement she could
                  not control. She at length said:
               "Who would believe in such madness? The girl will never have strength to refuse
                  the brilliant future that Count Ernesti can offer his daughter. Francesco will not
                  gain the inheritance—no, never. Marie, tell me again your grounds for this
                  Quixotic belief of yours."
               Marie went over the history of the attachment between Guilio and his bride, and
                  repeated her own conviction that Clarice would remain true to her plighted faith,
                  in defiance of temptation.
               When she paused, Madame Villeray drew a long breath, and said:
               "I trust it may prove so, for the sudden change in Senor Vivaldi's prospects has
                  brought much misery into my family. My daughter has almost rebelled against me,
                  though I have only done what prudence absolutely demanded of me as a good mother.
                  Francesco will probably call today. Send word to the porter to admit him, Lucille;
                  and now I think of it, he has not had a tête-a-tête with you for some time. I believe I will relax my
                  vigilance a little, and permit you to sit under the lime trees as you did before
                  the news came that his cousin had been found. If this young girl chooses to throw
                  her good fortune away, it places Vivaldi exactly where he stood before her
                  existence was ascertained. I am sorry that I did not comprehend that affairs might
                  take this turn; but who could believe that a woman who will give up rank and
                  fortune for love could have been found in this world?"
               "Ah, Madame, all women are not to be judged by the same standard," said Marie,
                  with unconscious severity. "There are natures so noble that the sacrifices they
                  make are not considered as such by themselves, though the rest of the world may
                  look on in astonishment."
               "I am glad that I do not belong to that class of simpletons," replied Madame
                  Villeray, rather brusquely. "People that live in the world, and have a position to
                  maintain, do not throw away their best chances in life as this wilful countess
                  seems ready to do. I think that she will yet find that she has sold her birthright
                  for a mess of something the priest told me an old Hebrew once sold his for. We
                  owed a duty to our child, which we have fulfilled. Since Francesco has a prospect
                  of succeeding to his uncle's wealth, there is nothing more to be said. The wedding
                  prepraations can be resumed, and the trousseau will not have been bought in
                  vain."
               The father sighed, as he thought that his darling must indeed soon be given to the
                  protection of one whose claims upon her would be superior to his own; but when he
                  looked into that sweet face that was lately so clouded, and saw there the rose of
                  happiness and hope again flushing into beauty upon the cheek which had begun to
                  grow alarmingly pale, he was almost consoled.
               At that instant a quick, eager step was heard without, and Vivaldi entered the
                  room. He had been told by the servant that Lucille was with her father; but he
                  paused, surprised at the presence of a stranger. With outstretched hand, and
                  gracious smile, Madame Villeray advanced to greet him, and in her most dulcet
                  tones, said:
               "You are welcome among us again, Senor Vivaldi; and I am happy to be the first to
                  inform you of the good fortune that is probably in store for you."
               Vivaldi seemed bewildered by this sudden change in her manner, and he looked
                  toward M. Villeray for an explanation.
               "I—I am really at a loss to know what can have happened, Madame; but be it what it
                  may, if it restores to me the hope of a speedy alliance with your family, I shall
                  consider myself among the happiest of men."
               
               "My dear Francesco, you know that we have ever esteemed you personally as the most
                  desirable of sons, but our imperative duty was to guard the interests of our
                  daughter. It seems that they will no longer suffer by a union with you, so M.
                  Villeray and myself withdraw our objections to your future marriage with
                  Lucille.
               "Madame, M. Villeray," replied the young man, with dignity, "I wish you both to
                  understand that I will no longer be trifled with in an affair so vital to my
                  happiness. I do not know what has wrought such a change in your views, but I
                  demand that the consent now given to my union with your daughter shall be held
                  irrevocable, whatever may happen in the future."
               He looked toward the father, who instantly replied:
               "It is but just to you and our child that it shall be so considered. Lucille, give
                  your betrothed your hand, in token that the compact is sealed. I pledge my word,
                  as a man of honor, that it shall be held sacred."
               How tenderly, how reverently that little fluttering hand was clasped; how much was
                  said in the look their eyes exchanged, need not be explained in words. When
                  Vivaldi could think of anything aside from the great and unexpected happiness that
                  filled his heart, he asked:
               "What miracle has been accomplished in my favor? I came hither jealous, and almost
                  despairing—scarcely hoping to be permitted even to see Lucille, and am met with
                  this unlooked for and most gratifying reception. What has wrought so great a
                  change?"
               M. Villeray hesitated and changed color, for he felt ashamed to say that the
                  improvement in his worldly prospects was the source of his welcome; but his wife
                  had no such scruples. A true Parisienne, it seemed to her the most natural thing
                  in the world that the man who, without fortune, might not aspire to her daughter,
                  was, as its possessor sessor, welcome to her hand. With perfect coolness she
                  said:
               "Senora Montoni has brought us the unlooked for information that your cousin will
                  relinquish the fortune bequeathed to her on such singular conditions, and you will
                  yet claim it as heir-at-law."
               Vivaldi turned quickly toward the dark figure he had hitherto scarcely noticed. He
                  recognized her name, recalled her touching history, and with an emotion almost of
                  reverence, he approached Marie, and raising her hand respectfully to his lips,
                  said:
               "Permit me, Senora, to offer my homage to one of the most courageous and most
                  unfortunate of modern heroines. Your story is well known to me, and your devotion
                  reverenced. Thanks for your endeavors to serve me; they shall not be
                  forgotten."
               Marie smiled faintly, and for an instant seemed bewildered by his sudden address.
                  She passed her hand over her brow, and slowly said:
               "You owe me no thanks, Senor. When I commenced the relation of what has happened
                  to me in my late wanderings, I was not aware that the happiness of my young friend
                  here was concerned in what I had to tell. I am glad to have been the bearer of
                  good tidings, for what I have said will, I am sure, prove true."
               "Sit down, Marie, and tell Vivaldi the whole story. He will hear it with as deep
                  interest as we have felt in its details," said M. Villeray.
               The group gathered around the narrator, and Vivaldi was soon in possession of such
                  facts as were necessary to the full comprehension of his position. When Marie
                  ended, he reflected a few moments, and then said:
               "If my cousin and myself could divide the inheritance it would seem only just; but
                  the terms of the will expressly forbid
                  that. The fortune our uncle spent his life in accumulating, must go entire to
                  either one or the other; yet the noble renunciation this young creature is willing
                  to make for the sake of her husband shall never be forgotten by me. As far as I
                  can, I will make amends to her for the sacrifice that secures my happiness. Have
                  you seen her since she learned her father's decision, Senora?"
               "No—we parted on the day she received it. What I have told you I learned from the
                  agent who brought Count Ernesti's letter. Captain Barnardo was once a friend of
                  her family, and from him I learned the particulars I have related. But from
                  previous conversations with Clarice, no doubt is left in my mind that she will
                  refuse her father's offers; for he insists that she shall give up a husband to
                  whom she is devoted, or forfeit her birthright."
               "And is there no chance that Count Ernesti will relent? He may finally receive his
                  daughter on her own terms, sooner than permit her to live as the wife of an
                  obscure outlaw," said Madame Villeray, anxiously. "He is powerful enough to have
                  this Falcone ennobled. Should he do this, your chances to inherit the estate are
                  very slender, Senor Vivaldi."
               "Perhaps so," replied Vivaldi, coolly; "but my prize is secured to
                  me, let the result be what it may. I have the pledged word of M. Villeray and
                  yourself that Lucille shall give me her hand at an early day. I can wait patiently
                  for the decision of Count Ernesti and his daughter."
               "But you misunderstood me, Senor. Only as the undoubted heir of your
                  uncle, I again repeat, will I permit you to claim my daughter as your wife."
               Vivaldi turned appealingly toward M. Villeray, who here interposed with an air of
                  decision unusual with him when engaged in a contest with his wife.
               "I have given my word, Madame; and it shall be kept. So honorable and true a man
                  as I recognize Francesco to be, is worthy of our child, and he shall claim her
                  with or without the inheritance. He will make her happy, and that is all I
                  ask."
               Vivaldi warmly grasped one of his hands, while Lucille pressed the other to her
                  heart with an expression of joy that deeply moved the old man.
               Pale with anger, Madame Villeray spoke:
               "We shall see, Monsieur. The marriage shall not take place till this
                  question is finally decided. A sudden conviction has come to my mind that this
                  girl will not refuse the terms of her father; that she will claim her own; and
                  you, Senor, will be exactly where you stood this morning—a poor lieutenant, with
                  nothing but your empty hand to offer to a descendant of my noble house!"
               She swept from the room, leaving those within it looking mutely at each other.
                  Lucille struggled to maintain her calmness, but this sudden overthrow of her hopes
                  was too hard to bear, and she burst into tears.
               "Do not weep, my daughter," said M. Villeray, tenderly. "Retire with your friend,
                  and leave me to talk over this matter with Vivaldi. My will for once shall rule in
                  this house, as you shall see."
               A few murmured sentences passed between the lovers, and then Lucille departed with
                  Marie.
               The conference between the two gentlemen was long and earnest, and it was
                  definitely settled that so soon as Vivaldi could gain his promotion, and the
                  certainty of a support, he might claim his bride.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XX.
               THE BANKER AND HIS WIFE.
               EVOLI reached Bastia a few hours after Marie appeared at the house of M. Villeray.
                  His first object was to obtain a correct knowledge of the provisions of Tomaso
                  Vivaldi's will, that he might understand on what ground he must stand with his
                  nephew, in the interview he came to seek. If that document permitted such a
                  division of the estate as was proposed by Guilio, he would suppress the letter of
                  which he was the bearer, and carry back such a report of the failure of his
                  embassy, as must destroy all hope of claiming any portion of the estate.
               But if a restriction of that kind existed, it would be safe to see Vivaldi, and
                  ascertain with what manner of man he had to deal in the relations that might
                  hereafter rise between them.
               It was twilight when he entered the town, and he went at once to the villa of the
                  wealthy banker. Since his exile this was not the first visit he had made to his
                  friend Baliera, for the latter was bound to him by many strong ties, both of
                  interest and affection. To Evoli he was indebted for his present position as
                  consul, and also in a great measure for the prosperity he enjoyed. On sending in a
                  slip of paper with a few mystic characters scrawled upon it, Evoli was instantly
                  admitted to the private room of the banker, who stood ready to welcome him with
                  outstretched arms.
               "My dear duke, is this really you? For the last two days, I have been seeking the
                  means of forwarding a letter to you which lately came from Italy. How fortunate
                  that you should have arrived so opportunely."
               "Ah, that is good news indeed, though I suppose it only brings me leave to return
                  there and vegetate in one of my country-houses, provided I will not meddle in
                  political affairs again. Eh? Is it not so?"
               "You are right, as you always are, my lord. Permission to return and manage your
                  estates is fully granted, but you must pledge yourself to remain quiet."
               "Such is my intention; for the present, I give up ambition. Aspirations for the
                  elevation of my country, have led me into too many difficulties, and I relinquish
                  the struggle till a better day dawns on Italy. But where is my letter?"
               Baliera drew one from a portfolio and presented it to him. Evoli glanced rapidly
                  over its contents, then thrusting it in his pocket, said:
               "I am glad that I can return at my pleasure, for soon it may be necessary to my
                  plans to do so. And now I can see that you are curious to learn what has brought
                  me here in this peasant's garb."
               "If it be not indiscreet, I should like to be enlightened."
               "It is a simple affair, and easily explained. You know I have been the companion
                  of Falcone for many months. He has incurred the vendetta, and could not come
                  hither to attend himself to the settlement of some business in which he is
                  interested. Can you tell me how I can obtain a sight of Tomaso Vivaldi's will? for
                  I understand that a copy of it has been sent to an agent here."
               "Ha! has that fruitful subject of gossip reached even your mountain solitudes? For
                  the last three months it has been discussed here, and the presumptive heir has
                  been the lion of the hour. It turns out, however, that Vivaldi will be compelled
                  to resign his pretensions in favor of a long-lost cousin who was spirited away in
                  her infancy, but has been found just in the nick of time."
               "I know more about that part of the story than you can tell me. But where can I
                  find the will, for I must see it as soon as possible."
               
               "It is here, and I am the agent referred to. But pray explain how you came to know
                  of its existence, and what interest your outlawed friend can have in it?"
               In a few brief sentences Evoli gave as much information as he deemed expedient,
                  and Baliera in return produced a formidable looking parchment, and placed it
                  before him. In a short time Evoli mastered its contents so far as they could be of
                  use to himself, and with a feeling of repressed triumph, he said:
               "The old miser was determined that his hordes should not be scattered. He ties up
                  the property in such a manner as to preclude all chance of a compromise between
                  the heirs. The young countess must take all, or reject all."
               "Yes, there can be no evasion in this case. If Count Ernesti refuses to comply
                  with the conditions dictated to him, he strips his daughter of her inheritance.
                  But the girl will scarcely hold to her determination to abide by the lowly and
                  wretched life she has chosen."
               "Not if I can prevent it," replied Evoli, significantly.
               "And who could more easily do so?" replied the Italian, with a sly laugh. "The
                  reputation of the Duke of Evoli as the most admired and successful of cavaliers,
                  is well known to me already."
               Evoli reflected a moment, and then seemed to consider it necessary to vindicate
                  his reputation to a man who was at least thoroughly acquainted with his
                  weaknesses, as well as with his better qualities. He gravely said:
               "The world might probably condemn me, and accuse me of betraying the man whose
                  bread I have broken; but this is a peculiar case. This young girl, believing she
                  was marrying her equal, and blinded by one of those ephemeral passions which are
                  common to inexperienced children, gave her hand to a man who is every way her
                  inferior. It turns out that she is not only high-born, but magnificently dowered
                  ered. In addition to this, nature has given her beauty and refinement of a high
                  order. With the slender advantages afforded her, she has grown into a graceful and
                  fascinating womanhood, that might shame half the daughters of fashion and culture.
                  Behold this exquisite creature condemned to live as the wife of an outlaw, and see
                  for yourself how fitness would be outraged in permitting her to abide by the lot
                  she has chosen. Guilio is a good fellow, and very much in love with his Peri; but
                  her wings must soon lift her beyond his sphere, and I will aid her to plume them
                  for a flight which shall end——"
               He paused, and Baliera quietly added:
               "In your arms, my lord. I see plainly that her husband is not the only one madly
                  enamored of this peerless senora. But how are you to dispose of this mountain
                  chieftain? The Corsican heart is easily fired with jealousy, and wrong of this
                  nature is never forgiven. His carbine or his dagger will surely reach you."
               Evoli made a gesture of impatience:
               "Falcone is already the object of deadly vendetta. He tore his bride almost from
                  the altar, and in the melee that followed his rival was slain. The family of Matra
                  have sworn vengeance against him; and they will surely accomplish it. Without
                  raising my finger against him, Guilio will be removed from my path."
               "Ah, I know something of that Matra. Information has been laid before me of
                  dealings on his part which lead to the supposition that he was no better than a
                  pirate, for he was certainly in league with one."
               "My friend, Barnardo, I suppose you allude to," replied Evoli, coolly. "I have
                  long suspected as much, but he has managed hitherto to keep out of serious
                  difficulties, and it is not my wish that he shall be interfered with yet awhile.
                  He can be of material use to me, and in fact I have pledged him my word to serve him when I return to my native
                  land."
               "Then," replied the consul, respectfully, "I will ignore the communication, though
                  it came from a very respectable source. It will be as well, however, for you to
                  warn him that suspicion has been aroused against him, and he had better confine
                  himself to smuggling. The authorities can wink at that, when the greater crime
                  could not be overlooked."
               "Very well, I will answer for him for the next three months. After that time I
                  shall probably see fit to place him in a more honorable position than he now
                  holds."
               "Since you are kind enough to interest yourself in him, my lord, I consider his
                  fortune as made. But you will balance this liberality by ruining the prospects of
                  as good a lad as lives. Poor Vivaldi will lose his promised bride, I am afraid, if
                  you induce the heiress to claim her fortune."
               "How is this?" asked Evoli, with interest.
               Baliera, whose wife was the chosen friend and confidante of Lucille, gave the
                  history of herself and her lover, to which Evoli eagerly listened. When it was
                  finished, he said:
               "I came hither to seek an interview with Vivaldi, for I am the bearer of a letter
                  from Falcone proposing to divide the estate. This, it seems, cannot be done, but
                  when I have carried out my plans, I can easily offer to Lieutenant
                  Vivaldi such an equivalent as will entitle him to claim the hand of M. Villeray's
                  daughter. If I remember aright, he is a French refugee, living upon the wreck of
                  his fortune."
               "That is true, but Madame is of high family, and expects great wealth, or noble
                  blood, in her future son-in-law."
               "Great expectations are seldom fulfilled," said Evoli, coldly. "Madame Villeray
                  must be taught to lower her pretensions, natural as they may be where an only
                  daughter is concerned."
               "He would be a bold man who would undertake to convince her of that," replied
                  Baliera, shrugging his shoulders. "Of all the women known to me, I consider Madame
                  the most unreasonable."
               "It is always well to understand the carte du
                     pays," said Evoli, laughing. "But I think I can find means to reach
                  this fiery dame, even if her stilts do lift her so far above the heads of common
                  mortals. I should like to see the young lady, too, for your description has
                  interested me."
               "If you will honor us with your presence at a fancy ball my wife gives to-morrow
                  night, you can have the opportunity you desire. Madame Villeray has positively
                  promised to come and bring her daughter with her. Since the ban is removed from
                  you, you can appear without danger to yourself."
               "I should not wish to be known, but I can easily disguise myself so as not to be
                  recognized. The temptation is really great, besides, I can thus meet Vivaldi with
                  all the mystery that would give piquancy to our interview. He will, of course,
                  accompany his betrothed."
               "If the old dragon will permit it. She keeps him off or on, as his chances to gain
                  the estate rise or fall."
               "Then he will be sure to accompany her, for a friend of Falcone's has come hither,
                  and she is now in the house of M. Villeray as a guest. She will induce them to
                  believe that Clarice will never give up her husband. Thus the claim of Vivaldi
                  will seem to be in the ascendant, and he will be smiled on again."
               "You speak like one who knows, yet you are no wizard. How in the name of all the
                  Fates came a friend of your wild outlaw to be visiting the aristocratic dame of M.
                  Villeray?"
               "It is Marie Montoni, the improvisatrice, who is known to every one through the
                  tragic incidents of her early life. She accompanied Clarice to the cavern, and I
                  have heard her speak of M. Villeray and
                  his daughter as her best friends in Bastia."
               "Ah! poor Marie! hers is indeed a sad story, and I think her mind has been a
                  little astray ever since that dreadful night when she bore the body of her lover
                  to its grave. If she is with the Villerays, we must send her an invitation to come
                  to our festival. The time has been when that half distraught creature was the life
                  of the gayest ball-room. Her family repudiate her, but they are the only ones who
                  cannot see the heroism of her nature."
               "Have her here, by all means, for I wish to speak a few words with her before I
                  leave. I can easily guard against detection till I wish to make myself known, and
                  by my superior finesse, grasp the destiny of all these people in the hollow of my
                  hand. I rely on you, Baliera, to aid me in this as faithfully as I have served you
                  in other days."
               "I needed not that reminder, my lord. I am devoted to your service, as you have
                  heretofore had good reason to know."
               "That is true; you have been faithful to me in adversity, and I see the day
                  approaching when I can do something in return more important to your future
                  elevation than I did when I procured you the petty office of consul here. I shall
                  not forget your interests, you may be sure."
               Baliera expressed his thanks, and then the two had many incidents to relate which
                  derived interest from the early relations that had existed between them. Baliera
                  was the son of a noble but impoverished family, and the father of Evoli had
                  received him as a page in his household. The young heir took a fancy to him, and
                  insisted that he should share his studies. The two grew to manhood together, and a
                  strong bond of attachment existed between them. Baliera made an early and
                  imprudent marriage, and he would have fallen into the deepest poverty but for the
                  efforts of his friend to place him in a position to ensure independence. The
                  office of Consul at Bastia was obtained for him through Evoli's interest, and a
                  sum of money, furnished by the same liberal hand, enabled him to become a partner
                  in a private banking establishment, which prospered beyond his hopes.
               Senor Baliera was a small, sharp-looking man, with a keen eye to his own
                  advantage, and no strongly-defined principles. He adored his wife, was faithful to
                  his friend, and careful of his worldly chances; and he flattered himself that the
                  whole destiny of man was comprised in these duties. He was not shocked at the
                  treachery Evoli had developed to him, for he had a vague notion that a man on whom
                  the ban of society had fallen, had forfeited all rights, and if the vendetta was
                  carried out against Falcone, it was only a rude kind of justice against a man who
                  had placed himself beyond the reach of the law. His worldly shrewdness led him to
                  believe that Clarice must eventually become disgusted with the solitude of her
                  mountain life, and he considered it right that the daughter of a noble house
                  should be torn, even by violence, from the arms of her plebeian husband. Thus he
                  was quite ready to aid Evoli in every possible manner to carry out his plans.
               Senora Baliera was soon made aware of the presence of her husband's distinguished
                  guest, and every preparation was made to do honor to him. She was a brilliant
                  little brunette, whose vivacity and grace vindicated the good taste of her
                  husband. She was very fond of society, and the balls given at her house were the
                  most agreeable reunions in the town. The one to which she was now looking forward
                  was to exceed in brilliancy all that had preceded it, and great was the exultation
                  of the little woman when she learned that her husband's early friend and patron,
                  the handsome and magnificent Duke of Evoli, would grace her festival with his
                  presence.
               
               Her elation was a little clouded, however, when she learned that he would appear
                  only in mask, as, for reasons of his own, Evoli did not wish his true rank to be
                  suspected. The husband easily satisfied her that this was absolutely necessary to
                  the safety of his friend, and with a sigh she gave up the brilliant vision of
                  appearing before her guests attended by one of the most elegant men she had ever
                  seen, who, in addition, was the head of one of the proudest Italian families.
               An invitation was despatched to Marie Montoni, with a polite little note from
                  Senora Baliera expressing the hope that she would accept it, as a friend of hers
                  would be present who wished to have an interview with her under the shelter of his
                  mask. He had something of importance to the welfare of her mountain friends to
                  communicate, which it would be well for her to hear.
               The reception of this note filled Marie with surprise, and also excited her
                  greatly. After reading it several times, she carried it with her into Lucille's
                  room to consult with her as to the propriety of accepting the invitation. She
                  could not think, without a shudder, of again standing amid the glare and crush of
                  a ball-room; for the last time she had entered one she was accompanied by him she
                  had so fondly loved, so fatally lost; but if the interests of Guilio and his bride
                  were to be served by doing so, she could not hesitate.
               She found Lucille preparing the dress of a water-nymph, in which character her
                  mother had consented she should appear. She glanced at the perturbed face of
                  Marie, and turning from her occupation, asked:
               "What is it, Marie? You seem troubled."
               "I thought I had attended my last ball," she replied, with a faint attempt to
                  smile, "but it seems that I was mistaken. Read this note from Senora Baliera, and
                  then tell me how I can enter her rooms without being recognized except by the
                  mysterious person who wishes to converse with me concerning Guilio and his
                  bride."
               Lucille read the note with much interest, and immediately said:
               "I am glad we can take you with us on any terms. Let me see—oh! I have it. You can
                  go as a fortune-teller, with your head-dress so arranged as to conceal your
                  features. Furnished with the bones used by the Corsicans in divination, you will
                  doubtless be quite as successful in foretelling the future as most necromancers
                  are."
               The face of Marie cleared; she slowly said:
               "That will do—my usual dress will answer for a sibyl, and the use of the bones is
                  familiar to me. I have often foretold the future from them."
               "And you really believe in this strange method of reading the future?" asked
                  Lucille, playfully.
               Marie gravely replied:
               "Why not? Every nation has its favorite method of divination, and ours is by such
                  simple means as the polished shoulder blade of a sheep or goat; but, mind you, it
                  must be from the left shoulder, for the right one often deceives. When the bone is
                  made perfectly smooth, the lines upon it are as clear to me as those on a map. The
                  destiny of many distinguished Corsicans has been foretold in this way, and I
                  learned the art from an adept in the science."
               "Then you shall predict my fortune. But what great man has verified the prophecies
                  so curiously revealed?"
               "The greatest one of modern times. While yet a boy, Napoleon's career was foretold
                  by a Corsican shepherd. The diviner found stamped upon the shoulder-blade a tree
                  with a multitude of branches, but the roots were few and feeble. Thus was
                  foreshadowed the rise and fall of the conqueror."
               "Really, if true, it was very singular. I will order a small basket of bones to be
                  prepared for you, and you can astonish
                  the people you will meet at Senor Baliera's by the skill you will display. I
                  fancy, however, in most cases, you will be forced to draw on your imagination to
                  fill up the programme."
               Marie smiled vaguely as she replied:
               "With some people with whom I am thrown in contact, I seem to come at once into
                     rapport, and a bewildering, confused mirage
                  floats before my mental vision, in which I catch glimpses of their past, and
                  future. With others, and they are the many, the oracle is dumb. Lately I have been
                  thrown much with one who filled me with a vague kind of antipathy, and his future
                  would arise before me clouded with darkness, and ruin to those I love. It is he, I
                  am sure, who seeks to meet me now, though how or why he came hither is concealed
                  from me."
               Lucille looked upon the still face, with its large eyes fixed on vacancy, and
                  asked, almost in a whisper:
               "If you really possess this power, Marie, whence was it derived?"
               "From ruined hopes, from crushed reason. It arose upon the night of my despair, as
                  a beacon to warn others of the breakers that threaten to overwhelm their bark of
                  life. I try to use it to a good purpose, for God help me! it is all the good that
                  is left me to do now."
               She covered her face with her hands and sank shivering upon a chair. Her young
                  companion regarded her with tender compassion, but she did not venture to question
                  her further. She gently said:
               "I will answer Senora Baliera's note, and so arrange it that you need not enter
                  the ball-room at all. The grounds are spacious, and a suitable place for a sibyl
                  can be found far from the dancers."
               Marie gladly assented to this proposal, and Lucille hastily dashed off the
                  following lines to her friend:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "DEAR VIOLA—Marie Montoni consents to come to you, but she shrinks
                              from entering a crowd again. I have suggested to her to assume the
                              character of a sibyl, and the grotto which overlooks the grove will be
                              exactly suited to the exercise of her necromantic powers. She desires
                              to be known only to the person who seeks an interview with her, and
                              your own skill and and taste will suffice for the proper
                              arrangement.
                           "Francesco is again in favor, and will be our escort. I reserve what I
                              have to tell on that subject till we meet.
                           
                              "LUCILLE."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Senora Baliera was the only intimate friend Lucille possessed, and to her faithful
                  keeping was confided the innocent hopes and sorrows of her young life. The happy
                  wife took a keen interest in the denouement of
                  this love drama, which carried her back to the days of her own doubts and fears,
                  when prudence forbade a marriage which she risked with all its chances of future
                  poverty, and found her reward in so doing. She read Lucille's reply with eager
                  interest, and immediately set herself to the task of having the spot indicated
                  prepared for the occupation of Marie.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               THE BALL. A STRANGE GUEST, AND WHAT WAS DONE BY HIM.
               SENORA BALIERA was an ambitious little woman, who wished to signalize her ball by
                  something more striking than an elegant supper, and fine music, to which twinkling
                  feet should keep time; she desired this entertainment to be remembered, and spoken of as unique in its
                  character, while, at the same time, it should increase the popularity of her
                  husband with the excitable people he had come to dwell among. She took intense
                  interest in the traditions of the island which had become her home; and the
                  martial character of the Corsicans, their indomitable spirit of independence,
                  delighted her. She wished to give something of a national character to the
                  entertainment she had prepared, and arrangements had been made for the performance
                  of the Corsican weapon-dance during the evening.
               The Moresca does not belong exclusively to them, however, for it is also danced in
                  other countries, but in Corsica its character is entirely chivalric. In all ages
                  this dance, which is the very embodiment of the poetry of war, has been practised
                  by them in seasons of great national peril, when the courage of the laggard needed
                  rousing by reminding him of the great deeds of his forefathers.
               On this evening it was to be represented on a small scale, but the villa occupied
                  by Senor Baliera had extensive grounds, which might be made to serve as an
                  amphitheatre for the performers.
               An open space of green sward, encircled by majestic trees, and bounded by masses
                  of thick shrubbery, was brilliantly illuminated, and a small summer-house on one
                  side represented the gates of the town threatened with invasion. The guests, in
                  every variety of brilliant, picturesque, and fantastic costumes, gathered in
                  groups to witness the spirited scene about to be enacted, and among them was
                  Madame Villeray and her daughter, escorted by Vivaldi. They, however, did not
                  mingle with the crowd, but occupied the grotto which had been prepared for the
                  reception of Marie Montoni. This spot commanded a perfect view of the scene of
                  action, as it was built upon a projecting spur from the hillside, which overlooked
                  the esplanade beneath.
               Senora Baliera had been with them but a few moments, as her presence was needed
                  elsewhere: and she could only offer a cordial welcome to her strange guest, and
                  show her how cleverly she had fitted up the shrine of Fate, at which she was to
                  preside. The grotto was a fantasy of her own; it was decorated within with mosses,
                  spars, and shells, arranged so skilfully as to have the wild and picturesque
                  effect of nature; and one might have fancied that Titania herself had presided
                  over its construction, while the spirits of the air had been its architects.
               It was an exquisite little bijou, placed in a
                  rocky recess, which was approached by a winding avenue of lime-trees, whose
                  branches formed an arch overhead. It was converted now into a pavilion, by placing
                  heavy crimson curtains in front, which were drawn back and held in loose folds by
                  silken cords. A marble table, a tripod, and a vase filled with polished bones,
                  were placed within; and a pale, emerald light was diffused over the whole by means
                  of a lamp, with a green glass shade placed behind a sparry screen.
               In its wan scintillations, with her black dress, and flowing hair half-covered
                  with a scarlet mandille, Lucille insisted she should wear, Marie looked the very
                  embodiment of the character she had assumed. She had loosened her abundant black
                  tresses, and brought them forward in such a manner as partially to veil her face,
                  for she had a nervous dread of being recognized; while some power she could
                  neither control nor comprehend, impelled her to seek the interview she
                  instinctively feared, though she could not have told wherefore, so vague was the
                  impression of something evil which she must grapple with, and if possible
                  overcome.
               Lucille, in a pale, sea-green skirt, covered with clouds of filmy lace, her light
                  hair bound with sea grasses and water lilies, long sprays of which adorned her
                  dress, was a charming representative of Undine. Pearls of rare value and lustre gleamed upon her neck and arms,
                  which only seemed to gain additional fairness from the contrast. Bright, fresh and
                  happy, the young girl offered a striking contrast to the wan and worn figure of
                  the sibyl, though even over her the emerald light cast a strange pallor, wakening
                  in the heart of her lover the wish to withdraw her from its influence into an
                  atmosphere more suited to her sweet and genial nature.
               As Vivaldi was aware, however, that this was the best point of observation for the
                  spectacle of the Moresca, he made no such attempt for the present. The scene below
                  them was so striking that even Madame Villeray soon forgot to complain of the
                  discomfort of the rustic seat on which she had placed herself to overlook the
                  pageant.
               The esplanade was lighted by long wreaths of colored lamps, extending from tree to
                  tree, and gleaming like stars amid the foliage. The brilliant crowd, in gay fancy
                  costumes and flashing jewels, gathered in groups in the best positions for seeing
                  their national dance, and chatted, laughed and enjoyed themselves with that
                  abandon peculiar to people of southern temperament, while a fine band filled the
                  air with its inspiring music.
               At a given signal the performers ceased, and a single bugle note, clear, shrill,
                  and piercing, seemed to reach the very welkin. At this sound, the door of the
                  summer-house unclosed, and a Moorish astrologer came forth. He looked up to the
                  heavens, consulted the stars, and rushed back dismayed at the dire portents he
                  there beheld. Then came another trumpet-blast, and a messenger in hot haste rushed
                  forward and announced that the Genoese had taken two of their fortified towns, and
                  were now marching to Bastia. He disappeared within the summer-house, and the
                  defenders of the town appeared, headed by a tall, graceful knight, in gorgeous
                  dress and floating plumes, who assumed for a time the character of Pasquale Paoli.
                  His followers were all clad in flowing Roman togas of white material, and armed
                  with a sword in the right hand and a dagger in the left.
               Vivas and clapping of hands welcomed them, which were half drowned by a loud burst
                  of music from horns and trumpets. Then came their opponents, dressed in scarlet
                  togas, and armed in the same manner.
               A breathless silence here fell upon the crowd, the faint vibrations of the trumpet
                  faded away in the distance, and the notes of a single violin were heard. It was
                  touched with masterly skill, and its piercing melody filled every leafy covert
                  with its sound.
               The two leaders advanced to the measured cadence, followed by thirty dancers on
                  each side; they weave through the figures of the Moresca, striking their weapons
                  against each other with a clashing sound, and keeping exact time to the music. The
                  white and scarlet figures mingle in one wild maze, and the light flashes upon
                  their swordblades as thrusts are parried, and blows evaded.
               Then they separate, each party forms a crescent, moving for a brief space in its
                  own orbit, but to meet again in wilder, fiercer motion. The scene grows almost
                  fearful from its appearance of reality, and the actors seemed moved with the
                  spirit of mortal strife. Blow rings on blow and the faces of these excitable
                  Southrons begin to flash with the fury of a real contest, when the trumpet summons
                  the party supposed to be conquered to surrender. Their weapons are at once
                  lowered, and the stirring pageant is over.
               The performers mingle with the crowd, the band strikes up, and the company seek
                  the ball-room to join in the less exciting waltz.
               Our little party had watched the whole performance with breathless interest, and
                  both Lucille and Marie had kept their eyes fixed upon the striking figure of the
                  plumed knight who led the Corsicans. The first was attracted by the singular grace and dignity of his bearing, the
                  last by the species of fascination which the reptile exercises over the fluttering
                  bird it lures within its power. Lucille asked of Vivaldi:
               "Who is the tall knight who represents the great Paoli? He should be sans peur et sans reproche to assume the character of
                  so great and good a man."
               "Yet I am very sure that he is neither," muttered Marie; but her words were not
                  listened to.
               "That is the stranger who only came to Bastia on yesterday. He wishes to maintain
                  his incognita, but I have learned that the Duke of Evoli, the early friend and
                  patron of Senor Baliera, is now visiting him, and I think that is he."
               At these words the interest of Madame Villeray was suddenly aroused; she eagerly
                  said:
               "Ah, he is a great parti; the richest nobleman
                  in Italy, and almost of princely rank. He is unmarried, I believe?"
               "He is, Madame," replied Vivaldi, coldly, almost haughtily, for he read the
                  thought that prompted the inquiry. He answered it by adding, "Men of his rank only
                  wed their equals in birth and fortune."
               "Not always," said Madame, with equal asperity. "Love and beauty sometimes tell a
                  different story. Lucille, love, let me see how you are looking to-night. Ah! I am
                  glad you thought of coming as Undine, for the dress is very becoming to you."
               "Not by this light, Madame," said Vivaldi, "for in its beams we all look like pale
                  phantoms from the deep. Let us seek the ball-room; I am not afraid to trust
                  Lucille even where the glamour of this handsome stranger may be thrown around her.
                  I should be unworthy to win her, if I have not that much confidence in her."
               Madame Villeray bit her lip, but made no reply. After all, Vivaldi might prove the
                  safest card, and Lucille seemed stupidly resolute to favor no other suitor. She
                  arose and took the young man's offered arm, and Lucille made a last effort to
                  induce Marie to make one tour of the ball-room and see the masquers. Marie shook
                  her head.
               "No, no—not there. I cannot summon courage to enter such a scene again. Let those
                  who wish to consult me seek me here. Do not hesitate to leave me alone, Lucille,
                  for solitude is always welcome to me. Here I can sit and dream, and conjure back
                  the past, through the divine gift of memory."
               "Then I will leave you for a season. Hark! how the gay strains of music seem to
                  wreathe and dance in merry waves upon the soft air. Ah, it must be a scene of
                  enchantment in the ball-room."
               Printing a light kiss upon the sibyl's brow, Lucille tripped away with feet winged
                  by impatience to join the revellers. The guests had been required to appear in
                  fancy costume, but masks were not assumed except at the desire of the wearer.
                  Madame Villeray wore the dress of a French marchioness of the ancient régime, the
                  stately splendor of which suited her style, and set off the remains of the beauty
                  she had once possessed.
               Vivaldi, in the magnificent court dress of a Hungarian noble, was one of the most
                  striking figures in the motley crowd of courtiers, cardinals, and harlequins, amid
                  which they soon found themselves. Lucille, in her light, foamy-looking toilette,
                  seemed indeed a young Venus just from the sea, or better still, what she
                  represented, a pure water-sprite, without the taint of passion which mars the
                  ideal of the goddess.
               Senora Baliera stood at the upper end of the ballroom dispensing smiles and
                  gracious nods to her guests. She wore the picturesque dress of a Neapolitan
                  peasant girl, and the charming coquetry
                  of her manner, the sparkling brightness of her large dark eyes, gave piquancy to
                  its effect. Her husband, as a rural Boniface, was circulating among the crowd,
                  sustaining his assumed character with such wit and good humor as won him hosts of
                  friends.
               Vivaldi had wished to appear as Rudolph, the lover of Undine, but to this her
                  mother had positively objected. She chose to consider the union of the lovers as a
                  possibility which might never be realized, and she did not wish to give the little
                  world around them additional reason for linking their names together. Great, then,
                  was the chagrin of Vivaldi when a tall knight, masked, and wearing the dress of a
                  German baron, approached her, and with an air of assurance, said:
               "I claim the right to dance a measure with the spirit I had power to conjure from
                  the depths of ocean. Fair Undine, your Rudolph asks a single waltz to show these
                  people how gods and sylphides illustrate the poetry of motion."
               "My hand is already promised for the first waltz," she replied, "and, moreover,
                  Bertalda has rivalled me. Seek her, and offer her the honor you would extend to
                  me."
               "Ha! jealous little sprite! Bertalda! what is that form of mere clay to me, while
                  you are a dream, a sea-nymph, clad in spray, a pearl gathered from the halls of
                  Neptune. Come, and tell me of your coral home deep in the unsunned caverns of
                  ocean, child of the foamy sparkling element from which you sprang. Let us join the
                  waltz together; float with me through its mazes but a single round, and then I
                  resign you to your fortunate cavalier."
               Lucille still clung to the arm of Vivaldi, but Senora Baliera whispered in his
                  ear:
               "It is our honored guest, the young duke. He has the power and the will to serve
                  you; permit Lucille to go with him, as he particularly wishes it."
               Though bewildered by this singular assurance that a stranger was interested in his
                  affairs, Vivaldi knew the advantage so powerful a friend must be to him, and after
                  a brief moment of hesitation, he released the little hand from his arm, and
                  bowing, said:
               "For a brief season I resign my claims in favor of the noble Rudolph."
               Lucille looked surprised, almost offended, at this transfer, but a few low-toned
                  words from Vivaldi reassured her.
               "Senora Baliera wishes you to give the first waltz to her husband's friend. The
                  duke, as a stranger, is entitled to this courtesy."
               Madame Villeray listened eagerly, and caught the sense of his words. A smile of
                  exultation swept across her features, and she exclaimed:
               "Of course: go, my child, and enjoy the amusement you love so much. If this noble
                  cavalier waltzes as well as you do, your performance will be worth looking
                  at."
               "I should shame both my own and my assumed fatherland, if I did not excel in this
                  particular dance," replied Evoli, with his usual nonchalance; and Lucille, without
                  any volition of her own, found herself whirling away to the sound of the bounding
                  music, to which her twinkling feet instinctively kept time. She soon found that
                  her partner was indeed a perfect waltzer, for never before had her light form been
                  so perfectly sustained—never had she so floated on the wings of melody as now; she
                  seemed scarcely to touch the floor; and groups gathered to see the water sprite
                  and her cavalier perform their airy evolutions with a grace seldom equalled.
               At length they passed near the door of a boudoir which joined the saloon. It was a
                  small room, illuminated by a single lamp, to which a ground glass shade gave the
                  effect of moonlight. Evoli placed his partner on a divan near an open window, and brought her an ice from the
                  refreshment-room. He placed himself opposite to her, and lightly said:
               "It is really too warm to waltz long. I was afraid, if I kept you upon the floor,
                  that you might return to your original element, and flow a peerless rill to seas
                  unknown. If I could have shared your fate, and, thus united, we could have flowed
                  down time's river, I might have risked such a dénouement; but, alas! I have too much of earth about me to embrace
                  a destiny so blessed."
               "Ah! that waltz was entrancing! I am not at all fatigued, Senor, thanks to the
                  power and skill you displayed as we flew through its mazes. Do not fancy that I am
                  in danger of sharing Undine's fate. I am quite ready for another waltz when Senor
                  Vivaldi comes to claim me."
               "Really, your love of dancing must be insatiable; or does the charm of the next
                  one lie in the person who will claim it?"
               At this inquiry Lucille drew back with an air of reserve, which Evoli immediately
                  understood. He said:
               "Pardon me—I but assumed the freedom of the masquerade to utter my thoughts as
                  they arise. Protected by my assumed character, I still wish to say something to
                  you which you may consider strange, but my motives are atleast good; for the
                  welfare of yourself, and, may I say it, Mademoiselle, of your lover, is not
                  indifferent to me."
               Lucille blushed, looked distressed and perplexed; but she said nothing, and her
                  companion rapidly went on:
               "An agent has been sent hither from the husband of Senor Vivaldi's cousin, to
                  propose a compromise with regard to the fortune in dispute between them. Use your
                  influence to keep him clear of any entanglement in that quarter, and an equivalent
                  for enough of this estate to render him independent, shall surely be secured to
                  him. More I cannot say; but Senora Baliera will tell you that I redeem all the
                  pledges I make. There, I see that you are quite rested, Mademoiselle. Shall we
                  resume our waltz?"
               He offered his hand, which Lucille accepted in a state of bewildered surprise. As
                  they emerged from the door, he whispered:
               "You pledge me your aid?"
               She looked up, caught the gleam of his magnetic eye beneath his mask, and bowed
                  her head in assent. The next moment they were whirling among the dancers, and when
                  they reached the spot on which they had left her mother and Vivaldi, Evoli led her
                  back to their protection. With a graceful bow, he said:
               "Thanks, Madame, for the honor of your daughter's hand in this intoxicating dance.
                  Senor, I owe you something for the courtesy which led you to waive your right in
                  favor of a stranger. I always pay my debts, and I shall eagerly avail myself of
                  the first opportunity to cancel this one."
               He bowed, and before Vivaldi could reply, was lost amid the crowd. Lucille was
                  impatient to reveal to her lover the singular confidence offered her by her late
                  partner, but no opportunity offered for so doing, for among so many people she
                  feared her communication might be overheard; and soon she became so occupied with
                  the amusements of the evening, that, for a season, it passed from her memory. As
                  she left the supper-room, it was recalled by a voice that whispered in her ear,
                  "Remember!" in tones she recognized as the same which had addressed her in the
                  boudoir, but on looking around, she saw no one save a friar in a sombre frock,
                  with his cowl closely drawn over his face. He offered a folded paper to Vivaldi,
                  and disappeared.
               Lucille earnestly whispered:
               "Read it, Francesco. Its contents may have more significance than you think."
               Thus urged, Vivaldi availed himself of the first opportunity tunity to glance over the lines so mysteriously
                  presented to him. He read:
               
                  "SENOR:—I have come to this ball chiefly to secure a brief interview with you.
                     Meet me half an hour hence in the lime-tree walk leading to the grotto, as I
                     have that to say which may materially affect your fortunes."
               
               Lucille looked over the paper at the same time, and she said:
               "I also have something to tell you, which will convince you that the manœuvres of
                  the duke to waltz with me tonight, were simply to obtain a few moments'
                  conversation with reference to your affairs."
               She then related what had passed between them, and added:
               "The friar and the duke are one, I am sure. I cannot fathom the source of his
                  interest in our fortunes, but he is certainly connected with them in some manner
                  that we do not comprehend."
               Vivaldi reflected a few moments, and then seriously asked:
               "Are you willing, Lucille, that I shall accept the offer this stranger has made,
                  and give up my chances for wealth? For myself, a certainty which will enable me to
                  gain your hand at once, would be preferred to a claim which may end in
                  nothing."
               "I am not mercenary, and I love you," whispered the young girl, with a charming
                  smile, and a deepening blush upon her transparent cheek.
               "I am answered," replied Vivaldi, with a vibration in his voice which made her
                  heart beat with a new sense of happiness in the strong manly love of which she
                  felt she was the object.
               Vivaldi sought Madame Villeray, and placing Lucille in her care, at the expiration
                  of the time named in the note, proceeded toward the place of meeting. Groups were
                  promenading through the grounds, for the night was deliciously clear and soft,
                  even for that climate, and a few had found their way to the shrine of the seeress;
                  but now the lime-tree walk was nearly deserted. A single dark figure paced to and
                  fro beneath its shadows, evidently awaiting the arrival of some one, and as
                  Vivaldi approached, the friar advanced to meet him. The young man said:
               "I am here at your bidding. What is your object in drawing me hither?"
               "To serve you," was the prompt response. "I am the agent sent hither to propose to
                  you what I have since learned is an impossibility—the division of the inheritance
                  to which you are the legal heir, if the Countess Ernesti refuses the offers of her
                  family. Am I not right, Senor?"
               "Perfectly; the estate cannot be divided. You are, then, a friend of the outlaw to
                  whom my cousin has given her hand?"
               "I am; but I am powerless to save him from the doom that hangs over him. The
                  Vendetta has already written his fate in characters of blood; the decree may not
                  be carried out quite yet, but it will surely be accomplished before the expiration
                  of the year named by Tomaso Vivaldi, and the countess will be restored to her
                  birthright."
               "What, then, is your object in seeking me?"
               "To offer you something like an equivalent for what you resign. Move no further in
                  this affair, and I pledge the honor of a noble house to further your interests in
                  your profession, and also to guarantee your future fortune. You may expect rapid
                  promotion; and when the young countess bestows her hand on one who is her equal in
                  rank and fortune, a liberal annuity will be settled upon you."
               
               "What guarantee have I that these promises will be performed?"
               "Here is a written paper, signed by a name that has never been dishonored by
                  non-compliance with its contracts. I offer you immediate independence, with the
                  power to claim your betrothed bride. If you cling to the hope of winning the
                  inheritance, you will lose all; for I am certain that within the allotted time,
                  the daughter of Count Ernesti will be the acknowledged mistress of her ancestral
                  home."
               "Since the discovery of this young girl, I have not permitted myself to hope that
                  I shall claim my uncle's fortune. I accept your offers, my lord, for I penetrate
                  your disguise. Your name is attached to this paper, and yours, I presume, is the
                  hand destined for my cousin. I trust that no treachery against Falcone is
                  concealed beneath this offer."
               "Treachery! Why should you suspect it? His fate will only be one more story of
                  Corsican vengeance carried to its extreme limits. To secure his bride, life was
                  taken, and the relatives of the murdered man will only carry out the traditions of
                  their race."
               "But can he not be warned? You are his friend—you are aware of the fate that
                  threatens him."
               "And so also is he," replied Evoli, calmly. "Falcone may possibly evade the doom
                  that approaches him, but his life will not ensure the estate to you, for his bride
                  will not have firmness to refuse the brilliant future that is offered her. Count
                  Ernesti has already applied to the Pope for a dissolution of his daughter's
                  marriage; it will be granted, and the outlawed husband, even if he is permitted to
                  live, will be forsaken. I speak what I know, Senor Vivaldi."
               "Yet you, who probably expect to win her, claim to be his friend."
               "I was his friend, but now—Senor, I cannot explain our present relations. I should
                  rather say that Falcone and I have been friends—now we are—"
               He paused, and Vivaldi added:
               "Are rivals. I comprehend, my lord. My cousin must decide her own fate; 'tis not
                  for me to interfere in any way, when I should gain so much by her allegiance to
                  her wedded vows."
               "Then you will accept my terms?"
               "I do accept them."
               "That is well; examine the paper I have given you, and see that it is fairly
                  executed."
               Vivaldi, in a strange whirl of feeling, drew near a lamp, and looked over the
                  closely-written page Evoli had given him. He presently turned to address him, but
                  he had disappeared.
               Walking like one in a dream, he slowly paced the long avenue in deep thought, and
                  then proceeded toward the grotto to inquire how Marie had passed the hours of his
                  absence. In the meantime, a tall, masked figure, wearing the costume of a Turkish
                  pacha, appeared in front of the sibyl's shrine, and after a few courteous words of
                  greeting, his long, slender hand, flashing with jewels, sought among the polished
                  bones in Marie's vase for one from which to have his future foretold.
               There was a strange fluttering emotion visible in the face and person of the
                  seeress, as she fixed her large, melancholy eyes upon her visitor, with an
                  expression half of feat, half of defiance, and she tremulously asked:
               "Why have you come to me to foretell that future which you are
                  certain you hold within your own grasp? It is a mockery! a mockery!"
               The Turk lightly replied:
               "It may be so, fair oracle; but it is still my pleasure to have my bright fortunes
                  foretold by a real Corsican witch.
                  Excuse me, but the woman of Endor was beautiful and young, yet the chronicle calls
                  her by that name. Ah, here is a bone as polished as fashionable sarcasm, which
                  will answer my turn. Read its mystic lines, and tell me if my hopes will blossom
                  and bear fruit, or will they be nipped in the bud?"
               Marie, with trembling hands and dilated eyes, seized the bone, and glanced over
                  its surface with intense interest. The faint network of lines traced upon it
                  seemed to impress her vividly. She slowly followed them with her finger, and the
                  impatient applicant again spoke:
               "Let me hear the decree of fate. Am I to be happy or miserable? success or
                  failure? which awaits me?"
               Marie looked up, and faintly replied:
               "Both; success in meditated treachery—failure in the reward. In the moment of
                  fruition, the cherished hope of your heart will be crushed. There is
                  blood—blood—but the record is blurred—I cannot read it clearly."
               "Neither can you read it at all," replied the Turk, with haughty composure. "I
                  have no faith in your predictions; I merely used them as a pretext to see you in
                  private."
               "Then I am not mistaken. You are Senor Benedetto. When did you leave the cavern
                  and how are its inmates?"
               "I left them a few hours after your own departure, and I am bearer of a message
                  from Clarice to her friend."
               "Which is to bid me return to her as soon as possible."
               "On the contrary, it is to inform you that Lisa's daughter, Gulietta, will come to
                  her for a season, and until she summons you to return, you can remain with your
                  friends in Bastia."
               "What then has brought you hither?"
               "The wish to serve Guilio; but my mission has failed. I go hence to Italy, as my
                  sentence of exile is revoked."
               Marie uttered a cry of joy.
               "That is well, Senor Benedetto. You will go at once; you will not return to the
                  cavern; you will leave my poor Clarice to the love in which she will find
                  happiness. I have read you wrongfully—I beg that you will pardon me."
               "That is easily done, good Marie, for I never bear malice. If the heart of your
                  friend clings to her husband, I am sure I shall make no attempt to wrest her from
                  him."
               "You promise me this?" exclaimed Marie, eagerly. "You will go back to your own
                  country, and leave the mountain eagle with his dove clasped to his breast."
               Evoli laughed at this image; it was a laugh that made her heart stand still, for
                  it was bitter and scornful, but he lightly said:
               "An eagle's nest, with a dove for its inmate, would be a curious spectacle for an
                  ornithologist. Do you not know that the lordly bird would soon rend his timid
                  companion into fragments?"
               "My image may have been false, Senor," replied Marie, gravely; "but I warn you of
                  one thing: If my eagle suspects his mate of a desire to wing her flight from his
                  side, he will rend her. A Corsican slays his wife if she proves
                  faithless."
               "Yes, I know they are a tragic race," he mockingly responded. "Yet have no fears
                  for your fair friend, for I swear to you her safety shall not be compromised by
                  me."
               "You pledge your honor to this?" she earnestly asked.
               "Aye, be at ease with your friends here. Gulietta is young and bright; and she
                  will prove a pleasant companion for a gay young girl like Clarice. When she needs
                  your presence, she will duly warn you. Adieu, fair prophetess. I hope your next
                  applicant will have better fortunes to foretell than you have vouchsafed to
                  me."
               A step was heard approaching, and as it drew near, Evoli disappeared in the
                  opposite direction. Marie looked after
                  him with an expression of vague fear and distrust, but her face brightened at the
                  sound of a familiar voice, and with a sigh of relief she turned to greet
                  Vivaldi.
               "Have you had many inquiries at the shrine of fate?" he asked.
               "Oh, yes; many of the gay butterflies of fashion have been attracted hither; but
                  the sombre tone of my predictions disgusted the most of them. Yes, to-night
                  everything has seemed clouded to me with storms and darkness. I can see nothing
                  bright, and a dim oppression has fallen on my own spirit."
               "Ah, you only describe the feelings of a sensitive person placed in a discordant
                  atmosphere. The sounds of mirth strike with hollow dissonance upon the heart that
                  is not in unison with them. We had done better to leave you to a quiet evening
                  with M. Villeray."
               "No—it was necessary that I should come hither. I have accomplished my mission by
                  so doing, and now I am ready to go."
               Vivaldi regarded her intently, but as he possessed no clue to the meaning of her
                  words, he said:
               "The sparkle and zest of the entertainment are over. I will seek Madame Villeray,
                  and see if she is ready to return home."
               "You will not have your future revealed, then?"
               "No—I lack faith, and, besides, your bones have probably all been used by others;
                  how, then, can one do duty for my especial fate? I do not care to have my bright
                  visions dispelled by predictions of evil, for in the mingled woof of life I cannot
                  expect the golden threads to weave themselves exclusively for me."
               "It is as well, perhaps. Enjoy the sunshine while it lasts, and shelter yourself
                  from the storm of fate as best you may."
               "That is true philosophy, Senora, and I shall act on your advice. Come with me to
                  the end of the lime tree walk, and I will bring our party there to join you."
               Together they descended the pathway, and leaving Marie on a rustic seat, Vivaldi
                  again entered the ball-room. Madame Villeray was looking anxiously for him, for
                  she was desirous of being the first to leave the scene of the revels. The young
                  duke had disappeared, and losing the hope that her daughter might secure so
                  brilliant a conquest, all interest in the scene departed. Their adieux were soon
                  made, and the four were whirled away toward the villa, the hearts of at least two
                  of them filled with happy dreams of the future. Before they parted Vivaldi found
                  means to whisper in the ear of his betrothed:
               "You are mine, cara mia. To-morrow I will see
                  your father, and settle the day that will make me the happiest of men."
               The sudden flush of joy, the tremor that ran through the little hand he held,
                  assured him that she, too, was happy in the prospect of release from the thraldom
                  in which she had lately been held.
               Madame Villeray glanced at her face as they entered the hall, and peevishly
                  said:
               "One would think you had just returned from Heaven, Lucille, in place of a stupid
                  ball. After all Senor Baliera's preparations, the affair was a failure."
               "Oh, maman, how can you say so? I think it was
                  charming. Nothing could have been in better taste."
               "So you may think, you have never seen anything more magnificent,"
                  replied the elder lady superciliously, "but after my experience, it seemed flat
                  and tame. And only to think! you had the chance to fascinate a duke, and did not
                  profit by it."
               Lucille laughed, but she checked the reply that arose to her lips, and carried with her into the solitude of
                  her own room the perfect content with her opening future which filled every pulse
                  of her beating heart.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXII.
               DEADLY JEALOUSY. ITS FATAL ACTION.
               A FEW few hours after the departure of Evoli, Lisa sought an interview with her
                  foster-son, and informed him of her wish to have her daughter with her for a
                  season. Guilio seemed pleased with the proposal, and promptly said:
               "It is exactly what I wish myself. My own presence is absolutely necessary on my
                  lugger, and I cannot leave Clarice without some companionship. My mate does not
                  manage the bark well, for he has been very nearly captured with a valuable cargo
                  on board."
               "That would have been bad; but does the young Senora know that—that you are a
                  smuggler?"
               He changed color, and then abruptly said:
               "She does not; neither do I wish her to discover it."
               "Then how does she suppose you provide all the fine things that are about her?
                  Outlaws don't usually have the means to buy silks and laces, not to mention other
                  extravagant doings."
               Guilio here looked almost angry; he imperiously replied:
               "My expenses or those of my wife are no business of yours, Lisa. I see that you do
                  not like Clarice; but I warn you not to betray to her the source of the luxury
                  that surrounds her. She does not reason about it, for she is too young and
                  ignorant of life to take thought of such things. It is my pleasure to lavish upon
                  her all I possess, and no one shall say me nay. Let Gulietta come as speedily as
                  possible, for I must leave the cavern in two days, to be absent probably as many
                  weeks."
               "I thank you for the permission to have my child with me, though it was
                  ungraciously accorded. Oh, Guilio, mio, you have
                  forgotten the days of your childhood. In your devotion to your new idol you throw
                  aside all consideration for others."
               "You accuse me unjustly," replied Guilio," with deepening color, for he felt that
                  her words were true. "I love you, and trust you. I remember all your care of me
                  during my childhood, and I have shown that I did not forget it by aiding you as
                  soon as it was in my power to do so. But from the day I brought my bride hither
                  you have shown that you dislike her; why, I know not, nor do I care to know. Her
                  sweetness, her beauty, have failed to conciliate you; you reproach me with
                  ingratitude, yet it is you who are ungrateful when you repulse the advances of the
                  loveliest creature under the sun."
               Lisa coldly replied:
               "I am aware that such is your estimate of her, therefore I cannot be expected to
                  share it. The heart of the child I nursed as my own has gone after a strange
                  woman, and has closed itself to me. It is natural, perhaps, but it is hard to
                  bear."
               A few tears fell from the fiery black eyes, and Guilio felt almost self-condemned.
                  He more tenderly said:
               "Pardon me, Lisa, if I have unconsciously wounded you. I adore my wife; we are in
                  the first bloom of our passion, and I have naturally been much occupied with her;
                  but I also have a strong attachment for you. I love Guiletta as a sister, and when
                  she comes, perhaps through her, we shall all learn to understand each other
                  better."
               "The sooner she comes the better then," returned Lisa, gloomily.
               
               "Yes, by all means; I will inform Clarice of her expected arrival, and prepare her
                  to regard her as a sister."
               He turned away, and reentered the passage leading to his own apartments, and as
                  the woman listened to his retreating steps, her dark eyes lighted up with a
                  vindictive gleam. Muttered words of ominous import burst from her lips while she
                  arranged the cheeses she was preparing for Angelo to take to market in the valley.
                  On his return on the following evening he was to bring Gulietta with him, and with
                  a kind of fierce joy the mother anticipated her arrival.
               Clarice learned with dismay that Guilio must leave her for a season, and when she
                  was convinced that it must be so, she gladly welcomed the prospect of a companion
                  suited to her in age during the tedious days of his absence.
               Gulietta arrived the next day, and after a brief and impressive interview with her
                  mother, she was conducted to the presence of the young wife. She was a few years
                  older than Clarice, and the tall, lithe figure, blooming cheeks, and starry eyes
                  of the girl, with her abundance of raven hair, gave one the idea of a gipsy queen.
                  Her manner was as stately as her person, and her voice was clear, hard and
                  metallic. The voice is often a key to the character, and that of this grand
                  specimen of mere flesh and blood beauty did not belie the nature that lay folded
                  within her.
               Two flowers might have typified these women, thus brought in deadly rivalry with
                  each other; Clarice as the stately lily, with its white and delicate petals
                  withering beneath a rude touch, and Gulietta as the Virginia creeper, with its
                  poisonous wealth of scarlet blossoms. The refined beauty of her rival awakened a
                  pang of envious jealousy in the heart of Gulietta, and as she compared her own
                  style with the delicate loveliness of Clarice, she marvelled if Guilio could ever
                  be brought to console himself for her loss, with a being so different in every
                  respect as herself.
               He should, he must, was her resolve; love such as she felt for him could achieve
                  more than this, and the heart that had wandered from her should yet own the power
                  of her charms. Yet all this was concealed beneath an appearance of interest and
                  affection for the wife of her early playmate.
               Gulietta played her part so well that Guilio who watched her with keen eyes during
                  the week he remained after her arrival, was satisfied that the affection she felt
                  for himself was only that of a tender sister. Once he feared it might have been
                  otherwise, but now he felt reassured. In her convent Gulietta had acquired
                  accomplishments not often bestowed on persons of her class, and Clarice found in
                  her a companion suited to her taste. It was speedily arranged between them that in
                  the weeks of Guilio's absence they were to spend a portion of every day in the
                  cultivation of music, and in reading together such books as Gulietta had brought
                  with her from the convent.
               Hitherto almost shut out from the treasures of literature, with the vague longings
                  of genius, and aspirations after the beautiful in art and nature, Clarice eagerly
                  grasped at any means of improvement that came within her reach; Gulietta promised
                  all the assistance it was in her power to bestow, and the former expressed her
                  thanks so warmly and gracefully as almost to touch the heart filled with baleful
                  enmity toward her.
               At the moment of departure, Guilio reiterated his charges to Lisa and her daughter
                  to take the best care of his precious darling; he extricated himself from the
                  clinging arms of his bride, tore himself away with the promise to return as
                  speedily as possible. Clarice retired to indulge her sorrow alone, and the two
                  women remained together.
               Their eyes met, and the mother asked:
               "Have you the nerve to carry out my plan?"
               "Why not trust to this Benedetto of whom you have told me?" replied the daughter, evasively. "He will
                  remove her from my path without the necessity of crime."
               "Aye, but the safety of Guilio will be risked in carrying her off, as long as
                     she lives, there will danger that her existence may become known
                  to him. Believe me, Gulietta, when I tell you that no other woman can be anything
                  to him till this one is cold in death."
               A savage gleam shot from the eyes of the girl, and she hissed through her half
                  closed teeth:
               "To think that such a pale-faced thing as that should have stepped between me and
                  the one hope of my life! Guilio knew that I loved him; he has known it from our
                  childhood, and he should have understood my nature better than to have dared to
                  give me a rival. Yes, I will do it; I will blacken my soul with crime to gain him.
                  Give me the deadly extract you have prepared, and I will use it so deftly she
                  shall never know what hurt her."
               Her mother gazed fixedly upon her a few seconds, and then drew from her bosom a
                  small vial filled with a murky-looking liquid. She whispered:
               "It is the life of the laurel, unskilfully extracted, but certain in its effect.
                  When Guilio returns, it must be to find his dainty darling in her grave. It is the
                  only safety for him, the only hope for you."
               Gulietta took the vial, held it up to the light, and shook its contents. A strange
                  smile quivered on her lips as she said:
               "We are curious creatures. To think that the living consciousness can be blotted
                  out by a few drops of this innocent looking fluid, the blood be frozen at its
                  fount, the heart robbed of its pulsations. Yet—yet it is a fearful thing to
                  do."
               "Have you grown cowardly in your convent?" asked Lisa, disdainfully. "Is it not
                  better that she should perish in the flush of her youth and happiness, before
                  blight has fallen upon her, than that you shall live a hopeless, disappointed
                  woman? Choose between the two."
               "I have chosen," replied Gulietta, with a fierce gesture, as she
                  concealed the vial about her person. "This fair piece of pride and impertinence
                  shall not trouble you much longer, mother. But what shall we say to Benedetto,
                  when he returns to find her in her shroud?"
               "I shall tell him that confinement in the cavern brought on a violent fever, which
                  proved fatal in a few hours. There will be nothing to disprove my statement, for
                  in this climate such things are of too frequent occurrence to cause suspicion of
                  my truth."
               "But if he should suspect?"
               "Then he may think what he pleases. Thank Heaven! we are above the reach of the
                  law in our stronghold, so what matters it if we are at war with all below us?
                  Guilio is an outlaw, with vendetta declared against him, incurred for the sake of
                  this pretty doll; why, then, shall she who wishes to assume her place shrink also
                  from the ban of society?"
               "I do not; to win him, I am ready to dare everything," replied Gulietta, with an
                  expression of concentrated purpose which assured her mother that there was no
                  shrinking in her nature. She looked the meditated crime firmly in the face, and
                  her heart did not quail before it.
               With a smile of triumph, Lisa said:
               "You are a true Corsican; fiery as the lava which rushes seething from the
                  crater's mouth, fearless as the steel that flashes in the front of the battle, I
                  recognize in you blood of my blood. Make your own fate, my daughter; let no
                  relenting turn you aside from the bright future that opens before you, and you
                  shall yet be Queen of the Mountain."
               The girl's cheeks flushed, her lips parted, and a savage gleam of joy illuminated the dusky depths of her
                  eyes as she whispered:
               "And the beloved of Guilio's heart; that is my crown, for the diadem of an empress
                  would be worthless in comparison with that hope."
               "Cherish it, then, for it shall meet fruition."
               Lisa turned away, and busied herself with her ordinary occupations as quietly as
                  if nothing unusual had occurred. It was not thus with Gulietta. She paced the vast
                  length of the cavern with the swiftness of a caged leopardess, brooding over the
                  fatal power of life and death that rested in her keeping, and lashing herself into
                  a kind of blind, jealous fury, against the innocent cause of her suffering.
               Clarice once out of her way, she felt assured that, in his great anguish at her
                  loss, Guilio must turn to her for consolation. Gradually she would win her way to
                  his heart, till she had made him her own forever. Forever! she
                  shuddered as she recalled the teachings she had so vainly received.
               "No murderer shall ever enter the kingdom of Heaven." Bah! why should she fear
                  that sentence? Away with doubt; action, action was now the only surety for the
                  future. Before the return of Benedetto, the deed must be accomplished, or it would
                  be too late.
               She smoothed her brow, decked her lips in smiles, and went to join her intended
                  victim. She found Clarice preparing to go out on the platform which looked toward
                  the sea, in the hope that she should catch a glimpse of Guilio's lugger, as she
                  flitted past their eyrie. Gulietta accompanied her, and remained until the vessel
                  appeared, and a signal agreed on between the lovers was hoisted, to point out her
                  identity to the eyes her commander knew would be watching for its appearance.
                  Clarice waved her handkerchief in reply, and again wept bitterly.
               Gulietta used her utmost efforts to console her, but she soon wearied of the task,
                  and left her to the indulgence of her sorrow, under the pretext of assisting her
                  mother in her domestic duties.
               When twilight fell, she summoned Clarice to their frugal supper of broccio and cream. She came in reluctantly, and
                  scarcely tasted the food set before her; but there was a bottle of wine upon the
                  table, from which her companion insisted she should drink. It was the vintage of
                  her own convent, and had been made by the nuns. Gulietta had brought a dozen
                  bottles with her, as a present to her foster-brother, and Clarice must pronounce
                  upon its merits. Not caring to appear churlish, she languidly complied with the
                  urgent entreaties addressed to her; but, after sipping a few drops from the glass
                  offered to her, she said:
               "It has a singular, bitter taste; something like the petals of the wild flowers I
                  have sometimes chewed. I like our own red wine best."
               "That is because you scarcely taste it. Pray do honor to our nectar by drinking at
                  least half the glass I poured for you. If you do not, I shall think my humble
                  offering scorned."
               If Clarice had looked up, and beheld her paling cheek, her wild eyes glittering
                  with fearful excitement, she would instinctively have dropped the fatal draught;
                  but she did not—she wearily said, as she lifted it to her lips:
               "I cannot now refuse to drink it, Guiletta. Perhaps it will make me sleep soundly,
                  and take this dreary pain from my heart."
               "Aye, Senora, it will surely do that. Never have you slept so deeply, or so
                  sweetly, as the slumber this draught will produce. It is a matchless
                  sedative."
               Clarice drank half the wine, and replaced the glass suddenly; she murmured:
               
               "It affects me strangely. My head is giddy, and everything begins to glimmer
                  before me. What is it? Oh, am I dying, and my Guilio away!"
               She attempted to rise, but fell back upon her seat insensible. Trembling with
                  excitement, Gulietta approached her, felt her pulse, and passed her hands over her
                  lips; the breath of life still issued from them in fitful gasps, and she
                  muttered:
               "Stupid fool! why did she not drink the whole, and end the tragedy at once? I
                  wonder if I can force enough between her lips to destroy her without delay, for in
                  this condition she may lie for hours fluttering between life and death."
               Lisa, who had been on the watch, here entered, pale as a phantom, looking the very
                  embodiment of terror. She hurriedly asked:
               "Is she really dead?"
               "Not quite; her dainty palate did not relish the wine, and I could not persuade
                  her to drink enough to strike her down as with a stroke of lightning. See!"
               Lisa wrung her hands in terror.
               "What shall we do! what shall we do! Angelo has come, and he says Senor Benedetto
                  will be here in another hour. He met him at the cove, and he would have been here
                  before now, but for his care about a box he brought with him. He would not come on
                  till he had provided the means of getting it safely here."
               "Do!" repeated the girl, fiercely. "Just what we would have done if he had come
                  later. Show him the corpse of his dainty lady."
               "But she is not dead; she may not die. He is keen as Saladin's cimeter; he will
                  comprehend what we have attempted, and if he cannot restore her, he will punish us
                  direfully."
               The girl turned on her fiercely.
               "You have your story prepared; tell it to him, if it will serve you at all, it
                  will serve you now."
               "No, no; if she were really dead, the odor of the poison would soon leave her; but
                  when he comes he will be able to detect it on her breath. In place of letting her
                  die, our only hope of safety lies in keeping life in her."
               "And lose the reward of our crime? Never! let her die!"
               "But I tell you this fearful man will ruin us. He will reveal all to my husband—to
                  Guilio. Oh, is there no antidote to this poison?"
               "Doubtless there is one, but we have it not. I thought you had nerve for anything,
                  but you seem scared out of your wits."
               There was deep contempt in her tones, and her mother sharply retorted:
               "If you knew the man that is coming, you would be frightened, too. He would no
                  more mind crushing you and me, than if we were a couple of weeds upon his path. He
                  has power, will and recklessness, then why shall I not fear him?"
               "You should have thought of all this before you undertook to circumvent him. I
                  will meet this formidable Benedetto, and bear the brunt of his anger, since you
                  shrink from doing so."
               "Wait till you see him, and then utter your bravado if you dare. Come, help me
                  lift this girl and put her in bed; if he found her here, and thus, he would
                  destroy us both."
               Between them they lifted Clarice, and carried her to her couch. Gulietta loosened
                  her clothes, and wrapped her in a dressing-robe; she then sought for some pungent
                  essence upon her toilet, and her lip curled with fierce scorn as she saw the many little elegant trifles
                  scattered about it. She bathed the face of the insensible girl with rose-water,
                  with the hope that its perfume would overpower the subtle odor of the potion she
                  had swallowed; but when she bent down at intervals to see if respiration yet
                  continued, the sickening taint of the laurel water came with each labored sigh
                  that issued from the oppressed breast of that pale and silent form.
               Lisa chafed her hands, covered her with blankets, and used every effort to restore
                  the languid circulation before the arrival of the dreaded Benedetto. An hour, that
                  seemed to the two women an eternity, thus passed away; another was slipping by,
                  and they began to hope that he would not reach the cavern that night, when the
                  sound of approaching voices were heard.
               Evoli and Angelo, gaily talking, were coming through the chapel, and how to
                  account to them for the strange scene that awaited them, was the thought uppermost
                  with both the women. Angelo, they knew, was honest and open as the day, and the
                  deadly treachery they had almost accomplished would be to him a terrible
                  revelation, if comprehended in its full extent.
               As they drew near, Lisa summoned courage to go and meet them. Her pallid face and
                  disordered appearance struck her husband, and he hurriedly asked:
               "Has anything happened to the senora? Why do you look so wild, Lisa?"
               "Oh, dear, oh, dear, that I should live to see this hour. The poor child lies
                  insensible, stricken down like a broken flower by a sudden and incomprehensible
                  attack which came on her at supper. Oh! I am afraid she will never unclose her
                  sweet eyes again."
               Evoli glared on her one instant, and the poor actor felt as if the secrets of her
                  soul were laid bare before that glance.
               He made no reply, but dropping the box which he and Angelo were carrying between
                  them, rushed like a madman to the side of Clarice.
               The death-like immobility of her form filled him with nameless terror; he wildly
                  passed his hands over her face, clasped her chilling hands, and bent down to
                  ascertain if she yet breathed. As he raised his head again he glanced at Gulietta;
                  it was but a single flash of his eyes, but it took in her shrinking form, her half
                  defiant, half terrified expression, and he comprehended the dire meaning of the
                  scene before him. He merely said:
               "It is not yet too late. Thank Heaven that I arrived in time to save her; aid me
                  in this to the utmost of your ability as you value your own life."
               His voice was low and concentrated, and his words only reached the ears for which
                  they were intended, but the unscrupulous woman felt that she had met her master.
                  There could be no trifling here, for what this man said he fully meant, and she
                  quailed before the power she dared not resist.
               With rapid movements Evoli sought a small medicine-chest, and taking from it a
                  vial, forced a portion of its contents between the lips of the senseless Clarice.
                  He watched its effect with intense solicitude, and at intervals repeated the dose.
                  Gradually faint symptoms of returning life were visible; a pale rose-tint returned
                  to her cheeks, her lips moved tremulously, and she made efforts to lift the heavy
                  lids that vailed her eyes.
               At length he arose, and said to Lisa, who had followed all his motions with that
                  kind of fear inspired by the venomous reptile before it strikes its prey,
               "The senora will live. You and your husband can retire, and your daughter and
                  myself will watch beside her."
               "If we can be of any use, we had better stay, too," said Angelo, bluntly. "I would not for my right hand
                  have Guilio come back and find his bird of beauty dead."
               "I have told you she will not die. Lisa should return to her child, and you must
                  rest before you go forth to your daily labor. Go, then, good Angelo; this young
                  girl and myself can take every care of the senora."
               Angelo was not sorry to have this assurance, for he had been wandering over the
                  hills all day, and felt the need of sleep. His wife was glad to escape from the
                  penetrating eye that followed all her movements, and, she felt, fathomed her to
                  the depths of her soul. In a moment of dire temptation she had been incapable of
                  resisting the impulses of the wild nature within her, but she felt the mute
                  accusation of that unflinching glance with a shrinking dread that was
                  incomprehensible to her. She submissively said:
               "Since Senor Benedetto wishes it, we had better leave him to watch with Gulietta.
                  She is young and strong, and can easily bear her share of the burden."
               "Yes, mother; go to the child, he may wake and miss you if you stay here too long.
                  Senor Benedetto and I can do all that is now necessary for our patient."
               Thus urged, the husband and wife retired, leaving the two watchers alone. Evoli
                  listened to the echo of their retreating steps, and when they died away in the
                  distance he turned to the girl and surveyed her a moment without speaking. She
                  looked up, and met the glance which she felt was upon her, but her eyes had in
                  them no deprecation, no quailing. The fire of pride and passion burned in their
                  depths, and her red lips quivered as if resolutely repressing the words ready to
                  pour forth in vindication of her crime. He at length spoke, in low, ringing
                  tones:
               "In this case life has been tampered with. Yours was the
                  hand that did it, for I recognize in you one that can act, while your mother, less
                  firm in her wickedness, can only plan. Speak the truth—why have you attempted to
                  destroy the wife of Guilio!"
               The emphasis upon the last words caused the blood to leap to her cheek, and she
                  slowly answered:
               "Because she is his wife. You knew it before; then why have you compelled me to
                  say it?"
               "Then you love him?"
               She passionately replied:
               "Have I not proved it in this confession which you have wrung from me, I know not
                  how or why?"
               A subtle smile played upon his lip, and he said:
               "I have never yet met one who could resist my power. It was my birth-right and my
                  best inheritance. It is the secret of a grand organization, given for good or for
                  evil as it is wielded by its possessor. I glory in it for the sway it gives me
                  over men, and I have not often abused it. Could not your weak mother have told you
                  that this statue of breathing clay that lies so helplessly before us would be
                  removed from your path without danger either to you or to her?"
               "She feared for Guilio's safety; she dreads the entrance of the sbirri into our
                  fastness. It may lead to ruin to all who dwell here."
               "Therefore she would not abide by her compact. Truly, worse than an invasion of
                  the sbirri would have happened to her had this young creature perished."
               "I do not know what can be worse than ruin to all one loves."
               "Oh, yes, there are things infinitely worse. Torture, despair, death; all these
                  would I have inflicted on both you and her if I had entered this cavern to find my
                  idol a corpse. Strong as you may believe your love to Guilio to be,
                  it is an idle fancy in comparison with the fiery passion Clarice has aroused in my
                  heart. I was the friend of her husband; I have broken his bread, shared the shelter of his roof; I am of that caste which
                  prizes honor above wealth; yet all—all has been forgotten in the frenzied hope of
                  snatching her from his arms. I can do it, I shall do it, for the life I have saved
                  belongs of right to me. Act your part, and the outlawed chief shall remain here
                  alone, to be consoled in time by you."
               Gulietta listened with breathless eagerness; she asked:
               "What shall I do to produce such a result? Remove her, and I ask no more."
               "You must induce Clarice to believe that Guilio was faithless to you; that he was
                  bound to you by every tie that should influence a man of honor. She is sensitive
                  and proud, and many other influences will be brought to bear upon her, which will
                  aid in the decision she herself will make to go forth with me."
               "But how are you to accomplish all this, Senor? You are an exile yourself, and
                  Clarice loves Guilio."
               "My sentence of exile is revoked, and I shall return to Italy to claim my
                  hereditary rank, which is noble. Clarice is also the daughter of an ancient race,
                  and the heiress to great wealth. I tell you this, that you may see I have the
                  power to perform what I promise. I shall lift your rival to a sphere so far above
                  her present one, that Guilio would as soon think of seeking his lost love among
                  the stars of Heaven as in my palace."
               Gulietta listened to this revelation with intense interest. She bowed her head
                  respectfully, and replied:
               "I trust you, and I consent to serve you to the utmost of my power."
               "That is well, but I warn you that the least deviation from the line laid down for
                  you will be fatal to your hopes. Help me to win Clarice in my own way, and Guilio
                  shall be yours."
               Gulietta bent her head in assent, and again silence reigned between them. Evoli
                  watched with intense solicitude the flickering life which struggled to regain its
                  vital power in the delicate frame of Clarice, and with deep joy he saw that she
                  was slowly reviving to consciousness. Aided by Gulietta, his efforts were
                  unceasing to restore the stagnant circulation, but the gladness with which he felt
                  the small hand he held fluttering with renewed life, was slightly dashed by the
                  first words that escaped her lips, she murmured as one waking from a dream:
               "Oh, my Guilio, clasp me close; do not—do not let me escape from you. Death is
                  cold, cold, and its icy touch is upon me."
               "You are safe," whispered Evoli. "The skeleton hand shall not grasp you yet. Oh,
                  Clarice, look on me, and see that I have given you back to life, and
                  not your faithless Guilio."
               These words seemed to arouse her inner consciousness, for she struggled to lift
                  her heavy eyelids, and made a vain effort to arise.
               "Raise her head, and sustain it carefully," commanded Evoli. Gulietta submissively
                  obeyed, and the pale face of Clarice rested upon her breast, and her long hair
                  swept over her, though she almost shivered with repulsion at its touch. Evoli
                  understood the source of her emotion, and he said:
               "Be very tender with her, Senora, for the burden you bear is very precious to more
                  hearts than one."
               He bent over Clarice, and earnestly regarded her; beneath that magnetic gaze her
                  eyes were slowly unveiled, and she looked at him with an expression of vacant
                  surprise. She faintly said:
               "I do not understand; I thought Guilio had returned. Lay me down again, and let me
                  sleep off this languor. It clouds my brain; I can see nothing truly."
               
               "Ah, you have only seen too much!" muttered Gulietta, inaudibly, and she carefully
                  replaced her head upon her pillow. Evoli pressed her hand to his lips again and
                  again; she feebly attempted to draw it from his clasp, while a faint flush came
                  upon her cheek, but a controlling power she could not resist seemed to overpower
                  her feeble will, and she fell into a tranquil slumber with her hand still held in
                  both his own.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               THE TEMPTER. A WEAK HEART.
               THUS the watchers sat hour after hour, each one bringing in its passage renewed
                  life to the being who had so nearly slipped from the shores of existence into the
                  wide sea of eternity. Gulietta watched the face of Evoli, and a kind of remorseful
                  joy arose in her heart that her fell purpose had been stayed in its
                  accomplishment. Since Clarice could live, and become the light of the stranger's
                  home, far removed from all her early ties, it was best so. It was far safer to
                  deceive than to destroy, and she was ready to play the part assigned her with such
                  apparent truth as must bring conviction to the mind of the confiding wife.
               On the following morning Clarice awoke languid, but perfectly calm, and conscious
                  of all that was passing around her. Evoli placed himself where she could not see
                  him, and watched the interview between the rivals.
               "I have been very ill, I believe—suddenly, strangely ill," said the soft voice
                  which sounded as music in his ears. "What could have caused such a seizure? Have
                  you any knowledge of sickness, Gulietta, for I was never ill in my life
                  before."
               "The healthiest persons are often subject to the most severe attacks," replied the
                  girl, evasively. "For a season you were in great danger, but fortunately Senor
                  Benedetto arrived just in time to tell us what to do for you. My mother and I were
                  so frightened that we did not know how to aid you effectually."
               "Senor Benedetto," repeated Clarice, with an accent of surprise. "I scarcely
                  expected him to return here while Guilio is away; but since he saved my life, I
                  must not cavil at his coming. Where is he now?"
               "He watched beside you with me till you were sleeping sweetly, and then retired to
                  obtain some rest himself."
               Clarice sank back and seemed absorbed in thought; presently she said:
               "You too must be tired, Gulietta. I thank both you and Senor Benedetto for your
                  kindness, but will not tax it farther. I still feel like a tired child, and I
                  shall soon sleep again. Lie down and rest, I entreat you."
               Gulietta suffered herself to be persuaded, and after she retired Clarice lay in a
                  half dreamy state, similar to that which is produced by the use of morphine, a
                  crowd of undefined memories and fancies strangely mingling in her mind. She had
                  dreamed that Guilio was beside her, clasping her hand in his, and holding her back
                  from death during those long hours of semi-consciousness, and now she knew that
                  another had been her saviour. To Evoli she owed her life, and deep in her soul
                  awoke the conviction that he would claim what he had rescued from the dark
                  oblivion of an early grave.
               She already seemed to belong less to herself than to him, for he had cast over her
                  a spell she felt herself too feeble to resist. She vainly tried to drive such
                  fantasy away. Benedetto was the friend of her husband, and he had only sought to
                  save her for Guilio's sake; she was nothing, could be nothing to him. Then he had brought her the
                  decision of her unknown cousin; perhaps he bore with him the power to release her
                  from the life she felt would soon become intolerable to her if Guilio must often
                  be absent from her.
               After a few more hours of repose she felt strong enough to rise and make her
                  toilette. Unconsciously she selected the most becoming morning robe in her
                  possession—a rose-colored wrapper, which harmonized with the delicate fairness of
                  her complexion. When Gulietta appeared, she was quite surprised to find Clarice
                  already dressed, and sitting in the leafy dining hall. The girl had already taken
                  the precaution to remove the drugged wine, and no evidence remained of the event
                  of the preceding evening.
               In reply to her congratulations, Clarice declared herself almost restored to her
                  usual health, and desired her to inform Senor Benedetto that she was ready to
                  receive him, and hear the news he had brought from her friend Marie.
               Evoli came immediately to join her, and after she had expressed her thanks for the
                  service he had rendered her on the previous night, Clarice proposed that they
                  should seek the platform overlooking the sea, for she felt as if its breath would
                  revive her enfeebled energies.
               He readily assented, and together they went toward it. The manner of Evoli was
                  punctiliously reserved, and in the interest of the tidings of which she knew he
                  was the bearer, Clarice forgot her fancies of the morning. He placed her on a
                  seat, in a convenient spot near the edge of the rock, and replied to her inquiries
                  concerning Marie:
               "Senora Montoni wishes to remain some time with her friends, and she was glad to
                  hear that you will have a companion in her absence."
               Clarice tried to repress her own eagerness, as she asked:
               "And my cousin? what was the result of your mission? Will he divide the
                  inheritance with me, or will he play the part of the churl, and grasp the
                  whole?"
               "Lieutenant Vivaldi would gladly share the estate with you, but the terms of your
                  uncle's will forbid it. You must have all, or none."
               Her cheek flushed to a vivid rose, and then an expression of pale disappointment
                  settled upon her features. But she presently said, with forced composure:
               "Then my fate is fixed. My father will not claim his daughter, and my cousin will
                  gain the inheritance. Let us go in, Senor. The air is cooler than I thought; it
                  chills me to the heart."
               Evoli silently offered his arm to assist her over the rugged path. This was not
                  the moment to speak of his own passion, for he felt that she would now resent it,
                  and probably banish him from her presence. But a few more weeks with the subtle
                  poison of suspicion working in her mind against him she had so blindingly and
                  trustingly loved, would open the way for his insidious wiles. His hand once upon
                  her fate, its grasp should never be loosened while life lasted.
               The days that followed opened a new era in the life of Clarice. Evoli had brought
                  with him a box of books, selected with reference to her peculiar tastes; they were
                  works of imagination, and the passionate poetry of his own tongue was read aloud
                  by him with that pathos and expression which imparted to it a double charm.
               All the stores of his highly cultivated mind were brought into requisition to show
                  her how far superior he was to the man on whom she had bestowed her hand. Clarice
                  felt the captivating charm of his manner, and unconsciously compared him with
                  Guilio to the disadvantage of the latter. She sighed as she thought the wife Evoli
                  might choose would be elevated and refined by association with a man of such
                  varied culture, while Guilio cared little for the lore of books, and still less
                  for the elegance of thought and expression which would render a man distinguished
                  in society.
               
               In short, the power of race was beginning to make itself felt in the soul of this
                  inexperienced girl, and the innate love of the beautiful and refined which is the
                  best inheritance of the cultivated classes, now asserted its influence in an evil
                  moment for her fidelity to her mountain chief. She almost ceased to think of
                  Guilio's return, for the days passed all too swiftly in this charmed intercourse
                  of kindred minds. The mornings were spent in reading, the afternoons in the marine
                  grotto, which often echoed with the music of Evoli's magnificent voice, and
                  Clarice listened entranced by its melody.
               Gulietta always accompanied them, and Clarice dreamed not of the insidious power
                  that was winding its coils around her. The girl seemed deeply depressed, and
                  Clarice often tried to draw from her the cause of her unhappiness. At length, with
                  a passionate burst of tears, Gulietta told her that she had been deserted by her
                  lover; that every pledge had passed between them, and then he had falsely given
                  his hand to another.
               Clarice listened with tender sympathy; she attempted to console her, but Gulietta
                  repelled her in such a manner as caused a cold doubt to thrust itself into her
                  mind. She suddenly asked:
               "You and Guilio were reared together; you were his foster-sister, he did not seek
                  to——"
               Her voice refused to utter the words her heart dictated, for they seemed to her to
                  be a cruel wrong toward her absent husband.
               "What have I done! what have I said!" exclaimed Gulietta, breaking from her. "Oh,
                  Clarice, forgive me! I should never have spoken of my wrongs to you, but they have
                  been bitter, bitter, and hard to bear!"
               Clarice stood an instant pale as if stricken into stone. When she recovered voice
                  to speak, she quietly said:
               "If this is so, you should not have come here. I believed you were his sister in
                  affection when he proposed that you should come to me."
               "Till I saw him again, I thought I had conquered myself. Then—the unforgotten past
                  rose up before me. Forgive me; this revelation was not for you to hear, but you
                  have surprised it from me."
               "Forget that it has been made," replied Clarice, with glittering eyes, and an
                  expression of wounded pride which Gulietta was quick to interpret; and she
                  secretly exulted in the success of her nefarious scheme.
               The thought uppermost in the mind of Clarice was the great sacrifice she had been
                  willing to make for the husband of her choice. Everything her heart most eagerly
                  coveted—that her very temperament rendered almost necessary to her happiness—she
                  had relinquished to remain with him, and he was the perjured lover of another
                  woman! It was a fatal blow, brooded over in silence till it sunk into the depths
                  of her soul, and rankled there.
               Why should she persist in her refusal of her father's offers, for the sake of a
                  man who had acted thus? Could she not forget their brief dream of love, and find
                  happiness in such pursuits as were most congenial with her nature, while he
                  returned to his first allegiance. She began dimly to comprehend that she was not
                  fitted for the life she must live upon this isolated rock, cut off from nearly all
                  communion with the outside world. Evoli had told her that he must soon return to
                  Italy, and she thought, with a shudder, that his departure would snap the only
                  link that bound her to the father she had abjured; the brilliant destiny that
                  might have been hers; for with the intuition of her sex she divined that Evoli
                  loved her; that he was far superior in rank to his present associates, and had she
                  been free, she might have shared his greatness.
               
               Ah! why had they not met before the inexorable fate which now separated them had
                  been embraced? then she would never have marred her future by wedding Guilio, for
                  her heart would have sprung at once to meet its true master. She would start from
                  these thoughts as if stung by some venomous reptile, and look up to meet the deep
                  eyes of her tempter fixed upon her with such thrilling power as made her half
                  believe in the stories of the evil eye. She sometimes even confusedly thought that
                  his will forced these traitorous regrets into her mind, for in his presence they
                  recurred again and again, while in solitude, her faith returned to her absent
                  husband, and she wished he would come back, and save her from even a dream of
                  treachery to the vows she had so lately plighted.
               Then Guilio's supposed treachery to Gulietta arose before her, and her heart was
                  torn in the conflict of feeling that ensued. At moments she struggled fiercely to
                  escape from the net that was narrowing around her, and her cheek grew daily more
                  delicate, her eyes lost their soft charm, and were alternately fierce with the
                  fires of jealousy, or glittering with excitement over the vision of the new and
                  untried world she might enter under such brilliant auspices, if it were only her
                  will to do so. Evoli gave her clearly to understand that her own consent once
                  given, he could restore her to her birthright without danger to herself or Guilio,
                  but she must give up her husband.
               Six weeks elapsed before Guilio returned. He had been unavoidably detained, and he
                  came back in the gayest spirits to find Clarice so changed that he started in
                  dismay when he beheld her. The inexplicable attack of illness from which she had
                  so narrowly escaped, accounted for her pallor and nervousness, but the change in
                  her manner to himself must have some deeper source.
               He glanced suspiciously toward Gulietta, and the look was not lost on Clarice.
               "Yes, he fears that she has betrayed him," was her bitter thought, and she
                  extricated herself from his embrace, and sat down white and panting with
                  emotion.
               Evoli had gone to the cove to meet him, but did not return with him. He had
                  planted the germ of discord, and was sure of its fruit, but he did not care to
                  witness its first budding. When they met he informed Guilio of the ill success of
                  his mission to Bastia, but he heard it with more indifference than his agent
                  expected. He merely said:
               "I feared as much; but if I can ply my old trade as successfully as in this last
                  venture, I can provide my dainty little queen all she can require."
               "Aye—even to the hoped for residence in Paris?" asked Evoli.
               Guilio colored, and hastily replied:
               "That was an idle dream. Clarice could not have been in earnest. What figure could
                  a wild Corsican outlaw make in Parisian society? No, my home is upon
                  the mountain hight, and my true mate will also find her happiness there. I should
                  pine and die in the close walls of a city."
               "And she would flourish in it as an exotic in the warm air of the conservatory.
                  Count Ernesti is wrong; if he could see the delicate loveliness of his daughter,
                  he would receive her on her own terms."
               "I do not wish him to receive her," replied Guilio, brusquely; "she is more my
                  own, since his heart is closed to her; I will be all to her; she is everything to
                  me."
               Evoli turned away to conceal the expression of sarcastic doubt which appeared upon
                  his face. Let Guilio cherish this fancied security; it would only enable him more
                  surely to carry out his plans.
               Falcone was only to remain at the cavern a week, and then make another cruise. To
                  his surprise, Clarice did not object. He could not understand what had changed her so much. At intervals flashes of
                  her former gaiety shone forth; occasionally she was tender as in the early days of
                  their union, but her manner was so fitful, her spirits so clouded, that she became
                  utterly incomprehensible to the simple-hearted youth who loved her better than his
                  own life.
               "Alas! she regrets the sacrifice she is compelled to make for me," was his
                  discouraging thought. "Yet if Clarice loved as fondly as I do, how light they
                  would seem, so long as I adore her."
               The days passed on, sometimes bringing Evoli as a chance guest, and Clarice felt
                  with a sinking heart, and accusing conscience, how much his presence brightened
                  her life. The charm of intellectual companionship once made known to her, caused
                  her to feel more acutely the lack of sympathy between the highest aspirations of
                  her nature and the more mundane soul of Guilio. The poetry that moved her to the
                  very depths of her spirit, he regarded as a mere jingle of fine words; he was a
                  creature of action, passion, and impulse; she one of feeling and sentiment. Had no
                  discordant element mingled with their existence, they might have remained as true
                  to each other as on the day they fled together; but long before the period
                  allotted by her uncle's will expired, the scales hung evenly balanced between
                  misery on one side, and desertion on the other.
               In Guilio's absence, Evoli returned, and resumed the charmed readings. Clarice
                  felt that this should not be permitted; but she had not the courage to banish him
                  from her presence, for she daily felt how necessary to her happiness he had
                  become. The two women concealed these visits from the herdsman, for he was true to
                  the interests of his employer. Angelo was engaged with his out-door occupations
                  all day, and when he returned, he was too weary to inquire into what passed during
                  his absence.
               Evoli had been in the habit of going and coming at his own pleasure, without
                  notice or comment, and he now came and remained equally unobserved.
               One evening he stood upon the platform with Clarice, looking for the return of
                  Guilio's lugger. Suddenly she looked fixedly at him, and asked:
               "What is the trade that Guilio carries on? The unusual luxury that surrounds me in
                  this wild spot causes me to suspect, and fear, I scarcely know what."
               "That he is more of an outlaw than even the vendetta would make him?" replied
                  Evoli, significantly. "Is that your fear, Senora?"
               "I do not believe him to be a pirate; that would be too dreadful; but he may
                  be——"
               She paused, and he added:
               "A smuggler? exactly—you have guessed his occupation."
               Clarice became very pale, her lips compressed themselves, and a gleam of pride
                  flashed from her eyes. After a struggle, she said:
               "I thought him only a fisherman, when I gave him my hand; and humble as the
                  occupation is, I wish he had followed it in preference to the trade he really
                  carries on. I shall henceforth loathe the elegance that is purchased by
                  dishonorable gains."
               "Then leave it forever, angel of my life," he passionately exclaimed. "Clarice, I
                  am noble; I am rich; I ask you to share my home, and title. Your father's arms are
                  opened to you; the church will break the bonds that bind you to this sterile spot.
                  Leave Guilio to his first love, and come with me, for I adore you."
               Clarice started from his side, and a crimson flush swept over her face; then her
                  eyes met his, the blush faded to marble whiteness, and she burst in tears. Evoli
                  would have taken her hand, but she
                  evaded him, and after a struggle to regain calmness, she said:
               "My lot is fixed. What has induced you to believe that my allegiance to Guilio is
                  shaken? Senor, you could not have been aware of the strength of your expressions
                  just now."
               There was a tremulous vibration in her voice, which revealed what her words were
                  designed to conceal. Evoli fixed his pleading, passionate gaze upon her, and
                  rapidly went on:
               "You would immolate yourself upon the altar of fancied duty. Your heart is no
                  longer your husband's. I have probed it to its depths, and I have read all its
                  struggles; seen all its weakness; if weakness it be to respond to the passion of
                  him who loves you with all the strength of his being; who can make you happy.
                  Clarice, do not throw away the brightest hope of your life, and also of mine. The
                  mountain outlaw should never have claimed you as his bride, and it is no crime to
                  tear you from him."
               "But he will destroy me if I prove faithless to him," her pale lips syllabled.
               Evoli laughed scornfully:
               "I will bear you so far beyond his reach, that he shall never find you again. Holy
                  church will release you from your bondage; and as the heiress of your ancestral
                  honors, as the Duchess of Evoli, you shall appear before the world the fairest and
                  loveliest bride that ever blessed a happy and exulting husband. See, Clarice,
                     mia, what I can give you, and
                  compare it with the beggarly lot to which you would condemn yourself."
               Clarice listened in breathless astonishment, and a dazzling vision of pomp and
                  power swept before her for one brief moment; then she whispered in broken
                  tones:
               "Go away; I cannot, dare not listen to you. Leave me to my wretchedness and
                  self-condemnation, for I have been false where I should most jealously have
                  guarded my faith. Had you not seen this, you would never have spoken thus."
               "And he too. You owe him no faith. What has Guilio been? Ask Gulietta, and she
                  will tell you."
               She started, as if a serpent had stung her.
               "His falsehood is no excuse for mine. Besides, Guilio loves me
                  now."
               "And you have ceased to love him. It is the law of nature that like shall seek
                  like. I have found my true Eve, and, whether she will or no, she must forsake her
                  first Eden, and go forth with me."
               "You speak as if you possess the power to compel," she haughtily replied.
               "Only the sweet compulsion of love, my angel. Look into my eyes, and swear to me
                  that I am mistaken, that your heart has never wandered from Guilio, and I leave
                  you to him forever. Ah, bird of beauty, you dare not, for it would be
                  perjury."
               Clarice stood trembling and pale before the power thus daringly asserted, and even
                  her resentment at his boldness seemed to die away as her eyes met his; were held
                  in a gaze that gradually melted into tenderness which she had no power to conceal.
                  Evoli folded her to his breast, and pressed his first kiss upon her glowing
                  lips."
               The next instant she tore herself from his clasp, and fled from him,
                  exclaiming:
               "Go, go—leave me forever. I will not be the companion of your flight. Forget this
                  scene; forget me, for I shall soon be laid where oblivion falls on all."
               She disappeared within the cave, and Evoli turned away with an expression of
                  exulting triumph upon his features.
               Three nights afterwards Matra received the following note:
               
               "The time has come. Obey the directions of the bearer, and abide implicitly by the
                  terms of our compact; thus your reward will be sure."
               The ring which accompanied it attested its genuineness, and Matra, with savage
                  joy, prepared at last to swoop down on his victim and destroy him.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               THE ABDUCTION. THE ANGUISH OF AN ACCUSING SPIRIT.
               WHEN Guilio returned from his cruise, Clarice received him with remorseful
                  tenderness. She felt bitterly self-condemned that she had permitted her thoughts
                  to stray a moment from the duty she owed him. The pageant of pride and splendor
                  that swept at intervals before her mental vision was sedulously put aside, and she
                  chided her vain heart that it was tempted by them even for one instant to forsake
                  the path of honor and duty.
               Clarice had not seen Evoli since the evening she fled from him almost in a state
                  of frenzied excitement. He went forth to meet Guilio, and did not return. As he
                  left the cavern he exchanged a few words with Lisa. In reply she passionately
                  whispered:
               "Guilio will be unharmed? You could not abuse his kindness so foully as to injure
                  him. Promise me this—swear it to me on your life, Senor."
               "I only seek to bear away the woman I love," returned Evoli, evasively. "Have I
                  not before pledged my word that your foster-son shall be well cared for? Since you
                  shrink from this service, let Gulietta point the way to those who come hither to
                  remove her rival. My life on it, she will do it willingly."
               "Ah, yes, she will do it," answered Lisa, vaguely. "I do not know but I might
                  falter at the last, for I fear—I fear that something fatal my happen. I have had
                  warnings of death to one I love. Last night I saw a pale flame glimmering on the
                  hill side; the owls filled the air with their cries, and the sheep dog responded
                  to them in long, doleful wails, till I struck him and made him hush his pitiful
                  clamor. But when he was quieted, it was only to hearken to the spirit drum beating
                  its tattoo within a foot of my head."
               "Nonsense, Lisa, you are full of Corsican superstitions, and of late you have had
                  nothing better to do than to nurse such absurd fancies."
               "You may speak as you will, Senor, but those omens never lie. Besides, as I lay
                  upon my bed last night, I saw the figures of the departed flit past me, clad in
                  the garments of the dead brothers, with hooded mantles and pointed caps, and their
                  ghastly eyes shone on me through the masks they wore. I saw them surround a bier,
                  take it upon their shoulders, and carry it off, as plainly as I see you standing
                  before me now."
               "It was but a dream, Lisa; you slept, and your dreams took the sombre hue of your
                  fears," replied Evoli, impatiently. "At all hazards you must serve me, for I need
                  you, and you are in my power. Think what your fate would be if I but hinted to
                  Guilio the cause of his wife's illness."
               "You would not—you dare not, Senor," she excitedly said.
               "I both could, and would, if you fail me now," he resolutely replied. "It is too
                  late to draw back."
               "Then, then, it must be so; but should any evil befal Guilio, the curse of a broken and deceived heart
                  will surely follow you; aye, and cling to you forever."
               Evoli impatiently turned away; he sternly said:
               "On the sixth evening from this, hold yourself in readiness to admit those who
                  will come hither."
               He left her, and the woman wrung her hands in helpless anguish, for a great dread
                  overshadowed her, and she feared the results that might flow from this treachery
                  to one to whom she was bound by every tie of affection and interest. She saw the
                  days, hours, and moments speed away toward its consummation in a kind of dumb
                  horror. Mechanically she performed her accustomed tasks, and it was not until the
                  last hour arrived that she found courage to impart to her daughter the service
                  that must devolve on her. Lisa felt that she could not point out the path which
                  would lead the myrmidons of Evoli into the secret recesses of their mountain
                  stronghold, and Gulietta must perform this service.
               When at last, in broken tones, she revealed their expected arrival to Gulietta,
                  she received the information with a fierce burst of joy.
               "At last," she panted, "the sickening sight of Guilio's devotion to this
                  pale-faced idiot will be removed far from me. She has ceased to love him, yet he
                  fawns around her, and loads her with caresses which she passively receives. Yes, I
                  am ready to point out the way to those who come at her lover's bidding to tear her
                  from his arms."
               They stood in the upper cavern while they thus spoke together, and as Gulietta
                  ended, Evoli stood before them. He briefly said:
               "All is ready; my friends will be here in a few more moments. I have preceded
                  them, that I may be ready to bear away my prize through the lower outlet. A
                  felucca awaits me near the grotto; the tide is out, and we can pass through the
                  opening to the sea. Gulietta, I see that your nerves are strung up to the
                  requisite point, but where is Angelo?"
               "He has gone down to the villages to sell our cheeses, as is his custom every
                  month."
               "So much the better; we have nothing, then, to fear from his interference. Be
                  firm; when you hear a whistle from without, swing your lamp above your head as a
                  signal, and four trusty men will enter, and follow your steps. Guide them over the
                  rocky descent, and leave the rest to me."
               "Senor, you only seek to remove her; you will give me back my Guilio
                  in safety?" asked the girl, with tremulous fierceness.
               "I swear to leave him to you; his safety shall be cared for. Does that satisfy
                  you?"
               "It does," she murmured. "He will be mine; I ask no more."
               Evoli rapidly passed on, with stern brow and compressed lips. He left the
                  carefully-concealed doors open behind him, and, carrying a small lantern in his
                  hand, threaded his way quickly toward the quiet retreat so soon to become the
                  scene of violence and bloodshed.
               For months Evoli's mind had been firmly made up to the necessity of sacrificing
                  the man he had once called friend, but at this last moment he would have saved him
                  had it been possible to do so without ultimate destruction to himself. He knew the
                  Corsican nature too well to trust his future safety to the wronged and outraged
                  husband. To ensure that, Guilio must die; then why should he recoil from the dire
                  necessity that drove him onward? Had not Falcone also caused the sacrifice of life
                  to gain Clarice; then why should he shrink from delivering him up to the avengers
                  of blood that were even now upon his track?
               
               If a momentary relenting had weakened his purpose, it was put to flight by the
                  scene that greeted his eyes as he lifted the curtain that hung over the inner
                  apartment. Clarice sat with her head resting upon her husband's bosom, her hand
                  clasped in his, and a smile upon her lips as she listened to his voice in a dreamy
                  kind of languor which she vainly tried to believe was akin to their old happiness
                  together.
               At the sound of Evoli's footstep she started up, blushed vividly, and greeted him
                  with a cold hauteur he readily comprehended. It was their first meeting since the
                  passionate scene which preceded Guilio's last return, for since that evening Evoli
                  had purposely held himself aloof. Now the sequel to it was to be enacted, and he
                  nerved himself for that which must speedily follow his arrival.
               Guilio arose, and welcomed his comrade with cordial frankness.
               "I am glad to see you back, Benedetto, for we have sadly missed you, and my
                  lady-bird here has secretly wished for you, I am sure, to read aloud the strains
                  of poetry she so much admires. I wish that my taste lay that way, but it does not,
                  more's the pity."
               "Do not underrate yourself, Guilio," said the low voice of Clarice. "You are
                  sufficiently educated to appreciate the poetry of books, but you naturally prefer
                  that of action. The incidents of our wedding day would make a pretty epic, I am
                  sure."
               "Shall I write it for you, Senora?" asked Evoli, significantly.
               "Are you poet enough to make the attempt?" she replied, without looking toward
                  him, for the impress of his kiss yet burned upon her lips, and she feared to
                  encounter again the eyes which had wrenched from her the secret she had scarcely
                  dared to acknowledge to herself. She trembled in his presence, yet her heart had
                  given a great bound when she heard the sound of his well-known footstep.
               Yet in all probability he had come to bid them adieu forever, for he had said his
                  next visit would be his last, as he was on the eve of returning to his native
                  country. At this thought her heart sank like lead in her bosom, and a film spread
                  over her vision; but she aroused herself from this momentary trance of feeling.
                  She would be true to her wedded lord, though her heart broke in the struggle; and
                  Clarice sat calm, pale, and outwardly composed, while a whirlwind of feeling and
                  emotion rushed through her soul. Evoli said:
               "I have come to bid you adieu. The felucca of Barnardo awaits me below the grotto,
                  and I must avail myself of the low tide to get safely out of the archway."
               "Yes—that was a good idea, Benedetto, for we have more than once passed safely
                  through it, but I am sorry to part from you, my old comrade. You have made my life
                  joyous in other days, and you have witnessed my happiness since I brought my queen
                  hither. We can never forget you—never. Clarice, mia, can you find nothing to say to my old friend, although he may
                  be going from us, perhaps never to return."
               Clarice was speechless; she felt as if a great weight had suddenly fallen upon her
                  heart, and a giant hand seemed clutching her throat. She held out her hand, which
                  Evoli took in his; he felt that it was icy cold, yet its touch thrilled him to the
                  soul.
               At that instant a noise was heard in the outer hall; steps were passing over the
                  chapel floor, heavy, unfamiliar steps, and Guilio sprang toward the entrance,
                  exclaiming:
               "What does this mean? Who enters my stronghold? Can it be that we are
                  betrayed?"
               Clarice would have shrieked, but her voice was frozen on her lips as the curtains parted, and four armed men
                  rushed toward Guilio. There was one moment of blinding horror, and then she
                  impulsively threw herself forward to place herself between her husband and his
                  assassins, but Evoli tore her back; he wound his powerful arms around her, and
                  held her firmly in his clasp, while Matra and his bravos rushed on Guilio with
                  cries of—
               "Vendetta, vendetta; thus we avenge the blood of our slain. Go to thy doom,
                  assassin."
               Of lithe and agile frame, Guilio desperately defended himself, but in a few
                  moments he fell beneath the daggers aimed at his life. At this unexpected
                  consummation, Gulietta rushed in with wild cries, and threw herself beside him.
                  Clarice had fainted, and while the avengers coolly wiped their weapons, and looked
                  down upon the body from which life was welling through many ghastly wounds, Evoli
                  bore his prize away from the scene of blood. He rapidly descended the steps
                  leading to the grotto, followed by one of the men who had taken no part in the
                  conflict.
               Gulietta had guided the men to the entrance of the chapel, believing that Guilio
                  would be bound, and left to be released by herself; but the clash of weapons, the
                  cries that came from the scene of the conflict, revealed too late the extent of
                  the treachery to which she had become a party. Now she wailed, tore her hair, and
                  acted all the extravagances of the wildest grief and remorse.
               "Wretches!" she exclaimed, with glaring eyes and foaming lips, "you were only to
                  have borne the girl away, but you have killed my Guilio, my pride, my darling, the
                  life of my life. Go away; leave me to my despair and penitence, for they will
                  never end."
               The men, rude as they were, recoiled before the sudden blaze of madness that
                  flashed from her eyes. One of them said:
               "She will do us a mischief; put your knife in her, Piero, and end this pother; her
                  squalling deafens me."
               "No—I will not kill a woman: that was not what I bargained for. We expressly
                  spared the chief's wife from the vendetta, then wherefore take the life of this
                  poor girl? By Bacchus! but this den is grandly fitted up, and one can find
                  something more valuable to take away than the blood of our victim."
               At this crisis Lisa rushed in, her hair streaming wildly over her person, and
                  uttering shriek after shriek. She turned fiercely upon the men, and said:
               "You have had your hour, and now your own doom comes. Antonio, my husband, is here
                  with twenty men at his back, and they will speedily avenge him you have
                  slain."
               At this announcement the assassins gathered hastily together, and rushed toward
                  the entrance, for they fully believed that a whole band of outlaws were coming
                  upon them. Lisa followed quickly upon their steps, and closed the doors as they
                  passed through them. When they reached the outer cavern, the men stood in
                  bewildered surprise, for there was no enemy there to encounter. They groped about
                  a few moments to find the door, but soon comprehended that they had been baffled
                  by the superior cunning of a woman. Finding the quest hopeless, they stumbled to
                  the entrance, and went on their way consoling themselves for the loss of plunder
                  with the prospect of the reward that awaited them for the successful consummation
                  of their enterprise.
               With fleet steps Lisa returned to the side of her daughter. She hoarsely said:
               "Get up, girl; cease your wailing, and let us see if anything can be done to help
                  my poor boy. Curse the cruel hearts that dealt the blows, curse the treacherous
                  one that led them on. Too late—too late, I see his purpose."
               
               There was hope breathed in her words, and as Gulietta comprehended their sense,
                  she hushed her cries, raised her prostrate form, and looked upon the face of
                  Guilio. It seemed already set in death, and the girl clasped her hands
                  despairingly.
               "They have killed him! and I, blind fool that I was, led them on. Oh, mother, I
                  shall go wild! I cannot live with this burden upon me."
               Lisa scarcely heeded her; she knelt beside the wounded man, placed her hand upon
                  his heart, felt his wrist to see if a feeble pulsation yet remained, and she
                  rapidly said:
               "There is life in him yet. I know of herbs that will stanch the flow of blood.
                  They have cut and hacked him fearfully, but he may not have a vital wound, and we
                  may save him yet."
               The hope thus expressed inspired the girl with new life. She stifled her cries,
                  and assisted her mother to lift the prostrate form and place it on the bed. As
                  they did so Guilio uttered a faint moan, and with renewed hope they proceeded with
                  their labor of love. Four deep wounds were found upon his person, three of which
                  were in his breast, but the most deadly one had been dealt upon his head from
                  behind.
               With infinite labor the welling tide of life was stanched; Lisa's skill proved to
                  be by no means contemptible, and while she dressed his wounds her daughter
                  moistened his lips with wine, and chafed his cold hands between her own. The
                  result of all their care proved that its object still breathed, but no more.
                  Guilio lay as insensible as death itself, and thus Angelo found him when he
                  returned to the cave.
               The two women gave a confused account of the surprise and attack, carefully
                  concealing their own share in the treachery, and laying its whole burden on the
                  false Benedetto. The herdsman believed them, for he was simple and unsuspicious,
                  and all his care was devoted to the restoration of his wounded master.
               For weeks Guilio lay vibrating between life and death, unconscious of all that
                  passed around him. Life rallied so slowly, that for days the two women who
                  seduously watched him thought all hope was gone; but they did not relax their
                  efforts to save him, and at last he unclosed his sunken eyes, and looked around as
                  if seeking something he missed with pain. With a shuddering sigh he relapsed into
                  his old state, and another wearing interval of suspense ensued. But at last their
                  efforts were crowned with success, and Guilio awoke to consciousness, though weak
                  and helpless as an infant. His first connected words formed themselves into an
                  inquiry for Clarice.
               Lisa and her daughter had their story prepared. With many precautions and much
                  circumlocution, they finally told him that his wife had thrown herself between him
                  and his assassins, and thus perished. Guilio started up, uttered a great cry, and
                  fell back insensible. When he recovered he was quite delirious, and the feeble
                  thread of life was with difficulty prevented from snapping in the dire conflict
                  that ensued. Fever burned in his veins, delirium raged in his brain, and his
                  piercing cries for his lost love might have moved the heart of a stone.
               Angelo was deeply touched by his ravings, and when Guilio again looked upon him
                  with a vision unclouded by delirium, he wished to undeceive him and show him how
                  unworthy of his love he believed Clarice to have proved herself. But Lisa used all
                  her art to persuade him that it was better to delude the forsaken husband with
                  this belief than to let him know she had fled with her lover. She insisted that
                  Benedetto was a great and powerful prince, who would take swift vengeance both on
                  Guilio and themselves if an attempt was made to avenge his duplicity.
               
               Angelo listened to her reasoning and yielded, for he had great faith in Lisa's
                  superior shrewdness; besides, as she argued, it would be better to have their
                  daughter as the future mistress of their stronghold than a strange girl who was so
                  unsuited to their way of life.
               It was three months before Guilio was able to visit the platform, and look out
                  upon the sea. He asked to see the grave of his lost Clarice, and a mound prepared
                  by Angelo, with many remorseful misgivings, was shown to him as her last resting
                  place. This he decked with flowers and shells; he watered it with his tears, and
                  knelt beside it when he prayed.
               The blow upon his head seemed to have permanently injured his brain, for a dull
                  apathy clouded all his faculties, and his days were spent beside the mound, or in
                  sitting upon the platform gazing in sombre vacancy upon the sea. All his interest
                  in life seemed ended, and Gulietta followed, watched over, and talked with him,
                  without producing any impression. He replied to her briefly and coldly, but did
                  not seem to care whether she went or came.
               Guilio's heart lay dead within him, and the fearful struggle for life through
                  which he had passed appeared to have exhausted all the vital power both of mind
                  and body. Gulietta fretted fiercely beneath this untoward condition of affairs,
                  but she still persevered, in the forlorn hope of winning him from the
                  contemplation of the past, to appreciate all the love and care of which he had
                  been the object.
               Thus we must leave him, and follow the retreating footsteps of Evoli and his hard
                  won prize.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXV.
               THE HEIRESS IN HER FATHER'S HOME. FATHER GREGORY'S
                  REVELATION.
               CLARICE lay cold and insensible upon the bosom of her abductor. Evoli, followed by
                  one of the men, reached the grotto, his attendant unmoored the boat, in the stern
                  of which Clarice was tenderly placed. The tide was low, and the archway that
                  opened toward the sea was high enough to permit the small craft to pass out
                  without difficulty.
               As the man rowed toward it, Evoli busied himself with attempts to restore
                  consciousness to the insensible girl, but without effect, and he urged the rower
                  to speed away as rapidly as possible. Under the impulse of the man's powerful
                  strokes the light boat shot swiftly toward the opening; a few clinging vines and
                  aquatic plants were torn away, and they were rocking on the open sea.
               An arrow's flight from the towering cliff lay a felucca evidently awaiting their
                  appearance; for as they approached, the anchor was lifted, and preparations for
                  instant departure were made. By the time our party reached the deck the vessel was
                  ready to wing her rapid flight from the shores of Corsica, and in a few more
                  moments she was under way.
               Clarice was immediately conveyed to a cabin prepared for her use, where a young
                  girl impatiently awaited her appearance. She flew toward the insensible form,
                  clasped it fondly, and wept over it; she used all her art to recall the dormant
                  life, and hailed the first symptoms of revival with a burst of joy sadly at
                  variance with the piercing cry of anguish that issued from the lips of Clarice in
                  the first moment of consciousness.
               "Why do you weep, my Clarice?" asked a well-known voice. "You are with those who love you; for your
                  own Ninetta is restored to you. See—I have come from Isola Rossa to serve as your
                  maid, for you are a great lady now."
               Clarice impulsively fell upon her neck, and wept as if her heart would break. She
                  at length said:
               "If I could feel glad for anything, Ninetta, it would be to have you with me
                  again; but I am wretched and broken-hearted. My Guilio has perished in the
                  vendetta; I saw him fall, pierced with many fatal wounds, and how or why I was
                  spared I know not. At the moment he was struck down I became insensible, and I
                  awoke to find myself here. Who brought me hither? who provided for my safety, and
                  placed you here to console me?"
               Ninetta had learned the story she was to tell, and we must do her the justice to
                  say that she believed it. She instantly replied:
               "A great Italian lord who is a friend of your father, has been hiding in your
                  cavern. Matra's family have been raging for the accomplishment of the vendetta
                  against poor Guilio. You, too, were to have been sacrificed through the treachery
                  of a woman named Lisa, whose daughter Guilio was once pledged to marry. They gave
                  admittance to the assassins, on condition that you should be the sacrifice to the
                  vengeance of Matra's relatives, as it was on your account he lost his life.
               "Senor Benedetto discovered their intended treachery too late to prevent its
                  execution, but a large bribe induced the murderers to spare you, and destroy your
                  husband. Thus you owe him your life, for he it was who rescued you from the
                  daggers of the assassins; he it was who saved you when those two women had
                  poisoned you in Guilio's absence."
               Clarice started convulsively, and became even paler than before; but she said
                  nothing, and Ninetta went on:
               "Senor Benedetto engaged the vessel of your old friend, Barnardo, to convey you to
                  your father, who is impatiently expecting you. He came to my mother and offered
                  her such terms for my services that she consented to part from me, and here I
                  am."
               Clarice shuddered, and turned her face to the wall, weeping bitterly. In vain did
                  Ninetta endeavor to console her; in this hour of deepest anguish no earthly voice
                  could whisper peace to her wrung soul. She could only murmur, at intervals:
               "Oh! my Guilio—murdered! lying cold, cold in your blood! and for my sake. Alas! I
                  am fatal to all that love me; two men slain on my account—faithless, false as I
                  have been! Oh, it is horrible, horrible! Ninetta, give me something to bring
                  oblivion. I must sleep or go mad in my anguish!"
               Her excited appearance alarmed the girl, and she hastily sought Evoli. He came
                  with her to the side of Clarice, but she wildly motioned him from her.
               "Go away! go away! I cannot bear your presence yet. The life you have rescued is
                  worthless—the father to whom you would take me will receive only a hopeless,
                  broken wreck! Let me die! that is all that is left me now."
               Evoli made no attempt to reason with or console her; he understood the phase of
                  anguish and self-accusation through which she we passing too well to oppose mere
                  words to the torrent of her grief. He silently mixed a powerful narcotic, and
                  leaving whispered directions with Ninetta to watch constantly beside her, glided
                  away. The girl faithfully administered the potion, and sat in perturbed silence
                  till her charge sunk into a broken slumber, interrupted by deep moans and muttered
                  words, imploring pardon from him whose spirit she believed had been ruthlessly
                  severed from his body.
               At intervals she started up with staring eyes and quivering hands, making vain
                  efforts to clutch the airy phantoms
                  that flitted before her mental vision; but at last she sank into the deep sleep
                  produced by artificial means, and lay white and motionless, though her deep
                  breathing indicated the strong young life that wrestled in her frame.
               Evoli who had been watching with deep solicitude at her door, again entered, and
                  observed her condition carefully. In reply to Ninetta's look of inquiry, he
                  briefly said:
               "She will recover from the shock, and regain all her old elasticity. Yes—she will
                  awake to life and happiness again. Be faithful to the trust confided to you,
                  Ninetta, and all will be well."
               "Ah, Senor, I love her, and will do all I can for her," was the reply; and again
                  she was left to her watch of affection. Evoli joined Barnardo on deck, and they
                  sought a retired spot to confer with each other. The captain spoke, with cynical
                  contempt:
               "I did not believe you would succeed, yet you have won the outlaw's bride, and
                  will bear her in triumph to her father. How has it been accomplished?"
               "Not through a woman's weakness, as you evidently think. The friends of Matra have
                  carried out the vendetta, and at a heavy price I purchased exemption for this
                  young creature. I would have saved her at the cost of my own life, had that been
                  necessary."
               "Humph! then the wretches have murdered the lad in revenge for the crime
                     I committed? I begin to think myself a paltry scoundrel, not to
                  have proclaimed the truth, and taken the vendetta on myself."
               "In that case you would have given the Senora up to them, for in her rescue the
                  life of Matra was taken. Balked of vengeance either on you or Guilio, her life
                  would surely have been sacrificed. We have but played a game in which life was the
                  stake, and you and I, by superior craft, have been the victors."
               "True; but is the life of this poor girl worth that of my fearless comrade? I trow
                  not; but you have a way of binding people to your will, my lord, that is
                  incomprehensible to me. What is your secret? Pray, tell me, that I may try it on
                  my refractory men."
               Evoli's peculiar smile gleamed an instant on his lip, and he carelessly
                  replied:
               "It is one you understand pretty well already. An iron will, that never falters in
                  its purpose; in addition to which, nature has bestowed on me other advantages,
                  which I know how to use with the best effect. That is all. Good night; the moon
                  has risen, to light us on our way, and our voyage promises to be a prosperous one.
                  I must sleep a few hours before we reach our haven; for the scene through which I
                  lately passed has shaken even my firm nerves a little."
               Barnardo gazed after him; with an expression half of admiration, half of envy, he
                  muttered:
               "It is almost a pity he is a duke, for he would make a splendid captain of a
                  privateer. But with his chances, I should never have trod the deck of one myself.
                  Well, my old enemy will get back his daughter, but the end is not yet," and
                  Barnardo, a true servitor of fortune, reconciled himself to the part he had been
                  induced to play, with the thought of the large reward he should gain for his
                  services. He regretted the sacrifice of Guilio, though he congratulated himself
                  that the vendetta had not fallen to his own lot; he had slain his enemy, and
                  another had borne the penalty; such was the decree of fate, therefore why should
                  he grieve; and he drowned such qualms of conscience as would arise, in a bottle of
                  strong wine.
               On the evening of a calm and lovely day, a litter was borne into the hall of
                  Ernesti Castle, in which reclined a drooping form only half aroused from the
                  death-like lethargy produced by the
                  narcotics, under the influence of which it had been found necessary to keep
                  Clarice. She was immediately carried to a magnificent apartment which had been
                  prepared for her reception, for Count Ernesti had been forewarned of her arrival,
                  and he had himself superintended the fitting up of the suite of rooms appropriated
                  to her use.
               He did not appear to welcome his long-lost daughter, for at the last moment his
                  feelings overcame him, and he retired to the room of penitence, to look upon
                  Ginevra's portrait, and pray again for pardon for his great wrong against her,
                  before he claimed the love of her child.
               Many hours elapsed before he went slowly to the door of Clarice, and asked for
                  admittance. The middle-aged housekeeper answered his knock, and seeing who the
                  visitor was, she turned toward the bed on which the pale sufferer had been placed,
                  and respectfully said:
               "It is the Count, my lady, who has come to welcome you to your home."
               At this announcement, Clarice lifted her heavy eyelids, half arose, and faintly
                  said:
               "Let him come; I am his alone now."
               Ernesti motioned to the women to retire, and closed the door. Then he glided
                  toward the couch, lifted the half-sinking form, and clasped her to his breast,
                  while tears fell like rain over her face, and broken words fell from his lips.
               "O, my child, my pride, my darling, why have you been kept from me so long, for my
                  heart and home have been desolate without you."
               "Alas! I now come to you broken and crushed. My life is desolate, but it shall
                  henceforth be devoted to you. No other claims me now, my father."
               "Then we will be all in all to each other, and you shall console me for all the
                  misery of the past."
               As the count looked upon the pale face that rested upon his breast, he could not
                  repress a shiver, for in the anguish impressed upon it, he saw again that
                  expression which gleamed white and cold upon him in that hour of supreme despair
                  when Ginevra appealed to him in vain for mercy.
               He softly laid her upon her pillows, and wiped the cold drops from his brow which
                  that memory called there. A gulf which he could not pass seemed to open between
                  himself and his child, and he sat down chilled and terrified. Had she come to him
                  as a Nemesis, or as a blessing? Had he torn her from her happiness, only to become
                  a living dread to himself? It was a fearful question, but one which only time and
                  Fate could answer.
               After a dreary pause, Clarice gently said:
               "I am unable to talk with you now, my father. Mind and body are so overwhelmed by
                  the dreadful scenes through which I have lately passed, that I must have rest. I
                  shall soon be better, and then I will make such efforts as I can to brighten the
                  home into which you wished me to enter. I need help, consolation, under the burden
                  of my sorrow. Is there no holy man attached to your house, who can speak peace to
                  my distracted spirit?"
               The count arose with alacrity.
               "You are right, my daughter; I will send Father Gregory to you. He can speak such
                  words as will bring back composure to the heart that is sorely stricken, and I
                  will leave you to his ministrations."
               "Let him come to me without delay, then, I entreat you."
               Her father bent over, and lightly kissed her brow, then he left the room, feeling
                  as if a weight had been lifted from his heart. Yes, her very presence was an
                  oppression, for her voice, her eyes brought vividly before him the awful record of
                  the past, and he sorrowfully asked himself how long he could endure it and
                  live.
               Soon after the count's departure, a light tap was struck upon her door, and the venerable priest entered,
                  and drew near to the bed. Father Gregory's heart was filled with compassion as he
                  looked upon the broken lily that lay upon it, and he at once addressed himself to
                  the task that lay before him; to bind up this bruised heart, heal the wounds of
                  the tender conscience, and reconcile her to the life that now lay before her, so
                  dark and hopeless.
               Since her marriage, Clarice had not been to confession, and she humbly and
                  penitently laid bare her soul before him. She concealed nothing; even the
                  momentary wandering of her heart from the husband she had chosen, was revealed,
                  for now this seemed to her an inexpiable crime.
               When she finished, the priest prayed with her, and inflicted such a penance as
                  would compel her to arouse herself from the state of apathy into which she seemed
                  in danger of falling; for Father Gregory was a keen observer, and he comprehended
                  that the reaction of her present grief might bring with it lassitude and languor
                  she would not struggle against without some powerful motive to counteract
                  them.
               He set before her the new duties that devolved upon her, and exacted from her a
                  promise that she would seek to perform them as became a conscientious daughter of
                  the church. When she had pledged herself to all he required, and he seemed about
                  to leave her, Clarice said:
               "Before you go, holy father, tell me something of my mother. Did you know her?
                  Have you been long in the household of Count Ernesti?"
               The change that came over his face caused her to think she had committed an
                  indiscretion. An expression of reserve succeeded the bland mildness with which he
                  had hitherto regarded her, and he replied, with evident reluctance:
               "Yes, my daughter, your mother was well known to me. What can you expect me to
                  reveal that is not already known to you?"
               "I really know nothing. My parents parted in anger; my mother was thrown off, or
                  eloped, I know not which. Oh! my mother, my dead mother, clear her fame to her
                  unhappy child, if it can be done."
               The priest was deeply moved, and after a pause, he said:
               "The living and the dead equally claim your reverence, my daughter. Your father
                  opens his arms to receive you; your mother lies in her quiet grave, so let her
                  rest. She was imprudent, but not guilty. Your parents did not understand each
                  other. Over their final rupture let a veil be drawn; mine shall never be the hand
                  to lift it."
               She sighed as if a heavy weight was lifted from her mind, and softly said:
               "Thanks, father, for this much. I will endeavor to follow your counsels, and in
                  the performance of the duties allotted to me on earth, perhaps the sunshine of
                  peace will again fall on my soul. Pray for me that I may have strength to walk in
                  my new path in faith and honor."
               This the priest readily promised, and giving her his blessing he departed.
                  Clarice, composed and elevated by this brief communion with a strong, God-fearing
                  soul, closed her eyes in a balmy slumber, that gave new life to her drooping
                  frame.
               Evoli, after a long and confidential interview with Count Ernesti, set forth for
                  his own castle. He bore with him the certainty that his return would be welcomed
                  both by the Count and his daughter; for the present, he felt that it would be best
                  to absent himself for a season, as Clarice would naturally shrink at this time
                  from all that brought back to her the memory of the recent painful events of her
                  life.
               We must briefly pass over the succeeding months, though each day bore its record in the experience of the
                  young creature so suddenly placed on such an eminence of worldly power and pride.
                  Every luxury that wealth could command was hers; every taste that could be
                  ministered to, through its means was gratified at any cost. The heroine of a fairy
                  tale could scarcely have had her fancies more completely realized than were those
                  of the new found heiress of Count Ernesti.
               Her father anticipated her wishes, and each day brought some new proof of his
                  pride and affection; yet, after that first moment of meeting, his manner toward
                  her never softened. Clarice felt that she was the heiress to his haughty line—the
                  darling of his pride, but nothing more. A dividing line seemed to be drawn between
                  them; and in her loneliness she often felt that the privilege of weeping upon his
                  breast, of kissing his worn brow, those sad, firmly closed lips, would have been
                  worth all the baubles he lavished upon her.
               She wished to wear mourning for her lost love, but to this the count would not
                  consent. All the pride of his nature recoiled from the thought that his daughter
                  should wear the outward symbols of grief for a low-born outlaw, with whom it was
                  degradation to remember she had ever been connected. He insisted that she should
                  wear such robes as befitted her new state, and she yielded to what she believed to
                  be her duty to him. The name of Guilio was never pronounced in his presence, and
                  gradually the memory of what he had been to her faded from the heart of her who
                  had ceased to love him before she was torn from him.
               Intellectual culture, for which Clarice had so deeply pined, opened its stores to
                  her eager mind, and under the guidance of Father Gregory she made rapid progress
                  in the studies she undertook. Other masters were called to her assistance, and
                  lighter accomplishments cultivated, and in one year from her restoration to her
                  birthright, she was a brilliant and beautiful woman, fully conscious of her own
                  powers, and eager to try them in the arena of fashion.
               During that time she had greatly changed. Ambition to excel swayed her heart;
                  pride of family and station had fully imbued her mind, and she became plastic in
                  the hands of her imperious father. Count Ernesti impressed his own views upon the
                  nature she inherited from himself, and Clarice learned to look back with a feeling
                  of humiliation upon the humble associations of her childhood, and she finally
                  parted from Ninetta because she brought them back daily to her remembrance.
               The young girl was liberally provided for, and an annuity was settled on Senora
                  Marcante sufficient to enable her to eclipse all of her class in Isola Rossa.
                  Ninetta gladly returned to her own home, for she preferred the freedom of her
                  mother's house to servitude in that of the count, and a more fashionable maid was
                  found for the young countess.
               During this time Evoli was often a guest at the castle. At first he was received
                  with chilling reserve, for Clarice was a true woman, and her pride was wounded by
                  the thought that this man had fathomed all the weakness of her heart; he had won
                  her allegiance from her husband, and now he might presume upon this knowledge to
                  assert claims she did not feel disposed to concede.
               But Evoli was much too politic to commit this error; he did not even devote
                  himself to her as he had done in other days. He left the charm of his presence,
                  the sympathy in their tastes, to prove to her that fate had designed them for each
                  other, and ere Clarice was aware of her danger, her heart was more deeply
                  enthralled than before.
               The love she had felt for Guilio she now knew was a child's dream; this was the
                  engrossing, all-absorbing passion of a woman who has felt and suffered, the depths
                     of whose inner nature had been
                  sounded, and who had learned to understand herself. In vain did she struggle
                  against the conviction, that this man was her master, for she felt it in every
                  quivering throb of her heart, in every pulsation of her being.
               With subtle power, Evoli read and comprehended the fluctuations of Clarice's mind,
                  and when she reached that point at which her pride might take the alarm if his
                  outward indifference continued, he resumed his old habit of devotion to her. He
                  read, walked, sang with her, and entered into all her employments with a zest that
                  gave them double piquancy.
               Evoli made his presence necessary to her, and then suddenly left the castle
                  without coming to any explanation. Clarice missed him during every moment of the
                  long days, and felt that life was becoming a burden to her. Her spirits drooped,
                  and her father proposed a visit to Rome. She eagerly consented, and in the Eternal
                  City she made her first appearance in society. Her beauty, noble family, and
                  reputed fortune, drew around her a crowd of admirers, and the debut of the
                  charming countess was regarded as the event of the season. But after the first
                  flush of triumph passed away, Clarice turned from them all with a sigh of
                  weariness, to find amusement and interest in the monuments of departed greatness
                  which attest the grandeur of the race that has passed away.
               One night she stood in the Coliseum, watching the effect of the moonlight upon its
                  crumbling walls; she had strayed from her party to be alone a few moments, that
                  her fancy might go back to the days of old, and re-people the vast arena with its
                  shouting crowds looking down upon the dying struggles of the gladiator. Suddenly a
                  stately form stood beside her, a voice that made her heart bound with rapture
                  called her name.
               Evoli had arrived during her absence, and had immediately set out to join her. A
                  struggling moonbeam fell over her face, and he read his welcome in the flash of
                  joy that swept over it. He seized that unguarded moment to pour into her ear the
                  story of his hopes and fears, of the adoring love which must find a return, or
                  become the burden of his life.
               The time was skilfully chosen, and Clarice returned to her father the betrothed
                  bride of the proudest duke in Italy. Count Ernesti received the announcement with
                  deep gratification. The dearest wish of his heart was thus accomplished, and once
                  more his lips were pressed upon the brow of his daughter as he congratulated her
                  upon the brilliant future opening before her. When left alone, he muttered:
               "The curse has passed from my house. The fatal mark has not marred her fate, for
                     my child will be great and happy. Duchess of Evoli, and a noble
                  man for her husband. Ah! Father Gregory will cease his croaking now, I hope."
               As if the thought had evoked his presence, a knock came to his door, and the
                  priest, looking pale and careworn, entered the room. The count greeted him with
                  surprise, in which some apprehension was mingled.
               "What brings you hither, father? I hope nothing has happened at the castle of so
                  important a nature as to force you from your beloved seclusion?"
               "Everything there is as quiet as usual, my son. But I have received a piece of
                  information of such importance that I could entrust it to no other person, so I
                  came hither myself to communicate it."
               "Then let me hear it at once. Is my daughter interested in it?"
               "You have rightly guessed, my lord. My news is vital to her future happiness. I
                  have a letter from Francesco Vivaldi,
                  from which I learned that Falcone was not murdered; he was desperately wounded,
                  but he is yet living, though in a state of weakness both of mind and body, which
                  time seems powerless to heal. He believes that his wife perished in the vendetta,
                  and he makes no effort to arouse himself from the state of apathy into which he
                  has fallen."
               The count uttered an exclamation of angry dismay.
               "Living! The wretch! what right has he yet to cumber the earth? Yet it really
                  matters very little, father, for the divorce for which I applied has been granted
                  by the church, and my daughter is now the betrothed of the Duke of Evoli. My
                  lessons have fallen on good ground, and the pride of Clarice would induce her to
                  spurn her first lover, even if she were not strongly attached to Evoli.
               The priest sighed heavily.
               "I see, I see how it is. I have watched your daughter, and I have seen the
                  imperious blood of your race assert its pride. I also saw the tender heart of her
                  mother yield to the power of him who won her troth. Yet, my lord, in this hour of
                  elation, painful as it is to me to utter a warning to recall the past history of
                  your house, it becomes my duty to tell you of something which singularly refers to
                  it."
               The count became very pale, for he was superstitious, and with difficulty he
                  said:
               "Let me hear what you have to say."
               The priest cast on him a piercing glance, and nerved himself for the disclosure he
                  had to make.
               "You are aware, my lord, of the tradition in your family that your noted ancestor,
                  Count Ludovic, received from a learned eastern astrologer a prediction concerning
                  the fate of his house. This was carefully concealed from his descendants, nor had
                  its hiding-place been sought for, as it was vaguely understood that its discovery
                  would herald the extinction of his race."
               The listener bowed his head, and visibly trembled, but he could not speak; the
                  priest went on:
               "A violent storm lately burst over the castle, and the wall of the ruinous room in
                  the rear of the chapel fell in. A recess was laid bare in which some relics and
                  parchments had been concealed. One of the latter bore a rude drawing representing
                  an armed knight, with a woman at his feet, on whose breast his dagger thrusts had
                  marked the sacred symbol of martyrdom. Below it, traced in Greek characters, which
                  were still clear and distinct, was the prophecy given by the Arabian astrologer to
                  your ancestor. Here is a rough translation which I have made: 
                     
                        "'A storm will rage whene'er this page
                        Be given to mortal scan;
                        Then tremble, man, before the ban
                        Of thy portentous doom—
                        The last of all thy haughty race
                        Will perish in her youth and grace,
                        And he whose hand bears bloody brand,
                        Be left in lonely pride of place,
                        A prey to endless gloom.'"
                     
                  
               
               The count listened with an expression of pale terror that appalled his companion.
                  He gasped:
               "It is not true! it shall not prove true. The prophecy does not apply to me. The
                  caitiff perished by suffocation; I did not soil my hands with his ignoble
                  blood."
               The priest compassionately regarded him. He slowly said:
               "The blood of your victim is not the less upon your soul because you stifled its
                  flow in place of shedding it. Alas, my son, I have gloomy fears and forebodings
                  for the welfare of you and yours."
               By a mighty effort the count recovered seeming composure. After a long pause, he
                  said:
               "The day for such superstitious nonsense has passed away. We are more enlightened now, father, and can
                  laugh at such a prediction as this. Destroy the parchment, and forget its
                  contents, as I shall. My daughter shall become Duchess of Evoli, and her fate will
                  not be marred by those ancient rhymes."
               The priest bowed his head.
               "I will obey you, my lord, and I trust that your hopes will not be blighted by a
                  power which sets all our puny efforts at nought. Your daughter has become very
                  dear to my heart, and any evil that menaces her, I would gladly avert by every
                  means in my power. If prayers can avail in your favor, you both have them from
                  me."
               "I thank you, father, and now to other matters. Tell me of young Vivaldi. What is
                  he doing, and how does he bear the loss of his uncle's fortune?"
               "As a true man should. A friend has obtained promotion for him, and he has also
                  acquired a considerable accession of fortune, he does not explain by what means,
                  and Mademoiselle Villeray has given him her hand. Thus his happiness and
                  prosperity are provided for."
               "That is well; when Clarice is old enough to act for herself, it is her purpose to
                  be liberal toward her cousin. I shall not interfere, for she will have the right
                  to do as she pleases with her own fortune. When you see her, I beg that you will
                  give no hint of this discovery. It might affect her spirits, and she is happy
                  now."
               "I will be careful not to do so, my lord. God forbid that I should shadow the
                  sunshine in which she may for a season dwell. That it may continue is my earnest
                  prayer."
               After a few moments of deep thought the count said:
               "Vivaldi is aware of the existence of the outlaw. It may be as well, father, to
                  warn him not to betray to Falcone that my daughter yet lives. Since he believes
                  that she perished, let him remain in that delusion. It will be best for all
                  parties concerned."
               "And will you conceal from the countess the fact of his escape from the
                  assassins?"
               "Of course; what good could be accomplished by telling her that Falcone yet lives?
                  She has ceased to care for him, and her whole heart is devoted to Evoli."
               "Yet my mind strangely misgives me, my son."
               "Silence its misgivings, then," replied Ernesti, imperiously. "I only act for the
                  best. If Falcone stood before her to-day, Clarice would refuse to return with him.
                  She has adapted herself to her new position with a facility that is quite
                  wonderful; and even if her passion for Evoli could be set aside, she would
                  repudiate the thought of giving up her fortune and the luxury she loves, to return
                  to that mountain den, to be drugged again by those jealous women. But if she were
                  weak enough to think of such a sacrifice, I would oppose it at the risk of my
                  life. Understanding this, father, you see your duty clearly before you."
               "Not so clearly, I am afraid," replied the priest, gloomily; "but I will do the
                  best that lies in my power. The happiness and well-being of the countess are my
                  first care, and such precautions as will secure these I will cheerfully take. The
                  rest we must leave to Him who rules our fate."
               Father Gregory saw Clarice and her lover together, and his heart failed him as he
                  saw how deeply enthralled she was by this new passion, and thought that another
                  lived whose claims upon her no human laws could set aside; for the good priest was
                  one of those rigid interpreters of Scripture who believe that not even the Pope
                  has power to unloose the bonds assumed in the name of God himself. Yet he had not
                  the courage to speak, and set the whole truth before her. Why should he mar her
                  dream of bliss? Guilio was dead to her, her heart had found its true master, and
                  the brilliant future beckoned her onward with gay promise of triumphant
                  prosperity. Then let her bask in its
                  beams; his should not be the hand to dash the sparkling cup of joy from her
                  lips.
               The marriage was to take place in the following month at Ernesti Castle, and a
                  brilliant party of friends was invited to accompany the count and his daughter on
                  their return there.
               To Clarice the hours sped by on wings of light. The whirl of social life was
                  varied by delicious têtes-à-têtes with her betrothed, and together they visited
                  every spot of interest in the vicinity of the Eternal City. A magnificent
                  trousseau was ordered, and Clarice indulged her taste in selecting gems of art
                  with which to decorate her future home. Evoli approved of all she did and said,
                  and with them all went "merry as a marriage bell."
               Evoli was truly and passionately enamored of her, and no qualm of conscience came
                  to check his rapture, even when he thought of all he had done to gain her. He
                  possessed one of those natures to which remorse is unknown, and with the skill of
                  an adept in sophistry, he convinced himself that his treachery toward Guilio was a
                  necessity imposed on him by fate. By the sacrifice of his rival he had saved one
                  far more worthy to live, and thus he considered the account fairly balanced.
               At present there was only room in his heart for one thought. This exquisite
                  creature loved him entirely, devotedly. He felt assured that the love he had
                  inspired was as different from the tender regard she once felt for Guilio, as the
                  full blaze of the noon-tide sun is from the pale scintillations of a star; and day
                  by day, hour by hour, this passion grew with the sweet aliment it fed on, till
                  Clarice felt that to lose him would be to die to all that made life beautiful.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               THE RAGE OF THE WRONGED HUSBAND.
               THROUGH the manœuvres of Madame Villeray, the marriage of Vivaldi and her daughter
                  was postponed from month to month, but at last he bore his bride to a villa by the
                  sea-side, belonging to a wealthy and eccentric friend, who was absent on a distant
                  tour. Embosomed in groves of orange, myrtle and laurel, the house stood in deep
                  seclusion, overlooking the blue waters that spread away in the distance. The walls
                  were covered with masses of ivy, and flowers bloomed on every side. In this
                  enchanting spot the first halcyon days of their union were passed; the newly
                  wedded pair brought no one with them except Marie Montoni, who, by her misfortunes
                  and her gentleness, had won deeply on the affections of both.
               To the tender entreaties of Lucille, the improvisatrice had yielded, and given up
                  her wanderings to become a life-long resident with her. When the tragedy at the
                  cavern had been related to Marie, and the flight of Clarice to the protection of
                  her father became a certainty, she relinquished all thought of returning thither,
                  though her heart yearned vaguely to ascertain every particular concerning the fate
                  of the unhappy Guilio. That he was dead she believed in common with the rest of
                  his friends, for every effort had been made by the inhabitants of the cavern to
                  conceal his continued existence.
               Fate had now brought her near the spot on which she had left him happy in the
                  affection of her he had so fondly loved, and Marie formed a resolution to visit
                  the cave, and learn from Angelo and his wife the history of what had actually
                  occurred. On the morning on which she intended to set out on her clandestine journey, Vivaldi
                  invited her to join himself and Lucille in a visit to a grotto they had not yet
                  explored, which was situated in the grounds of a neighboring villa. Marie could
                  offer no excuse for refusing to accompany them, and she set out with the intention
                  of disappearing at some opportune moment, and starting on her proposed
                  pilgrimage.
               The grotto had been recently discovered, and was pronounced a marvel of beauty.
                  They passed through orange groves loaded with yellow fruit, and gathered clusters
                  of purple grapes at the invitation of a young peasant girl, who acted as cicerone.
                  When they reached the entrance, the girl lighted a swinging lamp, and left them to
                  explore the interior at their leisure.
               The faint light illuminated a fairy temple of exquisite grace and beauty, in which
                  were represented pointed arches, massive capitals, tabernacles and rosettes, such
                  as above ground are only found among the elaborate inventions of Gothic
                  architecture. In the centre was a figure, which required little effort of the
                  imagination to believe was the form of a woman with a white veil thrown over her
                  person, and a crown of flowers upon her head. Four smaller figures kneeled near
                  her, with hands stretched out as if in supplication.
               Vivaldi and his companions paused in front of this, and commented upon the
                  singular grace of the veiled lady. The faint light fell over it, and all beyond
                  lay in deep shadow. Suddenly Marie said:
               "We are not the only visitors here. Some one is crouching behind this group."
               "I will soon see who it is," replied Vivaldi. "Stand quite still, till I light the
                  lamp that hangs on this side. Why do you tremble, Lucille? there is nothing to
                  fear."
               He took a small match-box from his pocket, and drawing it sharply against its
                  side, the flame flared up, and in another second the broad glare of the lamp
                  flashed over the prostrate form of a man, who lay wrapped in the deep sleep of
                  exhaustion, and whose emaciated person showed that he was suffering from ill
                  health. His arm was thrown upward in such a manner as partially to conceal his
                  face, but Marie started forward with an exclamation, for there was something in
                  the appearance of the sleeper that brought Guilio irresistibly to her mind.
               At the sound of her voice the man started up and grasped the carbine which had
                  fallen from his hand. He gazed upon them with an expression of bewildered
                  surprise, and then with a wild cry threw himself toward Marie.
               "Oh, Marie, my heart is broken! my life is desolate. They have slain her! my love,
                  my darling lies in her bloody grave, and I—I live to tell it to you!
                  Oh, pity me, for I need pity!"
               Marie grasped his hand, she heard his voice, yet she could scarcely credit the
                  evidence of her senses that this was indeed the living Guilio. She faintly
                  said:
               "I have believed you dead these many, many months, and another, to whom your life
                  is more important, believes so too."
               "To whom can my life be important now?" he asked, with an accent of indescribable
                  desolation. "The angel of my life has been snatched from me by violence; and I
                  have lost, with her, all hope, all energy. I wandered hither to gaze upon this
                  veiled form, because I fancied that it bears a resemblance to my Clarice, wrapped
                  in her flowing veil, when we rowed about our submarine grotto. Oh! those days are
                  agony to remember now!" and down his wasted cheeks a tear wandered, and fell hot
                  upon the kind hand that clasped his own.
               "Who is this person?" inquired Vivaldi, in a low voice.
               
               "Senor, this is the wreck of what Guilio Falcone once was."
               "The husband of my cousin? Impossible!"
               At these words, Guilio turned quickly toward him.
               "Then you are the heir to her wealth. You gained by her death; your presence
                  stifles me; I must away, for we cannot breathe in the same atmosphere."
               Vivaldi impulsively and proudly replied:
               "Her fortune is her own, I claim no portion of it."
               "Her own? How can my murdered Clarice stand between you and your inheritance?"
               A bewildered look passed between the three, which Guilio was quick to catch. A
                  wild hope dawned on him. He clutched the hand of Marie with a grasp of iron, and
                  gasped:
               "What does he mean? what can he mean? Have they told me a falsehood? Have I worn
                  out my life mourning over an empty grave? Oh, God! if my Clarice lives, why—why am
                  I alone? Answer me on your soul; as you shall hope for mercy in your dying hour,
                  show it to me now."
               Lucille clung trembling to Vivaldi's arm; she eagerly whispered:
               "Tell him, Francesco; he has the right to know all."
               For an instant he was undecided, for he feared what might result from the
                  revelation; but the lover, who had just won his own bride, could not stifle his
                  deep compassion for this wronged and stricken man. He said:
               "There has been some strange misconception here. My cousin believes you to be
                  dead, and you have been induced to believe that she perished in the attack upon
                  your strong hold. She escaped, and is now with her father."
               A wild cry rang in startling echoes through the grotto, and Guilio fell senseless
                  at his feet. He was removed to the villa, but when he again awoke to life his old
                  fever returned, and weeks passed away before he recovered sufficiently to
                  understand all that had happened. Then he had but one thought—to reclaim his lost
                  bride, and find a new home in some foreign land where the vendetta could never
                  reach them.
               Marie watched over him with the tender care of a sister, and when he was
                  sufficiently restored to explain to her all that had happened at the cavern, her
                  woman's wit instantly penetrated the motive of Gulietta for concealing the safety
                  of Clarice. She began to have painful doubts as to the willingness of her former
                  friend to give up her new state for a life of wandering and privation with Guilio;
                  and these were confirmed by the reply of Father Gregory to the letter of Vivaldi,
                  which informed him that Guilio yet lived. The priest entreated him to conceal from
                  him the continued existence of Clarice. He informed him of her approaching
                  marriage with the Duke of Evoli; of her deep attachment to him, and the ruin to
                  her happiness which must follow any attempt to reclaim her. The church had
                  dissolved the tie that bound her to her first lover, and her heart had also
                  repudiated the affection she once felt for him. Henceforth their paths lay widely
                  apart, and they must never meet again.
               How to reveal all this to Guilio was now the question, for his mind, so long
                  clouded by grief and sickness, had regained all its clearness, and but one hope
                  seemed to animate him—that of regaining his lost Clarice. Under the stimulus of
                  this new hope his health rapidly mended, and once more he walked the earth with
                  erect and firm steps. He sent for Angelo, and revealed to him his knowledge of the
                  deception which had been practiced upon him, and commanded him to remove his
                  family from the cavern without delay. In a few more weeks he hoped to bring back
                  his lost love to her own home; and he desired Marie Montoni to hold herself in readiness to precede her, and
                  prepare everything for her reception.
               The herdsman listened respectfully, though he knew it was useless to hurry these
                  arrangements; he felt assured that Clarice would never again reign as Queen over
                  the mountain, and Guilio would yet be glad to return to the friends who were
                  faithful to him. A few words with Vivaldi confirmed this belief, and on his return
                  he simply announced to Lisa and her daughter the safety of Guilio, and his early
                  return to them.
               One morning Guilio sought Vivaldi, and said:
               "I am now strong enough to travel; I must go to Italy, and in person claim my
                  wife. However powerful Count Ernesti may be, he cannot resist such a claim as
                  mine. I shall leave to-morrow."
               Vivaldi regarded him with compassion. He gently asked:
               "Has it never occurred to you that my cousin may herself refuse to return to
                  you?"
               The livid pallor that overspread Guilio's face was fearful; at length he
                  gasped:
               "You are aware of something, then, that has been concealed from me. What is it? I
                  demand it of you; I must know all, that I may be able to judge what I
                  should do."
               With deep reluctance Vivaldi related to him the contents of the priest's letter.
                  Clarice loved another; was on the eve of marriage with a man of her own rank in
                  life. She had been divorced from him by an especial decree of the church, and any
                  attempt to reclaim her must end in wretchedness to all concerned.
               Guilio listened with whirling brain and flashing eyes. When Vivaldi ended he
                  asked, in a low tone:
               "Does Clarice know that I yet live?"
               "She does not; until very lately we all thought you dead, and her father deems it
                  best that she shall still think so."
               "Then shall my living lips undeceive her, and from her alone will I receive the
                  assurance that another is preferred before me. And that one? who is he? what is
                  he?"
               "He is noble, rich, and reckless of consequences. He will have you seized and
                  imprisoned, if you attempt to come between himself and the woman he adores."
               Guilio started up with all the fire of his race blazing in his eyes. At that
                  moment he was only the wild Corsican, ready for vengeance upon his foe, and he
                  hissed through his shut teeth:
               "Let him do it, if he can; I defy him—I spit upon him! She pledged to
                  me her life, her blood, and I swear to take both, sooner than let another clasp
                  her to his heart as his living bride."
               He rushed from the room, and without offering his adieux to any one, left the
                  house. When convinced that he was indeed gone, Vivaldi wrote a few hurried lines
                  to Father Gregory, informing him of Falcone's purposes, and imploring him to
                  prevent a scene of violence if it was possible to do so. Then, in the faint hope
                  that his letter would arrive in time to put Count Ernesti on his guard, he went,
                  with a heavy heart, to join Lucille and her companion.
               As fate would have it, when Guilio sought at the cove for the means of
                  embarkation, he found there the felucca of Barnardo. With what joy and surprise he
                  was welcomed by the captain, we need not record; and he listened to his despairing
                  cry for vengeance for his wrongs, with a degree of sympathy that surprised
                  himself.
               Barnardo had refused the offer of Evoli to employ him as agent for one of his
                  estates; his fondness for the wild life he led was too great to permit him to
                  immure himself in the country; and in
                  defiance of the authorities, he continued to ply his regular trade."
               The journal Jacopo had engaged to send to him was received at intervals, and he
                  was kept informed of all that occurred at Ernesti Castle, in which Clarice was
                  interested. Though it now promised to be of little service, yet Barnardo read it
                  with morbid curiosity to know how the count's affairs prospered, and at moments a
                  kind of savage hatred arose in his heart at the thought that after all Ernesti
                  would triumph in the restoration of his daughter, and her marriage with a man of
                  high rank.
               This feeling was predominant when Guilio suddenly appeared before him as one risen
                  from the dead. Barnardo really liked him; believed that he had been basely
                  deceived, and he quickly resolved to place in his hands details that must
                  exasperate him to frenzy. Guilio read every word of the journal with a burning
                  heart, and a resolution that never faltered in its purpose. Barnardo concealed
                  from him the identity of Benedetto and Evoli; he left that for the future to
                  reveal, calculating on the effect of the discovery to give fatal impulse to the
                  blow he knew was resolved on.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVII.
               A STORM BURSTS, AND THE VENDETTA IS ACCOMPLISHED.
               A SELECT party of friends assembled at Ernesti Castle to witness the bridal of the
                  beautiful heiress. The appointed day dawned amid threatening clouds, with that
                  oppressive stillness in the atmosphere which always heralds the approach of a
                  storm of unusual violence; yet the hours passed on, and it did not burst. It was
                  hoarding its wrath for a final explosion, which should scatter desolation in its
                  track, and leave death behind it.
               Clarice, who was the child of sunshine, was vividly susceptible to the changes in
                  the atmosphere, and she had almost a childish dread of lightning. For the first
                  time for many weeks, a depression she could not shake off rendered her restless
                  and miserable. Even the arrival of Evoli and a gay party of his friends, could
                  scarcely enliven her. He brought with him his family diamonds, reset for her use,
                  and requested that she would adorn herself with them on that night. Among them was
                  a starry wreath, twined in the form of a coronet, as the insignia of the new rank
                  she was about to assume, and the love of splendor innate with her, was gratified
                  by this princely gift. She examined it with eager delight, tried its effect, and
                  for a few moments forgot her depression. But when the excitement of meeting her
                  betrothed passed away, she relapsed into the vague feeling of restless dread that
                  haunted her, in spite of her efforts to shake it off.
               Late in the evening she sought Father Gregory in his own sanctum; she came to him
                  to make her last confession before the sacrament of marriage, and the priest
                  received her with even more tender interest than usual, for when she came in, he
                  held in his hand the hurried letter of Vivaldi, informing him of Falcone's
                  resolution to regain her, even by force.
               There was yet time to baffle the designs of the madman; but Clarice must learn the
                  cruel position she held between these two men; both madly enamored of her; both
                  claiming her as his lawful wife; yet Father Gregory dared not speak, and show her
                  the precipice on which she stood.
               Her confession was soon made, and then the old man, in a voice that vibrated with
                  emotion, said:
               "My daughter, if Guilio could arise from the dead, and insist that you should return to him, what would be
                  your own decision?"
               She grew deadly pale, then flushed crimson, as she replied:
               "I am wedded in soul, life, and spirit to Evoli. The love I once felt for Guilio
                  was that of an inexperienced child. This is the passion of the woman who has
                  staked her every hope in life upon its object. The rank and fortune of my
                  betrothed I do not undervalue; but they are trifles in comparison with himself,
                  for he is dear to me as the life-blood that warms my heart."
               "I am answered, my dear child, and I trust—I trust that you will find happiness
                  with him."
               "Who doubts it, father? Yet I have had a strange presentiment of approaching evil
                  throughout all the hours of this weary day. I believe, after all, that it springs
                  from a weird dream I had last night, which left so vivid an impression upon me
                  that I cannot shake it off."
               "Relate it, my daughter. I may be able to interpret its meaning, as I have been
                  thought to have some skill in that way."
               After a moment's thought; Clarice said:
               "I slept very little last night. Toward morning, I fell into a sort of waking
                  trance, for I scarcely think that consciousness entirely deserted me. I seemed to
                  be carried back to the days of the crusades, and I saw an Eastern scene stretching
                  before me. The tents of two opposing hosts dotted a vast plain, and in the
                  distance, the minarets of a Moslem city arose against the transparent sky.
               "Then came the clash of battle; the infidels were overthrown, their city taken,
                  and delivered over to pillage. I followed a knight of lofty stature who had been
                  conspicuous in the fray. He entered, with others, into a palace filled with women
                  and children. Death followed on their track, and the arm of this stalwart knight
                  was raised against a defenceless woman. He stabbed her three times upon her
                  breast, making a mark exactly similar to the one I bear upon my person. With her
                  last breath, she shrieked:
               "'My blood shall cling to you and yours. It shall curse your descendants, the last
                  of whom shall perish by the hand of God himself.' It was strange that, although
                  the woman spoke in a language unknown to me, the interpretation of her words came
                  to me by that kind of magic known only to dreams."
               The priest listened with absorbing interest. He said:
               "Go on, my daughter. How did the vision end?"
               "That scene passed away, and the cell of an astrologer was next visible. The same
                  knight received from a venerable-looking man a scroll on which some Greek
                  characters were traced, which I could not decipher, but I heard the words of the
                  soothsayer. He said:
               "'Conceal this prediction, for while it rests in oblivion your house shall last.
                  When it is brought to light, its greatness shall pass away as a shadow, and be no
                  more.'
               "Then a long procession of my dead and buried ancestors passed slowly before me,
                  and each one whispered as he glided by me: 'We claim you as one of
                  ourselves—prepare to join our ghostly ranks, for the death-feast is made ready.'
                  Was not this a frightful vision, father, to come to a bride on the eve of her
                  marriage?"
               The good priest possessed as little superstition as belongs to most men, but this
                  ominous dream caused the cold drops to gather upon his brow. He hurriedly
                  said:
               "Your mind is full of fancies, my daughter, and you read too much nonsense. Think
                  no more of this vision. Be happy while you may, and do not permit so intangible a
                  thing as a dream to affect your spirits."
               "Then you think it has no significance? Oh, I am so happy that you do, for it has been a weight upon my
                  heart all day. Yes, I will forget it; I will be hopeful again."
               "That will be best, my daughter; and now I must dismiss you with my blessing, for
                  I have business with the Count that must be attended to."
               Clarice retired to the duties of the toilette, her heart a little lightened by the
                  words of the old man, and Father Gregory immediately sought the Count, and placed
                  the letter of Vivaldi in his hands.
               Such precautions were immediately taken as Ernesti felt assured must ensure the
                  arrest of Guilio if he attempted to penetrate into the castle; and he insisted
                  that the knowledge that he yet lived should be kept from Clarice at all hazards.
                  But he had a foe more wily than himself to deal with, and he forgot that the
                  hunted outlaw would probably prove subtle enough to evade his best planned
                  measures for security.
               The chapel had been decorated for the ceremony much against the will of the Count,
                  for he too well remembered the scene once enacted there, and the ghastly secret
                  its walls enclosed, to be willing to make it the scene of a festivity; but in this
                  Clarice had been wilful, and she declared that only before its altar would she be
                  married at all. Her father yielded, as he did to all her caprices, and the walls
                  were decorated with myrtle and orange boughs, and the pillars wreathed with vines
                  from the forest. Banners, which had been borne in many a battle's front by gallant
                  knights, bearing the name of the Ernesti, were draped above the altar, and on it
                  burned the consecrated candles.
               The chapel was one blaze of light, and at every entrance an armed man was placed
                  with strict orders to permit no stranger to enter on pain of his own life. Too
                  late had these precautions been taken. Crouching behind the folds of an immense
                  flag, on which a red cross was embroidered, was a hollow-eyed phantom, in whose
                  veins the fires of rage and insanity were burning. The wound on Guilio's head
                  predisposed him to madness, and the terrible mental suffering through which he had
                  passed had now completed their work. He was in that state of mind which stops at
                  nothing, however fearful might be the results that would flow from carrying out
                  his scheme of vengeance. He comprehended the drift of the preparations making, and
                  panting like an enraged tiger about to spring upon its prey, he awaited the
                  entrance of the bridal party.
               Mutterings of thunder, reverberated from the distant mountain peaks, were heard at
                  intervals, and the arrowy flashes of lightning which were seen even through the
                  illumination within, showed that the storm was gathering in its fury, and would
                  soon burst over the castle. But Guilio heeded it not—the storm that raged in his
                  heart was wilder and fiercer than any strife of the elements could become.
               He waited for the appearance of the bridal cortége to make his presence known;
                  then it was his purpose to spring forward and bear away his bride, or strike her
                  to the heart if she resisted him. He watched with feverish agony for the sounds
                  that would herald her approach, and although he knew that Clarice was willingly
                  giving her hand to another, he did not for an instant doubt that, when once
                  assured that he yet lived, she would bound to his arms, and cling to him in
                  defiance of every effort made to separate them.
               There was a murmur of voices, sounds of triumphant music, and a dazzling array of
                  pride and splendor poured into the ancient chapel. A bevy of young girls strewed
                  flowers before the fair bride, who came forward radiant in white, resplendent with
                  jewels, which flashed from every fold of her magnificent dress.
               But her face was all that Guilio saw, and the expression of pride and joy that now
                  rested on it struck coldly to his
                  heart. What if she really loved his rival? and his fiery glance fell upon the
                  splendid bridegroom, who looked as if the crowning triumph of his life had been
                  just attained.
               A cry of savage wrath arose, but at that instant the long delayed storm burst with
                  terrific violence; the thunder crashed in rapid reverberations, accompanied by
                  flashes of lightning so vivid as to pale the light of the lamps within the chapel,
                  and Guilio's cry was lost amid the increasing strife of the elements. He stood
                  breathless and panting, his brain whirling so violently that he felt himself
                  incapable of moving or speaking.
               They arranged themselves in front of the altar, and the voice of Father Gregory,
                  tremulous and uncertain, commenced the ceremony. Clarice clung trembling to the
                  arm of Evoli, for the fierce storm that raged without filled her with fear.
                  Suddenly a wild form bounded into the midst of the group, waving aloft a gleaming
                  dagger, which he aimed at the heart of Evoli, as he shouted:
               "False friend, base deceiver, take that as the reward of your treachery. Clarice,
                  I yet live! Come back to me, for you are mine, mine."
               Evoli rapidly parried the blow aimed at his life, and the reply of Clarice to this
                  appeal, was to throw herself in his arms as if for protection from him who so
                  madly loved her. At this, with a howl of rage, Guilio struck wildly at her breast,
                  resolute to fulfil his threat that living she should never become the bride of
                  another.
               At that instant the castle shook to its foundation—there was a stunning crash, a
                  blinding glare of lightning, and the wall of the chapel was shivered. A mass of
                  stone fell forward, and with it a skeleton rattled to the feet of the Count. A
                  pale blue flame seemed to play around the group before the altar; and each point
                  of the starry crown worn by the bride glittered in its phosphorescent rays.
               Falcone was struck down senseless, and all were stunned; when they recovered
                  sufficiently to note what was passing around them, they saw Evoli and the priest
                  sprinkling water over the pale face of Clarice, endeavoring to restore life to
                  her. Alas! all their efforts were vain. The last of the Ernesti had perished in
                  her youth, and the wretched father was left to end his days in the solitude of a
                  monastic life. The long-suspended curse was consummated, and all that now remained
                  to him was to consecrate the remnant of his existence to penitence and prayer.
               Guilio was taken to an asylum for lunatics, where he was cared for at Barnardo's
                  expense during the few remaining months of his life. Evoli mourned the loss of
                  Clarice with passionate sorrow, and in an active career he sought to drive the
                  memory of the past from his heart. He devoted his life to the elevation of his
                  country, and among the most distinguished of Italian patriots is to be found his
                  name.
               Vivaldi gained his inheritance, and with his fair Lucille he is happy. Marie
                  Montoni has found with them a permanent asylum; and in devotion to Lucille's
                  lovely children she has ceased to pine for the freedom of the wanderer's life.
               Gulietta accepted a consoler for the loss of Guilio, in the person of Barnardo,
                  who found the cavern a convenient place of refuge for himself, and a safe
                  receptacle for his contraband wares. She and her mother reign over the mountain
                  fastnesses, which still continue to be a refuge to the hunted outlaw.
            
            THE END.
