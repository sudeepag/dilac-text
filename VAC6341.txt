            BY MISS ELIZA A. DUPUY. AUTHOR OF "THE HIDDEN SIN," "A NEW WAY TO WIN A FORTUNE," "ALL FOR LOVE," "THE GIPSY'S WARNING," "THE MYSTERIOUS GUEST," "THE CANCELLED WILL," "WAS HE GUILTY," "WHO SHALL BE VICTOR," "MICHAEL RUDOLPH," "WHY DID HE MARRY HER," "THE PLANTER'S DAUGHTER," ETC.
            
               
                  "The Dethroned Heiress" is a deeply interesting story, full of plots and counter-plots, which keep the interest alive from first to last. The character of Mrs. Ashley is well sustained; the temptation to which she succumbs, does not destroy the interest of the reader in the fair sinner, and the retribution eventually brought home to her, still leaves something of interest and pity for the mother who risked so much for the supposed welfare of her child.

               CHAPTER I.
               THE JOLLY ANGLER.
               A PEDESTRIAN came slowly toward a small wayside tavern on a private road in the southern part of Maryland. The place was solitary enough, except in the fishing season, when parties came up from Baltimore and other towns to enjoy this quiet pastime in the blue waters of the Potomac, which flowed calm and majestic in its course toward the sea within a few hundred yards of the rustic haven that opened its doors to the tired wayfarer.
               The house consisted of two portions; an old-fashioned picturesque log cabin, with its rough walls matted over with ivy, mingled with the Virginia creeper, now flaming with bright scarlet blossoms, formed one wing. The other was more pretentious, and evidently of recent origin. A tall, staring frame two stories in height, glaring with fresh paint, and destitute of every floral embellishment, had been stuck on to the verdant nest we have described.
               The clinging vines were permitted to veil the decay of the old cabin, but the smart new house must shine forth in all its naked ugliness to show strangers how well to do was its owner.
               Indeed, the burly landlord had at one time seriously thought of cutting down a magnificent oak which stood in front of this pride of his heart, that passers-by might have a better view of the fine new addition to the old shanty, which had long been known as the Jolly Angler. But his wife, who, like most women, had a spice of reverence for ancient things in her heart, declared that it would be a sin to destroy the old patriarch of the woodland which had towered above its fellows for unnumbered years, though it yet seemed in the green vigor of youth.
               After several sharp struggles between the husband and wife, the tree was spared, and beneath its shelter the pedestrian now sat down, right glad to rest his weary limbs, for he had walked many miles from the railroad station at which he had been set down.
               The traveller was quite a young man. He could not have numbered more than twenty-five years, for his form possessed the slender proportions and elastic vigor of youth, and his face, though worn and troubled, was smooth and unwrinkled.
               It was not a handsome face, though there was an expression of resolution and firmness in the closed mouth which proved that its owner possessed that manliness of character which would lead him to brave danger without pausing to consider the consequences to himself.
               An active and observant spirit looked out from the deep-set eyes which gleamed dark and vivid beneath heavy black brows, and the whole aspect of the man gave the idea of a mixed character in which good impulses were often overcome in a moment of temptation. His complexion was sallow, and his hair straight and black as darkness itself.
               The landlord, who was smoking his pipe in the shade of the tree, glanced knowingly at the stranger, and decided in his own mind that he was not much, which in his vocabulary meant that he was neither rich nor aristocratic; for the new-comer's clothes were almost shabby, and his carriage that of a man depressed by fortune.
               The red-nosed Boniface deliberately removed his pipe from his mouth and slowly said:
               "Evenin', stranger. Had a long walk, I judge, from your tired looks; 'taint often as people comes here afoot, but it's all the same to me if I gets what's a-comin' to me all right."
               The young man half smiled as he stretched himself on a bench at the foot of the tree, and placed a small satchel he had brought in his hand beneath his head for a pillow. He carelessly said:
               "This is all the luggage I have with me, Mr. Samson, for I suppose you are that renowned individual; but there's money in my purse, at least enough to pay for all I am likely to get here," and he drew from his pocket a purse of open network, through the meshes of which a few pieces of gold were visible.
               Samson straightened himself, and tried to look dignified. He stiffly replied:
               "I wasn't insineratin' of anything agin your 'bility to pay, young man; an' as to what you'll git, I reckin the Jolly Angler can at least give you as good as you've been used to. The quality as comes here from Baltimore and all the country round when the fishin's prime, never finds no fault with their 'commodations."
               The stranger listlessly replied:
               "My wants are few and easily supplied. I must rest here to-night and go on my way in the morning; although I am not very far from the place I seek, I am too much fatigued to go on at once."
               Samson had opened his mouth to inquire to what place he was bound, when he was interrupted by the appearance of a small black-eyed woman, who paused in the doorway to scrutinize the new-comer with her keen orbs. More astute than her husband, Mrs. Samson at once decided that he was a gentleman, and she subdued the natural shrillness of her voice to a more gentle key, as she stepped out and addressed him.
               "A good evenin' to you, sir; ef I may ax, are you agoin to the grand weddin' up at the old Arden Place? Ef the bride aint so pretty nor so young as she might be, she's got a power o' money, an' grand folks thinks more o' that than anything else, I'm a thinkin'."
               "I am not bidden to the wedding, Madam; I am a stranger in this neighborhood, and came hither to see an old college chum on business that concerns himself. I could obtain no conveyance from the railroad station, and my long walk has given me a keen appetite for supper, after which I hope to enjoy a good night's rest under your hospitable roof."
               "The supper's ready to set before you. Mebbe you'd rather have it out thar than in the house. My ole man don't often come in to supper when the evenin's warm, and Sally can bring it out thar if you'd like to have it on a pine table."
               "I should infinitely prefer that arrangement, Madam. Pray permit Sally to do her devoir as speedily as possible."
               "I jest wish I may catch her a devourin' of anything afore her time comes, that's all," said Mrs. Samson, sharply. "It's settled, then, that the supper shall be brought out here; but it'll be worse for Sally, I can tell her, ef she goes to techin' any of it afore her betters is sarved."
               The stranger half smiled at this tirade, and sunk back upon the hard bench apparently too indolent to correct the landlady's mistake. He appeared to be so deeply absorbed in thought that he was deaf to all the attempts of the landlord to engage him in further conversation.
               Sally, a very black and shiny-faced young girl, brought out a small table on which a white cloth was spread, and the nicely cooked supper was soon placed upon the board. There was delicious coffee, with thick yellow cream, biscuit, white and crisp, rich butter, and fresh fish from the neighboring river.
               The girl placed plates for three, and the jaunty little landlady, in a smart cap, took her place in front of the tray, while Sally waved a spreading fan of peacock's feathers above the table to keep off the insects that fluttered around in that soft June evening.
               There had been a slight fall of rain in the earlier part of the afternoon, and toward the west the hazy mist which veiled the path of the sun was suddenly lighted up in golden glory by the bursting forth of that luminary, and the whole heavens seemed aflame with the vivid illumination.
               The guest laid down his knife and fork, and for a few moments seemed rapt in the contemplation of the brilliant concave filled with this gorgeous phantasmagoria of light, but his thoughts were brought back from heaven to earth by the voice of Mrs. Samson, saying:
               "I reckin the brightness o' them clouds thar is like what we'll see when we mounts to glory; that is, ef we're so fortunate as to git to the New Jerusalem with the elect."
               Samson put down his cup and solemnly said:
               "Now, ole 'oman, you jest shet up 'bout the 'lect; as ef God's a gwine to pick an' choose among the critters he's made, sendin' one to glory out of every ninety-nine, an' leavin' the balance to go to the mischief. I say God's no 'specter o' persons, an' I don' put no faith in 'lection, unless it's for a President, or a member o' Congress, or sick like; so pleast to hold on, on that thar subject, caze you knows it's one I can't bar."
               
               "Ah, well, you'd better larn to bar with it, John Samson, for you'll find it in all the church articles. Yes, every one of'em has it as well as my church. They all sings the same song on that ar' subjict."
               "Well, it's a song I sha'n't listen to, so thar. Now you jest find somethin' else to talk about, or do penince by holdin' your mouth shet."
               Thus suddenly silenced on her favorite topic, Mrs. Samson demurely ate her supper for a few moments and then suddenly broke forth:
               "That's a happy omen for Miss Arden; for the old sayin' is, 'happy is the bride the sun shines on;' an' I've been sorry to see her weddin' day overcast. But now this will make up for all; an'ef her life's as bright as this sunset, I'm sure she'll have nothing in this sinful vale to ax for more."
               The fat landlord crossed his knife and fork and solemnly said:
               "Ef Miss Grace Arden 'spects to have happiness with that ar chap she's been foolish enough to set her heart on, she must be dazed. Why, he have been sich a wild one, and run through wi' sich a power o' money, that they do say the Judge would ha' turned him adrift ef he hadn't made all fa'r an' squar' by axin' Miss Arden to be his wife."
               "They say—they say!" repeated his wife, snappishly. "I don' care what is said. I've known this youngster all his life, an'he's a free-hearted, dashin' fellow, with a pleasant word for everybody as comes anigh him. I, for one, will never believe all the things that's said of him. I don' b'lieve none o' those stories 'bout his wild doin's at college, nor the tales that come back here 'bout a young gal he was dead in love wi' at the north. Ef all that had been true, he'd never ha' come back here to marry that pale, delicate Grace Arden."
               The conversation of the landlord and his wife gradually attracted the attention of their guest; and something in this description seemed to strike him painfully, for his dark face grew stern, and he abruptly asked:
               "Of whom are you speaking, Madam? Excuse me, but I am anxious to know the name of this bridegroom."
               "It's no secret, I'm sure, an' you're welcome to it. Leon Ashley is as fine—"
               The encomium she was about to utter was cut short by the sudden outburst of the stranger. He pushed his chair back, struck his hand vehemently on the table, and exclaimed:
               "Leon Ashley on the eve of marriage! Impossible! He dare not—he dare not attempt such a thing."
               Samson stared at him in dumb amazement; but his wife soon recovered the power of speech, and indignantly retorted:
               "I don' know why he shouldn't, ef it's his pleasure to do so; an' I don't think the likes o' you can prevent it, eyther."
               The stranger excitedly replied:
               "But I will, I tell you. I must do it, for his sake as well as for that of another in whom I am more deeply interested. How far from here is Judge Ashley's place? I must seek him there at once. I must see him before he has time to consummate this great wrong."
               "Hey day, this is pretty talk to have about Mr. Ashley, an' you come from nobody knows whar," replied the incensed landlady.
               The stranger spoke more calmly:
               "Madam, I swear to you that Leon Ashley has no right to marry the young lady of whom you spoke. I came hither to seek him, and I must now find him without delay. Can you let me have a horse, and direct me to his father's house?"
               
               "It's no use goin' thar, for the weddin' is to be at nine o'clock, an' I s'pose the bride is dressin' now. You can't git no horse here to go on no sich errand as that. Mr. Leon shall git his rich wife in spite of all you kin do to prevent it."
               The deep set eyes of the young man flashed, and he sternly replied:
               "Then I shall walk, tired as I am. God will help me to sustain my strength, for he knows that I am doing his work in preventing the union about to take place. How far from this is Arden Place?"
               "It's nigh on to six mile, an' you could never walk thar in time to stop the parson, so what's the use? Jest go to bed like a tired Christian, an' let things take thar course among your betters."
               "That is quite impossible. I must see Leon Ashley this night; must drag him back from the brink of the precipice on which he stands. I do not now love him—God knows I do not; but for the sake of one I am bound to protect, I must not permit this iniquitous marriage to go on. But for her he might sink into the pit he is digging for himself."
               His rapid utterance, excited air, and the singular tenor of his words, at length aroused the landlord from his stupefaction, and he asked:
               "What's that chap been up to now? If you'll speak out an' tell me what he's been and done, I'll find a horse for you to ride on in spite of all my ole woman can say agin it; that is, ef I think it's enough to warrant you in breakin' in on the weddin' folks."
               After a moment's reflection the young man seemed to have decided on the course it would be best to pursue, and he more quietly said:
               "My name is James Hunter, and I came hither from New York. I was a classmate of Leon Ashley at Yale, and at one time his most intimate friend. Since it is necessary to give you a reason for my intended interference with the wedding about to be celebrated, I will merely say that it is made to prevent bigamy. Ashley is already married."
               Had a thunderbolt exploded at their feet the pair could scarcely have exhibited greater consternation. The woman was the first to recover speech.
               "Married! another wife living! Eh, but this is a grave charge to bring agin your friend, young man. Are you sure of what you say? for Judge Ashley will bring you to a sore account if your charge is not made good. He's a fearful man when his temper's up, an' his pride o' heart is as great as that o' Lucifer hisself."
               "Judge Ashley's son is already married, and I can prove it," reiterated Hunter, in measured accents, though there was a choking sensation in his throat that threatened to impede further utterance, and the sallow hue of his complexion assumed a ghastly tint.
               He suddenly sat down, and hoarsely muttered:
               "Water! water! I am suffocating."
               Sally rushed into the house, and speedily returned with a goblet brimming over with the sparkling fluid. Hunter hastily swallowed a portion of it, and then became conscious that both Samson and his wife were talking together, asking him innumerable questions, which he was in no mood to answer. He impatiently said:
               "I have stated to you, Mr. Samson, the imperative necessity of seeking Leon Ashley without delay, and it rests with you to furnish me the means of doing so. If you are his friend, you will order a horse for me without further words on the subject, for he stands in deep peril in this hour, from which I may not yet be in time to rescue him."
               
               "How do I know that you'll not do something dreadful when you git face to face wi' him? You mought murder him for all I know, an' whar'd I be I'd like to know? an' Judge Ashley my landlord, too! Though, for the matter o' that, I've made all the improvements on this ere place, an' added that fine new part to the ole shanty as used to be the Jolly Angler; all at my own cost, too."
               The young man impatiently listened to the prosy landlord, and then gravely said:
               "You need have no fears for Mr. Ashley's safety. His life is sacred to me, deep as is the wrong he is about to consummate against one I have loved from childhood. Come, sir; I have no time to lose, for I must be going if I would be in time to put a stop to the wedding. Will you furnish me with a horse, or will you not?"
               The enormity of the crime of which Ashley was accused effectually silenced Mrs. Samson, and after a side glance toward her, her husband replied:
               "Well—I 'spose you can have the beast; he be's none o' the fastest o' travellers, an' I'm feared he'll come to grief ef you push him too hard. Will you promise me now that you'll have mercy on the critter?"
               Burning with impatience to be off, stifling with difficulty the fiery indignation which swelled in his bosom, Hunter impatiently replied:
               "Have the horse brought out, and I promise to curb my impetuosity so far as to avoid injury to him. I pledge myself not to push him beyond his powers; but if I hope to be in time, I must set out at once. The sun has set, and in country places the hours are earlier than in cities. Hasten, I entreat you, Mr. Samson, if you really wish evil to be averted from your landlord's son."
               Samson slowly arose, waddled toward a gate opening into a yard, and reluctantly gave the necessary orders. In a few moments a high, lean horse, with shaggy mane, and tail knotted up with burs, was brought out. All fire seemed dead within him, and he stood with his head meekly bowed between his forelegs, as if worn out with the labors of the day.
               Hunter looked at this Rosinante in dismay, and he indignantly said:
               "This is a broken down plough horse, unfit to ride at any time, and least of all on such an errand as mine!"
               "The critter's all I have, an' you may take or leave him, jest as you please," replied the landlord, in high dudgeon. "He's worked in the plough all day, but I tell you that he's the fastest walker in all these parts, an' he'll take you to Arden Place in no time to speak on. Miss Grace is fashinible, an' she won't be married afore nine o'clock, an' the ole clock aint gone seven yit."
               "How far from here is Arden Place?" asked Hunter.
               "Not more'n six mile; an' you'll have plenty o' time."
               "He hesitated a moment; but his previous fatigue assured him that it would be hopeless to attempt to walk that distance before nine o'clock, and he resignedly said:
               "It is the best I can do; so I must mount this weary drudge, I suppose; so point out to me the exact road I am to take."
               "Go straight on for a mile, thar the roads fork; an' ef you'll be sho to take the left hand path, it'll bring you out at the right place. Arter you strike off, you'll find plenty goin' the same road, so you can hardly miss it."
               Without further parley Hunter sprang into the saddle, leaving his satchel behind him, and putting his jaded steed to his best paces, was soon out of sight.
               Samson shook his head dubiously as he muttered:
               "I'm 'fraid he'll spile that ere critter wuss'n ever. Well, the hoss aint fit for much anyhow, an' what could I do in sich a strait as this? The Judge can't blame me, even ef he does find out what I done."
               His wife decisively replied:
               "You couldn't a done nothin' but help him on his way arter what he tole us. Ef it's true that thar's another wife, it would be a burnin' shame to let Leon Ashley play off sich villany agin Miss Arden. Poor gal! she'll break her heart over his falseness anyway, I'm afeard."
               Samson lugubriously shook his head.
               "Ef I aint mightily mistaken, there'll be more'n heartbreak to pay. That fiery young brother o' hern will never stand sich a insult to his sister as this. Oh, oh—there'll be the devil to pay over at the Place when it's knowed thar's another wife in the way."
               "Do you really think that, Sammy?" Ef I believed it, I'd have my pony saddled and follow arter that youngster. I'd like mightily to know what will happen over thar tonight."
               "An' git yerself in a regular mess! No, I thank you, Mrs. Sam, you don't go on no wild goose chase to a house to which we've never bin thought good enough to be axed. The whole country side was bid to this grand weddin' 'cept you an' me, and I stan's on my dignity now. The scripter says, 'pride must have a fall,' an' that o' Judge Ashley will topple down this night, high an' mighty as 'tis. I don't know what punishment he'll think fittin' for that ere scamp o' his'n; I shouldn't wonder ef he took the law in his own han's, ef that ere Hunter don't git thar in time to perwent bigermy."
               "Well—as I wasn't axed, mebbe I'd better not go. But what's to become o' Miss Arden? She loves the very groun' that Leon Ashley steps on, they say, an' it'll go hard wi' her to know that he's as false as he can be. She have loved him since they was children together, though she's a matter o' two years older'n him."
               Samson philosophically replied:
               "Oh, she'll git over it in time. Miss Arden was a dunce to think that a wild young fellow like Leon would fall in love with sich a little pale thing as she is. Ef women will be fools, they mus' pay the piper, that's all. As to Miss Grace, I b'lieve she aint soft enough to break her heart about this ne'er do well."
               "I hope it'll prove so, but I have my doubts, for there's somethin' cranky about all the Ardens', an' more'n one's bin put in the madhouse. Ef you won't let me go up to the Place, ole man, mebbe you'll go yerself, an' see what happens thar, for I sha'n't sleep a wink till I hear all about it."
               "What! I go on sich a fool's errind as that! an'run the risk of breakin' the pony's back by my weight! I aint cur'us about other folk's doin's, specially those what think theirselves so much above me, so you may be sho I sha'n't go up thar. Besides, that chap'll be back here 'fore day; arter he's thrown a torpedo in their midst, he'll soon find the place too hot to hold him, I reckin."
               Thus compelled to curb her curiosity, the landlady busied herself in assisting Sally to clear the table, and found some consolation for her disappointment in communicating the exciting news she had heard to her sable dependents.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               A STORY OF TREACHERY AND WRONG.
               IN the mean time Hunter had passed with tolerable speed over the first mile, and struck into the road which led to Arden Place.
               The moon had not yet risen, and it was very dark in the sombre woodland through which the narrow road wound; he soon found it impossible to push his weary steed out of a heavy walk, and more than once he was tempted to dismount and proceed the remainder of the way on foot. But the physical languor which was creeping over him, in spite of the extreme excitement of his mind, assured him that he could never accomplish the distance in time, so he rode doggedly on, setting his teeth firmly together to repress the impatient execrations that arose to his lips.
               The guests seemed to have made their way to the scene of gayety at an earlier hour, for the road was silent and solitary, and he had leisure to review the past years in which he and Leon Ashley had been friends to all outward seeming, though in reality there was little depth of true attachment between them.
               They had been classmates at college, and fondness for the same pursuits knit the bond between them. Both were gay, rollicking pleasure-seekers, and the purse of the rich and lavish Ashley was always open to his more needy companion.
               In return for these pecuniary obligations, Hunter had invited the young collegian to spend a vacation in the cottage of his mother. The proposal would have possessed little attraction for a fast young man like Leon Ashley, if he had not heard of a beautiful young cousin who dwelt in that rustic home, to whom Hunter had long been betrothed. In truth, he scarcely knew himself when he had not loved Eva Weston, and he had such faith in her truth and purity, that he feared no rival, not even in the brilliant and fascinating friend he brought with him to the roof that sheltered her, for he believed that Ashley would respect the tie that bound this fair young creature to himself, and refrain from flirting with her as he was in the habit of doing with others. He had yet to learn that where women were concerned cerned, Leon Ashley had neither scruples of honor nor conscience.
               Alas for poor Eva! she was very young, and her heart was as yet a riddle to herself. She regarded her cousin with the quiet tenderness of a sister, and looked forward to their union as an event which would give permanence to the tranquil happiness she enjoyed beneath his mother's roof. The advent of the handsome Southerner changed all this; the young girl was singularly lovely and refined, and a few weeks of daily intercourse between the two revealed to Eva that the quiet affection she cherished for her cousin was not the true love, and brought the inconstant heart of the young stranger in homage to the feet of the rustic beauty.
               Mrs. Hunter, with the acuteness of her sex in such matters, soon detected the condition of affairs, but she quietly suffered things to take their own course. She had always disapproved of the marriage of her slenderly endowed son with her dependent niece, and she wisely concluded if this wealthy young Southerner would bear Eva away, it would be better for all parties concerned. Ashley was quite able to repay her son for robbing him of his bride, by assisting him in his future career, and possibly by finding a richly endowed wife for him.
               So the astute widow shut her eyes to what was passing before her, and wondered at the blind confidence of her son.
               Hunter was summoned from home for a few days on business, and excusing himself to his friend, he left him to the hospitable ministrations of his mother and cousin, without a lurking suspicion of the treason developing against himself. That brief absence was fatal to his long-cherished hopes, and to the happiness of the unfortunate Eva.
               She weakly yielded to the entreaties of Ashley, and while out riding with him crossed the State line, near which the village was situated, went to the house of a clergyman with him, and they were married.
               Many reasons were given to the confiding girl for maintaining the most absolute secrecy as to their union; and Eva, trembling at the thought of her own treachery to her betrothed, shrinking from his reproaches, readily consented to all Ashley proposed.
               While away from home, Hunter was struck with severe illness, and his mother was summoned to his bedside. Eva refused to accompany her, though she could give no plausible reason for doing so. A friend was found to take charge of her during her aunt's absence, and Ashley removed to the village hotel, professing his intention of speedily taking his departure.
               But he still lingered on from week to week, and every day that Eva could evade the careless eyes set as a watch over her, she spent with her husband in wandering through the neighboring woodland, forgetful of all the world beside.
               The sweet idyl of love was again enacted in perfect freedom from restraint, for the matron in whose charge the young girl had been placed, was much too busy with her own olive branches to give much thought or attention to her guest.
               Mrs. Elmer had perfect confidence in her prudence, and her walks, rides, and long tête-à-têtes with the fascinating Ashley, were of little significance to her. Eva was young and attractive, therefore entitled to such attentions from gentlemen, and thus the trusting girl was left to dream her dream out in its brief but beautiful delusiveness.
               The announcement of her aunt's speedy return, accompanied by her convalescent son, first aroused Eva from the blissful contentment in which the last few weeks of her life had been passed.
               Ashley shrank from a meeting with the friend toward whom he had played so treacherous a part; already had he had leisure to see the folly of the act of which he had been guilty, and now the first glamour of his passion was over, he bitterly repented his imprudent marriage.
               His father, one of the haughtiest and most aristocratic of men, he well knew would never consent to receive this penniless girl as the wife of his only son; and circumstances which had occurred in his own family, caused Ashley to doubt whether his own precipitate marriage would ever be forgiven. The father who had cast off an only and beloved daughter because she married beneath herself, would scarcely be more lenient toward his son.
               Unwilling to meet the man toward whom he had played so false a part, Ashley feigned the necessity of immediate departure to his native home; plausible reasons were invented for this course, which satisfied the mind of the young wife, though they were far from giving ease to her aching heart.
               Judge Ashley was represented to her as a terrible ogre, who must be propitiated before it was made known to him that his son had found a Northern bride, whose only dower was her beauty and intelligence.
               After a bitter struggle the two parted, but arrangements were made to keep up a constant correspondence without the knowledge of Eva's relatives. This for a few weeks sustained her failing spirits, but Ashley's letters soon ceased to come regularly, and those that did arrive were filled with excuses for his neglect, which fell coldly on her heart.
               Hunter was so slow in recovering from his long illness that he abandoned all thoughts of returning to college, and began to speak of marrying at once, and settling down at home, while he pursued his law studies with a friend in the village.
               Eva listened to his plans in extreme trepidation, but she sealed her lips upon the subject so vital to her future happiness and respectability. She had never been demonstrative in her affection for her cousin, and he was slow to remark the change that had come over her.
               When she shrank away and changed color, if he attempted to caress her, Hunter only attributed it to coyness; and full of his own love and future happiness, he took it for granted that all was right with Eva.
               Hunter went steadily on, preparing for their immediate union; and poor Eva's courage utterly failed her when an anxiously-expected missive from her husband came to hand, in which he positively prohibited her from betraying their union. Ashley insisted that she could find other means of deferring the marriage which was pressed upon her, and declared that it would bring ruin on his prospects if he was forced to acknowledge their union for several months to come.
               Eva endeavored to obey him, but her cousin laughed at her objections, and treated them as futile. In fact, he scarcely seemed to believe that they could be seriously offered, after the long engagement which had existed between them. The days passed on; the one appointed for the wedding drew near, and the helpless girl, with many causes of wretchedness pressing heavily upon her, took the resolution to fly from the house in which she felt she could no longer remain with honor.
               One morning her room was found empty, and a letter left upon the dressing-stand was all that gave a clue to the motives of her departure. It was addressed to Hunter, and contained these words:
               
                  "COUSIN JAMES—I do not love you as a wife should love her husband, and therefore I leave you. I have money enough for my present wants, and when that is gone I know where to get more.
                  "I have done very wrong by you, but you will forgive, and love me yet as your sister. I have been very unhappy during all these weeks of concealment, but I hope the worst is over now; and, in time to come, I am sure you will think my present course the best I could take.
                  "I cannot explain matters to you, cousin; but time will set things right; and I hope you won't think evil of me, for, indeed, I do not deserve blame except for my treatment of you. I hope you do not love me so very much, Cousin James; for, if I thought you care as much for me as I do for another, I should be very—very miserable.
                  "Yes—I love another, and that has severed us; so forgive the wayward heart that could not find happiness in your affection, and forget the ingratitude of your Cousin Eva."
               
               Stunned, bewildered, outraged in every feeling, Hunter read these lines, and then dashed them in his mother's lap. Mrs. Hunter had brought the unsealed letter from her niece's room, and as she had already read its contents, she now merely glanced over them, and slowly said:
               "This scarcely takes me by surprise. You were very blind that you did not see how desperately in love with each other Eva and young Ashley were before you went away."
               "How could I suspect that the girl of my heart, and the friend to whom I have always been true, could thus play me false?" he asked, in a broken tone. "Oh, mother, I loved Eva so dearly that I would have resigned my own hopes to make her happy if she had only confided in me. She has fled from her friends, and gone no one knows whither, and I tremble for the fate of the unfortunate creature. If she has been mad enough to follow Ashley, she is blighted forever. He keeps no faith with women; he has trifled with many since I have known him; but I did believe that my betrothed would be sacred to him. I must follow the deluded girl at once and bring her back to those who love her sincerely."
               
               He was about to rush from the room, when Mrs. Hunter quietly laid her hand on his arm and said:
               "Eva will never return here, for I am quite sure she is married to your friend."
               "Married! when? where? by whom?" he impetuously asked. "Oh, I hope this is true, mother; for anything is better than to believe she has fled from her home in pursuit of a man who was only making love to her for his own amusement. But why have they acted thus? There is no reason why the marriage should have been clandestine, for Ashley is the only son of a wealthy man, and he can afford to please himself in the choice of a wife. What ground have you for asserting what you did just now?"
               "Sit down, calm yourself, and I will tell you."
               Hunter sunk upon a chair with a deep sigh, and his mother calmly went on:
               "When you were called away from home, Eva and young Ashley openly showed how much they were taken with each other. I watched them quietly, and satisfied myself that your hopes were ended in that quarter. A few days after you went away they left here on horseback early in the afternoon, and did not get back till long after night. They would give no satisfactory explanation of where they had been, and Mr. Ashley, with a strange twinkle in his eye, said they had lost their way. Eva seemed in a singular flutter, and I watched her keenly while she was pretending to eat the late supper I set for them. I saw the expression of her eyes when they glanced toward him, and I thought then that something strange had happened.
               "I was determined to find out where they had been, and the next day I heard something from a neighbor which opened my eyes to their duplicity. Mrs. Cutter's son Tom had been over in York State on some business, and he met Ashley and Eva across the line going straight to Parson Fairchild's—the man, you know, who marries runaway couples from these parts.
               "Cutter naturally thought they would come back and everybody be told that they were married; but when nothing of the kind happened, he supposed he was mistaken in their object in riding so far. But I was keener than that, for I knew what had been going on so long between them. I should have spoken to them on the subject, but you sent for me to nurse you, and when we came back home Ashley was gone.
               "I saw that Eva was unhappy, but I knew you were too much infatuated with her to listen to, or believe me, if I spoke of my suspicions; so I left things to take their own course. I have been looking every day for some such catastrophe as this; but till she took some decisive step, I thought it best to leave you in your delusion. It was all I could do, James, as you must see yourself."
               Hunter listened to this explanation as one in a vague dream. When she ceased speaking he abruptly replied:
               "You have been unkind, not to say cruel, mother. If I had suspected this, I would never have urged on my marriage with Eva. Every feeling of pride, as well as of affection for her, would have forbidden it. If she is an unacknowledged wife, she should have remained with her natural protectors till I had compelled Ashley to do justice to her. If you had loved this poor girl as you ought, mother, you could not so calmly have looked on while she was going to destruction. Even if Ashley has made her his wife, he can never make her, or any other woman, happy."
               To this reproach Mrs. Hunter bitterly replied.
               "Why should I love her? She is not of my blood, and she came with her taking ways between her uncle and myself; when he has gone, she stood between me and my only child. It was much that I tolerated her beneath my roof, and acted toward her as a Christian woman should to those who are dependent upon her. Now I will speak the truth. I am glad Eva is gone; that she can never be your wife; but I do not wish her any evil, and I shall be happy to know that she is really married to that young man."
               "I will soon satisfy my doubts as to that," said Hunter, suddenly rising and putting on his hat. "Badly as Eva has treated me, I must stand in the place of a brother to her, and see that justice is done her. I will go myself to Mr. Fairchild's and ascertain if he really united her to Ashley."
               He would have left the room, but Mrs. Hunter detained him, insisting that he should breakfast before going on his errand. He hastily swallowed the cup of coffee she gave him, ate a few mouthfuls of bread, and hurried away. In a few moments he was mounted on horseback and flying like the wind toward his place of destination.
               A hard ride of ten miles brought him in sight of the rustic home in which a retired Methodist minister resided, whose chief source of income was derived from the fees paid by runaway couples from the neighboring State who required his services.
               Hunter dismounted at the gate, and, securing his horse, entered the enclosure. An elderly man in rough country apparel came forward to meet him, laying aside the rake with which he had been gathering up hay as he did so. He smiled good humoredly and asked:
               "What is your business with me, young man? If you had not come here alone, I should hardly have had cause to ask the question of so good-looking a chap as you are."
               "You, then, are Mr. Fairchild?" said Hunter, bluntly. "If I am right, I have some business with you."
               "Eh? wanting to make arrangements beforehand, and then bring the young lady? Well, well, we can soon settle the preliminaries to your satisfaction. Come in—come in, and tell me what you want."
               Hunter followed him into his small, poorly furnished house, and Fairchild led the way to his study. On a table lay a large, heavily-bound book, on which the eye of the visitor instantly fastened. He pointed to it and said:
               "That, I see, is the register of the marriages performed by you. My object in coming hither is not to make arrangements for my own, but to gain evidence of one which I believe took place on the eighteenth of last July. If you will turn to that date, and read out the names inscribed on that day, I shall be very much indebted to you."
               Mr. Fairchild saw that the speaker was endeavoring to control some powerful emotion, and he quietly replied:
               "I keep this register for my own satisfaction, but every one is at liberty to inspect it. On the eighteenth of July did you say? Let me see—there was but one entry on that day, and a handsomer couple I never joined together. The poor girl seemed dreadfully agitated, but she clung to her lover as if her life was bound up in him."
               The listener made an impatient gesture, and the talkative old man hastened to turn over the leaves till he found the required date.
               "Ah! here it is—but one entry on that day, as I said."
               "And the names, the names—what are they?"
               "Read 'em for yourself; they are plain enough before you."
               And the speaker pointed to the two lines briefly traced near the top of the page.
               Hunter glanced over them, but he only saw the names of Charles Leon Ashley and Eva Weston, and he quickly said:
               "That is enough, sir. I am satisfied that those two were lawfully united on the day referred to, and I have nothing further to inquire. Good morning, Mr. Fairchild."
               "Not so fast, if you please, young man. Was there any mystery about that marriage? and was it not at once revealed to the friends of the parties? I am no friend to underhand doings, and if I had known that concealment was necessary after the ceremony was performed, I should have refused to officiate."
               "It was not necessary," said Hunter, coldly. "Some romantic freak induced the parties to conceal their union from their friends, that is all. The young lady is a relative of mine, and I considered it best to obtain proof that the marriage has actually taken place."
               "Very right, sir—very right. The young fellow was a dashing blade, and the girl seemed to have no will but his. Nobody knows what might happen in such a case as this; clandestine marriages are sometimes sad snares. But no one ever comes to me without having their names put down in my book in black and white, with the date of the marriage all right."
               "May not false names sometimes be given?"
               "I scarcely think that could be done, for much in love as a girl may be, if she knows the true name of her lover, she will hardly submit to be married to him under a false one. It may sometimes be so though, and I not know it, for in the ten years I have lived here and followed this calling, you are the first person who has asked to see my register."
               Hunter effected his escape from the garrulous parson, and rode away in a maze of thought and feeling. The certainty was gained: Eva was lost to him forever; she had probably sacrificed peace and happiness at the bidding of her lover, but she should at least be saved from the taint of shame. She was the lawfully wedded wife of Leon Ashley, and as such she should be acknowledged before the world.
               Until assured that an impassible barrier arose between Eva and himself, Hunter had not known how tenderly he loved her; that love enabled him even to forgive the wrong she had done him, and to be only the gentle and forgiving friend, solicitous for her happiness alone in the steps he would take to place her in her proper position.
               Hunter hastened back to his home, informed his mother of the result of his quest, and told her to account for Eva's disappearance by informing her friends that she had gone to join Mr. Ashley, to whom she had been privately married several months. He then went to his own apartment, and wrote to Ashley:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "W——, October 5, 18—.
                           
                           "After what has happened, Leon Ashley, you can never again expect me to acknowledge you as my friend. I can in truth say, 'would to God we had never met, for you have not only blighted my happiness, but you will also destroy that of the girl I have loved with truth and sincerity.'
                           "My cousin has left my house to join you, and by the time this reaches you she will doubtless be with you. Why either of you have thought it necessary to conceal your union I do not understand, but if this concealment lasts so long as to threaten disastrous results to Eva, I will come forward and proclaim it myself.
                           "Mark me, Ashley—I speak of your marriage, for I am aware that it actually took place. A clue was accidentally furnished the very morning after my cousin disappeared, and I lost no time in following it up. I visited the house of Mr. Fairchild, and saw there the register of your union with Eva Weston on the eighteenth of July last.
                           "I do not utter reproaches for the treachery of which you have been guilty. Of you I should have expected nothing better, and I was myself to blame for bringing a fascinating and unprincipled man of pleasure in daily contact with my cousin.
                           "She was young and inexperienced, and she has fallen a victim to your wiles; yes, under the most favorable circumstances, as your wife she must be a victim to your capricious temper and inconstant nature. Since she is your wife, I demand that she shall be acknowledged as such without unnecessary delay. However wretched she may be in that position, it is still hers, and she shall at least possess the station to which she is legally entitled.
                           "I do not make threats, but you know me, and you know that I always mean what I say. Do justice to Eva, or I will take such measures as must result in her acknowledgment whether you wish it or not.
                           
                              "JAMES HUNTER."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               This letter was at once dispatched to New Haven where he supposed Ashley was spending his last college term. Several weeks elapsed before any reply came; and Hunter had several times been on the eve of setting out in pursuit of him, but the persuasions of his mother detained him near her till the long-expected letter came. It was dated from New York, and contained these lines:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "HUNTER:—Your letter was forwarded to this place, where I have been for the last few weeks in the society of my sweet Eva.
                           "I treated you badly, old fellow, I acknowledge, but you must not think too hardly of me, for the temptation was irresistible. After all, Eva loved me, and not you, so I only did what any other man would have done in my place—took my own to my heart.
                           "We were compelled to a clandestine marriage for more reasons than one. The first was Eva's entanglement with you, and the second is, that my father is a most unreasonable and tyrannical old fogey, who would be capable of throwing me off altogether if he suspected that I had made so unworldly a match. You must give me time to feel my ground with him, and make sure of his consent before I inform him of what will so deeply displease him.
                           "When the proper time arrives, I pledge myself to proclaim Eva to the whole world as my dear and cherished wife. She fled to me, and she is nestling beside me now, her sweet face bright with happiness.
                           "I have left college permanently, for I could not keep my treasure near me in New Haven without exciting unpleasant gossip. In this great city we are unknown to every one, and as happy as perfect devotion to each other can render us. I have written so plausibly to my father about my departure from college, that I am sure he will not object to what I have done, for in some things he is very indulgent.
                           "Only consent to remain quiet, Hunter, and things will be sure to come around right. I shall manage for the best both for myself and my little turtle dove. You know that we were regularly married, and that should be enough to satisfy you for the present. Leave the rest to me and all will be well.
                           
                              C. L. ASHLEY."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               A few lines in a delicate and well-known hand were added:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "DEAR COUSIN JAMES—I took the railroad and went on to New Haven. From the hotel I sent for Leon, who came at once, and his joyful transports at seeing me atoned for all I had suffered in my mind after leaving you and my aunt so abruptly. I did not think she would mind much, but I knew you would deeply feel the shock of my duplicity.
                           "Forgive me, cousin, but I did not love you except as a sister, and I knew it would be wrong to marry you while my whole heart cried out for another. I had not courage to tell you of the cruel dilemma in which my marriage placed me, so I fled.
                           "I am happy—supremely happy—and I beg that you will not interfere with the plans of my husband in any way. He has explained his position to me, and I fully acquiesce in the necessity of the course he has pursued. I trust him implicitly.—Yours with sisterly affection,
                           
                              "EVA ASHLEY."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               There was nothing more to be done, and from this time Hunter's life sunk to the dreary level of despondency which is felt by the young when a first bitter disappointment falls on the untried spirit.
               Hitherto every hope and plan had an object; now, he felt deserted, spiritless, and weary of life. In this vacuum he took to playing games of chance in the hope of driving his sorrow from his mind. He soon became not only skilful, but absorbed in them to the exclusion of nearly every important interest in life. At this juncture his mother unfortunately fell ill and died, leaving him free to act as he pleased.
               Hunter relinquished the study of the profession he had chosen, and devoted his life to the exciting career of a gambler. He never played unfairly, and therefore failed to gain more than a precarious living, and for many months he stifled the memory of his lost love in his devotion to cards.
               The dull apathy of feeling which was creeping over him was broken by a letter from his cousin summoning him to her side. It was evidently written under the wildest excitement of feeling, and was signed "your broken-hearted Eva."
               The address given was a small fishing village on Long Island, and he was to seek her in the house of a widow named Sims, with whom she was boarding.
               Two-thirds of a year had passed away since the newly-wedded pair deprecated all interference from him, and he had patiently waited till Eva herself should summon him to her assistance; for he felt the bitter conviction that she would yet need it, and the contents of her letter scarcely surprised him.
               Hunter hastened to obey the summons, and after a hurried journey he reached the place to which he had been directed. The cottage of Mrs. Sims stood on the outskirts of the village, and thither Hunter made his way.
               He found that he was expected, and after a brief delay he was ushered into the presence of his cousin; but oh! so changed, so broken in health and spirits was the fair Eva he had once known, that he was scarcely able to recognize her.
               She was reclining on a couch with a young child beside her, and her flushed cheeks, flashing eyes and burning hand assured him that she was consumed by inward fever. She wept convulsively as she held his hand in hers, but at length commanded herself sufficiently to say:
               "I knew you would come to me, little as I deserved it. I am dying, cousin, and I sent for you to entreat you to take charge of my infant. She will have no friend but you after I am gone."
               "Where then is her father? He is not dead?"
               An indescribable expression of anguish swept over her face, and she faltered:
               "He is dead to me—let that suffice."
               "No, by heaven!" thundered Hunter, "it shall not suffice! Where is Ashley? I will at once seek him and compel him to return to you."
               "It cannot be," she resignedly said. "When I at last comprehended that I am a clog on his destiny—that a public recognition of the tie that binds us together must bring ruin on him, I bade him go. I cannot live long to trouble any one—the child will be provided for; she will be no burden to you in a pecuniary way."
               By the exercise of extreme patience and forbearance toward the helpless and deserted wife, Hunter gradually learned the history of the last eight months of her life.
               For a season after she joined him Ashley had been devoted to her; but with his natural inconstancy, he soon wearied of this; he first neglected her for the pleasures of a city life; then he absented himself for weeks at a time without writing a line to her. Ashley made two visits to Maryland, ostensibly to soften his father, and, if possible, gain his approbation of the step he had taken; but he returned deeply chagrined and discouraged, and recklessly betrayed to Eva that his utter ruin would be consummated if their union became known to Judge Ashley.
               Her spirits and health both failed her, but her husband seemed unconscious of the change. In fact, he now remained with her so little that he had few opportunities of observing how much she suffered.
               The birth of her child she hailed as a promise of better days; at first Ashley seemed delighted with the small morsel of humanity that claimed him for its father; but he soon expressed the bitterest disappointment that the infant had not been a boy. If he could have gone to his father and informed him that he had a son to sustain the prestige of his ancient name, he would have listened perhaps with complacency to the story of his clandestine marriage.
               Eva had scarcely regained strength enough to sit up, when one memorable day Ashley disappeared, leaving behind him a letter in which was enclosed a considerable sum of money. The heartless effusion ran thus:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "May 25, 18—.
                           
                           "MY DEAR EVA:—If our child had been a boy, I could have found courage to reveal all to my father and brave his displeasure, for he would eventually have relented in favor of his grandson; but a daughter is nothing to him. He would refuse her a shelter and send me adrift without a penny.
                           "This being the case, and you and I by this time pretty well convinced that there is really little congeniality between us, the best thing we can do is to part. I will make you a liberal allowance from the income annually allowed me by my father, and I really think that is all you can reasonably expect from me.
                           "Should you persist in asserting your claim to the position of my wife, you will ruin me forever, and deprive yourself of all chance of support from my means—for then I shall have none, as I am entirely dependent on my father; and when he learns what I have been mad enough to do, he will cast me off without a cent.
                           "He is a violent and unreasonable man; capable of doing anything in a moment of anger, and I shrink from the thought of exposing you to his rage.
                           "I wronged you grievously, my poor Eva, when I fancied that it was in my nature to be constant to any being. I have a tender regard for you, which will lead me to care for you and our child, but the passionate love which precipitated me into so unsuitable a marriage is long since dead.
                           "You see, Eva, that I am frank with you, for I wish you to build no hopes on the possibility of our re-union. It could not conduce to the happiness of either party, so it is best that the tie we so madly cemented should be severed at once.
                           "If you choose to pursue me, and blight my life, you can do so; but I swear to you that you will only gain the name of my wife, for from that hour you shall be as an utter stranger to me, and both you and your child may perish of want before I will raise my hand to aid you.
                           "Yield gracefully to what you cannot avert, and you will have my respect, and a handsome support from me for yourself and the child, with a provision for her when I succeed to my inheritance.
                           
                              C. L. ASHLEY."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               The perusal of this letter excited the hapless wife to such a degree that she ruptured an important blood vessel in her lungs, and for days she hovered between life and death.
               As soon as she was able to write, she summoned Hunter to her side to give into his charge the infant she felt assured she must soon leave behind her in a cold and pitiless world. She seemed indifferent to her own fate, and vehemently protested that she would never claim the position of Ashley's wife. She would not ruin his worldly prospects, and make her daughter a dependent on charity; the child's father was naturally lavish, and if she obeyed his commands, as long as he could command money, it would be freely given for the support of the forlorn little creature.
               Hunter plainly saw that Eva was doomed—a few more months, or even weeks, and her brief career would be ended; then why torture her by insisting on the vindication of her rights? After many long and painful conversations between them, it was finally settled that he should proceed to Maryland, seek Ashley, extort from him an acknowledgment of the little girl's legitimacy in presence of his father, and obtain such a provision for her as would suffice to rear, and educate her respectably.
               Eva extorted from her cousin a promise that the life of her worthless husband should be safe; that no provocation should induce Hunter to offer violence to him; and he set out on his wretched mission with a heart overflowing with bitterness and indignation toward the man who had won his betrothed from him, but to break her heart and crush her life in the brief space of a single year.
               The unexpected announcement of Ashley's impending marriage to another, while the victim of his heartlessness lay forsaken, dying, swept away from the breast of Hunter every feeling but an intense and bitter longing to stand face to face with the recreant husband, and in the presence of his assembled friends denounce him as a base and heartless deceiver.
               As he urged his wretched steed along through the gloomy woodland, the clatter of approaching hoofs was heard; a brilliant glare from a pair of carriage lamps flashed through the darkness, and an open barouche, occupied by two gentlemen, dashed past him at full speed.
               In that brief moment, Hunter recognized in the one on the side next to himself the person of the expectant bridegroom, and a wild cry arose on the air, bidding him stop then and there and hear what he had to say; but it was lost in the rattle of the carriage wheels, and although a head was thrust out, and an eager backward glance cast by one of the gentlemen, no check was given to the speed of the horses.
               "I must get on faster than this!" muttered Hunter, and he used a switch which he tore from a neighboring tree with such effect that his grim Rosinante quickened his pace to a rough run, which in half an hour brought him in sight of the place he sought. The large mansion was blazing with light, and the spacious lawn was filled with empty carriages, tethered horses; strains of gay music from a band stationed on the front piazza, swept out on the night air, and the noise of conversation and laughter within the house was heard even above them.
               The uninvited guest noted everything, and he felt a grim satisfaction in the thought that all this festal mirth would be converted into dismay and wretchedness, by the few words he was now ruthlessly determined to speak, without regard to consequences.
               He thought of Eva dying in her loneliness and despair, and he was pitiless. He strode forward with but one thought—one purpose in his heart—that of retribution to the false man who had deserted her for another.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               THE FATAL SUBTERFUGE.
               WE must go back in our story a few weeks. Ashurst, the residence of the Ashley family, was four miles from Arden Place. The house, an old-fashioned brick building, had been erected more than a hundred years ago. It was spacious, and venerable in its appearance; externally it presented many pointed gables, and internally the arrangement of the rooms would have puzzled a stranger as effectually as the labyrinth of Crete itself. Such queer little out-of-the-way places as were contrived in the intricate arrangement of the apartments would have confounded a modern architect, with his ideas of simplicity and convenience.
               The house, however, had been built in accordance with the whim of its founder; and its pointed gables, overrun with ivy, loomed grandly from the background of woodland which towered in all the majesty of the primeval forest.
               In front, the ground swept away in gentle undulations, shaded by groups of trees mingled with shrubbery. Ashurst was a gloomy-looking place, and the interior made even a deeper impression of dreariness on the casual visitor; for the low-ceiled rooms were panelled with carved walnut, darkened by age almost to the tint of ebony.
               In one of the largest of these sat Judge Ashley and his son, with wine, fruits, and cigars, on a highly polished table between them, though there was little appearance of conviviality in the manner or expression of either.
               The Judge, stern, dictatorial and immovable, sat opposite his son, regarding him intently; and Ashley looked as if he would gladly have escaped that powerful and scrutinizing gaze. Judge Ashley was an embarrassing sort of man to scan one; his piercing eyes never blenched, his thin, sarcastic lips were firmly closed, and the high, narrow forehead indicated obstinacy and pertinacity in an unusual degree.
               His figure was thin and angular, and he wore a closely-fitting coat, buttoned up to the throat, which was cased in a heavy black silk stock. He had practised law with eminent nent success before he presided on the bench, and his great talent for cross-examinations had rendered him the terror of evil-doers in the palmy days of his legal fame.
               He was now verging towards his seventieth year, and had given up the struggle of life for the quiet shades of Ashurst; though he still continued to act as a local magistrate for the populous neighborhood in which his place was situated. Judge Ashley had married late in life, and at her decease his wife left him two children; a daughter, seven years older than Leon, had long been banished from the paternal roof, as a punishment for making a misalliance, and her name was not permitted to be spoken in her father's hearing.
               Knowing this, it was marvellous that his son should have ventured to commit the same fault; but from the first, Ashley had never intended to acknowledge his portionless Eva as his wife. He believed that in her devotion to himself he could find the means to evade the necessity when he wearied of her, and how cruelly and heartlessly he had dictated to her the terms of their separation has already been seen.
               At length Judge Ashley broke the grim silence in which he had so long sat.
               "Why should you hesitate about fulfilling your engagement at once, Leon? It is now two years since you asked Grace Arden to marry you when you left college, and she consented. She has worn the betrothal ring long enough, and as a man of honor you are bound to replace it with the bridal circlet at as early a day as possible. I insist on knowing why you ask for further delay in claiming the bride of whom I am afraid you are really not worthy."
               "Perhaps I feel that, sir, and that is the reason why I shrink from this marriage, which you know was settled for me. I like Grace well enough as a friend, but I should never have asked her to be my wife if you had not insisted upon it."
               "Yes," replied the Judge, imperiously, "I did insist upon it, and I shall still insist that your pledge shall be redeemed. Grace Arden is a thoroughly good woman; her family is all I could wish, and her fortune large. Understand me, Leon; I will submit to no disappointment in this. Your sister defied me, and you know the result; follow her example, and I will cut you off with a shilling. I will save my fortune to found an orphan asylum, and the home of my fathers shall become a paupers' refuge."
               Having uttered this threat, the old gentleman threw himself back on his chair, and coolly puffed at his cigar, while he watched the effect of his words upon his son.
               Ashley grew pale, and clutched nervously at his wineglass as he swallowed another bumper of the ruby liquid; but he presently said:
               "If I could only prevail on you to wait a few months, sir, I—I believe that things would be smooth before me. I intend to marry Grace; but if our union is precipitated, she may be annoyed and made unhappy by—by a person who has some claims on me."
               His father sternly regarded him, and his eyes flashed ominously as he asked:
               "Claims of what nature do you refer to, sir? Are they put forward by a man or a woman, though of course it must be the latter."
               Ashley feebly answered:
               "Yes, sir, a woman with whom I was foolish enough to become entangled; but she knows by this time that she can never occupy the station of—of—my wife."
               The Judge started as if a viper had stung him.
               "Your what, sir! How dare you use the word wife save in connection with Grace Arden? Have you deluded any poor creature into believing that you were free to give her your hand? Speak, for I will know the truth."
               Though inwardly quaking, Leon recklessly replied:
               "Of course, sir, there was some such deception used, for the girl was respectably connected; and—and—in fact, there was a sham ceremony of marriage that meant nothing."
               "Wretch!" thundered his father; "how dare you speak of such villany in so light a manner. How do you presume to make me the confidant of your utter baseness."
               "You drove me to the wall," was the sulky response, "and I had no resource but to tell you the truth. I have been trying to show you the reasons why the marriage you are determined shall take place, should be postponed a little while."
               "How long? and what disposition do you propose to make of the unfortunate creature who has been so bitterly deceived by you?"
               "I propose to do nothing with her, sir. It will not be necessary, for her physician writes to me that she is dying. She has hectic fever from which she cannot possibly recover. You see that a little delay will set things right, and Grace will stand no chance to hear of her."
               Judge Ashley regarded his reprobate son in deep displeasure; he bitterly said—
               "Leon, when nature formed you she forgot to put a heart in your body. I am at a loss to understand why you have chosen to make me the repository of your wickedness."
               "I should not have spoken unless forced to do so, you may be sure; but you must have learned what has occurred at some time, for I must have the means of providing for Eva, and her child, and if I obey your commands, the least you can do is to give me the power to do so. I have promised her a support, and that at least, she shall have."
               
               There was a pause, which was broken by Judge Ashley, who slowly said—
               "So-o—it seems that I have a grandchild born to degradation, and low associations. Illegitimate as the creature is, it wounds my pride to think of what its fate may be in time to come. Is it a boy or a girl?"
               "A girl."
               "Ah well, so much the better. She will take her mother's name, and her origin need never be known, so I shall waste no thought on her. Now listen to me, Leon Ashley, and as you value my forgiveness for this escapade, consent to what I am about to propose. I have thought of a way to save Grace from annoyance, and at the same time have the marriage come off within the present month. She wishes to make a lengthened tour in Europe, and you can leave Arden Place for Baltimore on the morning after the wedding, embark there for Liverpool, and remain safe out of the way of the person you referred to, till her fate is settled. I will deal with the young woman liberally, and I promise you that she shall have no cause of complaint on the score of money."
               Though extremely reluctant to give the law a hold on him by wedding Miss Arden before he was freed from poor Eva by death, Ashley literally had no choice left him by his pertinacious father. He saw that he must either avow the truth—ruinous as he believed it would be to his future prospects, or he must submit to the despotic will that ruled him.
               That which was most consonant to his own interests Leon Ashley always did, and after a feeble struggle, the consent to give his hand to Miss Arden within the month was wrung from him.
               Judge Ashley lost no time in visiting his intended daughter-in-law, in company with his son, and Leon throwing ing away the last vestige of reluctance to obey the commands laid on him, so successfully pushed his suit, that before the visit was ended, the twenty-first of June was appointed for the bridal day.
               In his elation at the announcement, Judge Ashley gave his son full power to make a liberal settlement on the hapless girl he had so heartlessly wronged, believing that would atone for the broken heart, and early grave of the young victim. Once embarked on the tide of deception, Leon gave no thought to consequences; he flattered himself that he could evade all possibility of interference with himself or his bride, by leaving his native land for an indefinite period. When he heard of Eva's death, which, from her physician's account, he believed would not be long postponed, he would confess all to Grace, and cement the tie between them by a second ceremony of marriage. Any humiliation before her, was better than to face his unrelenting father with the truth.
               True to his nature, he deferred the evil day as long as possible, imagining that it would be easier to bear the reproaches of a wronged, and insulted woman, than the bitter wrath of his stern father. So the preparations for the marriage went on, and Ashley smoothed his brow and called false smiles to his lips while he knew that one who had loved and trusted him lay dying far away.
               His passion for Eva had been more violent, but not less evanescent than others which had preceded it, and he now marvelled how he could have been drawn into so improvident a thing as an actual marriage. He did not feel the slightest emotion of love for Miss Arden, but he had known her from childhood—was used to her—knew all her gentle sweetness of character, and he confided in her passionate attachment to himself to induce her to pardon any wrong toward herself of which he might be guilty. He was certain tain that Grace Arden would make him a tender and submissive wife, and he would tolerate her in consideration of the large fortune she would bring him.
               She and her brother, a youth of eighteen, were the joint heirs to a magnificent estate lying side by side with Ashurst, and Leon Ashley consented to accept her as his bride more to escape from dependence on his father than from any preference for herself.
               But with Miss Arden it was far different. She could not remember when she had not loved the handsome boy who had been the companion of her childish days; she was neither brilliant nor beautiful, and with a most humble estimate of her own claims or attractions, she felt doubly grateful to Ashley for his supposed preference for herself. The richly-endowed heiress had not lacked suitors, but she treated them all with such cool indifference that one by one they withdrew, leaving the field to the least sincere or deserving of the pretenders to her hand.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               THE STRICKEN BRIDE.
               THE bridal evening came, the numerous friends of both families were bidden to the feast, and a gay and brilliant party assembled in the stately drawing-rooms at Arden Place. Miss Arden was in her apartment, surrounded by a bevy of laughing and chattering bridesmaids, more than one of whom envied her the captivating and elegant man to whom she was about to be united.
               She was small, slight, fair, and almost as colorless as marble. Her hair, of the palest flaxen hue, was folded back from her brow in a fashion peculiar to herself, and knotted at the back of her head. The light-colored lashes and eyebrows gave little expression to the pale blue eyes beneath them; but the mouth was flexible and expressive, and when the mobile lips broke into a smile, the charm of native sweetness and refinement was felt by those capable of appreciating them.
               To others, Grace Arden was only a plain, common-place looking girl, occupying a brilliant niche in social life for which nature had utterly unfitted her.
               On this important occasion, she had resolved that her dress, at least, should please the fastidious taste of her bridegroom, and afforded the guests something to comment on save her own insignificant self.
               She wore a white brocade trimmed with costly lace, and the tiara which bound her veil around her head was of magnificent pearls, while the veil itself was of the finest Brussels point.
               Few who looked on that small white figure, with its quiet bearing, would have dreamed of the passionate excess of feeling which lay cradled in that seemingly apatheticheart. Grace Arden had but two beings on earth to love—her young brother and the man on whom she was about to bestow her hand; and she clung to them as only such deep undemonstrative natures can cling to those who are admitted into that holy of holies, a pure, unselfish woman's heart.
               A few moments before the arrival of the bridegroom, Miss Arden left the gay group and retired for a brief space to a small apartment joining her own which she had caused to be fitted up as an oratory. She was a devout Catholic, and before the shrine, which sustained a marble image of the Virgin, she now knelt, and offered a fervent prayer for a blessing on the union she was about to form.
               She arose calm and elate, for the voice of her betrothed speaking in the outer room caused her heart to bound with rapturous joy, and her lips unclosed to murmur:
               "Mine—mine at last!" with an expression of serene joy that was almost divine.
               She believed in him; she trusted him as implicitly as poor Eva had once done. Alas for the return her confidence was to meet!
               When she appeared, Ashley seized her hand, and conveyed it to his lips, as he whispered:
               "Come, my love; the holy father waits our appearance; the company is impatient; let us descend at once and join our friends."
               He seemed excited, and the flush on his face betrayed that he had been drinking wine to fortify his courage for the ordeal before him. The wild voice which had hailed him through the darkness was still ringing in his ears. He had not recognized it, but he intuitively felt that it boded him no good. Even at that last hour, Ashley would gladly have receded from the crime he was about to commit; but he felt such a course to be now impossible. He had bound himself in the toils, and with desperate hardihood he resolved to brave the worst.
               Even if a messenger from his deserted wife was on his track, he would scarcely proclaim his perfidy openly at such a time as this, and means might hereafter be found to silence him altogether.
               Thus deluding himself, Ashley obstinately moved forward on the path of fate.
               The bridal party descended the broad staircase, and arranged themselves in the front drawing-room, in which a temporary altar had been erected. The bride and groom knelt upon the satin cushions placed in front of it for their accommodation, and the priest, a venerable man from Baltimore, commenced the ceremony.
               The impressive service went on, though Ashley dreaded that at any moment a voice might be raised to proclaim his delinquency and forbid the completion of the rites; but they were uninterrupted, and the wedded pair arose to receive the congratulations of their friends.
               An exultant smile swept over the lips of the groom as he looked over the crowd, to be greeted only by friendly faces; and he replied to the wishes of prosperity and happiness addressed to him in his blandest and most cordial manner. No one who looked on him then would have dreamed that he had anything to fear from the act he had just committed.
               Grace, bewildered, half frightened, but blissfully happy, submitted to be kissed and caressed by her "dear five hundred friends," and her stately father-in-law had just taken her slight form in his arms, when a voice pierced through every sound, and hushed the gay Babel of words as if by magic. It said:
               "Am I too late? Is this iniquitous deception completed? Leon Ashley, stand forth and answer if any manhood is left in you."
               The guests fell back from the speaker, leaving him standing alone, his face pallid from excitement, his eyes blazing with scornful meaning as he pointed his raised hand toward the cowering bridegroom, whose parched lips refused to unclose, whose tongue seemed paralyzed when he attempted to reply.
               Ashley could only grasp his father's arm with a mute imploring expression, and the Judge turned upon the intruder like a lion at bay, all his haughty pride flashing from his deep-set eyes.
               "What means this intrusion at such a time as this, and who are you?"
               "I am the messenger of fate to base and unprincipled man. If Leon Ashley is really married to that lady in the bridal dress, I accuse him of bigamy, for he has a wife now living, to whom I can prove he was lawfully united."
               Grace stood motionless, as if frozen into immobility, and her eyes turned in dumb anguish upon the livid face of him to whom she had lately believed herself irrevocably bound. Something in that face assured her that he was guilty, and she shuddered, though she had no power to resist the attraction that drew her to him and impelled her to lay her hand upon his arm.
               Ashley shrank from her touch; their eyes met, and then, for the first time, the unhappy girl comprehended that she was nothing to him; that in that hour he recoiled from her as from one with whom she had nothing in common. Her hand dropped to her side, and she would have fallen had not an arm been outstretched to receive her sinking form.
               Judge Ashley's voice arose loud and defiant in reply to the assertion of the audacious stranger.
               "If such should prove the fact, is this a time to proclaim it, I ask you, sir? How dare you hurl such a blow as this at a defenceless woman, even if you had no consideration for her bridegroom? I will soon convince you that no other marriage can stand against the one which has just been celebrated, if you will come with me and confer in private on this affair."
               "No," replied Hunter, with as much hauteur as the other evinced; "I will make no compromise in secret. The time for that has passed away, if such a thing could ever have been effected. I have made my assertion in the presence of this company, and I intend to prove it to their satisfaction at least. Here is a letter sent me by your son, in which he acknowledges Eva Weston, of the State of Connecticut, as his wife, and I have myself seen the record of their marriage, which took place on the eighteenth of July last. The union was clandestine, but the clergyman who united them can be brought forward as a witness to prove my assertions, if it is found necessary to do so."
               Many curious eyes glanced over portions of the letter which Hunter held aloft, and those present who knew the handwriting of Leon Ashley recognized it at once. Judge Ashley stalked forward, apparently as unmoved as if made of iron; he took the letter, glanced over it with a curling lip, though a grey shadow crept over his stern face as he read.
               When he finished, he turned to face his recreant son, but Leon disappeared, and Ernest Arden, the brother of the bride, stood in the place he had lately occupied, holding his fainting sister in his arms, with an expression of rage mingled with pity stamped upon his youthful features.
               Ernest adored his sister; he had never believed that Leon Ashley was good enough for her, but he saw that her heart was set on him, and he acquiesced in her choice in the belief that she would never bestow her hand on any other. His spirit was high, his temper uncontrolled, and the burning insult which had been offered his beloved Grace he thought blood alone could expiate.
               With this deadly feeling of animosity in his heart, he bore the insensible girl to her own room and laid her on her bed. Many friends would have crowded in after him, but he peremptorily commanded the old colored woman he found there to bolt the door and refuse admittance to every one.
               Then, with stern gravity, he divested his sister of her bridal coronet and veil, took from her finger the ring with which those false vows had been cemented, and threw it far away with an expression of bitter loathing on his young face.
               
               Leaving to the nurse the charge of restoring animation to the stricken girl, he looked on passively while she chafed her cold hands, and applied stimulants to bring her back to life. At length the woman brusquely said:
               "What for you stan' thar, as ef you had lost yer senses, Marse Ernes? Why don' you help me to bring my poor young Mistis roun'?"
               The young man gloomily replied:
               "Because I could find in my heart to wish that she may never recover to the wretchedness that must henceforth be her portion. My sister will be better off if she dies now, Aunt Hagar."
               "Dat aint for you to judge," replied the woman, almost savagely. "What for you dar to talk dat way 'bout de sweetes' young Mistis as ever was? What can we do widout her, I'd like to know, an' what have happened down stars to bring her to dis? Whar's de bonny bridegroom what should be here by her side?"
               "He is gone—but it matters not whither he flees—if it is even to the uttermost parts of the earth, I will pursue him till I find him, and bring him to account for his villany."
               These words were uttered with an expression of such intense rage and defiance as chilled the listener, and she shrank away from the steely glare of his light blue eyes. Another ear caught their hostile meaning, and a faint moan escaped the lips of Grace. Consciousness was returning, and after a pause she faintly said:
               "Oh, Ernest, my brother, come to me! Lay your ear close to my lips, for you must hear and heed what I am going to say."
               Arden sprang to her side, exclaiming:
               "Grace, my precious sister, can you bear this? Will not the knowledge of his perfidy blight your life?"
               "It is true, then, and he has gone from me forever!" she wailed. "Oh, Ernest, I loved him so utterly—trusted him so implicitly—and this is my reward! What shall I do? what will become of me when I can see him no more!"
               "You must forget him, Grace," whispered her brother. "Tear him from your heart, for he is unworthy of a regret."
               Convulsive sobs burst from her breast, and she wrung her hands in helpless anguish as she moaned:
               "It may be so, Erny, but I cannot console myself with that thought. I shall always love him—love him—love him as the one desire of my heart. Oh, my brother, it is a fearful thing to give up one's life to another as I have given mine to Leon. Seek him—help him to conceal himself—for he is in danger. Save him, if you would not see me die at your feet. I know this is weakness, but I cannot help it. Go for him; bring him face to face with me once more, that I may assure him of my forgiveness. Oh! he has been basely ensnared in some way; I know—I know he did not mean to wrong me. He did not know—"
               Suddenly the memory of the look which had passed between herself and Ashley flashed on her memory, and she shivered, closed her eyes and seemed about again to relapse into insensibility. All her weakness, all her misery pressed upon her heart, and she shrank and quivered as a child in pain.
               Ernest bitterly replied:
               "Ashley knows how to take very good care of himself, and this is the last place to which he shall come with my consent. Compose yourself as well as possible, Grace, and try and bear up against your sufferings. I must go down and see those people below; it is a wretched ending to a merry-making, but we will prove to the world that we can bear even such a blow as this with true dignity. Have you not strength to do this, sister?—pride enough to cover the wound even if it pierces to a vital part?"
               
               "I do not know—I cannot tell," she moaned. "My heart is broken, my pride crushed, and never—never will I show my face in the world again. Don't let any of those gay young girls come to me. Shut out every one save yourself and Aunt Hagar; but promise me one thing, Ernest."
               "If I can I will do so," he said, with some reserve.
               "Oh! you must promise it, or I shall die outright. Do not seek to harm poor Leon. Remember he is my husband; that he was wedded to me by all the sacred ceremonies of the church, and even if another does stand between us, he is as much mine as hers. Yes, yes—I claim his plighted vows, and YOU must hold him sacred for my sake. Promise me that my Leon shall be safe from your anger."
               In her excitement she raised herself, and tried to grasp his hand; but he turned his face away, and coldly said:
               "I will promise to do what is right, Grace; and when you are in a calmer frame of mind, you will see that only one course is possible to me."
               "Oh, God! what course is that? Ernest Arden, you will not dare to seek the blood of the man I love beyond my own existence, even if he has stabbed me to the heart! I can bear my grief—can live under his desertion, but the certainty that his precious life has been taken by you will destroy me. Oh! my brother, pity me, and spare me this last crowning anguish."
               The fiery young man was for the time partially subdued by the evidences of her suffering, and he bitterly said:
               "I will try to act as you would have me, Grace, but I am the descendant of men who never shrunk from defending the honor of their family. Ours has been touched in its most sensitive point, and yet you bid me stay my hand when every impulse of my nature bids me raise it against the man who has so bitterly wronged you."
               She passionately replied:
               "I can endure the wrong; in time I can even forgive it, Ernest. I entreat you, seek not to avenge my wretched cause; leave my poor unfortunate Leon to Him who has emphatically said, 'Vengeance is mine!' You promise me this, brother?"
               Before Arden could reply a sharp knock came upon the door, and a message was delivered to him informing him that Judge Ashley desired his presence in the library, whither he had gone with the stranger who had brought such fearful tidings to the house.
               After a few hurried words to his sister, Ernest escaped from the room, and hastened to the interview.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               A DECISIVE INTERVIEW.
               AVOIDING the main hall, Arden sought a private staircase, and made his way to the library. This was an octagon tower, separated from the main building by an enclosure filled with shrubbery. On this occasion it had been left dark and deserted, and thither Judge Ashley had induced Hunter to follow him, that he might learn such particulars of his son's previous marriage as were necessary to be understood by him.
               In his progress through the house he had snatched up a lamp, and it now glimmered feebly through the large room, casting deep shadows on the stern face of the outraged father, as he paced to and fro, impatiently awaiting the appearance of Ernest Arden.
               Hunter sat near a table, watching his companion, and marvelling if the sad work of this night would result in the acknowledgment of his cousin as Leon Ashley's wife. To her it imported little now, but to her child's future it was of vital importance that the legality of her parents' union should be admitted, and a competent provision made for her support.
               All hopes from Ashley himself were ended by the exposé of this night, but the pride of the grandfather would surely induce him to save the helpless infant from dependence on strangers. The door opened, and Ernest Arden with eyes kindling with excitement, features pallid from repressed emotion, came quietly into the room, and closed the door behind him. He abruptly said:
               "I am here at your bidding, Judge Ashley; but what can be done without the presence of your son? what has become of him."
               "I know not, neither do I care," was the stern response. "From this night he is no son of mine, I disown him; I cast him off utterly as a disgrace to my name. From the lips of this gentleman I have learned the history of the past year, and the revelation has proved to me that Leon is as destitute of feeling, as he is of principle; your sister may thank Heaven that the tie which binds her to him is as slender as a rotten rush, for he would have rendered her miserable."
               "Do not speak of Grace," replied Ernest with emotion. "When I think of her in connection with such an insult as this, my blood seethes in my veins as molten quicksilver; and if your son crosses my path just now I cannot answer for what may happen."
               "He will take good care not to do that, the heartless, cowardly dog!" exclaimed the old man in bitter anger. "He has fled from my wrath and yours, and it is as well perhaps that he has made good his escape. I sent for you, Ernest, that you may hear this gentleman's statement from his own lips, as he demands that you shall be made fully acquainted with the turpitude of my precious son. He has letters with him written by Leon both to himself, and the unhappy girl he has deserted. If any other proof were wanting, they will show how utterly heartless the writer is."
               Arden turned his set face toward the stranger and with effort said:
               "I am willing to accept the assurance of Judge Ashley that your proofs bear out the assertions you have made; but I feel that something was due to the helpless bride of to-night, and it was cruel in you to proclaim the downfall of my sister's happiness in so reckless a manner."
               Hunter sadly replied:
               "I felt that myself the instant after I had spoken, Mr. Arden; but I was laboring under intense excitement, and burning anger against the man I had once claimed as my friend. Leon Ashley stole from me my betrothed bride, only to break her heart; can you wonder that 'I hate him for the vow he spoke; I hate him for the vow he broke.' I left her dying, and I found him wedded with another."
               The voice of the speaker quivered with emotion, and the impulsive youth put forth his hand and strongly grasped that of Hunter; he felt that they had common cause against the author of all this wrong, and their mutual hatred of Leon Ashley, formed a strong, though brief tie between them. He said:
               "I understand, and sympathize with you, sir. What course do you propose to take to right this unfortunate lady? The wrong is even greater than that of my sister."
               "Alas! nothing is now left for me to do but to establish the right of her child to bear an honorable name, for my poor Eva is dying. Had her husband deferred his marriage a single month, he would have been free to give his hand to her rival."
               
               Judge Ashley uttered a sigh, and said:
               "He wished to do so; entreated that I would not hurry on matters, but he did not confide all to me. He dared not tell me that he had really given his hand to one I would never have consented to receive as his wife. I hurried on the marriage that I might remove him from a dangerous entanglement which he admitted to me. I never dreamed that he had actually married another, and he (weak fool,) rushed into this danger to avoid a collision with me. Young men, let us speak no more of this wretched affair; it can do no good. I will cause inquiry to be made, a copy of the marriage register to be sent to me by the officiating minister himself, and then, when satisfied that my son was the lawful husband of this young woman, I will see what can be done for the child. I will not let it be dependent on the charity of others."
               His voice was hard, and there was no relenting on his stern features. Hunter arose and curtly said:
               "That is all I have the right to demand of you, sir. But should you change your mind, and eventually become granite toward this helpless infant, she shall not want a friend so long as I live. My life is a wandering and precarious one, but I shall find the means to keep my cousin's child from want, even if she should be utterly cast off by those to whom she rightfully belongs."
               The old man haughtily confronted him.
               "When convinced that the infant is really the daughter of my son, born in the bonds of wedlock, I will permit no stranger to bear the burden of her support; but, until the marriage is proved to my entire satisfaction, I decline to have anything further to do with her or her mother's connections."
               He turned abruptly away and left the room. The two young men silently regarded each other for a brief space, and then Arden impulsively asked.
               "Is it not your purpose to avenge the baseness of which Ashley has been guilty in some other way than the one you have already taken? Of course you will seek him out and chastise him; it is your first right; but if he survives the encounter with you, my turn will come."
               Hunter gloomily replied:
               "I would gladly do so, but my hands are tied by a promise extorted from me before I left my cousin. I came hither at her request, to say to her husband that she would die without betraying their union to his father, if he would provide for her daughter after her death; but I intended that the child's legitimacy should be acknowledged in the presence of Judge Ashley. The news of Leon's marriage to another while Eva yet lives, exasperated me to such a degree that I forgot all my pledges to his unhappy wife, and in the madness of the moment proclaimed his perfidy."
               An expression of satisfaction swept over the pallid face of Arden, and he quietly replied:
               "It rests with me then to avenge the wrongs of both these injured women. I am glad that any cause induces you to waive your right to a first encounter with him who is now my deadly foe. My sister, woman-like, would also have trammelled me by a promise to spare him, but I evaded it and made my escape before she had succeeded in wringing any such pledge from me. I am free to act, and for this night's work Leon Ashley shall die, or I will bite the dust before him. I swear to pursue him through the world, if that is necessary to bring him to account; once overtaken, I will challenge him to a combat à l'outrance, and then may God defend the right."
               As these words were uttered in a tone of loud defiance, the blind of a window which had been left unfastened was cautiously moved, and a pair of gleaming eyes were flashed upon the excited speaker. Leon Ashley, who had been concealed in the shrubbery listening to what was passing in the library, saw how deeply in earnest his foe was, and his white lips compressed rigidly as he muttered:
               "You will not have to go far to find me, youngster. I will deal with you at once, and free myself from such a bloodhound as you would prove to be upon my track. If I can put you out of the way, and that wretched wife of mine once safe in her grave, I should not despair of persuading Grace to renew her vows to me, and yet endow me with all the wealth which would then be hers."
               Bitter, reckless, despairing, Leon Ashley turned away and plunged into the woodland that lay on one side of the house, there to conceal himself till the guests had departed and it would be safe to seek an interview with the unhappy Grace.
               It was his fixed purpose to see her and give her his own version of what had happened to him in the last year; he doubted not that he should be able to convince her that he had been more "sinned against than sinning," and he did not despair of yet winning her to believe that through all he had loved her truly and tenderly.
               He knew how weak she was—how desperately attached to himself, and he doubted not that his power over her could accomplish anything he undertook with reference to herself.
               After a little more conversation, the two gentlemen in the library parted, and Hunter mounted his horse and returned to the Jolly Angler. He had given his address and that of poor Eva to Judge Ashley, and nothing now remained for him to do but return as speedily as possible to her, bearing with him the consoling assurance that her infant would be cared for when she was left to battle with a hard and bitter world without the tender shelter of a mother's love. He must conceal from her the depth of Ashley's duplicity, for the knowledge of what had that night occurred he knew would prove her death-blow.
               To the infinite disappointment of Samson and his wife, he would not reveal what had occurred at Arden Place during his absence; he left at dawn on the following morning, impelled by secret uneasiness on Eva's account to hurry to the desolate being who now had no friend on earth save himself.
               Arden returned to the house, assuming as calm an air as was possible under the circumstances, and ordered the servants to throw open the supper-room that the numerous guests might refresh themselves before their departure for their own homes.
               He nervously shrank from any expression of sympathy, and after a few words of excuse he retired to his own apartment. There he was speedily joined by a young friend with whom he had been on most intimate terms.
               George Lester grasped his hand warmly and said:
               "I came to you as your friend, old fellow. It is impossible to let this thing pass, you know, without showing that villain that in spite of your youth you have a man's spirit in you. I have been out twice already, and I am quite ready to settle the preliminaries. What have you resolved on?"
               "To take his life, of course," was the prompt reply. "I am not much of a shot, it is true, but in a case like this God will defend the right. If Ashley is to be found, I commission you to bear to him a mortal defiance. If he has fled, I will follow him and compel him to afford me the satisfaction I demand."
               "By Jupiter, youngster, but you are true pluck! You're a man after my own heart, Arden, and I honor your courage. Shall I write the challenge at once?"
               "It will be as well, perhaps; but I have an idea that you will not easily find the man to whom it is to be delivered."
               "Have no fear on that score; only empower me to act for you, and I shall be sure to find him before very long."
               "I give you carte blanche, and all I desire is to have the meeting over as soon as possible. I have no wish to see my sister again until I have avenged the bitter indignity to which she has been subjected. God! to have her pointed at, and gossipped about, as the heroine of this disgraceful story, is enough to madden me. I shall have no rest till I have wiped out the insult with the blood of that wretched man. I always mistrusted him, but Grace was infatuated with him, and would listen to nothing I could say to dissuade her from accepting him. I yielded to her entreaties to receive him as my brother, and this is my reward. Find him, Lester, for the sooner this affair is settled the better for all concerned."
               His excited looks, panting utterance, and bitter earnestness assured Lester that no compromise or apology would be listened to; and by nature a belligerent spirit himself, nothing could have suited him better than the part assigned him in this sad affair. He sat down to Arden's desk at once, and wrote a challenge which was entirely approved by his principal.
               He smiled grimly, and said:
               "I have a magnificent pair of pistols which I will take with me to the ground. I shall find my man at Ashurst, be sure of that. Where should he go in such a strait as this but to his own home."
               "I hope it may prove so, but the dread of a meeting with his father may keep him away. We have settled all that is possible for the present, and now pray leave me, for I am weary and wretched."
               "Don't give up, old fellow; be sure and try to sleep to-night, or your nerves may not be as steady for the work in hand as I could wish. You must kill him at the first fire, or he will be sure to do for you. Good night; I will see you in the morning, at as early an hour as possible."
               When he was left alone the agitated youth paced the floor of his room till a feeling of exhaustion began to creep over him. He softly crept up stairs, and entered the apartment of his sister.
               Hagar was watching, beside her, and as soon as he glanced at the still face he said:
               "You have given her a composing draught. I am glad to see that anything will make her sleep."
               The old woman said in explanation:
               "I coaxed her to let me take her finery off, an' put on her bed gown. I was lucky enough to 'member de draps de doctor lef' for her when she had dat las' spell; an' when I brung 'em to her she tuck 'em herself, and swallered a powerful dose. I don' 'no as she'll ever git over it, poor thing; but ef her heart's broke, it's jest as well see shouldn't, I s'pose."
               "Don't speak of my sister dying for that man, Aunt Hagar! If I thought she could long regret so base a wretch, I should despise her!" was the fierce response from the writhing heart of the proud boy.
               "Oh! Marse Erny, don' talk dat way. Who would ha' thought Mr. Ashley so wicked? an' he so han'some too. 'Han'some is as han'some does,' an' as you say my chile ought to be above breakin' her poor heart over sich a rapscallion as dey say he is—Thar now! ef dat boy aint done gone like a streak o' lightnin'!"
               Ernest was indeed gone. A brief examination of his sister's condition had assured him that she was in no immediate danger; and blessing the drug which brought to her the balm of unconsciousness in this hour of bitter anguish, he hurried down stairs, and out into the night, feeling ing as if the weight of centuries had fallen on him within the last few hours.
               He felt that repose was impossible, and he plunged into the woodland hoping that rapid motion would allay the fierce tumult of feeling that fired his blood, and at moments deprived him of all self-control.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               THE DUEL BY MOONLIGHT.
               THE early portion of the night had been overcast, and clouds still drifted over the heavens, but many stars gleamed out, and the full round moon came up from behind the trees, and its silver light fitfully penetrated the leafy arcades through which Ernest Arden wound his way with bitterness in his heart, and a deadly thirst for vengeance on the destroyer of his sister's peace seething there, to the exclusion of every softer or more merciful feeling.
               In the lower portion of the grounds, about half a mile from the house, was a wide, semi-circular walk, which sheltered an artificial pond; this had always been a favorite haunt of his, and now he sought it that he might walk unmolested beneath the shadow of the umbrageous trees, and meditate almost to madness on the event of the night.
               Morbid and sensitive to an unusual degree, with a high strung temperament which could bear little contradiction, the conduct of Ashley toward his sister had aroused him almost to madness.
               A brick wall enclosed the pond, around the edge of which lay a wide green terrace, perforated in one place to admit a flight of steps which led down to the water. After taking a few turns in the walk, Arden descended these steps, and after laving his feverish hands in the clear water, he bathed his brow with the hope that it would allay the darting pain that racked his brain.
               But there was no healing in them for the fiery torment that surged in his heart; and as the broken life of his sister hovered before him, he lifted his voice in execrations against the man who had so heartlessly won, but to destroy her.
               The clouds drifted slowly away from the face of the moon, and its full light was suddenly thrown on a figure that emerged from the walk Arden had just left, and Leon Ashley advanced till he stood within a few feet of the steps. His voice rang out on the night air, clear and defiant:
               "Why do you exhaust your fury in useless curses, Ernest Arden, when the object of your wrath is here in person to answer for all he may have done to anger you. Come up here, and meet me as one foe may meet another."
               At the first sound of his taunting voice the youth sprang toward him with blazing eyes. A single bound brought him face to face with Ashley, looking with his white lips and set teeth the very incarnation of vengeful wrath. He hissed:
               "So—o—you're still within my reach, traitor! poltroon! wretch! How dared you make my sister—the descendant of an honorable race—the by-word and scorn of all who know her? How dared you offer such an insult to her as a sham ceremony of marriage? Speak, caitiff! before I strike you down at my feet."
               "That is easier said than done," replied Ashley, with cool audacity. "I am more than a match for you in strength, and I would not advise you to make such an attempt as that. You ask me why I acted as I did toward your sister; you shall for once have the plain, unvarnished truth from my lips. She held out to me the jewel of temptation not in herself, but in her fortune; and she plainly showed me that I had only to ask, and have. I have nothing of my own; my father is a dictatorial man, and I am tired of being dependent upon him. As to the other woman, I did not regard the tie that binds me to her as valid; and even if it were, I know she would never ruin me by putting forward her claims. The meddling fool she sent here is my enemy, or he would never have acted as he did to-night."
               While Ashley thus spoke in a cool, deliberate manner, the young listener glared on him with an expression of savage fury, which proved how difficult it was to him to restrain the impulse to hurl himself upon him, and close with him in a death-grapple. His breath came from his heaving chest in short, quick gasps, and it was several moments before he recovered sufficient composure to speak.
               "Leon Ashley, I denounce you as a deliberate and heartless scoundrel; and I shall be doing good service to the world to rid it of such a miscreant as you are. I have already sent a messenger in pursuit of you, to offer you deadly combat at as early a moment as possible after the dawn of day, and I now hurl defiance at you in my own person. I will meet you at daylight in the grove which lies between this place and Ashurst; there, in the presence of George Lester, we will settle this quarrel; and may God favor the right."
               Ashley replied, with a sneer:
               "Your opinion is a perfect matter of indifference to me, Mr. Ernest Arden; I accept your challenge, but there is no need of waiting till the dawn of day; the light of the moon will suffice for our purpose, and it is of little importance whether there is a witness to the combat or not."
               "But one of us must die in this encounter," said Arden, impressively; "and if we fight alone, the survivor may be accused of murder."
               "What matters that to you, or to me?" was the reckless response. "If I fall, the world will readily accept your version of the affair, and say that you did well to avenge your sister's wrong at the earliest possible moment. As to myself, I shall hardly remain in this country to suffer the indignity of a public trial for bigamy; and if you are killed, it will only give me another reason for expatriating myself as soon as possible."
               "I am unarmed, or I would at once accept your offer," said Arden, with a sudden accession of wrath at the utterance of the word bigamy in the coolly-defiant tone used by his adversary.
               To this Ashley replied:
               "I have my pistols with me; you are familiar with them, and know them to be good. You shall have your choice, and we can settle our chances, for life or death, without the intervention of a third person."
               He drew the weapons from his bosom, and held them toward Arden, who eagerly clutched one, and hoarsely said:
               "So be it; let us arrange the preliminaries at once."
               Ashley, with his eye, measured the width of the terrace, over which the moonlight now shone with undimmed lustre, and replied:
               "We must avail ourselves of this patch of light as we best can. Since the combat is to be a l'outrance we shall not need much space. Five feet between us will suffice?"
               Arden nodded his head in assent, and Ashley went on with as much coolness as if arranging for a cotillon.
               "We will stand upon the terrace facing each other, and one of us can count four aloud; at the last word we will fire simultaneously, and God have mercy on the one that falls."
               "I understand and agree to all. Let us lose no time, or we may chance to be interrupted."
               
               A strange smile crept to the lip of Ashley as he saw that the hand of his adversary trembled with passion as he clutched his pistol. He knew that Arden's whole nervous system was unstrung by the sufferings of the last few hours, while his own self-possession was as perfect as if no event in life, however disastrous, had power to move him.
               He marked out the distance with precision, grasped his weapon, and walked firmly toward his own station. The position of the two was fairly chosen, for they stood with their faces toward the north and south, while the great yellow disc of the moon poured its unclouded beams equally upon them.
               For an instant the two stood glaring on each other with deadly purpose in their eyes, and the fell thought of death in their hearts. A brief moment of time and one, or both, would be hurled into eternity.
               But there was no relenting in the heart of either, and the lips of Leon Ashley neither trembled nor grew pale as they unclosed to utter the fatal numbers.
               Slowly, clearly, unfalteringly, came the words of doom—one, two, three, four!"
               As the last one was spoken, there was a simultaneous report. A wild cry pierced the heavens, but it was not repeated; for the voice was smothered in the severed waters of the pond through which sunk the form of one of the combatants. The other was stunned only, for the ball of his adversary had passed so near his temple as to singe his hair, and he sunk to the ground partially insensible.
               When Ashley raised himself up and looked around, he saw a dark object struggling in the water, and in the impulse of the moment he hurried to the steps and threw off his coat.
               But it was too late. While Ashley lay stunned upon the bank, the unfortunate Ernest had twice struggled to the surface, too severely wounded to assist himself, and as his foe gained the steps he sunk to rise no more.
               "It is as well so," he muttered; "for if I had saved him it would only have been to give him the power to destroy me at some future time."
               The survivor sat down on the stone parapet, bewildered and oppressed by all that had occurred that night. He had fully intended to take the life of the being who had vowed undying hostility to himself; but now his purpose was accomplished something like remorse came to his heart.
               By the event of the last hour he felt himself doubly an outlaw, and whither he should turn for safety was now his first consideration.
               He had no money about him, but his father had pledged himself to advance him a considerable sum on the following morning to defray the expenses of his projected bridal tour. He shrank from the thought of meeting him now, or asking a favor at his hands, and he mused on the chances of getting in his possession the sum designed for him without applying to Judge Ashley.
               He knew where the gold was deposited, and he argued with himself that it was as much his own as if it had already passed into his possession. Moreover, he believed his father would gladly appropriate it himself to his use to remove him from the dangers that threatened him while he lingered in the neighborhood of his home.
               An hour was spent in deep meditation, and then Ashley arose from his hard seat, and slowly moved toward the spot on which the duel had been fought.
               No evidence remained of the deadly encounter which had there taken place, except his own pistol, which had fallen from the relaxed grasp of the wounded man upon the very edge of the terrace. He eagerly stooped and picked it up as he muttered:
               
               "So much the better! When they drag the pond in search of his body, they will find no evidence to criminate me, and I may avow the meeting or not as I may choose. I defy any one to bring home his death to me, unless I voluntarily acknowledge it."
               "Hey for Ashurst, and the old man's gold! Ha! ha! in place of going away in all the pomp of bridal array, I shall steal from my ancestral home like a thief, loaded with the gold which is now my only salvation. Curse the luck, I must say." And he ground his teeth in impotent rage as he walked rapidly towards Ashurst, taking a cross road which he knew would cut off much of the distance between the two places.
               Since the fatal meeting with her brother, he shrank from seeking an interview with Grace; with the blood of Ernest warm upon his hand, he dared not yet approach her with the falsehood which he intended should yet win her to be his.
               Yes, he would write to her; firmly deny the validity of his first marriage; and insist that she had given him lawful power over her fate by the ceremony which had been performed that night.
               Grace Arden would believe anything solemnly asserted by himself, and he rejoiced in the weakness of intellect, and the strength of feeling, which gave him such boundless influence over her.
               Now the passionate and resentful brother was effectually put out of the way, Ashley believed if he could only gain access to her after the first violence of her grief was passed, that he could mould her to his will.
               He must obtain an interview at all hazards before he left his native land; he must risk much to accomplish it, and he felt no shrinking from the thought that the hand red with the brother's blood was to ready grasp that of the sister, and force her to walk side by side with him upon the path of life. Yes—he would bear Grace away to a foreign shore, and in the enjoyment of her wealth learn to tolerate her who bestowed it on him, and by his kindness to her in the future atone for the evil he had already wrought her.
               Thus meditating, he moved through the solitary woodland at a quick pace, and a little after midnight stood beneath the shadow of the stately home to which he had so lately considered himself the heir; now, he dared not knock at the portal and demand admittance; like the burglar he meant to be, he stole around the house seeking an entrance to the private sanctum of his father, in which he knew the money he sought had been placed.
               The southern wing of the house, containing three rooms, was appropriated to the use of Judge Ashley, and the last one in the suit was used by him as a library and sitting-room. It was separated from the others by a narrow passage, the doors opening on which were usually closed at night on account of the old man's horror of a draught.
               Aware of this, Ashley believed he would have little difficulty in effecting his purpose and making good his escape; in that quiet country neighborhood it was not thought necessary to be very careful in closing blinds, and as he anticipated, he found one merely pulled in without being fastened. The windows opened to the floor, and a single spring placed him on the floor of the room. In the secretary which stood in the corner he believed the money was placed, and by the light of the moon which streamed in at the open window he approached and examined the lock.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VII.
               ENTRAPPED.
               OVERWHELMED with rage and anguish, Judge Ashley returned home immediately after the conclusion of the interview with Hunter.
               This marriage, on which he had set his heart, which he had urged on without regard to the wishes of his son, had set the seal of ruin on the reckless young man, and he swore a dreadful oath that he never would forgive him for the double deception he had practised upon himself and the devoted woman who lay in her deserted home almost in a dying condition.
               He bitterly realized that his only son, whose handsome person, acute intellect and popular manners had rendered him the pride of his heart, had been so utterly disgraced by the events of the night, that he would never again be able to hold up his head in the State in which his forefathers had so long lived in honor and respect.
               Then the thought that Leon might be arrested, thrown into prison, and condemned to a disgraceful punishment, came as wormwood to his haughty soul; but the danger that menaced his son did not soften his feelings toward him. No—it but embittered him the more deeply to reflect that Leon merited the sentence which might be passed upon him, and to his inflexible spirit there was little difference between that and bearing the legal consequences of his crime.
               When he entered his apartment he found an old gray-haired negro, who had been his personal attendant from boyhood, sitting up for him. Jupiter was extremely astonished at the appearance of his master at so early an hour, and he hurriedly asked:
               "Hi, Marse Judge, what bring you back here afore de gran' supper's over? Is you sick? for you looks mighty white, an' strange like."
               "Yes, Jupe, I am sick at heart, and of a sickness from which I shall never recover. Bring me wine, and do not talk to me now; I cannot bear it."
               He sank into a chair, and throwing his arms over a table, rested his head upon them in the attitude of a person completely crushed by grief.
               Bewildered and anxious, though not daring to ask for further information in his master's present mood, the sable attendant went on his errand; but snatched a moment to run into the kitchen, where the carriage driver was telling the horror-stricken servants of the disgraceful denouement of the night.
               Jupiter listened in breathless interest, and then asked:
               "Whar is Marse Leon? I hopes dey aint gone an' done nothin' to him."
               "They didn't git a chance, for he run off befo' anybody had thought o' layin' han's on him. I s'pose he mus' be somewhar about here, but I hope he won't stay roun' long, 'case I heerd say dat de perleese will be here airly to-morrow mornin' a-huntin' of him."
               Jupiter listened with horror to this suggestion, and he indignantly said:
               "A-huntin' of him for what, I'd like to know. Miss Grace would rather cut off her right han' than hurt a har o' his head; an' ef de other gal cares for him as she oughter, she won't do nothin' to him nyther. You's a fine sarvent o' won't do nothin' to him nyther. You's a fine sarvent o' dis family, Jack, to dar' to talk dat ere way 'bout de young marster. Git 'long wi' you, you 'ceitful nigga you."
               Jack fired up at this and retorted:
               "I aint no mo' 'ceitful den yerself, ole Jupe. I only tells de trufe, an' dat aint sayin' no wrong—git 'long yerself, ef it comes to dat."
               Clenching his fist and shaking it at the speaker, the old man unwillingly retreated, but he feared to remain longer lest his master's bell should be rung for him.
               When he returned with the wine, he found Judge Ashley pacing the floor of the apartment with that iron tread only used in moments of deeply excited passion. He nearly filled a goblet with the sparkling fluid and hastily swallowed it.
               Jupiter stared at this, for his master was a temperate man; he felt sure the fever of his mind would be increased by such unusual excess, but he dared not express his fears. At such a time as this, he knew his master would brook no interference from any one.
               Judge Ashley presently said:
               "Go into the well, Jupiter, and bring me the iron box in which my private papers are kept."
               The place referred to was one of the odd nooks of the old house; it was a small, square room, opening from Judge Ashley's bedchamber, and communicating with no other portion of the building. It extended through the whole depth of the walls, rising several feet above the top of the house, and was dimly lighted from above by a dome of painted glass.
               Shelves had once been placed around the lower portion of the walls, and the remains of a circular staircase were still visible where the steps had been clamped to the wall. The explanation given of its origin was, that the first owner of Ashurst had cultivated the science of astronomy, and the tower was built by him as an observatory.
               From this singular den the old servant brought an iron box about a foot square, and placed it on the table before his master. With rigid lips and eyes aflame with the wrath that burned within him, the Judge unlocked it, and then turning to the negro, curtly said:
               "You may go now, Jupiter, and listen to the gossip that is going on among the servants. I see that you are dying to know what happened to-night, but the disgraceful story will never be told by my lips."
               "I knows it a'ready, marster; I has heerd it, an' my poor ole heart bleeds for you; 'deed it does. But sha'n't none o' we servants go out and fine out what's come o' him?"
               A heavy frown gathered on the father's brow, and he icily responded:
               "It matters not what his fate is. He is no longer son of mine. I have renounced him; there, go."
               He motioned imperiously to the old man to leave him; and he dared not disobey a mandate given in his master's present mood. Jupiter moved slowly toward the door, passed the threshold, and then pausing with tears streaming over his black and wrinkled face, he imploringly said:
               "Oh, marse Judge, think twice afore you do dis awful thing. Let mercy come atween you an' de judgment, as you hopes for it yersel in de las' great day."
               As he finished speaking he closed the door precipitately, but he did not go to the kitchen, as he had been commanded; he sat down just outside the door, to be at hand in case his master should need him.
               The faithful old creature, who had carried Leon in his arms, who had taught him to ride, hunt, and fish, could not now bear the comments on his conduct, which he felt sure he should hear among the servants, so he sat down in darkness and solitude, and bewailed the calamity which had befallen fallen the family of which he considered himself an integral portion.
               Left alone, Judge Ashley unclosed the box and took from it a formidable looking parcel heavily sealed, and labelled—"The last will and testament of Rupert Ashley."
               Without opening it or glancing at its contents, he grimly held it over the lamp, and saw it shrivel into nothingness. He muttered:
               "I had given him all—all—to the utter exclusion of his sister and her son, and God help me! he has wounded me more deeply than she did. She shall not benefit by this act. I will make another will cutting them both off, and give it to charity, as I threatened; or better still, I can repay that poor deserted wife for all he has made her suffer, by making her child the sole heiress to all my wealth. I'll think of it, and in time, perhaps, I can bring down my pride to stand the presence of the beggar's brat beneath my roof."
               His lip curled with scorn, even in that hour of bitter suffering, but outraged pride had even more to endure than wounded feeling, for Judge Ashley was naturally a hard man, and such tender impulses as he once possessed, had been indurated by the large criminal practice he had conducted for so many years.
               He cherished a profound and cynical contempt for human nature, yet he held the opinion of the world at far more than its true value, and he writhed at the thought of what the guests bidden to the wedding were at that moment thinking and saying of his renegade son.
               Judge Ashley continued to look over the papers contained in the box, more to employ himself and gain some distraction for his troubled mind, than to obtain information from them, for he was already familiar with their contents.
               The hours rolled heavily away, till physical exhaustion compelled him to seek bodily repose, even if his tortured mind refused to permit the balm of sleep to fall upon his eyelids. He lay down, dressed as he was, on the outside of his bed, and poor old Jupiter, overcome with drowsiness, nodded in the hall, waking up at intervals and wondering if his master never meant to retire for the night.
               Everything was hushed in the repose which falls upon a quiet country household in the deep silence of night, and no sound broke the stillness, save the summer insects which made the air vocal with their Liliputian chorus. The lamp flickered in its socket, and died out, yet the miserable father lay with wide-stretched eyes gazing out upon the darkness. Suddenly a singular grating sound broke upon his ear, and he raised himself up, listened keenly, and then fell back muttering with 'bated breath:
               "It must be some one trying to get into the house; some one who knows that gold was lately placed in my escritoire. Oh, my God! can it—can it be that wretched—wretched boy come hither to consummate his degradation by committing a theft!"
               The suspicion at once took the form of certainty, and he lay for many moments completely unnerved. By a rare chance, the door opening from his room upon the passage before referred to, had been left open; the library door was also ajar, and the sound of a step bounding through the open window came distinctly to his ears. Then he heard steps moving about in the room with little caution, as if the burglar supposed the household to be wrapped in slumbers too deep to be broken by his presence there.
               "His search will be vain," thought the unhappy father, "for I removed the money to the tower before I set out for that fatal wedding. When he finds it's not in the secretary, will he venture hither in search of it?"
               
               "It would be like his reckless hardihood to do so, but if he does, I will catch him as a fox in a trap. I will lock him in my den, and make sure of him. Then—then I will play the part of Herod, or Brutus toward that wretched being. I believe that I can sternly assume the functions of judge, jury, and executioner myself, sooner than suffer him to live to bring disgrace upon my name—to drag it down in the very mire of iniquity in which he seems to revel."
               Revolving these terrible thoughts in his mind, Judge Ashley lay perfectly still, bending all his perceptive powers to the task of comprehending the movements of the person in the library. He heard stealthy steps moving across the floor, then a key was placed cautiously in a lock, and as its click came to his ears, the unhappy father started, for the bitter conviction came to him that his son had possessed himself of a duplicate key to the receptacle in which he usually kept his private hoards.
               Only that afternoon, in anticipation of his stay from home to a late hour, Judge Ashley had taken the precaution to remove the large sum of money deposited in the secretary into the tower, which had a strong patent lock upon it which he believed would defy the skill of the most accomplished burglar.
               When he threw himself upon his bed, he had left the door of this place partially open, and he now congratulated himself that he had done so. He would feign sleep, and the robber would walk into the trap unconsciously prepared for him; then, nothing would be easier than to spring up, close the door upon him, and secure him.
               These thoughts rapidly passed through the mind of the excited father; for after a very few moments, the intruder had satisfied himself that the money had been removed. Then his stealthy steps were heard crossing the narrow passage, which lay between the two rooms, with extreme caution. He had evidently removed his shoes, for there was no sound made by his light tread as he glided toward the door of the Judge's room, and paused upon the threshold to listen for the regular breathing which would give him the assurance that its inmate was asleep.
               In his irrepressible agitation, the breathing of the old man was as heavy as if steeped in the deepest slumber, and apparently reassured by this Ashley entered the room, moved lightly across the floor, and sought a table in the drawer of which the key of the tower was usually deposited.
               If anything had been wanting to confirm the suspicions of his father this would have sufficed, for Leon alone knew where the key was kept.
               One of the window blinds had been left partially open, and through this a hazy light penetrated which was sufficient for the intruder's purpose. Foiled in finding the key, he glanced around, saw the door open, and softly glided toward it.
               No sooner was he safely within the tower, than the Judge lifted himself, sprang toward the door with an agility scarcely to be expected in a man of his years, and suddenly threw it too with all his force; the spring closed, and before Leon was aware that danger was upon him, he found himself a prisoner to his outraged father.
               He glanced upward—there was no escape that way; and in despair he threw down the rouleau of gold he had already seized on, and fiercely demanded to be released.
               No answer came, and then he struck against the walls with violence; but they were too solid to permit him to hope that he could effect a breach in them. In impotent rage he cursed and blasphemed in a fearful manner, but still no answer came.
               Appalled by the silence, and exhausted by his own violence olence, Ashley at length sunk helplessly upon the floor, moaning over the fate which seemed to have overtaken him in a single night. The Judge sat on the outside of the door, pallid and stern as the incarnation of Fate itself, and as he listened to the violence of his son an expression of grim determination deepened upon his face with every passing hour.
               Aroused by the uproar his young master made, Jupiter ventured to come in, and the Judge ordered him to bring a light. He placed a candle on the mantel-piece, and then crouched down in a corner, tremblingly watching the cold, wrathful face before him, and a creeping dread, which he could not conquer, seemed to benumb the faculties of the poor slave. Through all these long hours Judge Ashley spoke not once; but when the first glimmer of dawn crept into the apartment he turned to Jupiter and sternly said:
               "No one save you and I must know of the prisoner confined here. If others discover where he is concealed, it may prove his destruction. You understand me, Jupiter?"
               "Ye-es, marster, I b'lieves I does. But—but de ossifers will be here p'raps, caze dey'll naterally come to dis place fust to look arter Marse Leon. Why not give him a chance to escape at once?"
               "There is but one chance to escape disgrace left to him, and that he shall have the full benefit of," was the cold reply. "I shall not leave this room to-day. Bring my coffee here; I require nothing else; and do you remain within call all day. I shall have need of you."
               "An'—an' de young marster? sha'n't I bring nuffin' for him, sir?"
               "No, let him do without food till he is weak enough to be dealt with by you and me. Should we open the door now to give food to him, he would overpower us both, and escape from us only to be taken by those who by this time are probably on the watch for him. I will at least save him from the disgrace of being seized on and thrown in the county jail till his trial can come on."
               "But de weather's very warm, marster, an' dere's mighty little fresh a'r in dat ere tower. I's 'feared de young 'un will suffer mightily shet up in sich a tight place as dat."
               "He'll soon be in a tighter one," muttered the Judge. He went on more audibly: "I have no choice left me, Jupe. Leon must either stifle there or in the jail, and I am sure he would choose the tower in preference. At any rate, it is my pleasure to keep him here, and you are to give no hint of his presence in this house."
               "Who—I, marse? I'd cut my han' off sooner than do sich a thing."
               "Very well; I know that I can trust you, Jupiter."
               The old negro left the room on his errand, and in half an hour returned with a cup of steaming coffee, and a plate of toast, which he hoped his master might be induced to take, for he felt assured that the Judge must need food after the exciting and sleepless night he had passed.
               His thoughtful care was not entirely unrewarded, for his master mechanically lifted the toast to his lips, and absently swallowed several morsels; suddenly they seemed to choke him, and he pushed the plate away, while a deeper pallor overspread his face.
               The cause of this was soon evident, for strange voices were heard upon the lawn, and on looking from the open window, two men were seen approaching the house.
               The father, who believed he had nerve enough to play the part of the stoic, trembled and grew cold; but when a heavy knock was struck upon the door of the adjoining room, which he used as an office, he controlled himself, and hurriedly said:
               "I will receive these men myself; do you remain here; but as you value the safety of the prisoner in that place, make no noise while they are with me. They have scarcely come to arrest him at this early hour, for they have not had time to have a warrant issued, even if my neighbors were very anxious to lay violent hands on my son."
               He drew the key from the lock of the tower door, dropped it in his pocket, and composing his features as well as possible, went into the next room to meet his unwelcome visitors.
               No sooner had the door closed on him, than the old negro placed his lips against the keyhole, and softly whispered:
               "Marse Leon, how is it wid ye? Is ye mos' stifled in dat ere hole?"
               "Is it you, Jupe?" replied a faint voice. "Open the door, if you can. If I stay here much longer I believe I shall be done for. Oh! I am sure that I am dying in this hot den."
               "My dear young marster, I'd open de do' wid all my heart, but he's got de key, an' I can't do nothin' to help yer."
               There was an impatient groan in response, and nothing further was said between them.
               In the mean time Judge Ashley carefully closed the door of communication, and admitted those he felt assured came there with no friendly intent. In the elder man he recognized the overseer of Arden Place, and the younger one was George Lester.
               He had vainly sought Ashley throughout the early portion of the night, and then concluded to snatch a few hours' repose before performing the errand he had undertaken.
               At daylight he was astir, and on descending from his room he found the overseer mounting his horse in a state of great excitement. A frightened looking servant stood upon the steps, of whom Lester inquired how Miss Arden had passed the night, and whether he should go in search of her brother. The man answered:
               "De nurse says Miss Grace is asleep yit, but Marse Erny aint to be found nowhars. He aint bin in his room dis night, an' nobody knows what's 'come o' him. Oh, Lord, ha' mercy on us, for we don't know what we's all a comin' to!"
               Lester hastily descended the steps, and addressed the overseer:
               "Mr. Watson, have you any idea where Ernest can be. We had an appointment together this morning, and it is imperative that I shall see him immediately."
               The man gloomily regarded him, as he replied:
               "The lad is nowhere to be found, and I am afraid we shall never see him alive again."
               "Why should you think so?" asked Lester, appalled by the gloomy certainty of his tones.
               "I can give you a reason that satisfies myself, but likely you won't think much of it."
               "Let me hear it, at all events."
               After a pause Watson said:
               "I was lying between sleeping and waking last night about twelve o'clock, when I heard a sound like the firing of pistols. I tried to make out in what direction it came from, and I jumped up and looked out of my window. Everything was so still that I thought I must have been dreaming, so I went back to bed again.
               "I was falling off into a sort of doze, when a strange sound came whizzing through my room; I opened my eyes and my hair riz on my head, for as sure as I see you standing there before me, I saw Ernest Arden, dripping with water, within six feet of my bed. I had but a glimpse like, and then he vanished away, and though I called him, he never answered.
               
               "After that I couldn't rest in my bed, so I dressed and walked up to the house. Everything was quiet there, and after making a circuit of the grounds I went to the pond. The moon was shining as bright as day, but I saw nothing there to make me think the vision was real; so I concluded that I might have been dreaming, and I went back home and went to bed; but I couldn't sleep, and at three o'clock I saddled my horse and rode around the place again. I came here as soon as it was day to ask for the young master, but he wasn't in his room, and hadn't slept there last night.
               "Putting all these things together, I am mighty uneasy in my mind; I'm afraid he and young Ashley met last night, and something dreadful has happened."
               "That can hardly be, for I was in pursuit of Ashley all the earlier part of the night, for the purpose of settling a meeting between them. I did not come up with him, and it is my opinion that he has fled the country."
               "Maybe so—I hope so for Miss Grace's sake, for she'd never get over a fatal duel between these two. I'm doubtful about Ashley's going off, and I scarcely know what is to be done next. What would you advise, Mr. Lester?"
               "Let us go over to Ashurst and see the Judge. Perhaps he may know something of the movements of his son after that wretched exposé last night."
               "It isn't likely; Judge Ashley is a dreadful stern man, and after such disgrace as the young man has brought on his name, he would be more afraid of meeting his father than any one else."
               "We will try it, at any rate. Mr. Watson, for that is the most likely place to hear of Ashley, even if he is not found at Ashurst. Suppose we go around by the pond; poor Ernest may have drowned himself there, though that is scarcely likely. He is morbid enough on some points, but not to such a degree as to make him commit suicide for such a thing as this."
               The horse Lester had ordered now made its appearance, and he mounted and spurred in the direction of the pond, followed by Watson. It was half a mile from the house lying in a deep dell, on one side sheltered by the walk before described, and on the other shaded by a group of golden willows.
               There were evidences that the grass upon the terrace had been trampled in several places, but not more than was readily accounted for by the presence of a party of gentlemen anglers there on the day before. Baffled in their endeavors to gain a clue to Arden's fate in that direction, the two rode on to Ashurst.
               When the master of the house appeared before them with that stormy expression of despair and resolution upon his features, Lester attributed his suffering to the disgrace his son had brought upon him, for he well knew the indomitable pride of the man before him.
               Before he could speak, the Judge said:
               "To what am I indebted for so early a visit, gentlemen? Has anything been heard from my unhappy son? Perhaps he has been arrested, and you have come to break the degrading news to me."
               "He is not here, then?" said Lester. "We came hither to inquire if he has been heard from since last night. I am sorry to inform you that Ernest Arden is missing, and we are apprehensive that the two may have met, and—and something fatal may have been the result."
               Judge Ashley sunk on a seat in overwhelming agitation; he hoarsely gasped:
               "Ernest missing! Are you sure—quite sure that it is so?"
               "He is certainly not to be found, and a singular dream Mr. Watson had last night fills his mind with apprehensions for his safety."
               The Judge waved his hand and said:
               "He must be safe so far as Leon is concerned. No, no, my son would never dare to harm the brother, after so deeply wounding the sister. I trust in God the poor boy may be found safe and unharmed; he is a singular youth; full of strange fancies and fantastical notions of honor; but Leon would not listen to any provocation from him in the state of excitement the event of last night must have thrown him into. Badly as Leon Ashley has acted, he is not so bad as that."
               "I think with you, Judge Ashley," replied Lester, respectfully, "and it seems useless to linger longer here, since it is evident that your son has not sought refuge at Ashurst. Come, Watson, let us resume our search in some other direction. Perhaps when we go back to Arden Place we may find that Ernest has returned there quite safe."
               "I trust we may," replied the overseer, gravely, "but I have very strong doubts as to his safety."
               "Yes, you will find him, I am sure you must find him there," said Judge Ashley, feverishly; for the most earnest desire of his heart was to rid himself of their presence, that he might at once proceed to such an investigation as would satisfy the terrible doubts which had arisen in his own mind.
               The two visitors took their leave, after promising to send a messenger over with tidings of Ernest, so soon as anything was heard of his whereabouts.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               LEON'S DOOM.
               THE door once closed upon his unwelcome visitors, Judge Ashley paced the floor in deep perturbation before he could summon courage to enter the adjoining apartment.
               When he at length did so, he approached the door of the tower, and spoke through it to his prisoner.
               "Leon, if I open the door and let you out, will you give me your word to make no attempt to escape? Will you submit to me as your judge?"
               No reply came, and after a pause he spoke sternly to Jupiter:
               "He is shamming. Go into my office and bring the cords which you will find in the closet; also the handcuffs that the constable forgot and left here the day Smith was brought before me on a false charge."
               The negro became ashen grey with terror.
               "Oh Marse Judge, Marse Judge, what am you agwine to do wi' dem ar tings? Don't 'sgrace yer only son by put-tin' dem on to him, he'll never forgive you for it, marster, never!"
               The Judge sternly replied,—
               "It matters not now what he will do or feel. My duty is to perform an act of justice, even if my own son is the criminal to be punished. Do you obey my commands at once."
               
               The old negro crept slowly into the next room, and after considerable delay returned, bringing with him the required articles.
               When he had placed them on the table, his master commanded him to close the window blinds and bolt them securely, while he locked the doors himself, and removed the keys. A large astral lamp, which stood upon a stand, was then lighted, and his arrangements were completed.
               Commanding Jupiter to place himself near the tower door to aid him in overpowering the prisoner should he attempt to escape, Judge Ashley cautiously sprang back the bolt, and opened a crevice to take a survey of the condition of things within.
               Everything was perfectly quiet, and on unclosing the door, he saw that Leon had sunk down in an attitude of perfect immobility, apparently prostrated by the heat and the closeness of the atmosphere in his narrow prison. He made an effort to spring up, but the strong wiry arms of his father were quickly thrown around him, and with the reluctant assistance of Jupiter, the manacles were clasped upon his wrists in spite of all the resistance he could make.
               Ashley was then lifted to a chair to which he was bound almost in a state of passiveness; he lay back pale and fainting, bathed in perspiration, exhausted by his frantic efforts to make a breach in the walls of his prison. After a few moments he gasped,—
               "Water—water—I am perishing of thirst!"
               A pitcher of ice water stood on the table, and Jupiter hastened to offer a goblet of it to his parched lips. The Judge then said:
               "Go, Jupiter, and bring food hither, for I suppose he has eaten nothing since dinner yesterday. But beware of betraying who it is for. Tell the cook that I ate no breakfast, and am now hungry."
               The negro hastened to obey this command, for all his sympathies were enlisted in favor of his suffering young master. During the time of his absence the pale father sat watching the averted face of his son, for Leon turned his head from him as far as possible, as if dreading the power of the cold, stern eyes so immovably fixed upon him.
               No word passed between them, though at intervals the Judge held water to his lips when he saw that he was suffering for it. This silence was more dreadful to Leon than the most bitter reproaches; knowing his father as he did, he trembled to imagine what it might forebode.
               Jupiter at length came back with a substantial breakfast, with which he fed the half famished prisoner. In spite of his present position, and the uncertainty of the future, his appetite did not seem to have deserted him, and Judge Ashley looked on with contemptuous astonishment at the apparent enjoyment with which he devoured his food.
               Color returned to Leon's blanched features; fire once more flamed from his eyes; and he turned them defiantly upon his father and asked:
               "Why am I treated in this contumelious manner? Is the tie of blood so slight that a parent can show no more consideration for his son than if he were a dog? I should have hesitated to throw even the meanest cur into such a don as that from which you drew me, only to bind me in fetters like the lowest of criminals. What do you intend to do with me, Judge Ashley?"
               "That, you will know soon enough, sir," replied his father, with stern gravity, "your fate lowers as a grim shadow over you even now."
               Then turning to the negro he said:
               "Leave the room Jupiter, but keep watch near the door; permit no one to interrupt me, for I have a grievous task before me in dealing with the criminal it is my duty to judge."
               Jupiter reluctantly obeyed, and the eyes of the bound man followed his retreating figure with an expression of alarm he vainly endeavored to conceal. He felt that he was left helpless at the mercy of a man who looked as if every soft, or human feeling had died out of his heart.
               He made frantic efforts to release himself from his bonds, but they were fruitless, for the stern hands that bound him had done their work too thoroughly to leave a hope of escape from the toils in which his own evil deeds had ensnared him.
               The judge went to a wardrobe and took from it the cap of judgment he had been in the habit of using when sentencing criminals to death. He placed it on the table by his side, and then seating himself exactly in front of his son, spoke in his most solemn and impressive manner.
               "Leon Ashley, you are arraigned before me for crimes of the deepest dye. It falls to me to play the part of prosecutor, judge, and executioner in your case, unless you show cause why the last shall not be performed."
               A faint sneer curled the lip of the bound man, for he began to regard these preparations as a mere mockery designed to frighten him. He defiantly replied—
               "If you dared attempt such a thing, you would be more criminal than I have been. It is quite enough to humiliate me thus, without proceeding to the extremity you threaten."
               The father's stern face assumed its haughtiest expression, and he severely said:
               "You will even find that I am in sad earnest; Leon Ashley at this hour you are nearer your doom than you imagine."
               "Doom! what do you mean, sir! Of what do you accuse cuse me, that can entitle me to endure the penalty of death?"
               "I arraign you for a trinity of crimes rarely perpetrated by one man. First, for bigamy; secondly, for burglary; lastly, for murder!"
               His very lips grew white and rigid as he pronounced the last word, and he fixed his piercing eyes upon his son, as if he would read his very soul. A quick shudder convulsed his frame, for the manner in which this last charge was received, convinced him of its truth.
               The form of the accused seemed to collapse with terror, and his eyes roamed wildly from object to object, as he faintly repeated.
               "Murder! who dares accuse me of that? I am no Cain; take your cruel eyes from me, old man, and do not seek to frighten me into criminating myself. I will deny this charge to the very bitter end. Who says I destroyed Ernest Arden?"
               The Judge sunk back with a faint cry at this confirmation of his worst fear, and several moments elapsed before he could again speak. At length he said:
               "You have accused yourself. I spoke not of Ernest Arden, and if not guilty, why should you have thought of him? He is missing; can nowhere be found, and your words assure me that by your hand he has fallen. Oh, wretched boy! Was it not enough to break the heart of the hapless sister, without taking the life of this unfortunate youth? The rest I might have been induced to forgive, but this crime can only be expiated in one way. The laws of your country will demand your life, and it is my purpose to save my name from utter disgrace by taking the law into my own hands."
               As he proceeded the eyes of the listener grew larger and wilder, and at the close of his words he furiously cried out:
               
               "What! will you—you play the part of the avenger toward your own son? If you do, may the furies tear you, and the vulture of remorse prey forever upon your heart. But I tell you I did not kill Ernest Arden. He may be found yet; and then you will see how unjust your accusation is. Why should I kill the brother of the woman I wished to make my wife? Unfetter my limbs, and cease to treat me as a condemned criminal, for such I am not."
               He writhed so violently in his bonds that the bosom of his shirt came open, and the handle of a pistol was revealed. With a swift motion the Judge leaned forward, and tore from their place of concealment a pair of small, richly inlaid pistols, which had been a present from himself to his son.
               
                  Both had been lately discharged, for they were blackened with smoke, and had evidently been recently used. He hoarsely said:
               "Perjurer! behold the evidence which comes to convict you of lying when you stand upon the brink of doom. Believe me or not, as you choose, but you are now on trial for life, or death, and the judgment shall certainly be executed upon you."
               For an instant Ashley was overwhelmed by the proof thus summarily brought against him, but he quickly recovered, and doggedly said:
               "No jury could be found to convict a man on such evidence as that. Scarcely a day passes that I do not use my pistols, and you are aware that I always carry them about me. As to my life, you can take it if you have the hardihood to do so; but in that event you will, in your turn, be amenable to the laws of your country, and all men will regard with horror the modern Brutus who condemned his own son to death."
               The Judge replied, with stern gravity:
               "Men will not know it: your doom will be secret, your death self-inflicted."
               Leon turned his dilating eyes upon him in mingled fear and incredulity. He repeated, with a sneer:
               "Self-inflicted! Do you imagine that I am going to commit suicide at your command? If so, you greatly mistake my character."
               "It matters not; you will have no choice, and you will yet grasp with eagerness the potion which is to save you from the infamy of a trial, and from the defiling hands of the hangman."
               There was such a depth of dreary conviction in the tones of the speaker, that Leon began to tremble. His was naturally a weak, pleasure-loving temperament, which could not endure suffering either of body or mind; and the possibilities thus shadowed forth seemed to turn his life current into ice.
               He remained silent, with his head sunk upon his breast, and his father sat watching him, with such a chaos of wretchedness imprisoned in his proud heart, that the most insensible must have pitied him.
               Judge Ashley had cast off his elder child for disobedience, and centred all his hopes in his handsome and attractive son, who he fondly hoped was to be the prop of his old age, and the inheritor of his stainless name.
               On the score of family pride the old man was almost a monomaniac, and to preserve his escutcheon pure, he believed himself capable of making any personal sacrifice. He was working himself up now to that point at which he would recklessly burden his life with a weight which he felt must destroy him as surely as if slow poison had been infused into his system. His heart might break, but justice should be done upon the criminal even if the heavens should fall and crush him for his unnatural act.
               
               He was in deadly earnest in the assertions he made to his son, and he only waited for some additional confirmation of the crime of which he had accused Leon to pronounce upon him the fatal sentence of death.
               The next two hours were spent in so terrible a manner, as to leave their impress forever upon the two men thus placed in deadly antagonism to each other.
               At intervals Leon passionately remonstrated against such treatment, and implored to be left free to make his escape; but to this the Judge replied that escape was now impossible; that by this time a watch had been set upon the place, and any effort on the part of his son to leave the house would lead to his instant arrest.
               It was near ten o'clock when a messenger came in hot haste to the door of Ashurst, and gave Jupiter a note addressed to his master. The man rode away immediately, leaving no clue to the writer of the following lines:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "JUDGE ASHLEY:—The pond on Arden Place has been dragged, and the body of Ernest Arden recovered from it, with a wound in his side which of itself might not have proved mortal; while stunned, he either fell into the water, or was thrown in by his adversary; which happened cannot now be known.
                           "Suspicion has fastened on your son, and persons have gone to Frederick to obtain a warrant for his arrest. If you are aware of his whereabouts, warn him of his danger, and aid him to get out of the country as soon as possible, for he would have little chance of escape if brought to trial.
                           
                              A FRIEND."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Jupiter carried this missive to his master, and with a scared face watched him while he read it. As the Judge comprehended the sense of the lines, all mercy seemed to die out of his heart. He turned toward his son with an expression of iron determination, and said:
               "If I have hitherto wavered, and listened to the promptings ings of nature, that weakness is now at an end, Leon Ashley. Read your death-warrant, for such this letter will prove to you."
               He held the lines before the eyes of the bound man, which eagerly devoured them. For a moment he seemed crushed by the evil that so nearly approached him, and every shade of color fled from his features, but he presently said:
               "The writer of that shows more consideration for me than you have, for he warns me to fly, while you bind me to my fatal doom, and give me no chance to save my life."
               His father sternly replied:
               "What right have I, a sworn servant of justice, to permit so great a criminal as you to escape? I have condemned to death the sons of other men for crimes more venial than those of which you are accused; why then shall I hesitate in your case, when I can compass the ends of justice without troubling the State to deal with you? There is now no doubt left in my mind, Leon Ashley, that you were the author of Ernest Arden's death—that yours was the hand which hurled his insensible form into the water."
               "In the last you wrong me, sir," said Leon impulsively. "I acknowledge that we met in the grounds; he challenged me to a personal combat, and I, of course, accepted his defiance. We fought upon the bank of the pond, and Arden must have staggered toward its edge as the shot struck him, for when I recovered sufficiently to look around me, he was nowhere to be seen. Once his head arose above the surface of the water, but so far from drowning him, I would have made an effort to save him had it been possible to do so. This is the simple truth, believe it or not, as you may choose."
               Judge Ashley seemed to be considering his words, but after a pause, he said:
               
               "It is true, then, that by your hand this young man fell, and you are amenable to the law for his murder. You have no witness to vouch for the truth of what you have just stated, therefore it will avail you little. Before the day is gone, the myrmidons of justice will be here to arrest you, yet you speak of the possibility of escape. Do you not see that but one avenue of escape is now open to you?"
               "And what is that? I am ready to embrace it," said Leon, eagerly.
               "I told you that you must eventually embrace it," replied his father, with solemn emphasis. "You can only evade arrest and punishment by taking your own life: when the officers come hither, they must find only the inanimate form from which the spirit has succeeded in effecting its escape."
               A cry escaped the lips of the criminal, and he passionately cried out:
               "I cannot—I will not take my own life. What should I gain by such a desperate deed as that? It would be better to risk the chances of a trial."
               "And bear the infamy, the long imprisonment, the scorn and contempt of all honorable men? Believe me, life will be harder to bear on such degrading terms than to sacrifice it at once. Your doom is sealed even before your trial takes place, for escape from condemnation is impossible. The double offence of which you have been guilty is of so aggravated a character that no jury could be found to clear you. Therefore, I here solemnly sentence you to expiate your crimes against Ernest Arden and his sister by the voluntary relinquishment of life, in token whereof I assume the badge of my office."
               As he ceased speaking, he lifted the black cap, and drew it upon his head.
               Leon sunk back with the sudden conviction that there would be no possibility of evading this sentence—that his father would be as inexorable as fate itself in exacting its fulfilment. His courage began to fail him, and his spirits sunk to the lowest level.
               Hitherto he had endeavored to convince himself that his father was only playing on his apprehensions, that he might punish him as severely as possible for his late conduct, before permitting him to effect his escape. That he was in earnest in this solemn doom he would not hitherto believe, but now he comprehended that the Judge was not acting; that he was in fatal earnest, and his abject soul cowered before the shadow that was so rapidly settling over him.
               He faintly asked:
               Will you not suffer me to avail myself of such chances as may still exist in my favor? Surely you will allow me to make an effort to save myself?"
               "It would be useless, Leon; and the attempt would end in something worse for you than an easy and speedy death. Choose your doom now while the power to do so is yet yours."
               "But if I consent to perish thus, what is to become of my wife—of my child?" asked the prisoner, with suddenly awakened interest in their fate. "They are dependent on me, and I have pledged myself to Eva to allow her a liberal support from such means as I expected to secure by giving my hand to Grace."
               "Such a compact as that was worthy of you," said his father contemptuously. "But you need not hesitate to give up life on their account, for I pledge myself to provide for them. Save my name from infamy, and I promise to receive the child under my own roof, and rear her as my heiress. I shall have no other one on whom to bestow my wealth."
               
               Leon despairingly cried out:
               "Oh, my father, since you can consider my child, have mercy on me also; let me go hence, only let me go, and I will trouble you no more. I will seek a foreign land, and under an assumed name, escape the bloodhounds of the law."
               "You would be sought after, identified and brought back to undergo the punishment you have incurred. Think of the wide-spread notoriety the newspapers would give your late acts; the dreadful infamy of the punishment you must eventually undergo; of the humiliating and wretched imprisonment while the scales of life and death hang balancing in the hands of justice. I solemnly assure you that in your case they would not vibrate long; the fatal doom would soon be pronounced, and other lips than mine enunciate the sentence I have already pronounced."
               There was a solemn dignity in his manner which overawed the young man, and in anguish he asked:
               "Oh, my God! can this be true? Are you quite sure of what you assert?"
               "As sure as that I am sitting here opposite to you," was the sad response. "So convinced am I of your ultimate fate, that if you refuse voluntarily to escape from the indignities that menace you, I will force the deadly potion upon you with my own hands, terrible as the alternative would be."
               There was stern, yet pathetic resolution in every tone of his voice, and as his son listened the last hope died out of his heart. He began to realize that he was in the toils, and the cold shadow of death was already settling around him.
               The picture of degradation and suffering drawn by his father was repulsive to every characteristic of his nature. He was but a poor butterfly, incapable either of deep thought or emotion, and such courage as he possessed failed him at once when he actually realized the full horror of his position. After many moments of gloomy and bitter thoughts, he faintly said:
               "Since there seems to be no escape from the punishment I have brought upon myself, I consent to embrace your alternative. I will do execution upon my own body, but in the hereafter yours will be the sin, and from you, not from me, will God require expiation for this most unnatural crime."
               The Judge replied with a faint touch of emotion:
               "God is just, and He sees the necessity of acting as I am about to do. He will absolve me in the great hereafter, for he knows how much I suffer in carrying out the justice He has himself set forth as His immutable law. Not many hours are left to act in, for the officers will be here by night in search of you, and at once you must take from my hand the potion which will save you from disgrace."
               Leon bowed his head with an expression of despairing acquiescence, and the Judge arose, went into the tower, and brought out a small medicine chest. After looking through it, he went to the door and asked of Jupiter:
               "Where is the laudanum which is usually kept here?"
               "Is it de lodomy you're axin arter, sir? I took it out to ole Kitty yistiddy when she axed for some to stop her toothache, an' I forgot to bring it back. What for you want de lodomy, Marse Judge?"
               "That is no concern of yours; do you go and bring it to me immediately."
               The imperative voice sounded hard and husky in the ears of the old negro, and trembling at the suspicion of what was to be done with the dreadly drug, he went to perform his errand.
               He stayed away so long that his master became impatient tient, and as he glanced toward the place of the sun in the heavens, he muttered:
               "We shall barely have time: if they should come before the doom is consummated, all will have been done in vain."
               The wretched convict sat cowering in his chair, so stunned by the events of the last sixteen hours that he was incapable of feeling the full horror of his position as a trebly-dyed criminal, escaping legal justice by the doom of his own father.
               Bewildered, helpless, and uncertain, Ashley felt that his fate had passed beyond his own control; that all which now remained to him was to submit to let the car of destiny roll over him and crush him into nothingness.
               Of course he was a coward, or he would have resisted to the last the alternative of self-destruction as an escape from disgrace; but he had no religious feeling, and he believed that when once the form was laid in the immobility of death, all consciousness was forever lost.
               He tried to think that the oblivion of the grave would be a welcome escape from the great evils that menaced him, but his soul shrank and quivered before the dread necessity which ruled him, and the bitterness of death was realized in all its keenness while he thus sat awaiting the action of his implacable father.
               The blood in his veins seemed turning to ice, and the pulsation in his heart became so feeble that he fancied himself dying; but from this delusion he was aroused by the sound of the shuffling steps of Jupiter, as he unwillingly drew near with the laudanum bottle in his hand.
               With grim self-control the judge received it, and closed the door upon him at once, without replying to the mutely imploring glance of the old negro.
               He trembled perceptibly as he advanced toward the chair occupied by his son, and with averted face said:
               "Drink this, Leon, and you will baffle those who are now upon your track; it is your only chance to escape ignominy. Death by laudanum is painless; you will sleep your life away, unconscious that it is slipping from you. It requires but a single effort, which if not made, will expose you to such infamy—such suffering, as will cause you to wish a thousand times that you had chosen death in preference to them. Swallow this draught without hesitation, Leon, and you shall take with you into eternity the pardon for your crimes which I will never accord to you, if you are base enough to live."
               The poor culprit shivered as he listened to this address, and he wailed:
               "Oh, my father, it is a dire choice that you force upon me; I must recoil from it; must shrink from death, when, as yet, I have scarcely lived."
               "When a man has outlived his respectability, he has already lived too long," was the stern response. "Do not play the part of the poltroon, boy, and leave me no vestige of respect for you. Methinks if I can have nerve enough to condemn my only son to death, he should have courage to meet his doom like a man."
               This taunt seemed to sting Leon, and he rapidly said:
               "Give me the drug; I will no longer shrink from what I see I shall not be permitted to evade." He grasped the bottle, and as he held it before himself, he went on:
               "You pledge yourself that my daughter shall be received here, and reared as becomes the future heiress of your name and fortune. Somehow I have a tender feeling for the helpless little creature, though I have no longer any love for her mother. Renew your promise to me, father, before I swallow this death potion."
               "I swear it: the child shall be brought hither, and her education shall be carefully attended to, and for the first time throughout this trying scene the voice of the Judge faltered.
               He regarded the motions of his son with dilating eyes and whitening lips, for in this supreme moment the iron of his nature began to melt, and doubts to arise as to his right to execute justice upon the criminal without allowing him a chance for his life.
               But his fears and regrets were too late, for Leon suddenly tore out the stopple, and swallowed the contents of the bottle before a hand could be interposed to prevent the deed.
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               THE RESURRECTION.
               THE shades of night had gathered around Ashurst, and all was still within and around the old house.
               On that evening there was to have been a grand merrymaking there in honor of the marriage of the heir. Invitations had been sent far and wide, but the startling news had gone forth that the groom was a recreant and murderer; that the bride lay on a bed of sickness, perhaps of death, and the bidden guests tarried in their own homes, and talked over the terrible retribution which had come home to Judge Ashley for his hardness toward his daughter.
               Ellinor Ashley had eloped with a young lawyer from New York while on a summer tour to the North; and although her husband died within a year of her marriage, leaving her in poverty, and burdened with a young child, her father had sternly rejected all overtures toward a reconciliation, and left her to struggle through the very depths of privation without holding forth a helping hand.
               Though much sympathy was now felt and expressed for him, the general feeling was that Judge Ashley was a hard, unyielding man, who would bear this bitter blow with the outward seeming of the stoic, even while his heart inwardly bled.
               The magistrate to whom application was made for a warrant to arrest Leon Ashley was an old friend, and with extreme reluctance he issued it; but the crimes of which the young man was accused were of so flagrant a nature that he could not refuse.
               He urged those who were sent to Ashurst to search the house to be as respectful in their course as was consistent with the performance of their duty.
               Some delays were purposely thrown in their way by Mr. Markham, that the criminal might have a chance to effect his escape, and the officers did not reach their destination till nine o'clock at night.
               The trampling of their horses on the lawn aroused the Judge from the stupor in which he had sat for several wretched hours; for now the fatal deed was accomplished, the unhappy father would have given all he possessed to restore life to the pale form before him. He tried to convince himself that he was in a terrible dream, for he dared not realize that his son had perished at his own command.
               The old negro watched him with unflinching gaze, as the two sat beside the rough coffin in which lay the body of Leon Ashley, cold and rigid.
               The astral lamp cast its steady light throughout the room, distinctly revealing the livid face of the hapless young man, who lay there in calm immobility; the brow still contracted with pain, and the lips closed with an expression pression of firmness they had never worn while the conscious spirit ruled the body.
               As the noise of the new arrival penetrated into the still room, Jupiter manifested extreme excitement, and he hoarsely whispered:
               "Dey's come, marse Judge; dey's come arter him at las'; but you won't let 'em take his poor senseless body away."
               Thus aroused, the Judge impatiently waved his hand, and said:
               "Go to the door, Jupiter, and open it. I will receive those men in this room."
               The old man slowly arose, and reluctantly moved to obey the order, but his eyes more than once scanned the motionless features of his young master before he left the room.
               There was a brief parley at the entrance, and then the heavy tramp of approaching feet was heard.
               The Judge tried to throw off the leaden weight that pressed upon him, and he vaguely passed his hand over his forehead, as if endeavoring to recall his thoughts to what was necessary to be said to those who came there to find that death had already claimed their intended victim.
               The under sheriff of the county, followed by two other men, entered the apartment, staring with astonishment at the lugubrious scene it presented. With ghastly composure the pale, stony-looking father addressed them.
               "I am aware of what brings you hither, Mr. Waters, but the crime the law would avenge is already atoned for, and the criminal at this hour answers for it at a higher tribunal than that of man. Behold! there lies my son stricken down in the flower of his youth—dead from the wound inflicted by him he is accused of destroying."
               Waters paused, and looked around with that feeling of sudden awe which falls upon the spirit in the presence of death incurred by violence. He had not thought of such a denouement as this, but he could not doubt the truth of Judge Ashley's words, for their proof lay before him in the person of his lifeless son.
               He spoke with much emotion:
               "Before Heaven, Judge, I would have been the last man to undertake such a duty as this with willingness, but I am the servant of the law, and you know that I could not evade obedience when my superior sent me the order to arrest your son."
               "I know—I understand that you are but a deputy, Waters—that you were commanded to search my house for the murderer of Ernest Arden. You have found him; he lies before you, stricken in death from a wound received in a fair duel, for with his latest breath Leon averred that such was the fact. The wound given my son prevented him from assisting his antagonist when he reeled, and fell into the water, so Ernest met his death by drowning. Leon managed to get home to die under his paternal roof. He bled internally, and it is now many hours since life departed. Approach, and see for yourself that he is really dead; if you suspect any deception, you can touch his hand, and see that it is quite cold."
               Waters had that shrinking horror of death which is often found among men, and in place of approaching nearer to the open coffin, he recoiled from it a step, and compassionately regarded the stern face on which such bitter suffering was impressed. The high character of Judge Ashley forbade any thought of falsehood or deception, and he huskily replied:
               "It is quite unnecessary, Judge. I can see for myself that justice has no further business here; that a higher power has dealt with the accused. I am glad to know that the duel was perfectly fair, and as both parties perished, there is nothing more to be done."
               "No—nothing more," repeated the overwrought father, in a dull tone. "Nothing more. And now, gentlemen, please to leave me alone with my dead. I—I have borne so much for the last few hours that I need solitude; a little more tension on my aching brain, and I know not what may happen to me. God help me! for my heart feels as if it would break with the load upon it."
               The two men who accompanied the sheriff stared at the shrouded figure in the coffin in dumb amazement, but they did not offer to speak a word. The tremendous nature of the tragedy which that room had so lately witnessed, they did not suspect, but the conflict ending in the death of both parties awed them into silence before the majestic old man, who looked as if time could never console him for the events of the last few hours.
               One of them ventured to touch the clammy hand of the recumbent form, but its chilling contact caused him to shrink suddenly away, and he drew a sigh of relief when his principal turned toward the door, and hastily retreated as he said:
               "I will return at once to those who sent me here, Judge, and report what I have seen. Of course you will be annoyed no further, and I am sure the community will show the respect and sympathy it feels for your great trouble, in every possible manner."
               "I shall thank them if they will forbear to interfere with me in any way: the expression of sympathy I cannot tolerate, and my most earnest desire now is, that the name of this hapless boy shall be permitted to sink into oblivion. I trust that no attempt will be made to harrow my feelings further, by holding an inquest which is needless. I watched over my son, and saw him die: and I do not need a jury of men to come hither to pronounce upon the cause of a death with which I am perfectly acquainted. I desire to bury him with the strictest privacy, as I could not brook the presence of strangers at his untimely obsequies."
               "A am quite sure that your wishes will be respected, sir; and with the assurance of my deepest sympathy, I bid you good night, Judge Ashley."
               The door closed on the intruders, and the father sunk down upon his knees, moaning:
               "My son—my son! would to God that I could restore to you the life I so recklessly forced you to surrender. Oh! I was cruel—hard of heart, to condemn you in the vigor of life to such a fate as this. You might have fled—you might have escaped, had I not been iron to your prayers. Oh, my God! how dare I ask mercy of thee, when I refused it to my own child!"
               His gray head was bowed over the motionless form, while he thus wailed forth his too lately awakened remorse. Jupiter again crept into the room after shutting out the strangers, and listened keenly to the self-reproaches thus uttered by his old master, and a strange expression of satisfaction passed over his black face.
               He watched the still features of Leon with a vivid, concentrated interest, which might have led one to suppose that he was trying to stamp them indelibly upon his memory.
               Suddenly the negro started, for he thought the livid hue of the face was changing to a more natural tint, and he raised his voice and asked:
               "Ef my young marster could come back to life, wouldn't you make him take pizen agin? Much as you's a grievin' now, I is feared dat ef de blessed Lor' was to make a myraccle for you, you'd undo it in yer pride an' hardness o' heart. Thar! I aint feared on you no longer, an' I dare spoke the truth outright. You is as hard-hearted as the nuther millstone, an' you has proved it dis day."
               
               The sense of his words seemed to come slowly to the stunned mind of the listener, but he lifted his head and after a pause replied:
               "Yes, Jupiter, I acknowledge that I am all you say; and being such as I am, I feel that I am not worthy that God should work a miracle in my behalf. My boy is dead—dead; but I have at least saved his name in some measure from reproach by the falsehood I prevailed upon myself to utter. That was all I could do for him now; but oh! if I could only bring him back to life again, I would bury my pride and sacrifice half—nay, the whole of my fortune to save him from the punishment he had incurred."
               "Is you in ra'al airnest, Marse Judge?" asked the negro, solemnly. "Have de debbil gone out'n yer heart o' stone, an' lef' it ready for some human feelin' to git inter it an' make it soft an' forgivin'? Ef it have, mebbe—mebbe dat myraccle will be did for you."
               There was earnestness and deep emotion expressed in the tones of his voice, and his master regarded him with sorrowful amazement, as he replied:
               "The genuine anguish I feel no one but you could doubt, Jupiter. Look at me—bowed down, broken in spirit to that degree that I ask sympathy from my unlettered slave. I, whose lofty pride led me to commit this crime sooner than see my son dragged into a public court and tried for his life. Oh! Jupiter, I am so miserable this night, that if doom would also overtake me, I should welcome the messenger of Fate as the best friend that could be sent me."
               The old negro drew a long breath, and after a pause said:
               "I is glad dat yer brought down to feel for others, Marse Judge; but ef you'll listen to me, I'll soon prove to you dat dere's no need of axin' de ebissary to sen' arter you yet awhile. Are you sho dat you wish Marse Leon was alive agin?"
               The Judge regarded him sorrowfully.
               "Poor old Jupiter, I believe you have lost your senses, but nothing will blunt mine," he bitterly said.
               "No I haint—my senses aint gone yit, caze I's got a good use for 'em jes' now. Look thar!" and the negro pointed with dilating eyes to the face of Leon Ashley, on which a faint tinge of color began to appear. The locked lips seemed to tremble, and the eyelids quivered as if about to open upon the world again.
               The Judge started up, and his gray hair seemed to rise upon his head; he gasped:
               "Great God, I thank thee! he that was dead is alive again, and this damning sin is lifted from my soul."
               He sunk down, grasping the hand of his son, who seemed to relapse into insensibility again.
               The negro bent over his master and said:
               "You'll help to bring him roun' again, an' you won't do dat dreffle thing no mo'. Since de Good Man have given him back to you, you'll let him live."
               "Yes—yes; only bring him to life, and I will do all I can to save him. He shall escape and seek safety in a foreign land. Only bring back life to him, Jupiter, and I shall forever bless you."
               "Dar—dat's nuff; I don' b'lieve you'll do dat ere wickedness again. Come help me to take him out'n dis coffin, caze de poor boy'd die outright ef he come to hisself an' foun' dat he were in sich a thing as dat."
               The Judge seemed endued with sudden energy; he arose, aided Jupiter to lift the form of his son, and place it on his bed. He chafed the chill hands, sought remedies from his medicine chest, and in half an hour the two had the satisfaction of seeing animation return, and Leon uttered ed a few disjointed sentences, which sounded to the ears of his father as the sweetest music he had ever heard.
               His respiration soon became easy, but he again fell off in a deep sleep, seemingly unconscious of what had been done to restore the circulation to his benumbed frame.
               The Judge examined his condition, and, drawing a deep breath, said:
               "I believe he will recover now; but how his system threw off the effects of the quantity of laudanum he swallowed, I cannot comprehend. There was enough in the bottle to destroy two lives. Oh! thank God! thank God! that my cruel purpose has been thwarted! I thought I had strength for what I undertook, but I now feel that I am as weak as the feeblest of mankind."
               "Hi! hi!" chuckled old Jupiter. "It's a blessed thing dat you 'skivered dat, Marse Judge. But I mus' tell you dat nex' to God, you's got to thank ole Jupe dat you aint a fellin yerself, and de wuss kind o' one; for who but you'd a thought o' takin' de life o' yer own born chile?
               "I s'pected dat you meant to make him drink dat ere pizen stuff, an' I poured out more'n half de lodomy, an' filled it up wi' soot an' water mixed together. I knowed dat 'nuff was left to make Marse Leon sleep like one dat was dead; but I trusted to de Good Man to keep him from dying outright. I was mortial feared dat dose men 'ud git nigh 'nuff to find out dat he were only in a sleep what looked mightily like death; but dey was so shocked and scared like, dat dere was little danger o' dat."
               To the old negro's surprise, his master here grasped his hand, and spoke with deep emotion:
               "You are a better man than I am, Jupe. We have grown old together, and until this night I looked on you as vastly my inferior. I no longer do so, for you have been more faithful to me than I have been to myself. You have saved me from remorse that must have blighted the few years I may have to spend on earth, and I must do something to prove my gratitude to you. From this hour I grant you your freedom, and the enjoyment of an annual sum of money which will support you in comfort."
               "Well, well—we'll see 'bout dat, Marse Judge," replied the black philosopher. "I's too ole now to care much 'bout freedom, an' as to de money, ole Jupe's got nyther wife nor chile, an' he aint got much use for it, I reckin."
               "It shall be yours, at all events, whenever you choose to claim it, Jupiter."
               "Yes, I un'stan's dat, sir, an' I's much obleeged; but I's thinkin' 'bout suffin else jes' now. Ef Marse Leon sleeps off de 'fects of de lodomy, an' ef you's in dread 'bout gettin' him off safe, I reckin you an' I has a good deal to do to shet up people's moufs an' throw dust in deir eyes."
               "Yes, I know that," replied the Judge, looking around him as if just waking from a dream. "There must be a funeral, and we must find something to fill up this coffin with. I see—I understand. I will just take another look at the lad again to feel sure that he is doing well."
               He bent over the bed, felt the pulse of the heavy sleeper, ascertained that it beat regularly, though feebly, and then, with a prayer of thanksgiving in his heart, turned to attend to the duty before him.
               The rough coffin had been manufactured by the black carpenter on the plantation, for the stricken father thought all pomp out of place in consigning to the earth one who had perished as he believed his son had. No one save himself and Jupiter was awake in that small household, and they both felt perfectly sure of completing without being observed the deception which had now become necessary.
               The old negro whispered:
               "We'll jes' lock up de do', an' take de key, marster, while we go to de wood pile and bring a big chunk o' wood to fill up dat ere thing. I's sorry to ax you to do sich a thing as dis, sir, but it's too heavy for me to manage by myself."
               "Of course I shall assist you, Jupiter. Come—the night wanes, and we must complete our preparations before the servants are stirring."
               With a lingering, backward glance toward the bed, the father left the room, carefully locking the door behind him. After a few moments' absence, he and his sable companion returned, bearing between them a large log of wood, which was speedily wedged in the empty coffin in such a manner as to prevent it from rolling about. Then the lid was securely screwed down, and the coffin carried into the hall and placed upon the table. With all sense of uneasiness removed from his mind, Jupiter now coiled himself up in a corner, and fell into a sleep scarcely less heavy than that of him whose life his cunning had saved.
               Judge Ashley could not sleep, so he sat beside the bed, with his eyes fixed on the face of his rescued son, and for the first time for many years he earnestly and fervently prayed to be made a better and more merciful man.
               The hours of anguish spent beside his son when he believed he had forced him into eternity with all his unrepented sins upon his head, had left their indelible impress on both mind and body. His hair, already gray, had visibly whitened during that fearful period of suffering, and he now looked like a broken down old man.
               Leon slept on, occasionally moaning as if in pain; and at such moments, his father bent over him with an expression of vivid anxiety upon his features, fearing that he was not really saved from the ruthless doom he had awarded him.
               The hours dragged slowly on, and in the deep silence of the night Judge Ashley was trying in his own mind to settle on the best course to preserve the secret of his son's existence from the knowledge of the world.
               It had now become almost as vital to himself as to Leon that his escape from death should not be known, for he could not endure the thought that others should become aware of the deception to which he had become a party.
               He readily acquiesced in the conviction that his son must seek a foreign shore, and under an assumed name lose his identity as Leon Ashley. He felt no unwillingness to part from him, for never again could confidence or cordial intercourse exist between them. Leon had forfeited all claim to them by his recent conduct, and the proud father found it easier to give him up altogether than to retain him near him, even if it had been possible to do so.
               Before day dawned, he had resolved on the course of action he would pursue, and at length exhausted nature demanded its tribute of repose. His head sunk upon the pillow on which the pale face of his son rested, and the overwrought father slept; slept but to renew in dreams the terrible scenes through which he had lately passed, and at length he started up bathed in cold perspiration, his hair bristling with horror, for he had dreamed that he was about to be executed for the murder of his son, which, by some inexplicable means, had become known.
               When consciousness returned, he recoiled with scarcely less affright from the large, black eyes of Leon, which were wide open, and fixed on him with an expression of dread and loathing that chilled him to the soul.
               His first impulse was to grasp the pallid and nerveless hand that lay upon the coverlet, and utter an audible thanksgiving for the restoration of Leon; but the faint effort made by him to avoid his touch caused Judge Ashley ley to draw back in his turn, and as he looked upon the living face of the son he had so passionately mourned as dead, all the pride and hardness of his nature returned.
               The eyes that looked into each other held a menace, not the tender light of reconciliation; and the bitter curl on the lip of the younger man showed that he was repressing the accusation which arose to them.
               The Judge spoke in a hard tone:
               "I would have given doom to you, Leon, but Jupiter saved me from the crime by a ruse which I have forgiven him. I have granted him your life, but the belief on my part that you were really dead, enabled me to practise a deception which will prove your salvation."
               "I know—I know," feebly replied the young man. "While you slept, I woke and found Jupiter standing by the bedside with nourishment for me. After he had administered it, he explained to me how I awoke on earth, and not in the terrible Hades to which your harshness had condemned me. Judge Ashley, only in your judicial character can I ever again recognize you, for in my case you laid aside the tenderness of the parent for the sternness of the Judge. I can never forgive you for the agony of those hours which I believed to be my last on earth."
               The face of the Judge grew sterner as he listened, and he haughtily replied:
               "Then we stand on equal ground, for I can never forgive nor forget the disgrace you have brought upon my name. I will conceal you here till you are strong enough to travel; and then furnish you with money to make your escape to Europe under a feigned name. An annual sum sufficient for your support shall be paid to the address you furnish me with, but beyond that, there need be no further intercourse between us."
               "That will be quite satisfactory to me," replied Leon, with an expression almost of exultation in his eyes; "that is, it will be, if you redeem your pledge to receive and provide handsomely for my daughter."
               "I have once given you my word with regard to the child, and you well know that I never recede from a promise," was the frigid reply. "She shall come hither, and if I can forgive the suffering her father has caused me, she may, in time, become the solace of my broken life."
               Leon was not touched by these words. He was yet too bitter and resentful for all he had lately gone through to feel compassion for his father. Besides, he was intensely selfish, and the change in the old man's appearance touched no remorseful chord in his nature.
               He now regarded his father as his bitterest foe, and in his heart there was no forgiveness for the condemnation he had passed upon him; for the cruel ordeal through which he had forced him to pass.
               Jupiter had vainly dwelt on the anguish and remorse of his master; in place of softening the heart of Leon toward his father, he only wished it had been deeper and harder to bear; for he felt as if no suffering was adequate for the punishment of the harsh and unnatural conduct of which the Judge had been guilty.
               At this juncture Jupiter came in, bringing a waiter, on which his master's breakfast was arranged. Leon again drowsed off, incapable of remaining long awake, and the Judge drank the hot coffee placed before him; he scarcely touched the food, though he had been so long fasting as to feel faint for the want of it.
               The door between the room in which Leon lay and the office was locked, to prevent intrusion; and soon the tramp of gathering feet was heard in the next apartment. The overseer, attended by a few favorite slaves, came up from the quarters to assist in consigning their young master to the grave, which had been dug in a family burying-ground about half a mile from the house. Putting strong constraint upon himself, Judge Ashley went out and spoke to the overseer. His orders were briefly given and immediately acted on. A spring wagon had been brought to the door, on which the coffin was placed; the Judge declined accompanying it, and Jupiter, as chief mourner, followed the supposed remains of the heir of Ashurst.
               Scandalized by the father's apparent want of feeling, Gibbins, the overseer, drove the wagon at a funeral pace, and chanted a doleful hymn, in which he was joined with great unction by the blacks.
               A small enclosure, shaded by weeping willows, in which rested the mouldering remains of several generations of the Ashley family, was gained, and, with much solemnity, the tenantless coffin was consigned to its last resting-place. When the grave was closed, Gibbins knelt down, and devoutly prayed, for he was a Methodist, and an exhorter in their meetings, and he was scandalized that a human creature should be put away with so little ceremony, even if he had led a fast and rather disreputable life.
               Jupiter acted his part so well, that the truth was not suspected, and he returned in high glee to his master, to report to him the feeling prayer uttered by the overseer over the log of wood they had so cleverly substituted for Leon.
               The ingenuity of the old negro was much more severely taxed to account for the delicate food he required for the invalid; but as the Judge confined himself strictly to his own suit of apartments, he succeeded in hoodwinking the cook completely, though she greatly wondered that her master could eat so much when he was in such terrible trouble.
               The Judge confined himself to his library, in which there was a spring sofa, which he used as a couch, and gave up his own room to his son, till he was strong enough to take steps toward a removal. The quantity of laudanum Leon had swallowed seemed to have enervated his system to such a degree that it was several days before a complete reaction took place; but at the close of the fourth evening he felt himself as strong and well as ever he had been in his life.
               During this time he revolved the best chances of escape in his mind, and came to the resolution to disappear without having another interview with his father. The large sum of money he had already attempted to appropriate was still in the tower, and that he regarded as his own, since it had once been destined for his use.
               For present use this would suffice, but in the future he intended that his father should honor all the drafts he made upon him, or the world should learn the crime he had attempted against his son's life. With this dread hanging in terrorem over him, Leon believed that he could exact from him any sum he saw fit to demand, and he had no scruples of conscience to prevent him from using his power whenever his necessities might require it.
               Leon purposely concealed from Jupiter the improvement in his strength, and on the fourth night of his convalescence, after that faithful servitor was buried in sleep, he arose, dressed himself, and prepared for his departure.
               On the following morning, when the Judge was aroused from his broken slumbers to learn that his son was gone from him forever, there was one mighty pang of bereavement, and then he felt thankful that the long agony was over, and he prayed that he might make good his escape from the land of his birth.
               On examination, he found that the gold had also disappeared from the tower, and all that day he shut himself up in his chamber, refusing either food or drink, mourning in sackcloth and ashes over the degradation and desolation of his house.
               A week later a letter with the Baltimore post-mark came to him. It was directed in a feigned hand, and the contents were written in French, of which the following is a translation:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "BALTIMORE, June 26, 18—.
                           
                           "JUDGE ASHLEY:—Such sums of money as will be needed to settle the business we lately discussed, can be paid to the order of Leon Larne, to the Rothschilds in Paris, as it is my purpose to go thither very shortly.
                           "You perceive that I have adopted the name of my cousin, who, luckily for me, died in St. Croix not long ago. When he was in this country, the likeness between us was so remarkable that we were constantly mistaken for each other. I am a little fairer, but that can easily be remedied; and so confident am I of my disguise, that I shall not hurry myself to leave this country. I shall draw on you from Paris for such sums as I may need, and I have no fear that my bills will be dishonored."
                        
                     
                  
               
               That was all; not an expression of affection—not a hint of regret at this final parting. The settlement of money matters seemed the only one of which the writer thought; and in bitterness of soul the unhappy father felt that it had been better far for him if no olive branches had reared their youthful heads beneath his roof.
               He thought of his exiled daughter, but his heart had been too long hardened toward her to grow soft now, even if his darling son had deserted him under such terrible circumstances.
               He wrote to a lawyer in New York, and sent him the address given him by Hunter, with directions to seek out the child of Eva Weston, and if the mother was dead, to send it at once by a trusty nurse to Ashurst.
               Having done this, the desolate old man sat down in a kind of dumb stupor, to await the advent of his grand-daughter.
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               FURTHER SCHEMES OF VILLANY.
               WHILE these scenes were enacting at Ashurst, Grace Arden lay in her desolate home, vibrating between life and death.
               The fate of her brother had been incautiously communicated to her, though those around her were thoughtful enough to leave her to suppose that he had lost his life by drowning; the wound in his side, and the fact of a duel having taken place between Ernest and her recreant lover, was carefully concealed from her, for the shock of her brother's untimely fate, coming so soon after the abrupt termination of her dream of wedded bliss, proved too much for one strong neither in body or mind.
               The remains of Ernest were consigned to the tomb with every mark of respect, while she lay in her darkened room raving in wild delirium, calling constantly to Leon Ashley to return to her, and promising in most pathetic tones to forgive him all; to believe nothing to his disadvantage if he would only come back once more.
               Friends gathered around her, whose sympathies were deeply enlisted in her unmerited sufferings; every attention was lavished upon her; but in spite of all their efforts to cheer her, when the fever abated, and immediate danger was past, Miss Arden fell into a state of apathetic depression which caused those most deeply interested in her to fear for her sanity.
               As health returned, a silent melancholy, which it was believed might end in derangement, fastened upon her, and the physician who had attended upon her from her childhood, declared that she must be removed from the scene of her recent trials, and roused from the stupor that seemed creeping over all her faculties.
               But change of place, and contact with strangers, Grace nervously shrank from, and she entreated that she might only be left alone—that solitude was the only balm for her wounded heart.
               But Dr. Manton knew better, and he would not listen to her objections; he declared that too much for her was at stake to permit him to do so, and he insisted that she should visit the sea-shore at as early a season as possible.
               He wrote to an old friend of Miss Arden's mother, a widow lady of the name of Maitland, who he knew would be happy to take charge of the wealthy heiress and travel whithersoever her medical attendant thought best.
               Mrs. Maitland, who had a handsome daughter to marry off, eagerly grasped at the proposal; and it was settled that in the early part of August that lady should come to Arden Place, and remove the invalid with her to Cape May for the benefit of sea-bathing.
               There she seemed to revive slowly under the care lavished on her by the elder lady; but there was not much congeniality between her handsome and coquettish daughter and the half broken-hearted Grace.
               Augusta Maitland was in the first bloom of life and spirits; too full of the enjoyment and pleasures of youth to have much sympathy for the depressed invalid. She soon became a belle, and in her numerous engagements left the care of amusing Miss Arden entirely to her mother.
               The sea-air strengthened the body of the suffering girl, but the poor wandering mind groped more darkly every day after her lost happiness. Under other circumstances, the death of her young brother would have been a deep affliction to Grace Arden, but now it was completely overshadowed by the calamity which had so cruelly, and unexpectedly, shattered her earthly hopes.
               It was at last thought best to tell her that Leon Ashley was also dead; that he had met her brother in deadly combat, and received his death wound, though the fact that Ernest had perished through his agency was still withheld from her. She was left to suppose that he had committed suicide in a moment of remorse for the crime he had committed against her lover.
               Strange as it may seem, Grace felt as if her brother had expiated his great sin against herself in the only way left to him, for she felt that she could never have pardoned him for taking a life so precious to her as that of Leon Ashley. It was well that the grave should hide him from her reproaches, for she had no forgiveness in her heart for him who had raised his hand against the life of her idol.
               With all the morbid strength of her nature, she had loved her betrothed, and she clung to his memory with a mournful tenacity which bade defiance to time or consolation.
               Miss Arden possessed one talent which had been assiduously cultivated, and she had acquired much skill in the use of her pencil. Drawing was now the only employment that afforded her any interest, and it was melancholy to look over her portfolio and find in every leaf an unfinished head of Leon Ashley; for each day she commenced a new one, and threw it aside as lacking some trait of the original.
               One morning she was thus employed, when Augusta Maitland came into her room, and unceremoniously looking over her shoulder, said:
               "It is a great pity you will not come into the parlor, Grace, for there is a gentleman here who wonderfully resembles sembles this handsome head you have drawn. Besides, he is one of the most eloquent and agreeable of talkers."
               The pale, wistful face was turned toward her with some appearance of interest, and Grace asked:
               "What is the name of this gentleman, Augusta?"
               "He is a Mr. Larne, a dashing and wealthy planter from St. Croix. Oh! you do not know what a charming fellow he is!"
               "If he resembles the original of this, he must be all you say," replied Grace, with a sad smile. "I do not wish to go into the public parlor wearing my deep mourning, but I should be glad to have an opportunity of seeing this gentleman."
               "Perhaps we can manage it," replied Augusta, willing to give her a pleasure which would cost herself little trouble. "I will walk with him under your window this evening, for he has been my most devoted since he made his appearance at the Cape."
               A sudden tremor seized Miss Arden, and she sunk back upon her chair with a faint cry. She was sitting near an open window opposite which grew a rose-bush, and framed between the clustering branches she saw the face she had so yearned to behold once more gazing earnestly upon her. Believing it to be an apparition, she faintly said:
               "His ghost has come to upbraid me for even wishing to look on one who bears his likeness. Oh, Leon! Leon! are you indeed near me? Come to me—speak to me—tell me that you still love me!"
               Miss Maitland had seated herself, and before she could arise and rush to the window to see what had so deeply moved her companion, the face had disappeared, and poor Grace fell forward fainting.
               It was long before she showed any signs of returning animation, and then her mind seemed to those around her to wander. She insisted that the wraith of her dead lover had appeared before her; that it would not now be long before she should rejoin him in the land of spirits to which he had preceded her.
               Mrs. Maitland prescribed composing drops, and after taking them the hapless girl fell into a heavy slumber, which permitted her friends to leave her in charge of a waiting woman, while they dressed and joined in the festivities of the night.
               While adorning herself for conquest, Augusta said to her mother:
               "Mr. Larne seems deeply interested in the sad history of Grace. He has asked me so many questions about her, that, if she were more attractive, I should begin to be jealous of her. I intend to win this charming man myself, so she, and every one else, may stand aside."
               Her mother an ambitious, scheming woman, looked at her sparkling face, with its piquant expression and riant loveliness, and smilingly replied:
               "There is little danger of successful rivalry against you, Augusta; you are just the style of woman that men lose their senses about. As to poor Grace, she will never care to win another lover. If this Mr. Larne is as wealthy as is reported, you will do well to make sure of him."
               "Oh, mother, that sounds so business-like! and for the first time in my life I am inclined to be romantic. This young West Indiaman has certainly awakened feelings in my heart that are entirely new to me. If I can win him, I shall accept him for true love, and not on account of the wealth he is said to possess."
               "Don't be so sentimental, child, as to spoil all. That style of thing does not suit your sparkling beauty, and this new Antinous does not seem one to appreciate a love-lorn damsel."
               
               "Oh, I intend to make him think each phase of my humor more charming than that which preceded it," was the gay reply, as the speaker looked into her mirror with the assured conviction that such charms as hers would bring any man to her feet on whom she condescended to lavish her wiles.
               Augusta Maitland was indeed a very charming young creature. Her figure, slightly below the medium height, was supple and graceful as that of the panther; her complexion, of a soft creamy white, was brightened by the faintest tinge of color; her starry eyes flashed with spirit and mirth; her exquisite mouth and pearly teeth—her wealth of dark brown hair, soft and fine as silk, formed an ensemble as piquant as it was attractive.
               Added to these charms, she had a gay abandon of manner and a quickness of repartee which rendered her the cynosure of attraction in every company in which she appeared.
               She was now in her nineteenth year, and her mother had brought her to Cape May in the hope that she would there find some lover worthy to bear off all these perfections, for Mrs. Maitland was not rich, and the exacting wants of her dear Augusta had become so oppressive to her, that she was anxious to bestow her expensive darling on any suitable adorer who presented himself as a suitor for her hand.
               So Augusta Maitland adorned her lovely person for the conquest of Leon Ashley and went with a beating heart to join the first waltz which she had promised to dance with him.
               Ashley met her at the door of the ball-room, and with eager impressment insisted that she should waltz with no one save himself that night. They had known each other but four days, but in that brief time the mutual prepossession sion had almost assumed the phase of passion, and careless of consequences—heedless of what had brought him there, Larne pursued his usual course of self-indulgence.
               In all his previous flirtations he had never before been so completely enthralled as he now was by the fascinating Augusta, and as she floated around the large ball-room with her head resting upon his breast, her form held in his wreathing clasp, he breathed the sweetest flatteries in her ear, and the subtle poison entered her heart as it had done into those of many before her.
               That night completed the conquest of Miss Maitland's affections.—Ashley professed to adore her, though there was no word of marriage in all his tender nonsense. They finally withdrew from the heat and glare of the ball-room to one of the long piazzas which was in a great measure deserted. Augusta promenaded there till a late hour, listening to the eloquent vows of Larne, charmed and bewildered by the new phase of life which seemed to be opening before her.
               He finally asked:
               "Is the friend who is here with you too ill, or only too much depressed to appear in public? I have heard many inquiries made about her, for she is said to be the heiress to a large estate."
               "Poor Grace! It is very true that she is enormously rich, but her money is of very little use to her. Her health and spirits are both broken by the trials she has lately gone through."
               "What trials? Pray enlighten me. I am a stranger here, and cannot be expected to understand your allusion."
               "Oh, I thought every one had heard the story, it is so dreadful and notorious. She was actually married to a son of Judge Ashley, of Maryland; but the ceremony was scarcely completed, when a stranger burst among the company, and declared that young Ashley had a wife living. Imagine the scene that followed. But that was not the worst; that night her brother and her bridegroom met in the grounds around Arden Place, and both fell in the duel that took place. Since that time Grace has been more like one demented than a sane woman. She sits for hours looking at vacancy, and it is often impossible to arouse her to what is passing around her."
               "This is a tragic story, indeed! But this unfortunate girl must execrate the memory of him who wronged her so deeply, and then destroyed her brother?"
               "One would naturally think so; but her infatuation about Leon Ashley is so great that she refuses to listen to a word against him. She cherishes his memory with fanatical affection, and if one could read her heart, I believe that even the death of her brother, caused by the wound inflicted upon him, would be excused if she knew it; but she does not. She has been led to believe that Ernest Arden perished by suicide."
               Ashley started, and quickly asked:
               "Why was that done?"
               "Because her mental anguish was so great that her physician believed, if the whole truth was told, the shock would destroy her mind. I do not think myself that she has much to destroy; she is a quiet and patient creature, but dreadfully stupid!"
               The listener half smiled, and presently he abruptly asked:
               "Do you think that Miss Arden grieves more over the death of her lover than over that of her brother?"
               "I am convinced that she does, for she spends her days in drawing likenesses of Leon Ashley, and her portfolio is filled with them. By the way, they look wonderfully like you, Mr. Larne, and I think poor Grace must have seen you this afternoon as you passed her window, for she grew wild, declared that she had seen Leon Ashley's ghost, and fainted dead away. When she came to herself again, Ma was obliged to give her a composing draught, and we left her sleeping off its effects."
               The vivid interest with which this revelation was listened to, was concealed from Miss Maitland by the obscurity in which the two stood, for a passing cloud swept over the moon at that opportune moment, and screened her companion's face from observation.
               After a pause, he jestingly said:
               "If Miss Arden's lover would only arise from the dead, he would be tenderly welcomed by her, in spite of his unlucky encounter with her brother."
               "I believe he would; indeed, I am sure of it, if it were not for the first wife. She would stand in the way, you know; the marriage was not a legal one, though poor Grace attaches much sanctity to the flimsy tie which the law does not recognize as binding on her."
               "Indeed! Then she must be a most romantic person."
               "Only a little touched here," and Augusta placed her finger significantly upon her brow. "I should not wonder if Grace Arden ended her days in a lunatic asylum."
               The probability thus suggested threw Ashley into a deep reverie. The possibilities of the future were slowly unrolling themselves before him, and he aroused himself from his pre-occupation to become more tender and lover-like to the fair woman leaning upon his arm than he ever had been before.
               Entranced, bewildered, carried away by the sudden and violent passion which had seized upon her whole being, the gay and laughter-loving Augusta Maitland listened to his seductive flatteries as if every hope in life had suddenly been suspended on the words that fell from those false lips.
               A smile of triumph wreathed them, as the thought came to him that no woman had ever yet resisted the spell he wished to cast over her, and this last and most brilliant conquest was the crowning one of all.
               Augusta Maitland had much in common with himself, and Ashley intuitively felt that this woman was the true wife for such a man as he felt himself to be. She would not judge him harshly, and she would love with passion equal to his own; she would help him to extricate himself from such scrapes as his want of principle might lead him into, and then laugh and rejoice with him over his escape. What were his ultimate intentions with reference to her he, as yet, hardly knew himself; but he was resolved on one thing: he would make Augusta love him with all the fiery strength of her nature, and leave the future to work out itself.
               They promenaded till a late hour of the night, and Ashley then left her at the door of her mother's apartment, with a promise to call on her at an early hour on the following morning.
               The moon was shining brilliantly, and too much excited to sleep, Ashley went down to the beach, and walked to and fro, planning, scheming, and arranging in his own mind the safest method of letting Grace Arden know that he was yet living—that the dashing islander and Leon Ashley were one.
               He had ventured to Cape May to open a communication with her, if he could obtain any assurance that his presence would not be odious to her; this he had adroitly gained from Augusta, and fully aware of how weak Miss Arden was with regard to himself, he felt almost sure of the game he intended to play. He felt quite secure in the disguise he had adopted, for the cousin whose name he had assumed had bequeathed him his seal ring, with several other articles bearing his initials, and in his exodus from Ashurst he had been very careful to bring them with him. The real Larne had been partially educated in the United States, but had returned home the previous spring, to die of one of the fevers incident to the warm climate in which his property was situated.
               There was little probability that any one found at a northern watering place would have heard of Larne's death, or be able to detect the impostor who had taken his name. One was fair, and the other dark, but the color of the eyes and hair was the same, and Leon's complexion was easily tinged to the olive hue of that of his deceased relative.
               After walking till he was wearied, and his scheming brain aching for repose, Ashley turned toward the hotel to seek his room. As he stepped upon the piazza, a young man, who sat alone smoking a cigar, and looking at the effect of the moonlight upon the water, suddenly started forward, exclaiming:
               "Good heavens! who are you? 'It is the witching hour of night, when ghosts do walk,' and I am constrained to believe that you are that of Leon Ashley, although you look solid enough to be real, and I know that he is dead."
               Brought suddenly face to face with one of his former class-mates, who evidently recognized him, his self-possession did not desert him. He bowed ceremoniously and said:
               "Your mistake is not strange, sir, since that unfortunate young man and myself were first-cousins, and so nearly alike as to have been often mistaken for twin brothers. The untimely fate of poor Leon filled me with sorrow, for with many faults, he also possessed many excellent traits of character."
               "You may say that," said the collegian, "for except where women were concerned, he was a trump. But it's deuced strange that your voice sounds exactly like his, too. I could almost swear that Ashley is standing before me, and speaking with me."
               "Yet, if you will go to Ashurst, the residence of my uncle, you will be shown the grave of my cousin, and learn the tragic story of his fate. To-morrow, when you see me by a clearer light, you will perceive that I am many shades darker than your friend was, though, in other respects, we have been considered remarkably alike."
               "And with good cause, too! By Jove! I never saw anything like it, never!"
               "Will you be good enough, sir, to inform me to whom I have the pleasure of speaking?"
               "Oh, excuse me; I forgot that we are really strangers. I am Tom Parker, and I was in the same class at Yale with your cousin."
               "I am happy to make your acquaintance, Mr. Parker, and I shall be glad to learn something of my cousin's college career from you."
               Parker shook his head.
               "So far as books were concerned, Leon did well enough, for he took the shine off all the rest of us. It was no trouble to him to learn anything, and he had so much the more leisure for playing off his pranks. Twice he was rusticated, and both times he amused his leisure by flirting with a pretty girl; the last time, the young lady proved the sharpest, for somehow she induced that gay deceiver to marry her. It was that unlucky marriage which led to the tragedy so lately enacted in Maryland. Ah! if they had only known as much as I do now, all that misery might have been saved!"
               Parker stopped, and the listener experienced the keenest desire to know what could so effectually have turned the course of the late events, but he carelessly said:
               "The result naturally followed the cause. Of course, young Arden was compelled to fight the man who had offered such an insult to his sister."
               "Yes—but they do say that the young lady would have forgiven almost any insult Leon Ashley could have offered her; and it is certain that if the poor fellow were still living he could claim Grace Arden as his lawfully wedded wife."
               Larne almost cried out at this assertion, and he trembled so violently that he could scarcely stand. He managed to control his voice sufficiently to ask:
               "How can that possibly be? The girl he first married was living when the second union took place."
               "That was the mistake they all made. I am just from New York, where I saw Eva Weston's cousin, James Hunter, and heard the whole story from his lips. He went to Maryland in pursuit of her husband, leaving the poor wife so ill that there was little chance that she would long prove a burden to any one. After he went away she seemed to get better, and was able to sit up a few hours every evening, till a very strange thing happened."
               Larne was listening with vivid intentness, and he vaguely muttered:
               "Yes—yes; what happened then? how was it singular?"
               "You shall hear. Mrs. Ashley had talked more than usual with her nurse, who was trying to persuade her to retire to bed as twilight was deepening in the room. Suddenly she cried out:
               "'There is Leon's bride!—I see her with her shining robe, and the crown of pearls upon her brow. Oh, Leon—my husband—they are decking her for you, and I am forgotten—deserted!'"
               "Her voice arose with each word she uttered, but it was quenched by a sudden rush of blood to her mouth. The hemorrhage could not be arrested, and in half an hour she was dead in spite of all their efforts to save her. On his return, Hunter inquired the precise hour of her decease, and satisfied himself that she had died exactly fifteen minutes before the marriage ceremony commenced which made Miss Arden poor Leon's wife. Hunter now bitterly regrets that he went to Maryland at all, since it did his cousin no good, and ended so tragically for all concerned."
               Ashley had listened breathlessly to this revelation, and he could have shouted aloud for joy at the power over Grace Arden's fate which was thus placed in his hands. He knew that she was a rigid member of that church which does not tolerate divorce, and he felt assured that her tender conscience would not permit her to repudiate the tie that bound her to himself, if he could once convince her of its legality.
               Satisfied of this, Ashley knew that her adoring love for himself would accomplish the rest, and place her future entirely at his mercy. Thus he saw the way clear to grasp the fortune he so ardently coveted, and the hint thrown out by Augusta Maitland on that night induced him to believe that he could easily rid himself of poor Grace after her wealth had been secured.
               The treatment she would receive from him as his wife would not be likely to restore the tottering mind, and once safe in a madhouse, he would seek a legal separation which would satisfy himself and Augusta, and make that enchanting syren the partner of his life, the sharer of the fortune so nefariously gained.
               But Ashley was not troubled with many scruples of conscience, and he smiled serenely as he heard Parker talk on, without accurately comprehending what he was saying.
               At length he bade him good night, and retired to think over the new phase of his affairs in the solitude of his own room.
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               A STRANGE DESIGN.
               HUNTER reached New York the second day after the scene at Arden Place, in which he had played so conspicuous a part. To return to his forsaken Eva was now his first wish, that he might give her the assurance that her child would be acknowledged and provided for by its grandfather. But the scene he had witnessed must be concealed from her, for the knowledge of Leon's turpitude, he felt assured, would prove her death-blow.
               Alas! the precaution was needless. When he reached the house in which he had left his unfortunate cousin, he was stunned by the announcement of her sudden death. He had not even the poor consolation of seeing her cold remains; for, uncertain how long he would be abroad, the woman in whose charge he had left Eva thought it best to have her buried without delay; and a dreary looking mound of fresh earth was pointed out to him in the neighboring graveyard, as the last resting-place of her whose treachery to himself had been so bitterly expiated.
               In the evening twilight he sat down beside this and reviewed all their past. He forgave her for her desertion of himself; but with her, he felt that he had lost his only hope of leading a steady and reputable life.
               For her sake he would have laid aside the erratic habits which would henceforth make him a wanderer on the face of the earth: a seeker after his own pleasure alone. Hunter ter had no calling but that of a gambler, for he had relinquished the study of his profession; no taste for any other pursuit; and in place of repenting of the evil of his ways beside that solitary grave, he only hardened himself by the thought that now his career was of little consequence to any one save himself. He would use his life as he pleased, and no loving, wifely heart would be wounded by his future actions.
               So, steeped to the lips in the bitter waters of desolation, he arose from his sad vigil as twilight deepened around him, and slowly returned to the house in which lay the motherless infant.
               As he drew near the house, the feeble wail of the child was heard through the open window, and he bitterly muttered:
               "It is a pity the creature could not have perished with its mother. That hard old man will give money for its maintenance; but when did mere gold purchase the care and tenderness a young child needs? I can't give it to her, for I have something else to attend to; and, besides, the daughter of Leon Ashley is not exactly the charge I should care to burden myself with. She might grow up to be as faithless as her mother, and as treacherous as her father."
               He went in and found Mrs. Sims, the mistress of the house, endeavoring to hush the infant to sleep; but the little creature seemed to be suffering, and the faint plaining moan she uttered had an inexpressible pathos in it to one aware of her recent bereavement.
               Hunter looked down upon the small white face with a feeling of compassion he could not repress, and asked:
               "What is the matter with her? Hadn't I better go for the doctor if she is sick?"
               "Oh dear no, sir! The doctor would do nothing for the poor motherless creature. She wants a good nurse, for the food I prepare for her doesn't seem to agree with her. It's the best cow's milk, but some children don't seem to thrive on that. I might dose her with paregoric; but her poor mother wouldn't let a drop of it be given to her while she lived, and I hesitate to give the nasty stuff to the little thing now she's gone."
               "Pray don't give her such a poison as that, Mrs. Sims. If the child needs a nurse she must have one, for money is no object, compared with her safety and comfort. That little atom, Mrs. Sims, which lies squalling in your arms, is the grand-daughter of one of the wealthiest men in Maryland, and may yet become the heiress of all he possesses."
               The eyes of the listener opened wide with astonishment, and she cast them on the baby with a bewildered expression, as she said:
               "La! sakes! you don't mean to say that rich people let that poor young creetur die here by herself, when they could ha' taken care of her theirselves. How did it happen that she was left here all alone; and what's become of the father of this child? He was fair spoken enough when he came here to get boarding with me for his wife."
               "There was an elopement and a private marriage, Mrs. Sims, which, until lately, was never acknowledged. But now the poor mother is dead, the child will be properly taken care of by her father's family. If you know of any one who can be procured as a nurse for little Evelyn, I shall be glad to employ her in that capacity, and she will be sure of liberal wages."
               Mrs. Sims seemed to reflect a few moments, and then she said:
               "Well—let me see. There's nobody about here that has a baby as young as this one, and most of the women folks have so many young ones of their own that they could hardly take in a strange child."
               Hunter shook his head.
               "That would not suit me at all. The child must remain under my protection till her grandfather has made some inquiries concerning the marriage of her parents, which will be satisfactorily answered. Then Judge Ashley will probably send hither, and have her removed to some place where she can be under his own eyes, if he does not receive her at Ashurst. If you can obtain a nurse who will consent to accompany the infant to Maryland, you may offer her any price she chooses to ask."
               After pondering a few moments, Mrs. Sims said, a little doubtfully:
               "There is a person stopping down at Jake Hinton's, a kind of cousin of his, that his wife will be mighty glad to get rid of, I'm thinking. Not that there is anything wrong about Mrs. Wilde, but Martha Hinton is so stingy that she grudges her what she eats, I do believe. Mrs. Wilde is so poor that she has no other place to go to, and maybe she'll agree to go out as nurse, sooner than stay there much longer; but she wasn't born to such things, even if she is Jake Hinton's cousin."
               "Mrs. Wilde is a widow, then, with a child to take care of?"
               "Yes. She's got a baby a month older than this one, and if the money is all right, I hardly think she will refuse to come here at once. Seeing as the child is a great trouble to me, I'd take Mrs. Wilde in the house, if I could get shet of its crying."
               "See if Mrs. Wilde will come, then, provided she is a healthy woman."
               "Oh, as to that, she is as blooming as a rose, and her baby is a perfect picture of beauty. This here mite aint anything to look at by the side of little Maggie Wilde."
               "It is settled, then, Mrs. Sims, that this young woman shall become Evelyn Ashley's nurse. Offer her her own terms to be a mother to this helpless little creature, for a season, at least."
               "Well, sir, if this young one will ever get to sleep, I'll go down to Hinton's at once, and see what I can do about it."
               "You must be sure to bring her back with you," was the parting injunction of Hunter, as he left the room, and went into that lately occupied by Eva. He sat down in her chair, and fell into a sad reverie, which was presently interrupted by the landlady coming in to place the sleeping infant in its cradle. She glanced toward Hunter and said:
               "The poor lady was sitting there when she took that last spell that killed her. She was getting so much stronger, I thought, that I let her sit up; but when night fell she wouldn't have a light brought in, and neither would she agree to lie down again. I think she must have kind o' dozed off sitting in her chair, for all at once she cried out in such a pitiful voice about seeing a bride with shining robes and a pearl crown on her head, and she cried out:
               "'Leon—Leon—you have deserted me for her!'
               "Them was the last distinct words the poor thing ever spoke, for the blood poured out of her mouth, and before the doctor could get here she was dead. She died on the twenty-fourth of June, at eight o'clock in the evening, for I mind the clock striking just as we laid her on the bed, with all the life gone out of her pretty face."
               The listener asked, in irrepressible excitement:
               "Are you quite sure that she died so early in the evening? I understood you to say that poor Eva departed on the night of the twenty-fourth."
               
               "So she did die after the candles was lit, and that's what I call night. But what flusters you so much, Mr. Hunter?"
               "Oh, nothing—nothing. I was surprised, that is all. There—the child seems comfortable enough now; I will remain near her while you go for the nurse."
               Mrs. Sims fidgetted over the baby a little, and then left the room. Hunter arose, paced the floor in an excited manner, and then sat down beside a table on which writing materials lay, and dashed off the following letter, which was dispatched to Maryland that night:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "HOBOKEN, June 27, 18—.
                           
                           "JUDGE ASHLEY:—I write these lines to remove from your mind any dread of punishment to your son for his late conduct, and also to express my deep regret for the precipitate action on my part which has caused so much misery.
                           "On my return to this place, I found the unhappy wife of Leon Ashley dead and buried, and I have ascertained that she breathed her last on the night of your son's last marriage about fifteen or twenty minutes before the ceremony could have commenced.
                           "Thus the marriage I declared illegal was not so, and Miss Arden is the lawful wife of Leon Ashley. In the hope that this information will heal the breach I so recklessly made, and that forgiveness and reconciliation may ensue, I write this to you.
                           "The motherless infant is still under my care, and will so remain until you have signified your wishes with reference to her.
                           
                              Respectfully,
                              "JAMES HUNTER."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               He had just finished writing, when he heard the voice of Mrs. Sims speaking in the adjoining room:
               "The gentleman is in there, Mrs. Wilde, and so is the child. He'll be wanting to see you himself before engaging you, so I'll jest knock at the door, and let him know that we've come in."
               Hunter arose, and stepped into the outer room. A young woman, in faded mourning and a shabby bonnet, stood in the centre of the floor, holding a sleeping infant in her arms. She made a slight inclination of her head as he appeared, and then waited for Mrs. Sims to present her in due form.
               "This is Mrs. Wilde, Mr. Hunter, and she thinks she can undertake to look after the young one here, at least till her friends take her away. Her own baby is a quiet, healthy little creature, and she'll have the most of her time to 'tend to the other."
               "Yes, sir, I can promise that, and I am glad of the chance to make something for myself even in this humble way, for now I have no one to look to to take care of me and baby. I am a widow, sir, and my husband was lost at sea before my child was born."
               The voice of the speaker was soft and refined in its tones, her pronunciation that of an educated woman, and Hunter saw that she was young and exceedingly attractive in her appearance. He was at once prepossessed in her favor, for, like most other men, he was easily interested in the possessor of a pretty face. He at once said:
               "I am glad that I can offer you a liberal compensation for your services, Mrs. Wilde, and perhaps enable you to do something better in the future for yourself and child."
               "Thank you, sir. I—I feel grateful for your kindness, for of late I have had little shown me. I have been in a wretched way since poor Frank's death, and I had almost given up the hope of getting anything to do, for no one is willing to employ a woman burdened with a young child."
               She was telling a plain story in a straightforward manner ner, and the heart of the listener was touched. He saw before him a young and helpless woman, with an infant to take care of; no means of living, no home, and apparently nearly destitute of friends, and he was filled with compassion for her forlorn condition. He took out his pocket-book, and said:
               "To clinch the bargain, I will pay you a month's wages in advance, Mrs. Wilde. Your young charge will certainly remain that length of time under your care; if she flourishes, and you have no ties to retain you here, I think it likely that those who remove her will be glad to engage you to accompany her to her future home."
               "Oh, sir! that would be a great thing for me. I shall be glad to get away from this place, for I have known nothing but sorrow since I came here. I will do the best I can by the little girl, and you can see for yourself what good care I take of my own child."
               As she finished speaking, she uncovered the head of her sleeping cherub, and held it toward him with a smile of tender pride curling her red lips. Hunter glanced down, and even his careless eye was arrested by the loveliness of the infant's face. She looked like a slumbering angel, with the soft smile of innocence and peace resting on her sweet mouth. The clear rosiness of her complexion indicated perfect health; and the young man said:
               "If you only do as good a part by my little waif as you seem to have done by your own baby, I shall be perfectly satisfied, Mrs. Wilde; and I shall certainly recommend you to be retained as her nurse."
               "Thank you, Mr. Hunter; I will do my best; but where shall I have to go if I remain with the baby, sir?"
               "Very far from here probably, though I cannot positively say. You may have to go to Maryland, or Judge Ashley may prefer keeping his grandchild at a distance from himself. You would not object to going south, I suppose, if you could obtain a comfortable home by doing so? If the Judge has the little girl removed to Ashurst, he will require some competent person to take charge of her for several years to come. If you prove yourself equal to the task, perhaps he will retain you permanently."
               "I shall not object to going anywhere, sir, where I can find bread and a respectable shelter for myself and my little one. The farther from this place the better, for I have suffered so bitterly here that I never wish to see the place again when I once get away."
               "You may set your mind at rest on that score, for if the child does well under your care, I think there is little doubt that those that send for her will be only too glad to retain your services. But I am detaining you from your new duties, and I hear an ominous squall from the next room. I hope you will not find your two babies more than you can manage."
               "There is no fear of that, sir; I am fond of children, and somehow I have a knack of getting along with them. Poor little dear! it cries as if it is suffering."
               She passed into the chamber, placed her own babe upon the bed, and lifted her new charge in her arms. The child looked pinched and half starved; Mrs. Sims, who had never had any children of her own, had dressed it in an awkward and uncomfortable manner, and the new nurse half smiled as she loosened its clothing and proceeded to prepare it for a good night's rest. In half an hour the infant was lying in her lap, perfectly contented, with its large dark eyes fixed on the light of the candle.
               Mrs. Sims came in and sat down near her.
               "I declare, now, it is mighty strange, but that baby wouldn't do one thing but squall when I had her in my arms, and the thickened milk I fed her with she just made a pint of throwing all over herself and me too. I had to wash her off half a dozen times a day; but she lies there as quiet as a lamb."
               "You probably fed her too much, Mrs. Sims; she seems very happy now, and I think she will thrive with me. If I can only secure the situation of nurse to her, I shall be very, very thankful."
               "Yet it seems to me, Mrs. Wilde, that you've been raised to something better than the employment of a servant. Tell me now, if you are really Jake Hinton's cousin, for I have had my doubts about it. Such as you don't belong to his folks, I guess."
               A deep flush swept over the fair face of the younger woman, and after a struggle with herself, she said:
               "I am aware that many have doubted the relationship, because they see that I have been better brought up than Mr. Hinton. But in this country that is nothing. One branch of the same family rises in the world, and another goes down. My father was able to give me a good education, and something more than that, if he had not been unfortunate. Both he and my husband perished on the same voyage—the little property I could claim was spent before the birth of my child, and that is the reason why I am so destitute as to be willing to accept any honest employment which will enable me to take care of her respectably."
               "Well, child, you speak so fair and straightforward that I can't help believing in you, in spite of the talk of Martha Hinton. But you're a deal too young and too pretty to be knocking around the world with nobody to take care of you."
               "That may be true enough," replied Mrs. Wilde, with a faint smile, "but since fate denies me everything but life and health, what can I do but go out into the world and take such chances as come to me. It is a hard life, Mrs. Sims, but such as it is, I have been able to find no better."
               "Well, well, my dear, I do hope that the baby will get to be so fond of you that you will have to go with her to her new home. Mr. Hunter says she will be a great lady some of these days, for her father's family are grandees down South. It will be a great thing for you if you can only get on the right side of her people."
               "Perhaps so," replied the widow, absently. "Look at these two children now, Mrs. Sims, and think to what a different lot they are born. My little angel is far more lovely than this pale little creature, and, to look at them, a stranger would think her the heiress to all this grandeur in place of this wee being. But Maggie's fate will be like my own, I suppose; to be a poor drudge for those born to brighter fortunes."
               "You shouldn't talk that way, Mrs. Wilde; God puts us all where he thinks we ought to be, and if he saw fit to make your child a pauper and this one a millionaire, it's all for the best for both of 'em here and hereafter."
               "How can you believe that?" asked the young mother, with some bitterness. "In her poverty, will not the beauty of my child be a snare to her? Look at her—if she matures according to her present promise, she will be that rare being, a perfectly beautiful woman. Is it not a shame that such a gem should be doomed to poverty and obscurity?"
               "You are too worldly in your thoughts, Mrs. Wilde. In place of thanking God for giving you such a picture of a child, you're repining because He hasn't given you a fortune besides. Maybe, since he finds you so ungrateful, he'll take away the good looks of your daughter by letting her get the small-pox, or something else that will disfigure her as much."
               "You are one of Job's comforters, Mrs. Sims," replied Mrs. Wilde, with a hysterical laugh. "But I am foolish and sinful to talk in such a manner. Through the opening now made for me, I may be able to place my darling in a better position than I now anticipate for her, poor, desolate little thing."
               "To my mind, she aint so desolate as this motherless babe that has to be knocked about among strangers, and be took care of by 'em because her father's people are so proud they won't let her mother's folks have anything to do with her. When gals go to making runaway matches with men that is above 'em, they ought to know that no good can come of it. That poor creetur got her heart broke, and that's what came to her."
               The nurse sighed, hushed her charge to sleep, and placed it tenderly in the cradle. For the first time she then looked at the note which Hunter had given her. She had put it in her pocket without unrolling it, and she now uttered an exclamation of surprise:
               "Twenty dollars! I had no idea it was more than half that. Mr. Hunter must have made a mistake."
               "No—I guess not. Mr. Hunter told me to offer you your own price; you won't have a chance to say anything to him about it, for he's going to New York to-morrow morning early; and when the child's wanting she'll be sent for from there."
               "Will he not come for her himself?"
               "I don't know; I rather think not. I don't believe he cares enough for the young one to trouble himself much about her. When her grandfather sends for her, I guess he'll jest leave me to hand her over to whoever comes."
               A singular expression flitted over the face of the nurse, and she muttered:
               "Poor little creature! she is indeed friendless."
               Mrs. Sims arose and bustled out as she said:
               "The night's getting along, and I have lots of work to look after before bedtime. Good night to you, and pleasant dreams, though I shouldn't dream much if I took a pair of babies to bed with me."
               The nurse saw the door close on her retiring form with a sigh of relief, and she stood a few moments beside the table apparently wrapped in deep thought. Her lips were compressed, and her brows slightly knit, and pretty as she undoubtedly was, there was something not altogether pleasing in the expression of her face.
               There was resolution and craft in the mouth and eyes, and in spite of her gentle manner and touching words, it was evident that her bitter struggle with life had not softened her true nature, nor taught her the great lesson of humanity, to do as we would be done by.
               She moved to the side of her child, and after looking down on her tenderly and wistfully, she muttered:
               "I must be very wicked to think of such a thing at all! Besides, it would be very hazardous to attempt it—I might lose all by doing so, yet it is a dreadful temptation."
               The clue to her thoughts was furnished by her subsequent actions.
               After securely fastening the door, she placed the two children side by side, and critically examined them, while comments dropped unconsciously from her lips.
               "They are both well formed; both have dark eyes, and the color of the hair is not yet decided; but mine is the fairest—the loveliest.
               "Oh, my beautiful darling, if I could only place you in the position of this little creature, I should be too—too happy. And I could easily give her to the rich woman that wanted to adopt my baby as her own.
               "But I couldn't give you, my precious, for she insisted that I should never see you again—never claim you for my child. Not for all her gold twice told would I have done that, my pet.
               
               "If fortune favors me, why can't I give Mrs. Allen this little one, and go with you to the wealthy southern home to which they say she belongs. It would not be wronging her, poor thing, for Mrs. Allen would pet her and think a thousand times more of her than these cold, rich relations ever will. But you could afford to put up with their slights, my innocent lamb, for you would have your own, own mother to look after you every day, to cherish you in her heart of hearts, for I would make myself so necessary to you that they could not send me away.
               "Oh, Lord, I do wonder if it would be an unpardonable sin to make such an exchange as that? It could not injure one child, and would be of infinite advantage to the other."
               She raised her eyes as if addressing this question to some invisible spirit, and a reply seemed to come to her in the soft cooing sounds which issued from the lips of her infant. Interpreting them to suit herself, she snatched the child to her bosom, exclaiming:
               "Bless the little darling, she's telling me in her baby fashion that I am bound to do the best I can for her, and I am sure I will do it, if I find it possible of accomplishment."
               She sat pondering on the possibilities that lay before her till a late hour. If Hunter only proved as indifferent to the little Evelyn as Mrs. Sims thought him, she saw the way clear enough before her to accomplish the fraud her mind had conceived.
               Margaret Wilde was not by nature an evil-minded or dishonorable woman, but she had grappled with a hard world at an age when all other women, reared as she had been, are shielded from contact with want and suffering. Her brief experience in the school of adversity had hardened her more than one would have believed possible to one of her years, for she was barely twenty.
               She loved but one creature on earth, and that was her orphaned and helpless little one, and the affection she cherished for her was an absorbing passion.
               To further her interests, to place her in a position of ease and prosperity, she would have been capable of any sacrifice save the one asked of her, to surrender her child altogether to Mrs. Allen. The treacherous thought that the children might be exchanged darted into her mind at the moment Mrs. Sims spoke of the wealth and high position of the little orphan's family.
               Mrs. Wilde was not so hard of heart nor so destitute of principle as to be willing to thrust down the deserted child to the level from which she desired to lift her own, and she soothed her conscience by the thought that the home to which she would consign Evelyn Ashley was as magnificent as that to which she of right belonged. She had never seen Mrs. Allen herself, but when her daughter was a week old, the woman who nursed her informed her that she was empowered to offer her a considerable sum of money if she would relinquish the child to a wealthy lady of New York, who wished to adopt her and rear her as her own.
               One of the conditions insisted on was, that Mrs. Wilde should never approach Maggie in her true character—never betray that Mrs. Allen was not really her mother. Wretchedly poor as she then was, she passionately refused the offer, for she clung to her babe as to life itself.
               Now, the thought would intrude that Evelyn Ashley would be quite as acceptable to Mrs. Allen as her own daughter would have been, for she was fair and attractive, and if she could only effect the exchange she meditated, the childless woman and herself would be equally benefited, while no material injury could accrue to the unconscious infant who was thus defrauded of her natural rights, only to bestow on her the affection of a warm-hearted woman who would indeed be a mother to her. With that sophistry with which those blind themselves who "do evil that good may spring from it," Mrs. Wilde made up her mind that there could be nothing so very wrong in such an exchange as this would be, and if fortune favored her so far as to enable her to carry out her scheme, she would consider it an evidence that providence smiled on the fraud which would set her fears at rest as to the future of her own daughter.
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               TEMPTATION TRIUMPHANT.
               SIX weeks passed away before Hunter heard anything directly from Judge Ashley, though the lawyer to whom the latter had written concerning the child had sought him out, and made such arrangements for sending Evelyn to Maryland as were possible, till he heard from the old man again, and received more explicit directions as to what was to be done.
               His letter ran thus:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "ASHURST, August 2, 18—.
                           
                           "MR. HUNTER:—Sir,—I have been very ill—ill almost unto death, and your letter lay unopened for many weeks after its arrival.
                           "This is the first day I have felt able to wield a pen, and I have undertaken the task of replying to you. Alas! the evil wrought by you is now irreparable, for my unhappy son can no longer avail himself of the chance of safety afforded him by the news your letter contains.
                           "With this I send you a newspaper, in which you will find a notice of the tragic events which followed your abrupt appearance on that fatal night. I do not blame you for asserting the rights of your cousin, but if you had been more considerate for others, less cruel in publishing the disgrace of him who had once been your friend, we might have been spared the wretched tragedy which has filled my days with gloom and bitterness, and wrecked the life of the bride on whom you hurled such an avalanche of woe upon that wretched bridal night.
                           "I am a broken, miserable old man, with the pride of my life laid low, and my heart and home left desolate by the cruel results of the unsuitable alliance made by my unfortunate Leon.
                           "Alas! his name has perished from the earth, and I have now no son to sustain the honorable name which has been borne by so many good and true men. It is a bitter thought to me that it was reserved for my son to bring disgrace upon the house from which he sprang: at times I feel as if it is very hard to pardon him, although the fiat has gone forth which forever severs us.
                           "With such feelings you may imagine that the child of this fatal union can never be very welcome to me, but she is of my blood; I have plighted my word to her lost father that she shall be received under my roof, and I must redeem my promise, however distasteful her presence may be.
                           "I have written to Messrs. Holden & Co., of New York, to confer with you, and repay you for such expense as you may have incurred on my granddaughter's account; and also to make arrangements to send her hither at once. The doubts I require to have settled are set at rest by the confession of her father, that he had been legally married to Miss Weston.
                           "I wish a competent person to be sent with the infant, who can take the entire charge of her; as I do not propose to have anything further to do with her than to provide liberally for her wants.
                           "A suit of apartments in a distant wing of the house are fitting up for herself and her attendant, and I wish the latter to understand that the child is never to be obtruded on my notice. Neither can I bear the presence of more than one crying infant in the house; and if the nurse who is with my granddaughter at this time refuses to leave her own child behind, another must be found who will be more accommodating.
                           
                           "I need not trouble you, however, to attend to all these details, as I have fully empowered the lawyers to act for me, and they will take such further steps as are necessary in this business.
                           
                              Respectfully,
                              RUPERT ASHLEY."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Hunter was glad to receive this letter, for he was becoming impatient to flit away from New York, and join some friends at Newport, in the hope that the sadness which had of late preyed upon his mind would be dissipated by change of scene.
               He had frequently visited the cottage of Mrs. Sims, and saw with satisfaction that Evelyn was rapidly improving in health and good looks; the emaciated frame grew plump and round, and the pinched and faded lips were now rosy and smiling, and all this was due to the tender, motherly care of the fair and fresh-looking nurse.
               With every interview with Mrs. Wilde, Hunter became more interested in her, and more convinced that she would be the most suitable person to accompany the little girl to her new home. From her manners and language he saw that she was superior to her present position; that she possessed sufficient culture to fill the place of nursery governess to her young charge for many years to come, and he felt so deep an interest in her that he was anxious to secure the position for her.
               When Judge Ashley's letter arrived, he went over to Hoboken to make such final arrangements as were necessary, as it was his intention to set out for Newport the following morning, leaving the lawyer to transfer the infant and her nurse to the steamer which was to take her to Baltimore.
               He found Mrs. Wilde sitting in front of the cottage, engaged with her needle, the children being both asleep. She no longer looked shabby, for her plain black dress, linen collar and silk apron, all seemed as if they had been made for her peculiar self; for she was one of those women who impart a grace to everything they wear.
               Her dark brown hair was put up in shining bands; and her large, hazel eyes looked up from her work with an expression that Hunter thought very charming, for there was an apparent simplicity and artless candor in this woman which were very captivating to him.
               He sat down on a rustic bench beneath one of the trees that shaded the yard, and smilingly inquired:
               "How are your twins, Mrs. Wilde? They must be doing as well as usual, or you would not be sitting here so quietly at work."
               "Oh, they are a couple of angels, sir; the best and sweetest little creatures in the world. They are sleeping together now like the babes in the wood; and it has come to that, that I hardly know which I love best. It will be a sad thing for me, sir, if I do not succeed in obtaining the situation of nurse to little Evelyn; every time I see you coming my heart gives a great bound, for I am afraid you are about to tell me that she is to be taken from me."
               "You need have little fear on that score, Mrs. Wilde, unless it is your own choice to give up your nursling; but I am afraid it will be necessary for you to part either from her or from your own child."
               She became very pale, and almost gasped for breath.
               "You have heard from Judge Ashley, then; and Evelyn has been sent for. Oh! sir, pray tell me what I had best do, and if there is a chance that I may get this place. You see it is almost life or death with me, Mr. Hunter."
               "Calm your agitation, Mrs. Wilde, and listen to what I have to tell you. I have a letter from Judge Ashley, in which he says he will receive the child in his house with a competent attendant; but the two are to occupy a portion of the building far distant from the rooms he lives in himself self; and neither nurse nor child must ever appear before him unless sent for. He furthermore prohibits another infant from being brought to Ashurst, and expressly says that if you refuse to leave your daughter behind you, some more accommodating person must be found in your place. I do not suppose that you will ever consent to such terms; but it is a pity you cannot secure this place, for it would be a very good one for you."
               Mrs. Wilde sat very still, and white while Hunter thus spoke. After a struggle, she asked:
               "If I'd give up my own baby I could go, then? But how can I—how can I? I should die away from my darling, and nobody would care for her as I do."
               "I supposed that would be your feeling, and I am very sorry for it, for I do not think as suitable a person can be found to go with Evelyn; besides, it is my only chance to serve you. If you do not go, it will put me to some inconvenience, as I had arranged to leave for Newport to-morrow, in case you would accompany her. With the certainty that a friend like you would take charge of the child, I should delegate all further trouble in the affair to Judge Ashley's lawyer. Since you decline, I must remain until another nurse is found. I should not like to trust poor Eva's child to the tender mercies of a person entirely unknown to me."
               When he finished speaking, but one thing was very clear to Mrs. Wilde, and that was, that if she accompanied the infant on its southern journey, Hunter would not remain to see them set out. Again the temptation she had struggled against through all these weeks assailed her. Now, it stood face to face with her, easy of accomplishment since Evelyn Ashley's only friend was about to leave her.
               It was her only chance to save her own darling from the grinding poverty which threatened to be her lot; to rescue herself from what she shrank from with all the repulsion felt by an imaginative, sensuous temperament, for that which is mean and hard.
               The other child would not suffer by the exchange; whereas, if she did not make it, she must sink back into her old life of wretched privation, destitute even of the means of providing for the few wants of her child.
               Unable to control her emotions, Mrs. Wilde burst in tears, and wept long and bitterly before she regained sufficient calmness to resume the conversation. Disconcerted and uneasy at this result to his mission, feeling the deepest compassion for her friendless condition, yet powerless himself to assist her in any way, Hunter strolled toward the gate and took a survey of the road till he supposed she had recovered composure.
               When he returned he found Mrs. Wilde sitting where he had left her, with an expression of hard decision around her mouth, and in her eyes, which almost prepared him for what she was about to say.
               "Excuse me, Mr. Hunter, but I am a little hysterical, I believe, and I could not help the burst of feeling which I see has annoyed you. I have now made up my mind to the hard necessity that rules me; and I can speak of what must be done in the cruel dilemma in which I am placed."
               Hunter protested that he was not annoyed in the least, and begged her to favor him with her views without delay. She sadly said:
               "I am, as you know, steeped to the lips in poverty; I have not been reared to drudgery, and I have not the physical strength to bear it. The life you offer me will at least save me from that; and it seems wrong to refuse to go with this motherless babe, especially as, by giving my own infant up to the protection of adopted parents, I can secure not only comfort but future fortune for her.
               
               "Before Maggie was a week old, a rich New York lady, who has no children, sent an agent to me to purchase my child, on the condition that I was never to approach or claim her as mine again. I refused, for my baby is as dear to me as that of any mother can be; but this strange child has crept into my heart, and shares it almost equally with my own. Do you think it will be too unnatural if I give up my own darling, and console myself for parting from her by taking little Evelyn to my heart? little Evelyn, who can give me the home I so much need, and who will console me for the loss of my own."
               Her large eyes were fixed on him with an eager, imploring expression, which deeply touched Hunter. He gently said:
               "If you can bear the separation, Mrs. Wilde, it will be the best thing you can do. For the sake of your own child, you should not permit your great affection for her to stand in the way of her advancement. You are but a delicate woman, scarcely able to labor for your own bread; and burdened with a young child, I frankly tell you that I cannot see what is to become of you in the future, if you refuse this chance of independence. You can remain with Evelyn as her teacher till she is old enough to be sent from home to a boarding school. After so many years of care and kindness, of course your grateful pupil would see that you were comfortably provided for. She will be rich, for I have every reason to believe that she will be sole heiress to a very large estate. If you can only make up your mind to part from your own child, all will be well with you I am quite sure."
               She sighed, shook her head, and seemed occupied by troubled thoughts. She at length said:
               "I have no other alternative. God forgive me if it is a sin, but I must do it. You can go upon your journey tomorrow, Mr. Hunter, after telling the lawyer that I will go to Maryland as nurse to Judge Ashley's granddaughter. Hard as it will be to leave my darling, I see that there is no other course for me."
               "I am glad that you have decided so rationally, Mrs. Wilde. It relieves me of a heavy responsibility; for I could not bear to think of placing the poor baby in the care of an utter stranger. I know that you will be a mother to her, and I am satisfied to trust her to you."
               Mrs. Wilde's lips grew white, as she faintly replied:
               "Thank you for your good opinion, sir; I promise you that she shall have the very best of care, and want for nothing."
               "I am satisfied of that; and now I must bid you good bye, perhaps forever, for I shall return here no more. I shall arrange with Mr. Holden that you shall go to the city to-morrow afternoon, so as to enable you to transfer your own child to her new protectors before you leave. A comfortable room at the Astor House shall be secured for you, and a carriage will be sent here to take yourself and your young charges over to New York. I have already settled with Mrs. Sims, and I will now pay you the amount due you over last month's wages."
               Mrs. Wilde drew back:
               "You owe me nothing, Mr. Hunter. You gave me twenty dollars, which should pay me for six weeks' service, since I have no board to pay. Since you have settled for that, I have no further claim on you."
               "I am not paying you, Mrs. Wilde, but Judge Ashley. He has sent orders that all sums disbursed by me for his grandchild are to be refunded. Take the money that fairly belongs to you, and I shall stipulate that the thirty dollars a month I intended to allow you, shall be increased to fifty when Evelyn is old enough to learn her A, B, C. In your new home you will need many things that you have not hitherto been able to get, and I insist that you shall take your first quarter's salary from me at once."
               He offered her a roll of bank-notes, and after a considerable show of reluctance she accepted them, feeling grateful for his thoughtfulness, but at the same time oppressed with the thought that she was receiving money for betraying the trust reposed in her.
               "I certainly need it," she at length said—"for it will be better to supply my wardrobe with indispensable articles before I go away to a country place where it may be difficult to get them. You will go in and see the little girl before you leave, sir?"
               "I may as well, I suppose; but all the babies look pretty much alike to me."
               Mrs. Wilde had now quite recovered her usual equanimity, and with her enchanting smile she led the way to the room in which the two children were sleeping. They were lying side by side in the profound slumber of infancy, and after a glance at them Hunter said:
               "They are really a pair of cherubs, and I do not wonder that you should shrink from parting from either of them. My waif has improved so much since you took charge of her, that I should scarcely know the difference between them but for the dainty clothing of Evelyn."
               He bent down over the tiny image and kissed the rounded arm that was thrown upward, partly concealing the infant's face. As he did so he noticed a large brown mole on the under part of the arm near the elbow, and with a feeling almost of repulsion he drew back, for he had seen a similar mark on the arm of Leon Ashley, and he bitterly muttered:
               "That is the Ashley mark, I suppose, of which I have heard Leon boast. I trust in God that this poor child does not resemble him in other respects, as in this."
               He drew away from the cradle, offered his hand to Mrs. Wilde, and wishing her success and happiness in the career that opened before her, Hunter took his leave.
               The nurse sat down in the darkening room, and tried to still the tremulous pulsation of her heart. The way was now clear before her to commit the fraud she had meditated from the first night of her introduction to her present position; in fact, she could not now retract, for she had pledged herself to go to Maryland, and to leave her own child with strangers was, to her, simply impossible.
               There would be no difficulty about disposing of the heiress, for a message from Mrs. Allen had reached her since her residence at the cottage, renewing the offer to adopt her own child, and the sum of money offered herself was doubled provided she would relinquish her daughter altogether.
               She at length arose, muttering:
               "It is the will of God, or the way would never have been made so plain before me."
               Trying to stifle the voice of conscience by such sophistry as this, she proceeded to busy herself in packing for the removal which was to take place on the following day.
               The expensive wardrobe prepared by poor Eva for her infant was put up with her own clothing, while the plain, though neat garments she had managed to procure for little Maggie were separately packed. While thus employed, she scarcely ventured to look toward the poor child she was preparing to defraud of her birthright, for her mind was now irrevocably made up to the necessity of sacrificing her charge to the future interests of her own daughter. She had cast away all doubts and fears, and was now ready for prompt action.
               On the next day she awaited the arrival of the carriage with painful solicitude, but she never once wavered in carrying rying out the fraud she had resolved on; when it came she calmly took leave of Mrs. Sims and set out for New York, determined to play the part before her with nerve and coolness.
               The children were both dressed very plainly, as she did not wish that any marked difference should appear between them. At the ferry landing the clerk of Mr. Holden met the carriage, and to Mrs. Wilde's tremulous inquiry for Hunter he replied that he had left for Newport that morning.
               Her heart gave a great bound, the fluctuating color came back steadily to her cheeks, and her eyes ceased to wander furtively around. The way to the consummation of her crime was made easy before her, and she thought she would be silly to hesitate in her onward course.
               The clerk asked:
               "Which of these children is Miss Ashley? She will be of some consequence by and by, for the Ashleys are grand people and rich—rich as California."
               Satisfied with the magnificence of his comparison, the young man was in the best of humors, and when Mrs. Wilde lifted the veil from the face of her own child, he went into ecstacies over her beauty, predicting all manner of conquests for her in the future.
               Gratified by his encomiums, the fond mother almost smothered the child with caresses, and the astonished clerk said:
               "You must love your nurse child better than your own. It's lucky that you do, since you mean to leave the other little kid behind you."
               Thus recalled to the necessity of keeping up appearances, Mrs. Wilde snatched up the neglected infant, and pressing her to her breast, burst into hysterical tears, which so much discomposed her companion that he spoke not another other word till the carriage drew up in front of the Astor House.
               The nurse was soon comfortably established in an airy apartment, and after informing Mrs. Wilde that he had ordered her meals to be sent up to her, the clerk took his leave.
               He was no sooner gone than she rang for a waiter and sent for a city directory. She knew on what square Mr. Allen lived, but not the precise number of the house; this obtained, she could complete the fraud to which she now felt herself in a manner pledged.
               The desired number was found, and then the struggle between good and evil in the heart of the nurse was curiously illustrated. She took up the heiress, laid her upon her lap, and shed such a torrent of tears over her as would have convinced a looker-on that she was really taking a final leave of her own child. The baby was just beginning to notice a little, and she put up her dimpled hands and cooed as if trying to console the deeply moved woman.
               Mrs. Wilde snatched her to her heart with passionate eagerness, and cried out:
               Oh! forgive me—forgive me, you little angel, for the wrong I am about to commit against you. But I do not give you up to hardship or evil; I give you to a motherly heart that will cherish you as tenderly as if you were her own. Oh! I cannot see that the wrong against you will be so very great, and my child will gain so much—oh, so much—by the exchange!"
               Thus reasoning in a circle; listening alone to the voice of interest, and to the passionate desire to lift her daughter to the position her beauty seemed to fit her for, Mrs. Wilde succeeded in stifling the voice of conscience, and replacing the child upon the bed, she completed her preparations for what lay before her.
               She administered a narcotic to her own infant, which would keep her asleep till she had performed her errand, and then made up a bundle of Maggie's clothing to take with the other child. The supper was brought up, and after swallowing a few morsels, she examined the condition of Maggie, and saw that the heavy sleep into which she had sunk would last several hours.
               Then, with a calm, set face, she lifted Evelyn Ashley in her arms, wrapped a light shawl over, locked the door of her chamber, and passed down the stairs leading to the private entrance. A heavy green veil screened her own face from observation, for she kept it carefully drawn, although twilight was beginning to gather.
               After gaining Broadway, she got into the first omnibus passing up town, and with outward composure, but inward perturbation, she was borne toward Fifth avenue.
               Mrs. Wilde was well acquainted with that part of the city, and she got out near Washington Square, crossed it, and entered the avenue. A few squares beyond she turned into a street pleasantly shaded by large trees, and by the aid of the gaslight, discovered the number she sought.
               All hesitation was now at an end. It was too late to recede, even if she had wished to do so, and the wrong she had undertaken to commit must be consummated without delay.
               She firmly ascended the steps, and rang a clear peal on the bell, which was immediately responded to by the appearance of a black servant in livery. The negro seemed much surprised to see a woman bearing a child in her arms, and he superciliously said:
               "You've made a mistake, mum. You ought to have knocked at the area door, and not rung here."
               Mrs. Wilde looked at him calmly, and replied:
               "I rang here because I have called to see the mistress of this house. Is she at home?"
               "Well—yes, she's at home. She's always here, 'cause she's an invalid, an' don't go nowheres else."
               "Then I must see her immediately. Go in and tell her that Mrs. Wilde is here with her baby, and wishes to speak with her a few moments."
               The man glanced around the hall, saw that there was nothing which could be conveniently removed by a woman burdened with a child, and he left her alone a few moments, while he went to deliver her message to his mistress.
               The time seemed long to her before he came back, but he presently returned, and more respectfully ushered her into a spacious apartment dimly lighted by the lowered gas.
               A large bow window opened upon a green yard filled with flowering plants, whose odor penetrated the room, and near it sat a delicate looking woman, dressed in a loose, flowing robe of white muslin.
               Near her, lounging on a sofa, was a small, active looking man, with light hair and sandy whiskers. He seemed to be suffering from intense ennui, and when the stranger came in, he was ready to welcome the interruption as something to divert the weary current of his own thoughts.
               He sat up, brushed up his stiff-looking hair, and said:
               "Eh? what's this, my dear? Baby made sure of at last! Well, that beats all! Hillo! young woman, I thought that you wouldn't be prevailed on to part from that picaninny by any manner of means. I must say that I never expected you to bring her here yourself."
               "Sit down, Mrs. Wilde," said the soft voice of his wife. "Do not mind what Mr. Allen says, for he must always have his joke. He does not mean to be unkind, for he is as anxious about the child as I am."
               "Well, yes—perhaps I am, but it wasn't that I wanted a mewling baby in the house, but because you seemed to pine for something to amuse yourself with when I am away attending to my business affairs. So, as you set your heart on the child, I could not say no; that's the whole of it, Anna."
               Mrs. Wilde looked from one to the other, and with her native acuteness made up her mind that the husband was willing to furnish his wife with a plaything, that he might enjoy increased opportunities to amuse himself in his own way. In a tremulous voice she said:
               "I am compelled, through necessity, to part from this child, for I am too poor to retain her with me. A situation has been offered me to go South as nurse to an infant that has lately lost its mother; I accepted it, but I am not permitted to take my own baby, so I have brought her to you, Mrs. Allen, in the belief that she will be as tenderly cared for by you as by myself."
               The lady warmly replied:
               "That you may be sure of, Mrs. Wilde. Give me the little creature; let me look at her pretty face. Oh, I love children so much, and this one will be such a comfort to me."
               She eagerly held out her arms, and tenderly kissing the sleeping babe, Mrs. Wilde laid it in them.
               "What a sweet little darling," exclaimed Mrs. Allen; "look at her waxen hands, George, with their taper fingers; are they not lovely? and the little coral lips, and long silken lashes? I declare the baby is as pretty as a wax cherub."
               "Pretty is as pretty does, Mrs. Allen," replied her husband, sententiously; "she's quiet enough now, because she's asleep, but wait till her peepers are open, and she begins to squall. Then will come the tug of war, to my thinking; but it's your fancy to take the child, and I'll not balk you. Since it will make you happy to have her, she may stay, and I'll endure all the squalls I anticipate in consequence."
               "Thank you, George; you are always considerate, but I promise that she shall not trouble you much. My seamstress has a young child, and she can take care of this one, too. As I have little sewing to do now, she can manage very well."
               "Do as you choose, my dear. The child is a good-looking chap enough as babies go, but it isn't in my way to make a fuss over such articles of merchandise, so I'll leave you to settle the terms with her mother."
               Mr. Allen threw a well-filled purse in his wife's lap, took up his hat, and frisked out of the room, kissing his hand to her as he disappeared. When she could no longer hear his steps, Mrs. Wilde spoke with some earnestness:
               "Mr. Allen does not seem anxious to take my baby, madam; your health seems to be feeble, and—and—pray excuse me, but I must speak out. I may be giving up the child to be pampered a few years, and then to be cast back into as bitter poverty as it has been my lot to bear of late."
               The invalid eagerly replied:
               "Have no such fear as that, for I have money of my own, which I can dispose of as I please, and I promise to settle enough on this child to render her independent. I shall not die before this little creature is grown; my mother was an invalid for thirty years; she was affected just as I am, and it was the conviction that I shall have long and lonely years to pass in a sick room which led me to adopt a daughter who will grow up to be a companion for me—and a nurse for me when I become more feeble than I am now. My husband will, in time, attach himself to her, for he is warm-hearted, though eccentric. The chances are that your little girl will eventually inherit all our wealth."
               "That thought must reconcile me to parting from her," replied Mrs. Wilde. "It is for the child's good that I have brought myself to give her to you. Henceforth she is yours, Mrs. Allen and I feel that you will fill a mother's place to the poor little darling."
               "Yes—you may rest assured of that; but what is her name? you have not told me."
               "Call her what you will, madam. She has borne my name so short a time that it can scarcely be said to belong to her yet. It matters not what you call her; since all things will be changed with her, the change of name will be a mere trifle. What do you wish to call her?"
               "I don't know—I haven't made up my mind yet, but I will write and let you know what I have named her. To what part of the South are you going?"
               "I—I am going to Louisiana. I shall go far into the interior of the State, and Opelousas will be the nearest post-office to the plantation on which I expect to live. You can direct to me there, to the care of Louis Leblanc."
               "Very well. And now all that remains for us to do is to settle the money question. I sent you word that I would pay you three hundred dollars to relinquish all claim upon your infant, and give her to me to raise as my own. This purse, which Mr. Allen just now gave me, contains more than that sum; but I am so charmed with my new acquisition, that I gladly give you the whole of it in exchange for her."
               She held out the purse, through the netting of which the glitter of gold was seen, but Mrs. Wilde pushed it almost fiercely from her, and abruptly said:
               "No, madam, I will not sell the child. I can live now without your money, and I should almost feel as if I had acted the part of Judas if I received gold for the poor little creature. There—there—say no more about it. I will not take it, and that is enough. Let me clasp my nursling to my heart once more, and then leave her forever. Oh! madam, as you perform a loving mother's part toward this poor little waif, will God judge you when you appear before him. What He will say to me I dare not think—dare not imagine!"
               She wildly snatched the infant to her breast, who awoke in a fright, and cried out; but the well-known face of her nurse reassured her and she submitted to the impassioned caresses of the guilty woman as to something to which she was accustomed.
               Mrs. Wilde suddenly threw her back into the arms of her new protectress, almost fiercely, saying:
               "There—she is yours, madam; keep her forever, for I claim no further property in her."
               Before Mrs. Allen could ring for a servant, she rushed from the room, and the house, leaving the heiress of Ashurst in her new home among utter aliens to her blood.
               On the following morning Mrs. Wilde embarked for Baltimore, where an agent was to meet her and forward herself and the supposed child of Leon Ashley to his father's house. The voyage was safe and prosperous, and at the close of the week she was safely established in her new home.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               AN INIQUITOUS ENGAGEMENT.
               ON the morning after seeing the face of Leon Ashley looking toward her window, Miss Arden awoke from the effects of the narcotic administered to her, in a calmer frame of mind then she had experienced since the night of her marriage.
               There was a vague feeling of expectation that something thing was about to happen to change the dreary tenor of her life, for which she could not account. A sudden sense of peace seemed to have fallen on her perturbed feelings, and the magnetic consciousness that some presence was approaching that affected her whole being made itself vaguely felt.
               She thought of the stranger, and yearned again to behold the lineaments which so strongly resembled those she believed had forever passed from her sight. Even the passing glance she had obtained of him showed her that he was many shades darker then her betrothed, and the identity of the two never once occurred to her.
               How was it possible that it should, when she believed Leon Ashley to be in his grave?
               The day was passed quietly, but in the evening she made a careful toilette and surprised Mrs. Maitland and her daughter by declaring her intention to join them in their promenade upon the beach.
               It was the first time Grace had expressed the slightest willingness to appear in public, if walking with them in the gathering twilight could be considered in that light. But Augusta knew that from the window of her room Miss Arden could see that Ashley joined herself and her mother every evening soon after they left the house, and she cast a sharp glance at the colorless face of the invalid to see if she could divine her motive for wishing to walk with them.
               The pallor of her complexion was less death-like, and a faint gleam of hope seemed to have been lighted in the dimmed eyes of the mourner. She half smiled as she caught the expression of Augusta's face, and softly said:
               "It seems strange that I should care to go out; but I do, Augusta. I will be candid with you, and tell you that I have the greatest desire to see this Mr. Larne more nearly, and I have observed that he always walks with you on the sands. I have a fancy that the face which so greatly startled me last evening was his; he was looking for you then, I suppose. Oh! you don't know what a comfort it will be to me to see one who so strikingly resembles my poor Leon."
               "Grace, love," said the suave voice of Mrs. Maitland, "if you will only strive to forget all about young Ashley, it will be far better for you than to cherish his memory in this fanatical manner. His conduct toward should destroy every feeling of respect or affection for him. It should indeed, my love."
               "So you may think," replied Miss Arden, in an irritated manner; "but I do not happen to agree with you in opinion. Love such as I felt for Leon Ashley can forgive a much greater wrong than he was guilty of toward me. He never could have believed that he was legally bound to that woman who thrust herself forward as my rival. She was far beneath him in social position, and she inveigled him into committing himself to her in some unfortunate manner. But that she really stood between him and myself as a bar to our legal union, I do not believe. I am Leon Ashley's lawfully wedded wife, though you all will persist in calling me Miss Arden, as if I had never been married."
               Grace had become quite oblivious of the conviction which came to her mind on the night of her ill-omened nuptials: in those long weeks of delirium she had forgotten much she had once known, and the poor overwrought brain had received a shock from which it was destined never to recover.
               But one impression was deathless as the spirit within her, and that was her adoring love for the unprincipled man who had won her affections.
               Mrs. Maitland looked at the face of the excited speaker, and saw that a red spot glowed in the lately colorless cheeks, that her eyes were shining with some new emotion, and she soothingly said:
               "Come and walk in the evening air with us, if you choose, my dear. If it is your wish we will introduce you as Mrs. Ashley to any one that may join us; but it will be awkward to do so, as we have spoken of you as Miss Arden, and your sad story is little known here."
               "Oh, well—I don't care. Let it be Miss Arden then," she sullenly replied. "But let us start, if we mean to go out at all."
               When the three ladies issued from the house there were very few persons on the beach, and Augusta looked anxiously around for her new admirer.
               Larne was nowhere in sight, and she began to chatter gayly to her companions. Grace evidently did not listen to her; every sense seemed to be wrapped in some ideal vision which was absorbing her whole being. Suddenly a voice spoke behind them, saying:
               "Good evening, ladies. The sea-breeze is charming to-night; and I am glad to see, Miss Augusta, that you have induced your friend to enjoy it with you."
               At the sound of his voice Miss Arden started as if she had received an electric shock. She passed her hand over her eyes, as if to clear her vision, and then gazed searchingly upon the features which were clearly visible in the moonlight. A tremulous shiver passed through her frame, and she muttered:
               "So like—so like, and yet not the same! His voice, too, seems but an echo of his that is gone—gone forever!"
               Suddenly turning toward Ashley, before Mrs. Maitland could perform the ceremony of introduction, Miss Arden abruptly asked:
               "Are you a relation of the Ashleys of Maryland? You must be, for such a resemblance can never be accidental."
               He courteously replied:
               "I am happy to inform you, Miss Arden, that I am a nephew of Judge Ashley, and I fully comprehend what so deeply moves you. I have often been mistaken for my cousin Leon, though you may observe that I am far darker than he was. Allow me to express my pleasure in making the acquaintance of one who was selected by my uncle as the bride of his only son."
               "No, no," she vehemently replied—"not chosen by Judge Ashley, but by Leon himself. He loved me—I know he did—I am sure he did—or he would never have braved disgrace to make me his wife. Men only do such things as he was guilty of at the instigation of intense and passionate love. Don't you agree with me, sir?"
               "Fully—entirely, Miss Arden. And now, as a near connection of those you have so long known, will you permit me to claim the privilege of a friend to visit you in your seclusion?"
               "Yes—pray come and talk to me of Leon. I think of him always, but every one seems afraid to mention his name in my presence. It is a great mistake, for it eases my full heart to speak of him. Those who know anything at all of me are aware of my sad history, so why should I try to ignore it? No—I shall carry its memory to my grave, and I wish I was lying there now with my poor, darling, lost Leon."
               Grace spoke in a rapid and excited manner, and ended by bursting into a flood of hysterical tears. Shocked by her want of reticence, Mrs. Maitland turned homeward, and hurried the agitated girl to her own apartment. She would stop at the entrance, however, and renew her invitation tation to Ashley to visit her every day during his stay at Cape May.
               He turned away from her, satisfied that her mind was fearfully warped, yet, strange to say, exulting in the certainty that this half demented woman was his lawful wife, and as such he would yet find means to claim her, and secure the large estates she possessed in her own right.
               But these ulterior intentions did not prevent him from carrying on a lively flirtation with Augusta Maitland throughout the remainder of the evening, and she retired at a late hour, with the conviction in her mind that the game was in her own hands, and she could easily secure this desirable match if she wished to do so.
               Just before they separated for the night, Augusta asked:
               "Will you accept the invitation to visit her given you by that poor, half crazy girl? It is a pity such a magnificent fortune as hers should be wasted on a person so incapable of enjoying it."
               "Of course I shall accept an invitation which was pressed on me with so much earnestness as to flatter my self-love. Miss Arden will yet get over her grief, and endow some clever fellow with her thousands who will know how to spend them."
               "Umph! If a spendthrift ventured to take her for the sake of her fortune, he would have to put her in a lunatic asylum in less than a year after their marriage. Grace Arden is unsound in mind now, and unless she is looked after, and humored as a child, she will lose the little sense she has. Mark my words, Mr. Larne: in less than three years from this night she will be the inmate of a mad-house."
               There was a strange expression in his eyes, as he replied:
               "You may prove a true prophet, Miss Maitland; but in that event the husband would soon be free to make another choice. A divorce could be easily obtained under such circumstances, for it would be a great outrage to keep a man chained to a senseless clod of clay such as a lunatic undoubtedly becomes when the light of reason is withdrawn. Tell me, fair Augusta, would you be willing to wed a divorced man?"
               As he asked this question Larne searchingly regarded her.
               "That is a strange question to put to me. Pray are you thinking of taking unto yourself such an incubus as a mad wife, and when you have succeeded in ridding yourself of her coming to me to console you?"
               Augusta spoke lightly, as if supposing his question had no significance, but he again persistently asked:
               "Would you think it a sin to marry a divorced man, Augusta? Some women do, and I wish to know what is your opinion on that subject."
               She hesitated a moment, and then replied:
               "I have never thought about it. If the first wife had been devotedly loved, I might hesitate, but on no other ground. Such a calamity as that gives a man the right to seek domestic happiness in a new tie."
               "Thank you—I am quite satisfied by that assurance. Some day you will recall this conversation, and understand its drift."
               "I hope I may, for I am quite in the dark now," she lightly replied, as she bade him good night.
               On the following morning Ashley presented himself in the private parlor of Mrs. Maitland, which had hitherto been closed to visitors, as it was engaged chiefly for the use of Miss Arden. To his disappointment she was not visible, and after a tender conversation with Augusta, he ventured to ask:
               
               "Can I not see your friend this morning? After the cordial invitation she gave me last night, I felt bound to call on her at as early an hour as fashion would permit."
               Augusta pouted, and presently said:
               "You have been in a great hurry to call on her, I am sure, and I begin to believe that you wish to play the part of the dashing rover you spoke of last night."
               "How can you imagine such a thing as that, my angel, when I have already found one who fills my ideal of all a woman should be? If I were master of my own actions, dearest Augusta, I should be on my way to Europe in another week, accompanied by the girl I love. But alas! I am not free to follow the promptings of my own heart."
               See grew pale, and faltered:
               "What can you mean, Mr. Larne? You surely have not gone so far with me, without possessing the power to realize the hopes you have been at such pains to excite. Oh, cruel! cruel!"
               For a few minutes Larne was apprehensive that she was about to faint, and he leaned over her, and tenderly said:
               "I have tried to win your love, Augusta, for it is everything to me, but if it is worth having it can bear trials—can wait a season for the rich reward it shall reap; for the present an obstacle exists to our immediate union. Before very long I shall set it aside, for I adore you, my peerless darling. If you will consent to wait for me two years, I swear, by the end of that time, to make you my wife, to share with you a brilliant fortune, which will then be mine."
               "What am I to understand by such language?" asked the agitated girl. "Oh, Leon Larne, why have you sought me, bound me to you in bonds of adamant, if you had no right to do so? If I could cease to love you, I would never look upon your false face again; I would fly from your presence forever. But you know how potent is the spell you have thrown over me; you are aware that I am your slave, or you would not dare to speak to me as you did just now."
               A faint smile of triumph flitted over Ashley's lip, and he tenderly said:
               "Is it indeed so, my fair Augusta? I am more fortunate than I had dared to hope. Only remain my slave, as I am yours, and some day I pledge myself to give you all your ambitious heart can desire. You shall have a magnificent home in a foreign land; jewels, laces, carriages and servants. All that can set off the beauty or gratify the pride of a charming woman shall be yours, my Peri, if you will only trust me, and have patience to wait a brief season to realize all this splendor."
               The astute speaker knew that he touched the spring of greed and vanity in the heart of this fair but frail creature, for Augusta wiped away her tears, and half smiled, as she said:
               "So much as you promise will be worth a sacrifice. Yes, Leon; I will wait for you the two years you ask. I pledge my word to you; but can you not give me an idea of the nature of the obstacle that exists between us?"
               "No, I dare not, for a season at least. In a few weeks, you will know it; but you must trust me implicitly, Augusta, as I did you. When you learn what shackles my freedom of action, I shall be able, by your conduct then, to test the truth and sincerity of your affection for me."
               "Is it something so very dreadful, then?" she apprehensively asked.
               "That depends on the view you may take of it. If you are my true mate, you will consider my position in the same light as I do; if you refuse to do so, we can but part. All will depend on you."
               
               "Part! Oh, Leon, anything is better than that. I promise to mould my thoughts on yours; to live in you and for you!"
               "My own darling, I should be the vainest man alive, for I have inspired the fairest of her sex with such a passion as I am capable of reciprocating. Augusta, I have admired many women, but you are the only one I have ever met who comes up to my ideal of what my future wife should be. I want neither a saint nor an angel, but a brilliant, passionate child of earth, who can understand my failings, and love me in spite of them; love me all the better for the peccadilloes which assimilate my nature more completely to her own. In you I have found such a being for the first time, and my mundane spirit clings to yours with a tenacity known only to such ardent natures as yours and mine. Is it not so, my adorable Augusta?"
               His voice took its softest tone, his eyes their tenderest expression, as he bent toward her. Hers were fascinated to them, and the look that beamed from them assured the tempter that Augusta Maitland was indeed his bound and willing slave.
               With a deep, struggling sigh, she murmured:
               "Oh, Leon, your words do not flatter me, yet you overpower me by the strength of your will. I feel that kindred souls indeed animate us, for all my life seems to have become absorbed in yours in the short week we have been known to each other, and what you bid me do I have no power to resist."
               Ashley smiled brightly, as he replied:
               "That is well for both of us, Augusta. If my influence can only be around you when we are separated, I have no fears for our future; for the two years of which I spoke must be passed far from each other."
               "Two years of absence, Leon! Ah! how am I to live through them! I shudder to think how void of interest my life will be when you are gone."
               "I will tell you how you can pass them, my angel. Go into the world, render yourself fascinating and charming to people in general, and thus prepare yourself for the brilliant role you will be called on to sustain as my wife. It will be sufficient for me to know that you are secretly devoted to me. I shall not be jealous, and the greater social triumphs you achieve, the more highly shall I value you. You see, Augusta, that I am intensely worldly; but that will not cause you to doubt the depth or intensity of my affection for you."
               After a pause, she sighed and said:
               "You are binding me to a strange compact, Leon. What will my mother say to such a contract as this? She is very anxious to see me well settled in life, and I doubt whether she will give her consent to an engagement, the fulfilment of which must be delayed two years."
               "Your mother must know nothing of it," he impressively replied. "To you alone must my secret be confided, for I have a secret of vital importance to unfold to you when the right time comes. Any premature disclosure would ruin me, and cause you to lose the brilliant and happy future I have promised you. Swear to me, Augusta, that what I have said to you shall never be revealed to any human being, till I remove the seal of secrecy myself."
               The eagerness with which he spoke—the light almost of anger shining from his eyes, overcame such resistance as Augusta was capable of offering, and she faintly said:
               "I have hitherto always confided everything to my mother; but this is your secret, and I have no right to betray it without your consent. Yes—I will pledge myself to you without consulting with her, for to lose you would be to die, Leon."
               
               A bright smile flashed over his face, and he clasped her to his heart and fervently kissed her.
               At this moment the sound of approaching steps were heard, and the voice of Mrs. Maitland spoke in the corridor loudly enough to warn the lovers of her approach, accompanied by Miss Arden.
               "We shall find Augusta in the parlor, my dear, with the gentleman you invited to call on you to-day."
               "Is Mr. Larne indeed there," replied the voice of Grace, with an intonation that was almost joyful. A significant glance passed between the two in the parlor, and Augusta whispered:
               "It would not take much to make her forget the dead cousin in favor of the living one; but I bid you beware how you trifle with her when I am near."
               "Pooh! she can never prove a dangerous rival to you," he replied, with a light laugh.
               The ample person of Mrs. Maitland first appeared, and then the slight figure of Grace Arden was seen gliding in behind her.
               She looked less eerie this morning, and a ray of color lighted up her face. She walked at once toward Ashley, and offering her hand, said:
               "You were very kind to come to see me so soon. I have been thinking of you all the morning, and trying to make out wherein you differ from my lost Leon. Except the difference in your complexion, it would be impossible to distinguish you from himself if he were here present. You are a dark Southron, and he was fairer, though still not a fair man. Now I see you by daylight, the resemblance is more wonderful than before. Oh! it seems to me that Leon, my Leon is here beside me."
               Overcome with agitation, she sunk upon a seat by his side, and stretched forth her hand as if seeking for his. Ashley took the soft little palm in his own, and with exultation saw that her finger still wore the bridal ring.
               He gently said:
               "Had I been so blessed as to possess this fair hand, I would never have relinquished it as my cousin did. I would have guarded my own life from the rash hand of a stripling, for the sake of her who had entrusted me with so precious a thing as her happiness. Dear Miss Arden, your pathetic story is known to me, and most deeply do I sympathize with your unmerited sufferings."
               His dark, eloquent eyes were fixed on hers, a magnetic thrill caused her to shiver through every fibre of her frame, and murmuring: "Leon, Leon—it must—it must be he," she sunk fainting from her seat. Larne caught her in his arms, and laid her on the sofa. Then he drew back, and left her to the care of the two ladies, as he said:
               "Poor creature, her mind is evidently distraught. I will leave the room, Mrs. Maitland, as my presence here just now is de trop, I perceive."
               In some perturbation Ashley took his departure, for he feared that Augusta might be shrewd enough to put together what he had lately said to her as to the obstacle which existed as to their immediate union, and the recognition implied by the words of Miss Arden; thus causing a premature discovery which must end in his utter discomfiture.
               Fortunately for his schemes, it never occurred to her to connect the two, and her firm belief that Grace was more deranged in mind than she really was, caused Augusta to attach less importance to her words than they deserved.
               Infatuated by her passion for her new lover, she had no desire to suspect him of evil; no suspicion that the pale and uninteresting Grace was anything more than an object of compassion to him.
               
               On the next day Miss Arden was unable to leave her room, but she talked constantly of Larne, and more than once asserted that he had been sent to console her for the loss of her first love. Augusta heard this with derision mingled with annoyance, and she felt tempted to betray the relation which existed between Larne and herself, but the remembrance of his manner when he bound her to secrecy suddenly froze the words upon her lips.
               For the following day Miss Maitland had an engagement she could not defer; a fancy ball was to come off in ten days, and she declared that a shopping expedition to Philadelphia was necessary, as it was imperative that her orders should be given in person for the recherché costume she intended to appear in.
               Mrs. Maitland, who feared to trust her extravagant daughter with her purse, lest she should leave her penniless, insisted on accompanying her, and Miss Arden, who declared herself perfectly recovered from her recent indisposition, was left under the care of a Mrs. Letton, an old friend of Mrs. Maitland's.
               Until they were on the eve of setting out, Augusta thought that Larne was to be their escort, but at the last moment a rose-colored note was brought to her from him. In it he excused himself from accompanying her under the plea of sudden illness, which would confine him to his room for a few days, though he did not apprehend any serious results from the attack. He bade her go and enjoy herself, and on her return he felt sure that he would be sufficiently recovered to welcome her back on her arrival.
               Deeply chagrined, Augusta reluctantly went upon her way, but as several ladies were of the party, and the fancy ball would take place so soon, she had no alternative but to take the advice of her lover.
               So the soi-disant Larne had the field now to himself, and he wended his way toward the parlor of Miss Arden, resolved that his fate for the present should be decided before the return of his fascinating charmer
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               THE VICTIM CAGED.
               ASHLEY found Grace sitting at her drawing table, with her portfolio open before her. She was quite alone, for the hour was an early one, and her new chaperon was accustomed to lie in bed till noon.
               Miss Arden seemed to have reasoned herself into the belief that Larne and Leon Ashley could not be the same person, in spite of the wonderful resemblance between them, and on this morning she greeted him with the reticence due to their supposed recent acquaintance. Her manner reminded him of the Grace Arden of old, and he saw that her mind had partially reacted.
               With the perfect tact of which he was master, Ashley conversed with her on many subjects which he knew possessed interest for her. He finally managed to approach her own recent trials without startling or unnerving her, and in reply to his apology for touching on so delicate a subject, she said:
               "You do not seem to be a stranger to me, Mr. Larne. Your near relationship to the family of my unhappy husband appears to give you a right to speak on this subject, especially as I believe I asked you to talk with me of my lost Leon."
               "Your husband, Miss Arden? Surely you do not recognize the validity of your marriage to my cousin?"
               "Why should I not? In soul we were one, for I know that Leon loved me. I do not believe the assertion of that man was true. Nothing further has been heard from him, or from the person who pretended that Leon had married her. I never will believe that he could play so treacherous a part toward one who loved and trusted him as I did, Mr. Larne."
               "But your brother, Miss Arden? Do you feel no resentment against poor Ashley for being the indirect cause of his death? I should think that would alienate you from him."
               Grace impetuously asked:
               "What right had my brother to inflict on me so incurable a wound as to attempt the life of the man in whom he knew my happiness was bound up? It is well for him that he evaded my reproaches by committing suicide. When I think of my immolated Leon, I can scarcely forgive Ernest Arden, although he atoned for his crime by the sacrifice of his life."
               "Are you quite sure that your brother lost his life by drowning? The wound he received in the encounter with Ashley might have caused his death, had he not subsequently thrown himself in the water. Have you never taken that view of the case?"
               She coldly replied:
               "I have been assured that the trifling wound found upon his person could not have caused his death; and I believe it. I am hard-hearted, perhaps; but the wretchedness poor Ernest inflicted on me has destroyed the sympathy I must otherwise have felt for his fate. I am afraid that, at times, I even resent his interference with what concerned me alone."
               "He doubtless thought the honor of his family had received a wound which must be expiated. You should not judge your brother hardly for what was done in a moment of passion, Miss Arden."
               Grace seemed scarcely to hear him. She had lapsed into reverie, and sat with her head supported upon her hand, her eyes fixed dreamily upon his face. At length she muttered:
               "Oh, would he were the same—so like—so like is he that I could believe him my lost Leon and accept him as such; but he has other dreams; he loves Augusta—"
               Unconscious that she was expressing her thoughts aloud, Grace was startled when the subtle listener, who had managed to hear every word that fell from her lips, softly replied:
               "I admire Miss Maitland's extraordinary beauty, but there are attractions far superior to mere physical charms. I have a sympathetic heart, Miss Arden, and it is deeply touched by your unmerited misfortunes. If I can console you—can help you to bear the burden that has been laid upon you, I shall be but too happy to do so. I had heard much of you before we met, and I have envied the happy man who was to win so much sweetness and goodness. Ah! if I dared hope that, in time, I might console you for your loss, I should be the most fortunate of men."
               Grace faintly smiled and said:
               "That sounds very much like a declaration of love, Mr. Larne."
               "If you will receive it as such; if you will permit me to approach you in the character of a lover, I shall be most happy."
               After a moment's pause Miss Arden earnestly said:
               "I will tell you the simple truth, Mr. Larne. I am so strangely attracted toward you, that it seems impossible that you should have been an utter stranger to me till within the last few days. Till we met, I thought that every hope in life had closed on me; but now it is different. Hope has rekindled; the torpor in which my heart has lain for weeks past is broken, and I am reckless enough to be willing to console myself for my late sufferings by plunging into a new attachment. It is very shameful—I know it is; but it is the truth."
               "Then you still love me," he whispered. Your love has defied even death itself. Is it not so, Grace? Your fine instinct has revealed to you what I feared to confess. Can you not guess my meaning—my love—my wife!"
               While he thus spoke, the faint color which emotion had called to the features of the agitated girl, faded gradually away, she uttered a faint cry, and sunk senseless in his arms.
               She remained so long insensible that Larne began to fear she would never recover; he would not summon assistance, for he feared the revelation her first words might make to those around, and he bathed her pallid face with water till she again showed signs of life.
               At length she sat up, and looking wildly around her, said:
               "I—I must have been dreaming. I thought Leon was here speaking such strange words to me. But I see now that it was only you, Mr. Larne. I feel very ill; pray call my maid to my assistance, and excuse me for dismissing you so abruptly."
               Larne saw that her mind had received a violent shock, from which she must have time to recover, and he at once obeyed her wishes. She smiled faintly upon him as he withdrew, leaving him in doubt as to whether she had understood him or not.
               When he returned to his own room he found a letter from his father, which had been laid upon his table in his absence. It contained these words:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "ASHURST, August 13th, 18—.
                           
                           "Your draft informed me that you are still in this country; that you are at a place of public resort. Why have you risked so much by going to Cape May, where people are to be found from all parts of the Union? You may be recognized there, and brought to trial for the murder of Ernest Arden.
                           "Oh, wretched boy! but for that crime, and the deception which followed it, you need not now abjure your native land and renounce your name. You could claim the woman I so earnestly desired to see your wife, and become a useful and honored citizen of your native State.
                           "But that now is impossible. Fraternal blood flows between you and Grace, which must sever you from her, though I now possess the proof that your marriage with her was legal. The other woman died half an hour before you gave you hand to Miss Arden, and but for that unfortunate duel, all might have been well.
                           "I have a letter from the madman who broke in upon us in so shameful a manner upon your bridal night, in which he informs me of the decease of your first wife, and expresses the deepest contrition for the evil he has wrought. Alas! it cannot now be remedied.
                           "Grace left this neighborhood as soon as she was able to travel, in company with Mrs. Maitland, an old friend of her mother's; and they were to go to some point where she could have the benefit of sea-bathing. I have not seen her since that dreadful night, but I wrote to her a week since, and sent my letter to Mrs. Maitland's house, to be forwarded to her wherever she may be. I felt bound to inform her of the validity of her marriage so soon as it became known to myself; and I also felt that it was my duty to tell her the truth respecting yourself.
                           "By this time, she knows of the ruse we practised to enable you to escape; but the certainty on her part that she is legally bound to you can avail you nothing; for Grace Arden can never accept the murderer of her brother as her future protector, neither do I think she will ever marry any other man; but I was not the less bound to show her the actual position in which she was placed, and you can depend on her to keep your secret.
                           "I send you an order for the money, which you must use to get away from the dangers that environ you. Your daughter is by this time on her way to me, accompanied by a person who is competent to take charge of her.
                           
                           "Oh, my boy—my boy! you have broken my heart, but I cannot utterly give you up. Since I heard from Hunter, my feelings toward you have relented, and if you had not destroyed that poor lad we might all have been happy together yet.
                           "Leave this country without further delay, for I am wretched at the thought of what may happen any day. If men should discover that I have lent myself to such a shameful fraud to evade the penalty my son has incurred, I could never again lift my head in the light of day."
                        
                     
                  
               
               There was no signature, but none was needed. The draft on Judge Ashley's banker in Baltimore for several thousand dollars, sufficiently proved its authorship, even if its contents had not done so. With a smile of satisfaction, Larne secured the check, and then tore the letter into minute fragments, which he burned on the hearth by the aid of a lucifer match.
               He then sat down to ruminate on his prospects, and calculated how long it would be before the letter addressed to Mrs. Maitland's residence would reach Grace Arden. A week before his own had been written that one was dispatched, and it might have reached the Cape by the same mail which brought his own.
               We have only to return to the apartment of Grace to see that his conjecture was right.
               When she awoke from the disturbed slumber into which she fell after Larne left her, she found the letter of Judge Ashley on a stand beside her bed.
               She was still so weak that she invariably sunk into sleep after any unusual excitement, and even the bewildering confession which came back dimly to her mind when her fainting fit was over, had not power to keep her awake, though she struggled to regain the clue to the mystery which evidently existed.
               But when she awoke refreshed by her sleep, she distinctly tinctly recalled what Larne had said, and she started up in irrepressible excitement, exclaiming:
               "It was Leon! He as good as admitted it himself. I see it clearly enough now, though I could not do so when I first recovered from that foolish fainting fit. Why do I lose all self-control so easily? I am too weak—too weak!"
               Her eyes fell upon the letter, and she snatched it up with a faint cry:
               "From Judge Ashley! What can he have to say to me? He must know that his son yet lives! Yes, yes—I am certain of it now: Leon sat beside me—held my hand—spoke tender words to me to-day! Oh, yes—I know it was my love—my own—own Leon! But what can his father have to say to me on that subject, I wonder."
               With trembling fingers she broke the seal, and with dilating eyes, and kindling cheeks, read the following words:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "ASHURST, Aug. 7th, 18—.
                           
                           "MY DEAR GRACE:—I have not seen you since that terrible night on which the happiness of your life, and the cherished hope of mine, were so sadly wrecked.
                           "When I relate to you all that has since happened beneath my roof, you will see that I could not leave home for several days; and then the despair that tugged at my heartstrings brought me almost to the brink of the grave.
                           "Oh! my daughter, we have both suffered most bitterly; but you are young, and you will in time recover from the sad blow that has fallen on you. But my grey hairs are brought low by the disgrace my son has inflicted on himself, and the anguish with which his conduct has filled my heart.
                           "But I will not sadden you, nor fill up my letter with complaints, for I have much to say in which you are vitally interested.
                           "You are aware that on that night a meeting took place between your brother and my son, which was supposed to have ended fatally to both.
                           
                           
                           "It was not so, Grace. Poor Ernest perished by drowning, for Leon denies that he died by his hand, though, alas! I cannot conceal from myself that but for the wound he gave him, the poor lad had never met so sad a fate.
                           "My son was not injured in the encounter with your brother; he took refuge at Ashurst; I concealed him, defrauded justice of its victim, and by a sham funeral led the world to believe that Leon also had perished.
                           "I could not give him up to disgrace, perhaps to death; for I then believed him liable to prosecution for both bigamy and manslaughter. As there was no witness to the encounter between Ernest and himself, there could have been no proof to rebut the strong presumptive evidence that your brother came to his death by Leon Ashley's hand.
                           "Believing this, I sent my son forth to take refuge in a foreign land under another name. He assumed that of a cousin from St. Croix, who recently died, and the striking resemblance between himself and Leon Larne will enable him to pass for him without difficulty."
                        
                     
                  
               
               The reader here paused, and in extreme excitement muttered:
               "How could I have been so blind as not to know him at once? The very tones of his voice, ringing as they did through my inmost soul, should have revealed his indentity to me. Oh, Leon! Leon! come to me—confide in me, and I will forgive all—all. Yet what avails it, when that woman stands between us as an ill-omened shadow, forbidding our happiness! Oh, God! forgive me for so wildly loving a man who is pledged to another; yet I cannot—cannot help it."
               After a bitter struggle with herself, Grace resumed the perusal of her letter:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "And now, Grace, comes the most singular part of the story.
                           "I feel bound to tell you that you are no longer free to act as you please with reference to any future choice you may make. The madman who broke in on us on your bridal night might have spared his fatal revelation, for, oh, my child! at that hour the girl my poor boy had been inveigled into marrying, lay dead.
                           "Yes—dead, Grace; and the bond which binds you to Leon Ashley is perfectly legal. Yet, after all that has happened, I could wish it were not so, for I, the father of your husband, tell you that he is utterly unworthy of you; and if he ventures to seek you under his assumed name, and urge you to accompany him in his flight, do not be induced to consent.
                           "I entreat, as you value your happiness, do not go with Leon, for he will break your heart, and blight your life, my poor girl. He is unworthy of trust, and I warn you against him, for I cannot help believing that he is lingering in this country in the hope that he may obtain forgiveness from you, and make you the companion of his exile.
                           "Oh! my child, refuse to listen to him—to see him even—as you value the repose of your future life.
                           
                              "Your afflicted friend,
                              RUPERT ASHLEY."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Grace sank on her knees, and her lips moved in prayer, while a shower of tears streamed over her face. When she arose she again read over the letter of Judge Ashley, and at its close exclaimed, almost contemptuously:
               "Repose! what do I care for that, if it must be purchased by relinquishing the wine of life? Judge Ashley writes to me as if I were an automaton, and not a loving, suffering woman, from whose life the clouds are rolling—letting the sunshine of hope fall upon my lately desolate heart. Leon is my lawful husband, thank God! He has the right to bid me follow him to the uttermost parts of the earth, and I am ready to obey him. If he has faults, I will close my eyes to them. I will cast into oblivion the detested thought that his hand has been raised against the life of my brother. But he did not take it; no, no, no. Ernest died by his own will, and not by the act of the man I so fondly love. God would never send such a misfortune as that to me."
               She seemed endued with renewed strength, and she paced the floor with a glow of happiness pervading her whole being. When Grace recovered from her excitement sufficiently to write, she sat down and dashed off the following lines to Leon, in which she enclosed Judge Ashley's letter:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "The enclosed will show you that the clue to your strange words this morning is gained. I partially understood them then, and that is why I lost all consciousness; but when I regained my senses they were so confused that I could not clearly remember what had made me ill.
                           "Come to me, Leon; explain the circumstances of that first marriage, and your voyage to Europe may not be companionless. Oh, Leon! if I can console you for all you have relinquished; if I can only become the true sharer of your life, no sacrifice on my part will be too great.
                           "Come to me, my love, my chosen one, in the assurance that I will cling to you, though all others should forsake you.
                           
                              Your devoted
                              GRACE."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               This missive was carefully sealed and dispatched by a waiter with strict orders to deliver it into the hands of Mr. Larne himself.
               Then Grace arranged her toilette carefully, and went into her parlor to await the result in palpitating expectation. Half an hour passed away, which to the excited girl seemed an age, and then a step which sounded as music in her ears was heard approaching. The tread was eager, and she felt the happy assurance that it was winged by love as pure and unselfish as she cherished for him. Alas! for the trusting heart of poor Grace!
               In another instant Ashley was in the room; he closed the door carefully behind him, and then rushed toward the trembling being who had arisen on his entrance, but looked ed as if life was about to desert her frame. He clasped her in his arms, exclaiming:
               "Grace—my love, my faithful one! Mine at last—mine through your noble trust in me! how shall I ever repay you for your goodness in this wretched crisis of my fate."
               "Only love me, Leon; cherish me as your heart's darling, and I shall not regret the sacrifice of home and country which I am ready to make for your sake," she whispered.
               Ashley placed her on a sofa and sat beside her, sustaining her trembling form in his arms, and at that moment he did feel that his late conduct toward Augusta Maitland was base and unmanly.
               To one or the other of these women he must prove a terrible fate, but just now he did not pause to ask himself which would become the sacrifice to his future caprices. To him woman was but a toy to amuse himself with as long as she interested him, and then to be cast aside as recklessly as we trample a faded flower under foot.
               A fatal egotist was Leon Ashley, who permitted no obstacle to stand in the way of his own gratification. He was also a consummate actor, and he now gave such a version of his entanglement with Eva Weston as induced his willing dupe to believe that he regarded himself as free to give her his hand at the time of their union.
               What mattered it how many falsehoods he told her, since she would never be able to bring them home to him? Once in Europe, he had no intention of ever returning to his native land, and there the hapless girl who was ready to throw her fate in his power, could be crushed into submission if she should discover how unworthy he was of the crown of love she had placed upon his recreant brow.
               Ashley's only care for the present was to deceive Grace completely, until her person and her fortune were under his control. That attained, he saw no bar to the accomplishment of the plans he had partially unveiled to Augusta Maitland.
               At length Grace asked:
               "How are we to evade the lady in whose care I am left? We must lose no time in embarking for Europe, for I tremble at the thought that you may be recognized and arrested. I absolve you from the guilt of my brother's death, but the law may not be so lenient, and your father thinks you are in danger here. After the scene which took place on the night of our marriage, even if this charge were dismissed, we could never return to Arden Place to live; so let us settle our plans for as speedy a departure as possible."
               With apparent hesitation he replied:
               "I am afraid that the only plan which has occurred to me may not meet your approbation, Grace."
               "Let me hear it, at all events. In the strait we are in we must not hesitate about adopting any feasible means of getting away from this country without incurring a suspicion of your identity with Leon Ashley.
               "My proposal will involve humiliation to your pride, my love, and—and I fear to develop my thought."
               "I entreat that you will speak, Leon. Why should I shrink from humiliation if it is borne for your sake?"
               "If that is your feeling, I will be perfectly frank with you. We must make good our evasion before the return of those prying Maitlands, or my incognito will surely be betrayed. Elope with me to-morrow night, and we will be united again, go at once to Baltimore and take passage on a steamer bound for Havre. We can be on our way to France before Mrs. Maitland and her daughter return to this place."
               Grace calmly replied:
               "The world here will say that I have been easily consoled for the loss of my first love; but why should I care about the opinion of people I shall never again be thrown among? Let it be as you have said Leon. I will be in readiness to accompany you to-morrow night; and I will write at once to your father, and inform him of what we have decided on. I will, at the same time, request him to take on himself the management of my pecuniary affairs, that the income arising from my estates may be transmitted to us in Europe without trouble."
               "My love, you think of everything; but I shall not be dependent on you, Grace. My father has promised to make me a liberal allowance."
               She smiled faintly as she replied:
               "I am now a great heiress, Leon, and what I possess is yours to enjoy as you please. It renders me happy to think I can endow you with wealth, even if your father should take offence at my not following his advice, and cast you off. Ah! how can he suppose that I would ever consent to give up one so dear to me as you are. I am but too happy in the reunion which has taken place."
               "And I, too, love. I determined from the first to see you before I left my native land, and if possible, to bring about a reconciliation between us. I am very happy in the prospect of our reunion, Grace; and I promise to be true and tender to you throughout your life."
               A few more tender words passed between them, and then Ashley arose to leave her, saying:
               "I must lose no time setting about my preparations for our departure. I shall telegraph to Baltimore to have a passage engaged for us on any European steamer that is on the eve of departure. This is Tuesday; by Thursday night we will be upon our voyage."
               
               "And—and about the second ceremony of marriage. What arrangement will you make for that?"
               "We have already been united once by the rites of your church, and no other marriage will have any significance to you. We will stop at some village on the way, as a runaway couple, get a magistrate to go through with the form again, and I will have an account of our elopement published and sent hither, to stop the idle tongues that will canvass us without mercy. When once assured that we are actually married, their interest in us will die out, and some newer theme of gossip be found."
               "But what will Augusta think? She evidently believes that you were much struck by her charms."
               "It matters little to us what her thoughts may be. Miss Maitland is an accomplished flirt, and she will find only that she has been foiled at her own game. We will not trouble ourselves about her."
               There was something half contemptuous in his tones which effectually set at rest any suspicions Grace might have felt that the speaker was tenderly interested in Miss Maitland.
               Her own presence at Cape May was, she firmly believed, the attraction that drew him hither; and in a blissful trance of happiness she threw herself upon her couch, after his departure, to realize the fact that Leon was restored to her in life and health; that within the next forty-eight hours she would be on her way to Europe with him, to become the companion of his joys and sorrows—the brightener of his expatriated existence.
               Ecstasy thrilled through every nerve of her sensitive frame, and every memory of wrong or anguish was sedulously thrust aside that her sweet dream of perfect love might be shadowless as her trust was pure. Her dead brother lay too peacefully in his lonely grave to permit his phantom to arise before her in that hour of happy delusion.
               Ah! he would bide his time, and when the sweetness of the intoxicating draft she pressed to her lips was gone—when pale distrust in the object of her idolatry swept ever at her side—when indifference and neglect had done their work—then would arise that brother's bleeding corse to mock her wretchedness till heart and brain were shattered in one common ruin.
               Ashley spent as much of his time as possible in the society of Grace, and he spared no efforts to induce her to believe that he adored her—that the hope of a reunion with her had induced him to brave the danger of appearing at a public watering place.
               His arrangements for their departure were rapidly and skilfully made. The maid who had been engaged as the personal attendant of Grace was bribed to accompany her and witness their marriage. The girl entered with zeal into their plans, and promised that on their arrival in Baltimore she would induce a cousin of her own, who lived there, to accompany the bride to Europe as her maid.
               On the next night, after Mrs. Letton was buried in sleep, Grace stole from her room, accompanied by Betty, and after walking a short distance from the hotel they were joined by Ashley, who led the way to the carriage he had in waiting.
               That night journey was made by Grace in a whirl of feeling which deprived her of all power of thought. She only knew that she was blissfully happy, sitting beside her lover, listening to the tender words he breathed into her ears as her head rested on his shoulder.
               Soon after daylight they stopped to get breakfast in a picturesque village; but before the meal was served, the party appeared in the office of the only magistrate in the place, and after a brief form of words, were again declared husband and wife.
               On the following day they reached Baltimore, and took possession of the rooms which had been secured for them in one of the best hotels. The steamer on which they were to leave, would not set out before Saturday morning, and the intervening time was spent by the newly wedded pair in complete privacy. Ashley was afraid that he might be recognized so near his own home, and he did not venture to go out during the day.
               The new attendant was engaged, and on Friday evening Betty set out on her return to Cape May to astonish every one there by the news that she had witnessed the marriage of the eccentric Miss Arden with a man she had known but four days.
               On the following morning Ashley and his wife were safely transferred to the Neptune, and they sailed away from the shores they never expected again to behold.
               Grace cared little for that. She was supremely happy in the sacrifice she had made for the sake of the man she so desperately loved. Ashley was also in a sunny mood, for he had secured an immense fortune with his wife, and her extreme delicacy of constitution, and the erratic tendency of her mind, assured him that either physical or mental death would release him from his bonds in time to fulfil the iniquitous contract he had made with Augusta Maitland.
               He was a little troubled as to how the latter might receive the news of his marriage with another; but he had left behind him an explanatory letter in the hands of a friend who had pledged his word to deliver it into Miss Maitland's own hands, and he believed he understood her well enough to be sure that she would keep his secret, and remain true to the pledge she had given him.
               In that letter he had avowed his identity with Leon Ashley, and showed how impossible it was for him to evade his first union. Since the marriage with Grace Arden was valid, he was not free to give his hand to another, and the safest course for him was to avail himself of the forgiving spirit of his wife, and thus secure the large fortune with which she would endow him.
               He did not scruple to assure Augusta that affection for poor Grace had nothing to do with his course of action; that he felt assured she could not long remain a clog upon his path, and by the time the stipulated two years had rolled away, he declared that he felt convinced that he should be free to follow the bent of his own inclinations.
               Their intercourse by letter could be constantly kept up, and if Grace refused to die, or lose her reason before the expiration of the time agreed on, Ashley pledged himself either to release Augusta from her promise to himself, or to obtain a divorce and claim her hand.
               The shock of hearing of his marriage was scarcely broken to Augusta by the reception of this letter, and it was many days before she forgave the deception he had practised upon her. But she was passionately in love with him; destitute of principle, and dazzled by the visions of future splendor he had been at such pains to set before her, she finally clutched her secret to her heart and resolved to await Ashley's own time to claim her. Yes—she would be his—would revel with him in the wealth poor Grace could give him, and forget his present treachery in the fruition of the brilliant future.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XV.
               THE FIRST INTERVIEW BETWEEN MRS. WILDE AND JUDGE ASHLEY.
               WHEN Mrs. Wilde reached Ashurst, she found the eastern wing of the old house prepared for the reception of herself and her young charge. The suit consisted of two medium-sized rooms, with a small dressing-closet attached to them.
               One of these was fitted up as a sitting-room for herself, and the other as a nursery for the infant heiress. A negro girl was placed under her to wait upon herself and the child, for Hunter had insisted that she was to be considered on the footing of governess to the little girl, and be treated as such.
               In the exultation of her heart, the fond mother forgot at what a sacrifice of principle all this had been obtained: she could only look upon the grand old woods, the stately home, and the evidences of wealth everywhere around her, and rejoice that by her own cleverness all these had been secured to her own daughter, without material injury to the defrauded heiress.
               In the first flush of success, she had no remorse for what she had done, though she was not so much hardened as to be incapable of feeling it. Mrs. Wilde had many good impulses, but no firm principle; but as time rolled on, and the necessity for concealing her fraud became more urgent, her nature must harden to the task of supporting the imposition she had thus far found so easy.
               Her meals were served in her own apartment with a degree of dainty elegance to which she had not been accustomed, and for a season the change in her condition from extreme poverty to luxurious indulgence, was sufficient enjoyment for one of her temperament.
               Besides, she had a passionate love for her child, and many hours of the day were spent in playing with and fondling the lovely little creature. But the extreme loneliness of her life gradually began to make itself felt, and one evening she impatiently asked Winny, the servant girl, if Judge Ashley never intended to visit his grandchild or speak with her attendant about her.
               To this inquiry the negro replied:
               "Marse don' see nobody, Mrs. Wilde. Since Marse Leon died, he stays mos'ly in his own room, an' when he comes out from thar it's only to walk by hisself in de woods. I reckin you may stay here a year afore he'll come nigh you to speak to you. He axes Mammy every day how de young Mistis comes on, an' as long as she's well he'll not trouble hisself to look after her."
               "What a hard-hearted old man he must be! I declare it is a shame that he has not yet looked on the innocent face of his granddaughter, and she has been in this house two months. How did his son come to die so young? I live here surrounded by mysteries I cannot penetrate, and I am tired to death of trying to find a solution to them. If this poor child is the daughter of a woman Judge Ashley's son clandestinely married, that is no reason why she should be treated as an interloper in his house. He has never asked to have her taken to him once, and I am surprised and shocked at his indifference."
               Winny regarded the speaker with dilating eyes; she seemed lost in astonishment that any one should presume to disapprove of what her master did; after a pause she said:
               
               "We all 'beys ole marse without axin' any reasons. He allers does jest as he pleases, an' what for shouldn't he when he's rich as cream an' has plenty o' darkies to mind every word he says."
               "But I am not a darkie, and I don't intend to be treated as one. I am determined to speak with Judge Ashley before another day goes by. Do you suppose that I can live here without having a white soul to come near me?"
               "I dunno, mum; I'd hate mightily to live whar thar warn't no darkies, an' I s'pose you feels de same 'bout yer own people. But my marse don't think nothin' 'bout dem things. He's had too much trouble 'bout his chillun turnin' out de way dey has to think much 'bout other people's feelin's."
               "Children! Had Judge Ashley more than one child?" asked the nurse, in an excited manner.
               "I thought everybody knowd dat. Miss El'nor, an' Marse Leon both went de same road. Dey bofe married without axin' de marster's leave, to some poor white trash at de north; an' he never forgave nyther on 'em."
               "And where is Miss Ellinor now, and whom did she marry?"
               "She met Mr. Wentwurf at Nagry Falls, I hear 'em say, an' when her father foun' out what was goin' on, he stormed at her, and told her to pack up her things to come along home wi' him. But she jest went t'other way an' got married out o' han' to her lovyer who hadn't got a cent to bless hisself wi', an' a nice time they had on it arterwards."
               "And has her father never forgiven her?" asked Mrs. Wilde.
               "Forgive her! I reckin ole marse don't know what dat means. He's as proud as Lucifer, an' when he's sot his foot down once, he never takes it up again on dat affair, you may be sho."
               Winny shook her head ominously, and looked squarely into the face of the interested listener.
               "And where is Mrs. Wentworth now?"
               "De Lor' above knows, but I don't. Miss El'nor's never bin 'bout here since she went away as gay as a lark, an' as pretty as a rose. De news came de very nex' year dat her husbin' had been killed on a steamboat, an' we darkies all thought she would be sent for den, sho; but she wasn't. She come to de Jolly Angler, de tavern not very far off from here, an' sent for her Pa to go and see her; but he wouldn't do no such thing, nyther would he listen to any o' her excuses for goin' off an' leavin' him, an' he swared a great oath dat her little boy should never grow up to have any o' his money."
               "And what became of the poor lady and her son?"
               "She went away from dese 'ere parts, an' nobody knows what's 'come o' her. It's five year this fall since Miss El'nor come back to de ole place, an' was sent adrift agin."
               "What a stony-hearted old man Judge Ashley must be," muttered the listener. "What I have done seems to me retributive justice for his harshness to his daughter. Oh! if he were to discover it, what dreadful punishment would he deem fitting for me! But I am safe—safe! He can never fathom the deception I have practiced upon him."
               After a few moments' reflection, she turned to a table, opened her portfolio, and wrote the following lines:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "JUDGE ASHLEY:—I shall be very glad to see you face to face for a few moments, that I may give you a faithful account of the care I take of your granddaughter.
                           "My life here is very dreary, for I have not seen a white face since I came hither, and I am not accustomed to being surrounded by black ones. Though I accepted the situation of nurse to little Evelyn under the pressure of extreme distress, I am a woman of respectable antecedents and good education; and I was not prepared to be treated as a menial on my arrival here.
                           "The strong attachment I have formed for my infant charge will lead me to bear much for her sake; but when I tell you that I pine for the sound of a cultivated voice, you will understand the desolate state of my feelings, living as I do, with no companionship save that of the negress who has been sent in to wait upon me.
                           "Accord to me only a brief interview, I entreat, and I pledge myself not to trespass on your time or patience.
                           
                              "Respectfully,
                              "MARGARET WILDE."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               She folded and directed this note, and commanded Winny to take it at once to her master. She felt a feverish anxiety to see him and judge of this man herself, for she felt that her future fate depended on the influence she could gain over him by the exercise of such wiles as she well knew how to use. Mrs. Wilde felt that she must risk everything to establish some sort of intercourse between her employer and herself, which she could turn to account as opportunity offered.
               Winny took the note and received her command, with an expression of astonishment that was almost ludicrous. That any one should dare to risk the displeasure of her master was inconceivable to her, but she went off at once to perform her errand.
               In half an hour she returned with the following reply:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "MRS. WILDE—Madam:—I regret to learn that you are not satisfied with the reception you have met with in my house. I ordered everything essential to your comfort and that of the infant, to be placed at your command, and if you will recall the terms of our agreement, you will see how unreasonable is your present demand.
                           "I distinctly stated that the child was not to be obtruded truded on my notice, and, of course, her nurse should have understood that the prohibition applied equally to herself.
                           "I do not require any report of the little girl's progress. If she is sick, summon the doctor; but unless she is in a dying condition, I shall not come to her. I tolerate her presence beneath my roof, but that is all I will do for the present.
                           "At her age, it is impossible that she could possess any interest for me, though in time to come she may assume some importance in my eyes as the heiress of my name and fortune.
                           "I shall be sorry to have you go away, but if you are so much dissatisfied with the seclusion in which you live, I suppose you will decide to do so. In that event I must confide the child to one of my own women, and when she is old enough to be sent from home, place her in a boarding-school.
                           "I understood from my lawyer that you had agreed to remain here an indefinite time as governess to the child, and I can only regret that you have such a distaste for the solitude in which you must inevitably live, as to lead you to give up a luxurious and secure asylum for the hardships to which you will be exposed in the outside world.
                           "I am not in a state of mind to see any one, so you really must excuse me for not granting your request.
                           
                              "Respectfully,
                              "R. ASHLEY."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Mrs. Wilde read over this letter several times with vivid interest, for it seemed to her to furnish a clue to the character of its writer. Firm, yet perfectly courteous, she saw that its author was a gentleman, though a man of arbitrary will and strong feeling.
               She did not reply to it till the following morning. She then wrote:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "JUDGE ASHLEY—Sir:—I have taken a night to reflect on my position here, and I have come to the conclusion that I cannot bear to give up my nursling.
                           "After what you have said, I will not presume to urge you to see her, though if you could be prevailed on to look upon Evelyn's sweet face but once, you would be so fascinated by her charms that you would ask to see her every day.
                           "Evelyn Ashley is a rare little creature, as you would acknowledge if you would only let her smile in your face, and twist her baby fingers in your hair.
                           
                              "Respectfully,
                              "M. WILDE."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               To this a curt reply speedily came:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "I shall not see her, nor yourself, though I am glad you have had sense enough to see where your true interests lie.
                           "Who called the child Evelyn? I do not approve the name, and I command it to be changed forthwith. Call her Elizabeth—that was my mother's name, and I know she was a good woman. Do not write to me again, as I am in no mood to answer letters.
                           
                              R. A."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               After this there was no further pretext for communicating with him, and as the weeks passed on, the tedium of Mrs. Wilde's life became almost insupportable. She had not much fondness for reading, and the books placed in her apartment were not suited to her taste; but one morning a package of novels and magazines was brought in, with Judge Ashley's compliments, and a message to the effect that when these were exhausted, she would have the liberty of visiting his library, and selecting such volumes as she desired to read.
               This was something gained, she thought. She could visit the opposite wing of the house, and penetrate into at least one of the apartments appropriated to the use of her host, and she resolved that the permission should not be used without bringing forth some result to further the ambitious project she began to entertain.
               Mrs. Wilde persuaded herself that it was necessary to the future security of her daughter that she should gain a permanent footing at Ashurst. Without it, she also risked ed a future separation from her darling, and she was ready to do anything that would secure herself against such a contingency.
               She looked into her mirror, and saw there a singularly attractive face, with a form rounded in the soft curves of youth and health; she thought of her twenty years of life, of the snow of sixty winters that lay upon the temples of Judge Ashley, and with time and opportunity she did not despair of melting the ice of pride and dignity which held him aloof from her, even to the point of inducing him to dream of happiness with a young wife—of eventually placing herself in that position.
               With such visions floating before her fancy, Mrs. Wilde hastened to read the books which had been sent, that she might have an excuse for visiting the library. At the close of the week, she dressed herself with extreme care, and taking in her hand the books which had been sent to her, she walked slowly toward the eastern wing of the house, and entered the lofty room which Winny had pointed out to her as the one where the "booktionary larnin'" was to be found.
               The windows opened to the floor, and a flight of steps led up to a glass door, through which she entered, and glanced curiously around. She saw that the room communicated with the narrow vestibule before described, and wondering if Judge Ashley was in his own apartment, she flitted from case to case, selecting such mental food as she fancied.
               Mrs. Wilde suddenly became conscious that some one was standing behind the shelter of the half-open door, watching her movements. It could be no other than Judge Ashley, and she felt a little resentful as she thought that this was the first glimpse she had had of him in the three months she had resided beneath his roof.
               
               But she was very careful not to betray her feelings, or to make him aware that she knew he was furtively watching her. With instinctive coquetry she remembered that she was looking remarkably pretty that evening, and she trusted that he would find sufficient interest in her appearance to induce him to speak to her.
               Nor was she mistaken.
               Pleased with her acquiescence in the decision that they were to remain aloof from each other, Judge Ashley insensibly began to think more of this lovely young creature than was quite consistent with the gravity of his years, and the deep affliction from which he was beginning to recover.
               The oppressive melancholy which had so long lain as an incubus upon him, was reacting, and he keenly felt the need of some kind of intelligent companionship.
               But where should he seek it, was the question he most frequently asked himself. Since the humiliation brought on him by the conduct of his son, he had shrunk from mingling with those who knew what a sad downfall his pride of family had met with, and desirous as he was of communion with his kind, he still morbidly recoiled from calling his old associates around him.
               In this dilemma, there seemed no resource left him but to seek the society of the solitary woman who had expressed the same need of social intercourse in the letter written so many weeks ago.
               At that time Judge Ashley thought it impossible that he should ever again tolerate the presence of a stranger near him. Misanthropy possessed him, and while he suffered so keenly the whole world was odious in his sight. But now the suffering had partially exhausted itself, and his desolate heart yearned for human sympathy.
               He did not acknowledge to himself that it would be peculiarly acceptable from a young and fair woman, but it must be told that his desire to make the acquaintance of Mrs. Wilde had been much quickened by a casual glimpse of her in the grounds, where she sat one bright day in the shadow of a large tree, engaged in a hearty romp with the baby. He had paused where he could not be seen, and he listened with amused surprise to the soft nonsense that fell from her lips, witnessed the passionate caresses she lavished on the child, and he caught himself sighing as he thought:
               "What a capacity for loving that woman has! The infant is not hers, yet she seems more devoted to it than most mothers are to their own offspring."
               Judge Ashley was interested in the nurse, and from that moment he determined to change his tactics toward her; so he sent her the books, and the permission to visit the library, intending to watch for her visit there, and come into the room as if by accident.
               How little was he aware that the astute brain packed away under those charming braids was perfectly aware of his tactics, from the moment she detected him watching her through the door.
               "I can outmanœuvre him," she thought; "and with patience and perseverance I shall yet win the day, in spite of his pride."
               Mrs. Wilde heard a step behind her, but she pretended to be absorbed in the contents of a book she had taken down, and she did not look around till the voice of the Judge spoke close beside her."
               "I hope you have found something adapted to your taste, Mrs. Wilde. You seem to be deeply interested."
               With a most natural start and a slight increase of color which heightened the piquant attraction of her expressive face, with perfect self-possession she made a graceful obeisance and said:
               "I have at last the pleasure so long desired of speaking to Judge Ashley. I thank you very much, sir, for the permission granted me to avail myself of the treasures of your library. I have found much in it that I have long desired to read."
               The Judge seemed struck by her courteous ease and the propriety with which she expressed herself. He half smiled as he replied:
               "I owe you an apology for not offering you the use of my books on your first arrival at Ashurst; but to tell you the truth, I had accustomed myself to think of you only as little Bessie's nurse, and not as what you proved yourself to be in the first note you addressed to me—a woman of education and refinement. Pardon me that my self-absorption at that time rendered me thoughtless of others. For months past I have been as one walking in the valley of humiliation and desolation; only of late have I begun to feel that I am still human—still have social needs which must be ministered to."
               With an arch smile Mrs. Wilde asked:
               "May I consider that as a confession that you were too hard on me in the harsh note which ended our correspondence? I then gave up all hope of making your acquaintance, and, pardon me in my turn, if I add that it quenched nearly all desire to do so."
               "It was a natural feeling," frankly replied the Judge. "You had every reason to think me a bear and to shrink from meeting me. I do not offer any excuse for writing that note, Mrs. Wilde, but, in the future, I will endeavor to atone for any want of consideration implied in its contents. In the nurse chosen for my grandchild I expected to find a healthy woman, with no particular recommendation beyond that; and I am much surprised to find in that position a lady whose manners and appearance would adorn any circle."
               Mrs. Wilde smiled brightly at this compliment; but she replied with a slight curl of her ruby lip:
               "I am a New England woman, Judge Ashley, and there the daughters of the humble, as well as those of lofty station, have the chances of obtaining a good education. I will be frank with you, sir, and give you an outline of my sad history.
               "My father was captain and part owner of a merchant ship which traded from a northern port to Liverpool. He was lost at sea with one who was even nearer and dearer to me, and I found myself thrown helpless and penniless upon the world. I had been the wife of Frank Wilde, my father's first mate, but a month, when he left me for the fatal voyage in which both father and husband perished.
               "By some informality in the insurance on the ship, I lost it all, and after spending almost my last penny in endeavoring to recover it, I took refuge with a distant connection of my father, a man in very humble circumstances; it was there the offer to take charge of your granddaughter was sent to me, when I had become almost hopeless of finding anything that I could do to gain a living. I gladly accepted it, and now I love the child as if she were my own."
               "And what did you do with your own infant?" asked the Judge. I am sorry now that it was not brought here."
               A change passed over her face. A slight pallor overspread it, and there was a sudden catching of the breath which touched the old man and prepared him for the answer which slowly came.
               "I lost her, sir; the little child was taken from me; but I am more fortunate than most mothers who have been thus bereaved, in having so lovely a nursling sent me in place of the one that is gone."
               Her voice quivered as she uttered this equivocation, and Judge Ashley pointed to a chair and said:
               
               "I have already kept you standing too long, Mrs. Wilde. Pray excuse me; a lady, however reduced in circumstances, is always entitled to the consideration of every man of feeling. I assure you that I have the deepest sympathy for you, and can comprehend how your pride must have shrunk from filling the position to which misfortune has reduced you."
               With infinite grace she lifted his hand to her rosy lips and softly said:
               "How shall I thank you for such sympathy, sir? It is worthy of yourself; but do not suppose that I have suffered the pangs which one of your proud race would be entitled to feel under such a change of fortune. My family is only respectable; it has no high name—no lofty antecedents to look back upon and make my descent in the scale of social life as bitter as they would be to one of your blood. I felt the stings of poverty more than those of pride, I am afraid."
               The touch of her glowing lips upon his fingers sent a thrill through the heart of the old man, which disposed him to listen kindly to the artful speech that followed. Like his son, he had a weakness for young and pretty women, and at that moment he felt like Jove stooping from the summit of Olympus to pluck an humble floweret and place it in his lofty abode. He patronizingly replied:
               "It affords me great pleasure, madam, to be able to assist you to regain the position to which you were born. Henceforth I shall consider you only in the light of my granddaughter's governess and entitled to the consideration in my family which that position will give you. I will order the mother of Winny to take the place of under-nurse, and the girl herself can act as your personal attendant."
               The sweet, clear laugh of Mrs. Wilde rang out, and she presently said:
               "My dear Judge, I hope you do not fancy that I am above attending to the duties for which I am paid. Excuse me, sir, but if I remain in your house at all, it must be as the bona fide nurse of Bessie. Besides, I love the child to that degree that I should be miserable if any one else had such care of her as to win from me her first smiles—the first emotions of love in her little heart."
               She spoke so earnestly now; there was such passionate emotion in her voice, that her companion was touched; he said:
               "You seem to make an idol of this little one, Mrs. Wilde. Creditable as it is to you, I must still feel surprise that the child of strangers should have awakened such strong feelings in your heart."
               "Oh, sir." she replied, with emotion, "Bessie came to me when I was desolate and almost broken-hearted. She took the place of those I have loved and lost, and it is not wonderful that she is dear to me as if—as if she were my own."
               The last words were uttered in a hesitating, tremulous voice, and the Judge smiled as he replied:
               "So much the better for her, if she has been fortunate enough to reach the true maternal heart. I must see this fascinating little gypsy, and, with your permission, I will have her brought to my room in the morning."
               "Certainly, sir; you have only to express the wish, to have it gratified."
               "Of course she has the Ashley mark," he asked. "If she has not the black mole below her elbow, which belongs to my family, I will scarcely believe her to be a daughter of my race."
               "Oh, yes, the mark of your family is upon her," replied Mrs. Wilde, with a brilliant smile, which showed an even row of pearly and faultless teeth. "You will be charmed with your grandchild, Judge Ashley, for she is the loveliest infant I have ever seen. But I beg that you will excuse me now; my baby may be fretting for me by this time, and pleasant as I find it to talk with you, I must go back to my duties."
               He bowed, lifted the books she seemed about to forget, and offered them to her, as he replied:
               "Whenever you wish to renew the conversation which I have found so agreeable, you have only to come to the library, make your presence here known to me, and I will join you. A man of my years and character may speak with a lady youthful enough to be his granddaughter, without causing invidious comment; even if there was any one to gossip about it. But there is not, for my slaves know better than to meddle with what concerns me."
               She demurely replied:
               "Thank you, sir, for the great compliment you have paid me in wishing to see me again. When I feel the need of speaking with one who can understand and appreciate me, I must perforce come hither; but I promise not to trespass upon you too often."
               In his heart the Judge thought that he could never find the visits of so fascinating a creature intrusive, but he only bowed, and suffered her to pass out.
               When Mrs. Wilde reached the yard, she cast back a nod and smile to the gray-haired man, who stood at the window watching her, which positively dazzled him; then, certain of its effect, she tripped away in the direction of the nursery.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               THE JUDGE FALLS IN LOVE.
               WHEN Mrs. Wilde reached her own apartment, she found Bessie still sleeping sweetly, and Winny enjoying the same repose on the floor beside the cradle she had been left to watch.
               As she took off her bonnet she muttered:
               "It was lucky that I noticed the mole, and divined that it might be a family mark. But for my acuteness, I might have been in a predicament now. Oh, Meg Wilde, you were born to achieve fortune, and you will do it yet! Ha! ha! how easily the old greybeard was melted. How courteous his manner became as soon as he saw how pretty nature had made me. What a chivalrous old darling he seems to be.
               "If I chose, I could live in state at once, have two servants at my beck and call, and do nothing myself. But that would not suit me at all. I don't want the slave woman as a spy upon me, neither do I care about having nothing to do in this dull old house. The care I lavish on my baby is all that keeps me alive.
               "Heigho! I like the marster, as Winny calls him, better than I expected I should. He is a good-looking man still, and he has an eye for youth and freshness, and a heart to be thawed into appreciating all the charming qualities of their possessor. My teacher once told me that I wore the girdle of Venus, which is of more value than beauty, or intellect; I know that I am attractive, and as to mind—well, mine can both plan and execute, and if strong will can bring events to pass, I shall triumph yet, and make a separation from my little angel impossible."
               She ceased muttering, drew near the cradle, and looked down with loving eyes upon its sleeping tenant. The right arm of the child was thrown out on the coverlet, and with a curious smile Mrs. Wilde lifted it till a large, dark spot was visible on the rounded portion just below the elbow.
               It was an accurate imitation of the mole on Evelyn Ashley's arm, which had been produced by artificial means.
               Mrs. Wilde now pressed her lips tenderly upon it, and murmured:
               "It cost you some suffering, my little angel, but you shall be richly repaid for it. When that proud old man sees it, he will be satisfied that you are his son's child, and never look into your face to trace a resemblance to those from whom he believes you are descended."
               The infant awoke, smiled in her eyes, and held up her hands as if asking to be taken up.
               "You are an angel," said the fond mother, snatching her to her breast, "for you never awake with a cry upon your lips, as most other children do. You open your eyes in tranquil surprise, as if you had been loitering in the land of dreams, but are most happy to come back to the mundane sphere to which you belong.
               "I wonder if those wailing infants foresee the evil lot in life prepared for them, and shrink with new dread from this cold world every time they open their eyes upon it. Thank me, my darling, that I have had the courage to secure a bright and prosperous future for you. Well may your sweet eyes unclose with the light of happiness in them, your lovely lips curve into that heavenly smile, forI have driven poverty, care and misery from your earthly lot."
               The child seemed almost to comprehend her, for she danced, laughed and clutched at her mother's braids with both her dimpled hands. Winny roused herself from her slumbers, and lazily gaining the perpendicular, gazed on the game of romps which ensued with the most lively interest.
               At length the baby was handed over to her, and Mrs. Wilde sat down to compose herself, and improve her mind by reading Susan Hopley, or the Servant Girl's Progress. The title of the story had been its chief attraction, and she soon wearied of it, and took from her trunk a volume of Pamela belonging to herself.
               This production of Richardson's had once been the property of her father, and it had been preserved on that account, but now she found some interest in it, because the heroine eventually succeeded in marrying her master.
               When Mrs. Wilde finally laid the book down, she meditated:
               "Such things have happened, and they may happen again. Lonely old men, deserted by their children, often marry women occupying an inferior social position. Even the pride of this stately Judge is not so lofty but it may be made to bend beneath such fascinations as I shall know how to use. He is a grand old cavalier, and may well bear the name of the princely Rupert. Such a man as he is will be far easier to work my spells upon, than one of a less lofty mould.
               "Ah! if he will only make me mistress of this grand old place, I can forgive him for being almost as antique as his possessions, and love him in spite of his snowy hair and ancient ways. Mrs. Judge Ashley—that sounds very well, and I will wear my state so deftly, that few will be found to cavil at his stooping to elevate the governess of his heiress to the position of his wife."
               On the following morning, a message came from Judge Ashley to the effect that he was ready to receive his granddaughter, and wished her to be sent to him at once.
               In anticipation of the summons, Mrs. Wilde had dressed the infant in her most beautiful robes, and the little creature herself was in the sunniest mood.
               When Winny approached and offered to take her from her mother's arms, Mrs. Wilde laughed and said:
               "Do you suppose that I will permit any one to defraud me of the pleasure of witnessing the first interview between Judge Ashley and this little baby? No—no, Winny, I must take the child to him myself."
               "He 'spressly tole me to fotch her along myself," said the girl, solemnly; I think as how he'll be mighty 'fended ef you goes to his part o' de house."
               Nonsense! wasn't I there yesterday evening with his permission. I spoke with Judge Ashley in the library, and he promised me that he would see the baby this morning. You can come with me, but I shall take Miss Ashley to her grandpapa myself."
               Thus silenced, Winny followed her, wondering if her master would not fall into a passion at the intrusion, and say something to the nurse that would teach her what an awful personage he was.
               Mrs. Wilde walked across the yard with a quick, light step, and soon gained the hall door. Jupiter replied to her knock for admittance, and he stared wildly at her as she calmly passed him, saying:
               "I have brought Miss Ashley to visit her grandfather. Show me to his room, if you please."
               Jupiter was about to unclose his lips to refuse her admittance to his master, when the Judge himself appeared in the door of his apartment, and spoke in a tone of some surprise, but one in which no displeasure was mingled.
               "Pray come in, Mrs. Wilde. I did not expect you to bring the child thither, though it is quite right that you should do so if you wish it. Even if you chose to accompany her, you might have permitted Winny to carry her; her weight is too much for one of your delicate frame to bear, and it is not my wish that you shall perform any menial service for Bessie."
               "Oh sir, you are very considerate; but, indeed, it is a pleasure to me to walk out with my little darling in my arms. I take her out every fine day, and we have the nicest times together in the woodland, when the weather is fine. When she can run about, I shall be as happy as a queen."
               The old man looked admiringly at her glowing face, and he placed a chair himself for her to repose on; but she did not sit down; she stood before him with smiling lips and questioning eyes, and lifted the veil which concealed the face of the half-sleeping infant.
               Bessie's soft dark eyes were slowly unclosed, and she stretched out her hands with her usual waking gesture, and offered them to the stranger.
               Judge Ashley forgot all his stately pride—all his ire against the lowly mother of his son's child, and he bent down and kissed the soft cheek before him. He spoke with a faint huskiness in his voice:
               "The child is very lovely, though I can see nothing of her father in her face. But there is the Ashley mark, I perceive, and by that token I know that she is a true daughter of my race. Remember, Mrs. Wilde, that this little waif is the heiress of my name and fortune, and ask for her whatever you may think necessary to her state. Train her to fill the station to which she was born, with dignity and ease, and I shall owe a debt to you which I shall find it difficult to repay."
               "Only permit me to remain near her as she grows older, and I promise to do my best," replied the nurse, with tears trembling in her expressive eyes. "This little creature has become so dear to me that it would be like severing me from life to bid me leave her to the care of others."
               "Be assured that you have nothing of that kind to fear, Mrs. Wilde; it would be a poor requital for the maternal tenderness you lavish on your nursling, and one, I hope you believe, I should be incapable of making. You may consider yourself as a fixture at Ashurst as long as you desire to remain."
               "Thank you, sir—oh! thank you a thousand times for the assurance—for dull as I often find my life here, I should be miserable if I thought there was a chance that I should be sent away. If such a thing were to happen, you would have to look sharp after your heiress, for I should be sure to find means to steal her away from you."
               She laughed with the gleeful abandon of a child, after uttering this threat, and to the saddened ears of Judge Ashley there was music in the sound of such mirth. It seemed to him that a sunbeam had suddenly fallen into the sombre old house, bringing back the spirit of enjoyment which had so long forsaken it, and he found a pleasure he did not attempt to realize in gazing on the fair face of the young woman who sat before him, fondling the infant as if all consciousness of being observed by others was forgotten.
               Judge Ashley had reached the advanced age of sixty without ever having been in love. At the command of his father he had married a girl of stately manners and much beauty, who filled the position of mistress of his house with a dignity and propriety which won his esteem.
               He cherished a moderate regard for his wife, which led him to treat her with such kindness as sufficed for her happiness; and after ten years of wedded contentment with each other, when the mother of his children died, he lamented her loss as decorously as the most devoted husbands might have done.
               By that time Judge Ashley was absorbed in his profession, to which he devoted all the energies of his vigorous mind. He had no thoughts to bestow upon the accomplished women with whom he was often brought in contact by manœuvring friends who wished to see him form a a second alliance.
               Had his children remained near him, he would have gone to his grave without being exposed to the fair temptation that now assailed him in the form of this charming creature, whose mere presence fascinated him more than that of any other human being he had ever met.
               He was just in the state of mind to appreciate all her bright and winning ways, for his long depressed spirits were reacting, and the soul that had lately dwelt in darkness and gloom was ready to bathe itself in any sunshine that offered warmth and light.
               The syren seemed intuitively to comprehend the state of his mind, and she made the best use of the opportunity before her to interest and amuse her employer. The baby played her part as deftly as if she had been tutored to make herself charming. She laughed and cooed at the judge in the most approved baby fashion; gripped one of his fingers, and seemed determined to taste its quality, but the dexterity of the laughing nurse extricated it before Miss had fairly dragged it to her lips.
               Altogether the interview was a success, and Mrs. Wilde retired in a state of great elation.
               Jupiter had looked on with amazement; how that young woman had found means to soften the sternness of his master to that degree as to permit her intrusion into his private sanctum to pass without reproof, he was at a loss to divine.
               After she retired the judge sat absorbed in reverie, apparently unconscious that he was not alone. The old negro cleared his throat, made an unusual quantity of noise in arranging some books, but finding all his efforts unavailing, Jupiter raised his voice and asked:
               "I wants to know, Marse Judge, ef dat ere Miss is to come a whiskin' in here wi' de baby whenever she likes? I mus' say she's a rare one for imperance; she jest axed for you at de do' as ef she had a right to do it."
               The sallow face of his master flushed slightly, and he turned severely toward the privileged servant. With stern accents he said:
               "You take a strange liberty, Jupiter, in speaking thus of a lady in my employment. If you had as much judgment as I have hitherto given you credit for, you would see that Mrs. Wilde is far above the position she occupies in this house. I have conversed with her before to-day, and I find her an educated and refined woman, reduced by misfortune to her present position. It is my will that she shall be treated with perfect respect, and when she demands admittance to these rooms, she shall never be refused by you. Do you understand me, Jupiter?"
               The negro deliberately surveyed his master and coolly replied:
               "I is feared I does un'erstan' you better'n you does yerself. Yon's a mighty insiniratin' creetar, marster, an' she's good-lookin' too. 'Sides, you see, Marse Judge, dere's 'no fool like a ole fool,' as de sayin' is."
               "Except an infernal, impudent darkie like yourself," roared the irate judge. "Get out of my sight before I punish your insolence as it deserves. Such presumption as this no amount of faithfulness can excuse."
               "P'raps not," muttered Jupiter, "but I's told the trufe anyhow, an' mebbe it may stop him from de foolishness dat's got inter dat gray head o' his'n."
               The judge caught the sense of his mutterings, and in extreme wrath he raised a book and hurled it toward the offender. Jupiter dodged it, slipped out of the door, and precipitately closed it behind him. Though he did not scruple to arouse his master's anger, he always found it best to avoid his presence till it had time to cool down.
               It was some time before Judge Ashley recovered his equanimity. He faintly smiled as he reviewed the thoughts which had lately occupied his mind, and he spoke half aloud:
               "Jupiter was right; I am an old fool, that is certain. A pretty face, a few gracefully spoken words and winning ways, have upset the tranquil tenor of my life as effectually as if I were a boy of twenty.
               "Ah, well! I suppose I must go back to the old stupidity; forget the sweet charm that threw its brief spell upon me, and be old and dull and grumpy as I was before this graceful vision flitted before me. By Heaven! what a witch of a woman that is! With wealth at her command, high station as her birthright, she might be a queen in the most brilliant circle."
               Poor man! absurd as it may seem, with the snows of sixty winters on his stately old head, he had actually fallen in love for the first time, and at that stage of life, as is well known, the disease always proves fatal.
               But his pride made huge struggles against the promptings of his heart, and he made vain efforts to prevent his thoughts from dwelling on the recent interview. He opened an abstruse work on mathematics, but finding it impossible sible to fix his attention upon it, he threw it aside, pettishly exclaiming:
               "I had better go back at once to the Pons Assinorum; for it seems to me that I am getting ready to walk over it. I believe the reading most suitable for me to-day would be the story of King Cophetna and the beggar maid, for I seem to be in a fair way to illustrate it. Ah, well! the first step toward curing one's self of a folly is to become conscious of it."
               Judge Ashley proceeded to form a stern resolution. that he would see the enchanting nurse as seldom as possible, and before he slept he addressed a brief note to Mrs. Wilde, saying to her that in future he would receive his granddaughter once a month, and on those occasions Winny could bring her to his room. He ended by saying:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "The library shall always be open to you, and you can select from its shelves such books as you may wish to read; or, if you will permit me, I will make a selection for you and send them to you.
                           "On reflection, the permission I gave you to make your presence there known to me, seems injudicious. Even negroes will gossip, and I should be sorry to have anything said which could wound or affect you in any way.
                           
                              "With high respect,
                              "RUPERT ASHLEY."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Mrs. Wilde read this effusion with an amused smile, and she tossed her head as she thought:
               "He will tire of this prohibition sooner than I shall. Touched is he? Of course; and his pride has taken the alarm. Umph! If I can't trample that under foot, my woman's wit was given me in vain."
               From that day the fair nurse never offered to approach the opposite wing of the house. She sent Winny from time to time to Judge Ashley with a request that he would send her something to read. He catered so well for her literary taste, that she seemed well satisfied never to enter the library herself.
               Yet, with all this apparent reticence, Mrs. Wilde watched her intended victim as artfully as a spider watches the unwary fly she wishes to entrap in the filmy meshes of her web.
               She was perfectly aware that he took his daily walk in the direction of the grove from which the place derived its name, and she suspected that he went thither in the hope that he should find her there with the child.
               But very rarely would she walk in that direction now, though she occasionally permitted the lonely old man to gain a glimpse of her lithe form flitting across the lawn, to hear the joyous tones of her young, fresh voice, as she warbled a snatch of song to the little girl, or talked to her the childish nonsense of which she had an infinite store.
               Once she had detected him beneath her window after twilight, gazing in at her, but she no sooner saw the dark shadow than she called Winny to lower the curtains:
               "Poor man," she mused, "he must be very far gone indeed. I wonder how much longer his pride will hold him aloof from what might be his joy and happiness, if he only cared less for the outside world. Well, I can wait; he is sure to come around some time or other."
               With this philosophic conclusion, Mrs. Wilde made herself as contented as circumstances permitted, and kept on the even tenor of her way.
               Bessie made her stated visits to the Judge attended by Winny, but no message or token of interest came to the banished nurse. Two months of utter estrangement rolled away, and Mrs. Wilde began to wonder if the approach of Christmas would not thaw the icy reserve in which the old man had thought fit to wrap himself of late. At that genial season he would surely relax his dignity, and seek such companionship as she was ready to afford him if he only would approach her in the right way. But all her calculations were set at naught by learning that Judge Ashley would spend the Christmas with friends at a distance from Ashurst.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               THE DIE IS CAST.
               AFTER much pressing Judge Ashley had consented to spend Christmas week at the house of Mr. Morse, an old friend who resided in the adjoining county.
               During those two months of seclusion the glamour of Mrs. Wilde's smiles was working its spell in the desolate heart of the solitary old man, who vainly tried to take counsel of his pride. He vainly said to himself that he could never commit the same folly for which he had so severely punished his children; that this woman should be nothing more to him that she now was.
               But his ears grew hungry for the sound of her voice, his eyes ached for another sight of her charming face, and he looked around his solitary room, bitterly contrasting it with what it might be if the bright creature who had so bewitched him would only smile on him from the opposite side of the fire-place. Many times he almost yielded to the temptation to grasp such happiness as remained for the brief span of life left to him, regardless of what the world might say; but he finally concluded to try the effect of absence first, so he accepted Mr. Morse's invitaion.
               On the last evening of his stay at home, Judge Ashley suddenly took the resolution to see Mrs. Wilde and bid her farewell. Without pausing to decide on the prudence of the step, he threw on his hat and coat, and made his way through a slight fall of snow toward the eastern wing of the building. When he knocked at the door she was quite alone, for Winny had gone to the kitchen to get her supper. Mrs. Wilde opened the door herself, with an expression of surprise upon her face, though she had heard the step that crunched the falling snow, and she knew perfectly well that the long penance the Judge had imposed on himself was about to be broken, and perhaps an apology for his late neglect be offered.
               She threw wide the door exclaiming:
               "Is it possible! have I the honor to welcome my master in my own apartment? Oh, sir, what will the servants say if they discover this visit?"
               He came in, closed the door, and hurriedly said:
               "I care not what they or any one else may say. Do not call me your master, Mrs. Wilde, for more as your slave do I come hither to ask you to forgive the churlishness with which I have lately treated you. I acted as I did for your sake; but now I break through my self-imposed regulations for my own. I am going away to-morrow, to be absent two weeks, and I could not leave home without bidding farewell to yourself and little Bessie."
               "Pray sit down, sir, and let us talk quietly a few minutes. I understood and appreciated the motives which actuated you, and I thank you for the consideration for me you have shown. I submitted to your decision, because I felt that there was danger to me in more ways than one if our acquaintance progressed further."
               A faint flush came to her rounded cheek, and her lovely eyes fell to the floor; the Judge saw her fluctuating color with a wild hope that made his chilled heart suddenly bound with rapture. He asked:
               
               "What can you mean? what other danger could menace you from occasionally meeting me?"
               She softly replied:
               "One danger was from the tongues of others; the other, from the weakness of my own heart. Alas! why should so forlorn a being as I am appreciate nobility of soul and seek to claim kindred with it? Had I been daily thrown with you—had I listened to the wisdom tempered by kindness which flows from your lips, my poor heart must have forgotten the difference of station—of years—everything that should have whispered to my pride to be upon its guard against such excellence as I know you to possess."
               The Judge sunk into the seat she placed before the glowing fire, quite overwhelmed by this sweet flattery; but its very excess partially recalled him to his sober senses, and he presently said:
               "Then the course I took was best for both of us. Do not imagine, my child, that I underrate the great compliment you have paid me; but I think you magnify the danger to yourself from frequent association with as old a person as I am."
               He regarded her keenly, in the hope, perhaps, that she would contradict him; but Mrs. Wilde only smiled frankly, and with apparent simplicity said:
               "Perhaps I do, sir. You know best, and I am willing to submit to your superior wisdom."
               Judge Ashley bit his lip, looked inquiringly into the fair face turned deferentially toward himself, and after a discontented pause replied:
               "I do indeed think that you imagine dangers which never existed. We have both been too squeamish, Mrs. Wilde; we have sacrificed many pleasant hours of social converse to a chimera that is as absurd as it is groundless. When I return to Ashurst we will occasionally meet in the library as I before proposed, and sometimes I will come hither to visit my granddaughter. Shall it not be so?"
               "I have no will but yours, sir," was the meek reply. "It is yours to command, and mine to obey, and what you think right must be so."
               He half smiled.
               "I wonder if you would be as submissive if power were placed in your hands."
               "I cannot say, sir. Prosperity might change my nature, as it does that of so many others; I might become overbearing and dictatorial under different circumstances, but there is little danger that I shall ever have the trial. Misfortune was my birthright, and I cannot escape it if I would."
               The soft melancholy of her tones moved him deeply, and he gently replied:
               "No, my child—grace and beauty were the gifts bestowed upon you by your fairy Godmother at the hour of your birth, and you should not repine that the mere dross of earth was withheld. Within yourself you possess a fine sense of enjoyment which all my wealth, twice told, could never purchase, so thank God for the dower he has given you."
               "All that may be true enough, sir; but still it is not pleasant to be dependent on the caprice of others for all the enjoyment one has. My life of late has narrowed down to such a mere animal existence, that I almost begin to weary of it."
               "I hope you have not thought of changing it?" he quickly asked.
               "It may come to that yet, sir. The strong attachment I feel for little Bessie may yield to the temptation to seek some sort of companionship. I am so lonely sometimes that I feel as if I must run away to find some one to talk with who can understand me."
               "But you have books."
               "Books are not to me what they are to you, sir. I crave something near me that possesses human interest. The baby is too young for anything but caresses; the blacks too far removed from me for association, and you have cast me from you as unfit to approach one so much elevated above me."
               Tears were in her eloquent eyes, and her voice took a plaintive tone as she thus summed up the catalogue of her grievances, and the listener spoke with the impetuosity of a much younger man:
               "My dear Mrs. Wilde, do not accuse me of such presumption as that. A lady of refinement and education like yourself, is the equal of the best in the land. You shall no longer suffer from loneliness. I promise you that when I return here I will see what can be done. I am sorry that I am compelled to go just now, but the visit has been promised, and I cannot now evade it."
               She sadly replied:
               "You will meet old friends and renew old ties. In their charming society you will forget the lonely woman who sits in this silent room hour by hour thinking of the joyful homes others have, and vainly trying to reconcile herself to the loveless and laborious lot Fate seems to have given her."
               The Judge replied with some emotion:
               "I have few friends left, and no ties that are now precious to me. I am as a tree scathed by lightning, and stripped of all its branches. If a new spring comes to my heart, it will not be through the ministrations of those I now seek, but through one I believe Providence has thrown upon my path to become the joy and the solace of my remaining days. Good-bye, Mrs. Wilde; kiss my granddaughter for me, and keep up your spirits while I am away. Look forward to something better in the future, for I promise you that life shall wear a brighter aspect to you when I again return to Ashurst."
               She arose as he did; held out her little soft hand, the palm of which was of the rosy tint of the sea-shell's lip; Judge Ashley took it in his own, half raised it to his lips, and then suddenly dropped it as if afraid to betray the half-formed purpose which struggled with the dying throes of his pride.
               When he left the room, and the sound of his retreating footsteps died away, Mrs. Wilde crouched down beside the fire with an expression of triumph upon her rosy lips, which muttered:
               "If he only comes back in the same mind, my schemes may—nay, they will, come to bear. But who knows what change may come over him while he is gone among those grand people?"
               A faint cloud gathered on her smooth brow, but it was soon cast aside, and her imagination revelled in the future she conjured up before her as the beloved mistress of Ashurst; the young wife of a doting old man who would have no will but hers.
               Judge Ashley went on his visit. He met at Mr. Morse's a small party of elderly people, many of them cotemporaries of his own. The most of them were weary of life, and disappointed in its results as much as he himself was. Their conversation only saddened him, for there was none of the freshness of life or hope to be found in their discourses.
               He soon discovered the motive which had induced Mr. Morse to insist on this Christmas visit. Now his son was believed to be dead, his friends again thought that a second ond marriage might render his life less dreary than it was, so he was lured to Moss Side to be introduced to a lady of suitable age, who, it was thought, would make him an excellent wife.
               Mrs. Perry was the widow of a wealthy planter, with no children to encumber her, and Mr. Morse tried to persuade Judge Ashley that she was the very person to suit him as a second choice.
               He looked at the lady critically, and found nothing to charm him. She was a small, insignificant looking woman, with pale blue eyes, and a flaxen front elaborately curled. He contrasted her with the vivid, glowing creature he had left behind him, and his heart at once vetoed the proposal his friend wished him to make.
               To the pressing inquiry of Mr. Morse as to what he thought of Mrs. Perry, Judge Ashley replied:
               "I do not think of Mrs. Perry any more than she does of me. She cares for nothing on earth but her own comfort, and the arrangement of those flaxen ringlets that hang over her yellow forehead, like youth caressing age. Oh no, Morse; if I am induced to marry again, I will at least get a wife that suits my taste."
               "I shall consider you wise to marry again, Ashley, provided you make a suitable choice; but from your words, I presume that only a young woman will suit your fancy."
               "Perhaps so," was the curt response; "but that is my own affair; and I shall certainly not accept a wife of any other person's choosing."
               Mr. Morse said no more. He was not aware of the presence of the captivating Mrs. Wilde at Ashurst, or he might have spoken his mind more freely. He wished his old friend to brighten his solitary life by installing a new mistress in his lonely home, but he chose one after the sober fashion of his years and station, unconscious that the silver-haired man before him was in the midst of his first romance; that he was ready to sacrifice even the demon of his pride to possess the charming piece of mortality who had fascinated every faculty he possessed; who held him captive in chains that thrilled him with pleasure, although they hourly tightened their hold upon him.
               "I will go back and marry my darling at once," he thought. "What is the opinion of these people to me? It can neither make nor mar my happiness. They would persuade me to give my hand to that dough-faced woman yonder, with her false hair and false teeth; with a smile as artificial as her heart is cold. Morse would make a conventional marriage for us, and then leave us both to drowse away our lives until we fall into the grave.
               "No, sir; I can do better for myself than that. I will take to my heart that desolate creature, who was not above laboring honestly for her bread, and with her quaff the wine of life the Gods will send me in such a union as that. I will give her station, fortune, home, and she will bestow on me love, obedience, happiness. A fair exchange, by Heaven! and it shall be made!"
               Firm in this resolution, Judge Ashley returned home to find the object of his idolatry ill in bed, suffering from fever consequent on a severe cold. No physician had been summoned, and Mrs. Wilde insisted that there was no need of one, but the alarm of the old man was so great that he immediately dispatched a servant for Dr. Manton, ordered a woman from the quarter, who had a young child, to come up to the house and take charge of Bessie, and established the plantation nurse by the side of the invalid.
               Many times in the course of the day he would come to the door under the pretext of inquiring if the baby fretted for her nurse, but really to ascertain how Mrs. Wilde was. The child did well enough, but her mother grew steadily worse, and on the second day after Judge Ashley's return, she was reported to him as being quite delirious.
               "She will not know me," he thought, "and I will go to her bedside for a few moments, and ascertain her condition for myself."
               How little could he have dreamed that the delirium was partially simulated to bring about that very result. Mrs. Wilde was just in that condition in which the tongue will utter any wild fancy that enters the brain if the curb of reason is not at once applied. She was conscious that she yet possessed this power over herself, but she did not choose to use it; her purpose would be better answered by giving the reins to her tongue if Judge Ashley should decide to visit her himself.
               When he entered the sick room, she was lying with her eyes half closed, and the flush of fever on her cheeks. He stood an instant looking down at her, thinking how very pretty she was, even in illness, when her wild, startled looking eyes suddenly opened, and she asked:
               "Who is that? What benign face is looking down upon me so compassionately? Oh! I need sympathy so much—so much. My life is so sad—my days so dreary. Oh! beneficent Creator, take me to thyself, or give me another heart to lean on, for I can no longer stand alone—alone!"
               The repetition of the last word sunk away in a dreary whisper, and again the eyes closed, as if tired of looking out upon the world.
               The Judge stooped over, and called her by her name, in a voice of deep tenderness.
               "Margaret, my daisy, my pearl, strive to regain your health for my sake, and you shall no longer be lonely. You shall be my child-wife; the brightener of my life; the joy of my heart. Only get well, my precious one, that I may strive to make you happy.
               She lifted her long eyelashes slowly, and asked:
               "Who talks of happiness? Alas! it is not for me. The remorseless sea swallowed up all I loved—father—husband—all—all!" and the small hands were thrown upward with a wailing cry that went to the heart of the listener.
               He again bent down, and whispered:
               "I speak of happiness, my Margaret. Only live and love me, and I shall be so happy myself that I must make you so."
               Her eyes rested on him with a bewildered expression, but gradually the light of reason seemed to rekindle in them, and she quietly said:
               "Judge Ashley! you here! How shall I thank you for this condescension?"
               He took the hands which still burned with fever, in his own, and gravely said:
               "You can understand me now, Margaret. Hasten to get well, to become everything to me. My love, my wife, I claim the right from this time forth to cherish and pet you as the darling of my old age. Speak—tell me now; will you—can you love me in return for all that I can bestow upon you?"
               Mrs. Wilde faintly, but sweetly, replied:
               "Affection is above all price; but such as I have to bestow is already yours, generous, noble hearted man. But I am too weak to talk much, and my mind already begins to escape me again."
               The Judge had stolen in during the temporary absence of the nurse, and her return at this crisis put an end to the conversation. Janet appeared very much surprised to find her master in the sick room, but he immediately retired, after saying:
               "I was passing, and called in to see how Mrs. Wilde was getting on. She seems very ill, Janet, and I hope you will neglect nothing that can be done to restore her. The poor baby must suffer from her long separation from her."
               The woman regarded him suspiciously as she replied:
               "De Nuss is doin' well 'nuff, sar. Eff she'll mind de doctor, she'll soon be about again, but she 'fuses to take mor'n half his truck. As to de chile, I warrant Leeny will do as good a part by her as de white 'oman did. You needn't be a comin' in here to look arter my charge, marster, for I know all about what's to be did for her, so thar now."
               The Judge knew from experience that the tongue of old Janet was not to be braved with impunity, so he hurried away with the resolution strong in his heart to place his new idol on a pedestal which would lift her above the impertinence of his own servants.
               The days wore away drearily enough till Mrs. Wilde was pronounced convalescent. At length she sat up, and received the Judge in the most charming dishabille; but the calls he made were brief and stiff enough, for in the adjoining room was always the colored nurse and the child, and the door between the two apartments invariably stood open.
               Judge Ashley longed for the time to come when she would be strong enough to leave her room; but the weather was cold and damp, and the physician had positively forbidden her to walk out before Spring fairly opened.
               Judge Ashley showed his interest in the convalescent by sending to Baltimore for every delicacy that could tempt her sick appetite; and fruits and fine wines were lavished on her with a profusion that made the servants stare, and surmise among themselves that—
               "Marster had lost his head, an' was a goin' to make a fool o' hisself, sho."
               Mrs. Wilde casually betrayed that she played on the guitar, and in a short time a fine-toned instrument, with a package of music, came to her. The latest papers and magazines were ordered for her use, and new novels were regularly sent from a large publishing house.
               The venerable wooer endeavored by these graceful attentions to win for himself a place in her gratitude, if not in her heart.
               But now the high position she had so artfully played for was within her grasp, a strange hesitation seemed to come over her. The spirit of coquetry must have been very strong within Mrs. Wilde, for desirable as she considered it in every point of view to make good her footing at Ashurst, there were days in which it seemed to her impossible that she should advance upon the path she had marked out for herself.
               This apparent caprice only rendered her more charming to the Judge. He indulged the flattering belief that if she were finally won to become his wife, it would only be through a personal preference for himself, and not for the worldly prestige he could bestow upon her.
               As Judge Ashley advanced, Mrs. Wilde seemed to recede from him; though in all she did or said there was still that piquant charm for him which he had never found in any other woman.
               With the first Spring flowers she came forth, radiant as the early blossoms, to take her first walk after her long imprisonment in the house. At the earnest entreaty of the Judge, she went out alone, and she had scarcely gained the grove when he joined her.
               After a little playful badinage on her part, he suddenly became serious, and said:
               "Margaret, my friends urge me to take another wife. They have chosen for me a woman of suitable age; that is, one as dull and weary of her earthly pilgrimage as I was before I knew you. I feel that Ashurst is too lonely for me. Shall I ask this lady to become my wife, or will you, tantalizing creature that you are, tell me what you intend to do. Of late, I cannot understand you. You seem like a will-o'-the-wisp, always evading me just as I fancy I am about to secure you."
               She coquettishly replied:
               "The pursuit has then brightened your life, and given you something to think of. So far, it has been beneficial. If you can do so, I bid you leave me for the rich and aristocratic woman your friends would be sure to select for you. They will all cry shame on you if you stoop to lift me to your heart. I own that I shudder at the thought of all you will have to endure for my sake, if I consent to accept your most generous offer."
               "Pooh! child, who could say anything that I should care about if I were blessed with an angel in my house to console me for their worldly babble? I am perfectly free to act as I choose. You are a lady—you suit my taste; and it is nobody's business if I choose to make you my wife. Come, Margaret—I am resolved to have a definite reply before we part."
               Mrs. Wilde spoke with extreme emotion:
               "If I refuse your generous offer, you will send me away—separate me from the child. Is it not so?"
               With some irritation he replied:
               "If you only consent to accept the state of my wife that you may remain near her, I had better take the one provided for me by my friends. But I will answer you frankly: Only as Mrs. Ashley can you remain here; for I could never bear to have you near me, yet have no claim on you save the slender one of governess to my grandchild. I can make you happy, Margaret; I know that I can; then why do you torment me by this hesitation?"
               After a pause of deep emotion, she replied:
               "I will hesitate no longer, Judge Ashley. You shall not reproach me with trifling with you; but—I cannot marry you just yet. Poor Frank has not been dead a year and a half yet; I must wait that length of time at least before I give my hand to another, and that seems very little."
               "Then you pledge yourself to marry me?"
               "I do, sacredly—solemnly."
               "When? Name some specific time."
               "In two months from this day. Does that satisfy you? And I declare to you that, to the best of my ability, I will make you a true and faithful wife."
               She offered him her hand with serious grace, and then held up her lips to receive the kiss of betrothal. Judge Ashley thought himself the happiest of men, and he poured forth his thanks and protestations in a flood of eloquence that almost reconciled her to the promise she had given.
               The next two months passed as an idyl to the enamored lover; he forgot his years, the dignity of his station, and gave himself up to the intoxicating belief that this young and beautiful woman was becoming attached to him for himself alone.
               He sought to gratify every caprice she might have; but his Daisy, as he chose to call her, was very careful to ask nothing which could lower his self-respect, or induce him to consider her as too exacting.
               Full of life and vivacity herself, she seemed to infuse her own nature into that of the sombre dignitary whose sternness had so lately caused him to sit up in judgment on his own son. She sang to him, striking with skilful fingers the chords of her guitar; she chattered an infinite quantity of lively nonsense, to which he listened with fond rapture; and for the first time since the cares of life settled upon him, Judge Ashley felt as if existence was not intended to become a mere round of duties divested of all agreeable recreation—all lightness of heart. The joyousness of his new idol's nature was rapidly counteracting the sombre tendency of his own, and he was a better and a happier man for the change.
               The two months passed away on wings of light to him, and at their close Mrs. Wilde still petitioned for a little longer delay. She seemed to shrink from the final settlement of her destiny, equivocal as her position had now become in Judge Ashley's house. The servants had long since discovered what was going on, and friends at a distance had heard of a young woman, occupying almost a menial position in his family, to whom he was devoting himself, and they wrote to remonstrate with him, as strongly as they dared.
               The Judge treated them with silent contempt; but his adored Margaret, for whose sake he was bearing all this annoyance, tantalized and worried him, almost beyond endurance, by insisting, with tears, that he would grant her the delay of another month before their union took place.
               Judge Ashley granted her prayer, for he could refuse her nothing; but he was determined this delay should be the last. When the close of the month approached, he made a visit to the county town, and returned to Ashurst accompanied by a young Methodist minister, whom he had engaged to marry him. He had the license in his pocket, and he walked into Mrs. Wilde's room followed by the stranger, and curtly said:
               "Margaret, I have brought this gentleman hither to unite us in the holy bonds of matrimony. I have the license, and I will no longer be put off; the wedding shall take place now or never."
               Mrs. Wilde had started forward to greet him on his entrance, but she now shrank back, and sunk upon a seat, trembling, and as pale as death.
               The Judge bent over her, and whispered:
               "What is it, love? What alarms you so?"
               "Nothing—nothing; I am better now," was the faint reply. "Since you will have it so, I suppose there is no alternative but to obey you."
               After a few moments of intense agitation, Mrs. Wilde recovered apparent composure; she allowed Judge Ashley to take her cold hand in his own, and lead her before the surprised clergyman, who had never before officiated at so singular and unceremonious a marriage. Winny and Janet were the only witnesses, though neither of them could believe that their master intended really to marry the nurse of Bessie, till they heard the words actually said which made her his wife.
               The ceremony was ended; Judge Ashley clasped his bride to his heart, on which she fainted dead away. Such was the effect produced by the consummation of all the wiles she had practised to bring about this very result.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               LEON'S VILLANY GOES ON.
               IF Grace Arden had ever imagined that being doubly wedded to Leon Ashley would render her doubly dear to her husband, she was destined to be soon, and bitterly, undeceived.
               She suffered terribly from sea-sickness on their voyage to Europe, and Ashley left her to the care of her maid, while he amused himself with flirting with such lady passengers as were not subject to la maladié du mer. When he did tear himself from his own pastimes, and found time to enter her state-room, he uttered the tenderest protestations of sympathy, and made her believe that he would never leave her side if the closeness of the cabin did not overcome him.
               Grace was well satisfied that he should absent himself, for the peculiarity of sea-sickness is, that it renders one indifferent to everything save the turmoil going on in one's stomach; and the newly wedded wife sensibly adjourned all display of sentiment till they reached terra firma again.
               The voyage was at last ended, and Ashley thought that something was due to her who had so generously trusted him. He believed that he should acquit himself creditably of the debt he owed her, if he made her happy for one little honeymoon. So he took a picturesque villa near Marseilles, which overlooked the Mediterranean, and installed a small but complete household in it.
               Grace took possession of "Love's first home," and there, for a few blissful weeks, she forgot all her previous sufferings, was oblivious of all her adored Leon had done to destroy her confidence in him. She loved him as only a weak and tender woman can surrender herself to a man she cannot esteem, though she may feel for him the most passionate affection.
               During a few weeks of that delicious autumn, the pale eyes of Grace gained fire, the wasted cheeks gained roundness and bloom, and the light of perfect content shone upon the brow of the newly-made wife. Her adored Leon was devoted to her, and what more could she ask of fate?
               But gradually her Eden was invaded by visitors from the neighboring city. Ashley spoke French perfectly, and he had managed to form many acquaintances since he landed in France, all of them men of his own calibre.
               Gay, reckless young cavaliers came to their secluded and beautiful home; they filled the house with carousing, and detained the master of the establishment night after night at the gaming table.
               Grace reluctantly remonstrated, for she detested the part of a scolding and discontented wife. Ashley listened good humoredly, and promised amendment, but he evaded keeping his word, and at last, pretending to be wearied with his fruitless attempts to rid himself of his companions, he proposed giving up their establishment, and removing to Paris. Grace joyfully consented, for she believed that if her husband were once removed from his dissipated associates, his habits would change, and he would again be to her the tender and considerate companion he had been on their first arrival in France. But she too soon had cause to know that the fault was not in the friends he had chosen so much as in himself.
               They were no sooner established in handsome apartments in Paris, than she found him lured from her side by the same pursuits which had occupied him in their country home. Ashley did not now incommode her with the presence of his reckless associates under his own roof, but he spent night after night at the gaming saloons of the Palais Royal.
               The time spent in his own lodging was chiefly consumed in sleeping and eating, and Grace found herself that most forlorn of beings, a neglected wife, in the midst of a strange city, surrounded by people with whose language she was imperfectly acquainted. Her American maid left her to marry a French hair dresser, and the unhappy wife had no human being near her to whom she could intelligibly speak. Ashley sneered at her because she did not acquire the language she heard spoken every day, but her ear was not quick nor her intellect bright, and try as she would, she found it impossible to remember more than was actually necessary for the common purposes of life.
               
               The deepest despondency settled on Mrs. Ashley's spirits; she discovered the correspondence which was carried on between her adored Leon and Augusta Maitland, and although she dreamed not of the extent of their turpitude, the knowledge that her husband took sufficient interest in Miss Maitland to keep up intercourse by letter with her, gave a severe stab to the trusting heart of the devoted wife.
               She also found that Ashley's temper was a terrible one to contend with; even if he had loved her, he would scarcely have put a restraint upon it, but feeling her a clog upon his path, loving another with such love as he was capable of feeling, poor Grace could do nothing which was pleasant in his eyes. If she tried to welcome him with a smile when he returned from his orgies, he turned away with a sneer, and made some cutting remark on her want of personal charms; if she wept, he stormed and raved at her, telling her that it was no wonder he stayed so much from his own home, since nothing greeted him there but ill-temper.
               As time passed on, the slight aberration of mind which had been observable before her marriage became a confirmed mania, and when a daughter was given to her before the close of the first year of married life, the unfortunate mother was in no condition to prize the blessing, which, under more favorable circumstances, might have given a new interest to her wrecked life.
               A severe fever confined her to her bed for many weeks, and when her bodily health seemed to be restored, the long-suffering mind had sunk into a kind of apathetic idiotcy. Even the sight of her child could not arouse in her any expression of interest, and the infant was removed from her lest she should do it some injury.
               By a strange caprice, Ashley chose to call this child Evelyn, after the Eva he had so basely deserted, and the little girl was baptized Evelyn Arden Larne. She was placed under the care of a healthy nurse, and her father watched over her with extreme solicitude. She was the heiress of the Arden estates, and therefore of importance to him, for he had exacted from his lunatic wife a settlement on himself of the income derived from her property until her child attained her twenty-first year.
               Ashley's next step was to obtain from three physicians a certificate of the incurable madness of his wife: armed with this, he went before the tribunals, and demanded that his marriage should be set aside. As he declared his intention to become a citizen of France, there was no legal flaw in the divorce he obtained, and the shameful programme laid out by the unprincipled lovers was now ready to be carried out.
               Ashley wrote to Augusta Maitland that his incumbrance was in no condition to combat any disposition he might choose to make of her, and so soon as he had placed her in a private lunatic asylum, he would fly on the wings of love to claim his adored one.
               As if to remove every obstacle in their path, Mrs. Maitland died suddenly about a year after Ashley's departure for Europe, leaving Augusta the possessor of a small fortune, and perfect independence of action.
               When the letter of her lover reached her hands, she made instant preparations to meet him in Montreal, as he was afraid to trust himself upon his native soil again; and although he crossed the ocean with all a lover's ardor to meet and claim her as his own, Ashley required her to show her trust in him by meeting him alone at the appointed place.
               Attended only by a waiting-maid she hired in New York, Miss Maitland travelled to Canada, found rooms already ready engaged for her in the principal hotel, and before she had time to take possession of them and remove her bonnet, she was clasped in Ashley's arms.
               Arrangements were speedily made for an immediate union, and in two hours after her arrival in Montreal they were united. The next day they set out for Halifax, and from there took the first outward bound steamer, and reached Liverpool in safety. After a brief sojourn in England, the bridal pair took up their residence in Paris.
               Ashley had made no attempt to introduce poor Grace into society; she was not attractive enough to gratify his pride, but with the brilliant and beautiful Augusta it was far different. He was proud to display his new charmer to the gay world in which he had gained a footing for himself, and to his great delight, he found that in their two years of separation, Augusta had so diligently applied herself to the acquisition of the French language, that she could speak it with ease and elegance.
               In the gay whirl of fashion and pleasure, Augusta gained friends and admirers wherever she appeared, and Ashley bowed in homage before the idol of the hour, and gave her all the heart he possessed. He surrounded her with luxury, lavished on her everything that could gratify her pride or increase the prestige of her beauty, careless that the means of doing this were chiefly drawn from the resources of the discarded Grace.
               In reply to the last letter Grace had written to Judge Ashley informing him of her resolution to cling to his son through good and evil report, he had returned a few brief lines which reached her through her husband's banker. In these the Judge expressed his fears for the result of what she had ventured to do in spite of all his warnings; but he accepted the agency of her estates, and through him a large sum was semi-annually transmitted to Leon Larne's credit.
               In addition to this, Judge Ashley allowed his recreant son a liberal annuity, and Leon possessed the means to revel in splendor on the fortune the hapless Grace was incapable of enjoying.
               Incarcerated in a maison de santé surrounded by extensive and beautiful grounds; furnished with everything that was essential to her comfort, Ashley thought he had done all for Grace that could be required of him, and beyond paying her bills as they fell due he no longer troubled himself about her.
               From his father he carefully concealed the condition of Grace, and also his subsequent proceedings. He suffered Judge Ashley to believe that the dear wife he referred to in the few brief epistles he addressed to him was herself; he made Augusta contribute to the deception by adding brief postscripts to his letters in the feeble lady-like hand of her predecessor, and there was little chance that Judge Ashley, in his far away home, should discover that another occupied the position of the forsaken Grace and enjoyed her fortune.
               The existence of the child was duly communicated to her grandfather, and the burden of Augusta's postscripts was praises of her baby, as she called the pale puny little being who had inherited all her mother's delicacy of constitution, with much of her father's beauty of person.
               The heiress of the Arden estates was too important a personage to be neglected, and in the luxurious home of her father a suit apartments and two attendants were appropriated to the use of the little girl.
               But with all the attentions lavished on her the child did not thrive, and with extreme difficulty was life kept in her frail form till the close of her second year. She then became so ill that the physicians advised her removal to the country as the only means of saving her life.
               
               Her father, in great agitation, sought an interview with her principal medical attendant, and insisted that his real opinion as to the ultimate chances of life or death for the delicate little creature should be expressed.
               Thus pressed, the Medico said:
               "Your daughter has no constitution, Monsieur. It is a wonder to me that she has lived this long, and, but for my skill, she would have been in her grave long ago. I am sorry to afflict you, but this little one will never reach maturity."
               "That is not what I am asking you, Doctor. Will the child get through now; and, if not, how long do you suppose she may live? It is of vital importance to my interests to have the last question frankly answered."
               "Frankly, then, I have no idea that she will be alive a month hence, and if you have any property arrangements to make that may be contingent on her death, I advise you to attend to them without delay, for the child may not last even that long."
               Ashley's face became livid, and with difficulty he commanded himself sufficiently to thank the speaker for his candor.
               The physician gave him credit for being a most tender parent, when in reality the child herself was of the least possible consequence to him; he only valued her so far as his own interests were bound up with the continuation of her life.
               Though his father was ignorant of his second marriage, all Ashley's foreign friends and a few of his own countrymen residing in Paris, were well aware of it; and if this child perished, his hold on the Arden estates must die with her.
               The next heir to them was a needy and extravagant man, who would lose no time in claiming his rich inheritance ance; and among Ashley's American acquaintances was a friend of James Arden, who would notify him of the decease of the heiress.
               With this dread hanging over him, Ashley sought the boudoir of his wife. The room was fitted up with exquisite taste, and it was crowded with articles of luxury which the expensive whims of Augusta led her to purchase. She was lounging over a new novel; but she threw it aside with sparkling eyes and smiling lips to welcome him on his entrance; for with that fatal power of fascination Ashley possessed for women, Augusta was as completely his slave as the unfortunate Grace had been.
               She observed the state of perturbation in which he was, and softly asked:
               "What is it, love? Has anything happened to disturb you? Evelyn is no worse, for I was in her room not long ago, and left her sleeping calmly."
               "Yes, she sleeps calmly enough, I dare say, but that does not alter the decree which says that her slumbers will soon be endless. Dr. Lemoine says that her days are numbered, and if Evelyn dies, we lose with her all the luxury that surrounds us. The allowance I receive from my father will barely enable us to live respectably; your fortune is a mere trifle, and the large income derived from the Arden estates, supplies us with every luxury by which we are surrounded."
               Augusta slightly changed color, but she hopefully replied:
               "I know how important the life of the child is to us, but if care can save her she will live. Physicians are not always to be relied on in their judgments of the ailments of children. Since Evelyn has been so ill, I have deprived myself of every pleasure to see that she is properly attended to. What can I do more, dear Leon, and why should you look so desperate about her condition?"
               
               For the first time since their marriage he replied to her angrily:
               "Because it is desperate. Dr. Lemoine has just told me that it is impossible for her to live another month, and in spite of your mistrust of his opinion, I believe him. We have that brief time to consider what shall be done, to save ourselves from the consequences of her death, and to act for our own interests."
               "What can you mean?" asked Augusta, in bewilderment. "What can we do to avert the consequences you foresee? I am sure that I shall be quite ready to assist you to the best of my ability."
               "I have never doubted that; but you are singularly obtuse for so sharp a woman as you are, Augusta. Can you not divine what must be done to save us from poverty?"
               "I suppose I must be duller than you thought me, for I do not in the least understand you."
               Ashley arose, glanced into the adjoining room to see that no listening ears were near, and then stooping over his wife, he whispered:
               "We must find another child to take her place, and personate the heiress of the estate I am resolved to retain possession of."
               Augusta started, and shivered; she hurriedly replied, in the same tone:
               "How can that be done with safety to ourselves? If the fraud were detected, we should both be ruined and disgraced."
               "Pooh! it shall not be detected," he firmly replied. "Why should it be? We will remove far from this city; seek and find a child near the same age, and substitute her for the puny creature who has given us so much trouble."
               "But how can we accomplish it without the knowledge of the servants?" objected Augusta, whose heart was filled with dread as to future results to herself and her husband if the crime should chance to be detected.
               Ashley impatiently replied:
               We will discharge them all except the Englishwoman, who has been engaged as nurse to Evelyn. I have remarked her particularly, for I have feared for some time that such a contingency might arise. She is poor and avaricious, I am certain, and for a consideration, she will aid me in accomplishing what must be done, and conceal the exchange we are forced to make. It will be no concern of Jane's, and a destitute child will be brilliantly provided for."
               Augusta made no reply, and Ashley asked, in an irritated tone:
               "You do not object, I hope, Madam!"
               There was something in his voice that startled her, and she shivered as the conviction came to her that even if she dared to object to his plan, her opposition would be crushed down as ruthlessly as that of the most indifferent person who offered to oppose his will.
               She hastened to say:
               "I am startled, love, by the sudden emergency that has arisen; but you are quite right, as you always are. If the poor child is doomed, we must provide for our own safety by finding another to take her place. It will be wronging no one, for you have the best right to the fortune you sacrificed a year of your life to obtain."
               He kissed her and smilingly said:
               "Now you talk like a sensible woman; and I see that you will go heart and soul with me in carrying out the measures that are necessary to self-preservation."
               He paused, and his wife asked:
               "Where are we to find a child, Leon? Will you seek for one in a public asylum?"
               
               "No—o—that would not do. We would be compelled to give our names and residence, and go through numerous formalities before we could gain possession of an enfant trouvé. The nurse, as I said before, will be our surest reliance for help in this strait. I have heard her speak of a sister of hers living somewhere near Paris, who takes children to nurse. We may find one with her that will answer our purpose."
               "Perhaps so—but I dread the thought of putting ourselves so much in Jane's power. Who knows what use she may make of it?"
               "Pooh—don't be a fool, Augusta. Money will induce Jane to serve us, and money will bribe her to hold her tongue. I am sure we shall gain enough by this operation to pay her well."
               Augusta made an effort to smile as she replied:
               "I will try and be wise, Leon; but pray—pray don't call me such a coarse name again; it wounds me deeply—indeed it does."
               "Don't vex me then by objections to anything I may find it necessary to do. There—don't begin to cry and spoil your eyes—you are a beautiful woman still, but no longer an angel; so you must allow me to be a little rude sometimes."
            
            
               CHAPTER XIX.
               BARGAIN AND SALE—A NEW HEIRESS.
               ASHLEY and his new toy made up their first misunderstanding, and after a long and earnest consultation they went together to inspect the condition of the sick child.
               The nurse, a thin, angular, but shrewd-looking Englishwoman, sat beside the bed fanning her charge, and the expression of her face bore out the assertion of Ashley as to her cupidity. She had a covetous eye and a greedy mouth, and her present employer judged her correctly when he pronounced her avaricious and believed her unscrupulous enough to assist him in the fraud he meditated, provided the bribe he offered was sufficiently large.
               She arose when Ashley and his wife went into the sickroom, and with a strong provincial accent, spoke:
               "The little Miss is no better, sir—she seems to be just dwining away with every hour. Ah, my lady! I have had much experience with children, and I am afraid this one is doomed. I shouldn't venture to speak so free like, if I hadn't heard what the doctor said to Mr. Ashley a while since."
               "Nonsense! Doctors are not infallible in their judgments. The child must live—I cannot give her up," said Ashley.
               The woman regarded him earnestly, and after a pause slowly said:
               "Yes—it is a pity she must be taken from you, sir; for you naturally wish to keep her, as she's to have a great fortune one of these days. All her poor mother's money was to have been hers, I have heard the other servants say, if she could only live to enjoy it."
               "Confounded impudence in the servants to be gossiping about my private affairs, I must say," said Ashley, angrily. "Do you suppose that my solicitude about the recovery of my child is caused by so mercenary a feeling as that? I love the little creature, Jane, and if you can save her for me, I will give you something handsome, over and above the wages I now pay you. Understand how important she is to me, and give every thought to her restoration to health. More depends on the nurse than on the physician, in cases like this, and if she lives I will richly repay you."
               "I will do my best, sir, but if it is impossible to save her, what must be done then?"
               Jane looked at him so significantly, that Ashley recoiled from her, and asked:
               "What do you mean? What would you hint at?"
               "Nothing, sir; but if you will have confidence in me in other matters besides the duties of a nurse, you may yet find out that I can materially serve you."
               Ashley stared at the woman as if he did not comprehend her meaning, though he felt that by some subtle intuition she had fathomed the purpose already formed in his mind.
               He haughtily replied:
               "Enough—enough! when I need your assistance I shall ask for it, and not before. I came hither now to inform you that it is my purpose to remove with my sick child to the country to-morrow. We shall take lodgings in some airy cottage till a change for the better takes place in the little girl."
               Jane did not seem at all surprised at this announcement; she respectfully said:
               "If you and Madame will be easily satisfied, sir, I can recommend a quiet, healthy place to you where I know you can be accommodated. I have a sister-in-law, a Frenchwoman she is, who lives in a nice place on the road to St. Cloud. She has three rooms in her house which she lets to lodgers, and I know they are vacant just now. If you think you could be satisfied there, I am sure the air would be good for this poor child, and I shall be glad to have Madeline's rooms taken."
               A glance passed between the husband and wife which plainly said:
               "Nothing could suit us better;" and Ashley said:
               "I will think of it, Jane, and let you know to-morrow; but you can write to your sister and ascertain if she can receive us at once."
               "I will do that immediately, sir, for such a chance must not be lost to my poor Madeline. She's a widow now, for my brother Tom, who came over here as groom to Lord Carleton, and married Maddy on a week's acquaintance, has been dead nigh on to a year, and the poor girl has to scuffle along as well as she can to take care of her little children; and as if they wasn't enough, in all conscience, she's got one child more to look after than she has any right to have."
               "How is that?" asked Ashley, with a keen desire to learn all he could of their proposed hostess, that he might form his own judgment as to the feasibility of carrying out his plan under her roof.
               Jane readily replied:
               "You see, sir, as long as my sister had babies of her own, she took in strange children to nurse with 'em. As her place is healthy, and she is herself a strong looking, rosy-faced woman, she was never at a loss for young ones that paid her well for such care as she gave 'em. She got along well enough till a little more than two years ago."
               Jane paused, and Augusta asked:
               "What happened to her then?"
               "A mighty curious and provoking thing, ma'am. An American gentleman and his wife, who seemed to be in bad health, came out to Maddy's with a baby that looked to be about six months old, and insisted that my sister should take it for a few months. The lady was too ill to attend to it herself, and she wished to leave it with Maddy till she came back from some springs her husband was taking her to for the benefit of her health. They offered such high pay, that there was no refusing them, and the child was left behind 'em.
               "Well, ma'am, they was very liberal in paying in advance for the first three months, and well they might be, for that's the last my sister ever saw of them; the child is still with her, and there seems to be no chance of getting rid of her, as I see."
               A furtive glance at Ashley finished this recital, but he indifferently asked:
               "Did you never hear from those people again? And do you suppose the child was purposely thrown upon your sister's charity?"
               "No, sir, I don't think they meant that when they left her. Maddy heard from 'em once, or rather, she heard from the gentleman. He wrote from Baden that his wife was dead; that as the child was not his own, and would be an encumbrance to him, he declined to return for her; but he sent a thousand francs to my sister to help her to take care of her."
               "Oh, well, it wasn't so bad for her, after all; that was a sufficient provision for a little stray like that, and I dare say your sister is better off than if the child had not been left with her."
               "She might be, if she had the money to take care of her own," replied the woman, significantly. "Since her husband died she's had a hard time to get along with four children to provide for."
               "Perhaps times may mend for her," said Augusta, with a smile. "Who knows what piece of good fortune may be in store for her. I do not know but I may take a fancy to this little waif and adopt her myself."
               "I only wish you would, my lady. She is a pretty, winsome little creature, and you'd find Babette much less trouble than this poor, sickly little darling."
               "Come, Augusta—we have an engagement for the afternoon, and you have your toilette yet to make. Evelyn seems better, in spite of the croaking of Dr. Lemoine, and I do not believe she will die."
               With a glance at the pale child who lay upon her pillows scarcely breathing, the husband and wife left the apartment. Jane looked after them with a grim smile, and a scornful expression came into her eyes as she muttered:
               "You think to deceive me, do you? I've seen through you, Mr. Ashley, for a good many days past. You haven't asked me about my sister and her young ones so particularly without some motive. You want a child in place of this doomed one, and you thought perhaps Maddy would sell one of hers to you. She never would have done that, but this strange child seems to have been left a purpose to make my fortune, for I'll go with her as her nurse, I'm determined, with very, ve-ry high wages."
               The reply to Jane's letter to her sister-in-law duly came, announcing that she was quite ready to receive the new lodgers if they should decide to go to her house. No sooner had Ashley and his wife heard the story of the deserted child, than their minds were made up to take the rooms of Madame Tompkins, and word was sent to that effect.
               On the day afterward, Evelyn was removed thither with her nurse, but Ashley and his wife did not go out till two days later, when they found that no change for the better had taken place in the sick child. This increased their anxiety to see the little Babette of whom Jane had spoken.
               If she was small for her age, healthy and sprightly, she could easily be made to assume the place of the dying infant. They would travel for several years, and on their return to Paris, no one would be able to detect the imposition.
               Jane must have divined what was passing in their minds, for their brief visit to Evelyn's bedside was scarcely ended, when she came in, carrying in her arms a little creature, dressed in a striped petticoat of crimson and black, with a quaint little bodice laced up on her waist. The black hair lay in soft rings upon her sunburned brow, and her large, dark eyes flashed beneath long, silky lashes, as she shyly raised them to inspect the strangers.
               Jane set her upon the floor, and said:
               "This is the child I spoke of, Mr. Ashley; and what is singular to me, if she wasn't so tanned, and the other so pale, I do believe they'd look alike. But the strangest thing of all is, that they both have a great black mole on the same part of the right arm."
               Ashley started, and eagerly approaching the child, examined the mark spoken of. He then keenly regarded her features, and changed color as he thought:
               "If it were not impossible, I should think this was poor Eva's child; but she is safe beneath my father's roof, and the resemblance I see myself to Evelyn is a lucky coincidence for me. It will enable me to place her in the position she is sliding out of, poor thing!"
               He coldly spoke aloud:
               "This is a hardy-looking little creature, but I can trace no likeness between this sunburned little gypsy and my pale, sickly child. What is her name?"
               "We call her Babette, but the man that left her here called her Angeline. As it was a hard name for Maddy to speak, she dropped it altogether, and gave her that of Babette."
               "And the name of the gentleman and lady? You surely remember that."
               "Yes, sir; he put it to the letter he wrote when he sent Maddy the money I spoke of. He signed his name John Allingham."
               "And that is the only clue you have to the friends of this child?"
               "Yes, sir—that is all; though I doubt about her having any friends except my sister and myself. Perhaps you may find it to your interest to become her friend, Monsieur."
               Ashley grew red with anger:
               "What can you mean? Why should you speak thus to me?"
               The woman pointed to the bed on which the dying child lay, and mysteriously said:
               "That one can't last much longer; and as so much money is at stake, why can't you do the sensible thing, and give this poor little child a good chance in the time to come?"
               Although Ashley's mind was already made up to pursue this plan, he was quite taken aback by the brusque proposal of the nurse, and he sternly replied:
               "Do you know that you are tempting me to a fraud, woman? Take the little girl away, if you please, and do not speak to me in this way again."
               "Ta! ta! you're mighty squeamish all at once, because I speak plainly to you; but I can see through you for all that. This child will suit you to a hair; she really is like the other, and she is such a little fairy that she may easily pass for only two years old. To see her is what brought you here, and you know it. But I'll take her away, if you insist upon it."
               She snatched up the child, and was leaving the room in a pet, when Augusta, at a sign from her husband, detained her.
               
               "Do not go just yet, Jane; I have something to say to you. Please to put the little girl down by Mr. Larne, and let her make his acquaintance. Come near me, and stand beside this window."
               The woman obeyed with alacrity; and impelled by an attraction he could not resist, Ashley lifted the child to his knee. She looked keenly at him a few moments, and then suddenly threw her arms around his neck, and kissed him. Babette laughed aloud as he returned her caress, and in a few moments she seemed as much at her ease with her new friend as if she had known him all her life.
               In the mean time Augusta spoke in a low, soothing tone to the offended Jane:
               "You are a shrewd and sensible woman, Jane, and your clear judgment has shown you the course my husband and myself should pursue in this sad crisis of our affairs. I am sure that we are much indebted to you for the hint you have given us, and I believe I can induce Mr. Larne to adopt it when I have had time to talk with him on the subject."
               "Oh! ah, indeed! I hinted it to you, did I? and you never thought of it before! Good; let it be so, ma'am; it don't matter to me how you put it, so Maddy and me make a few thousand francs by the exchange. You see I am fair, and above-board, ma'am; I don't go beating about the bush, a saying of one thing, and meaning of another."
               Augusta repressed the emotion of anger that arose within her at this rude speech, and sweetly said:
               "I like your frankness for my own part, Jane; but I would like you to go a little farther, and tell me how the exchange you propose can be made without others finding it out."
               "Who is to know anything about it that will not be interested in keeping the secret?" asked the woman. "I see that you have left even your own maid behind you in Paris, and in this house there is no one but Maddy and myself to know anything about the exchange. We can easily keep little Babette shut up for a few days, and give out to the children that she is sick. Your rooms won't be entered by them at all, and they are too young to suspect what is going on. When your baby dies, we can bury her as ours, and the living child you can take away with you, keeping me for her maid."
               Augusta smiled faintly, and said:
               "Really, you have a long head, Jane, and you have arranged the whole affair admirably. I will speak to my husband, and try and bring him round to think as we do; for I will not conceal from you that a great deal depends on the life of his child."
               "I thought as much, ma'am, and that made me bold to speak. It ain't wronging nobody, I'm sure. One child dies, and another takes her place; nobody is hurt by such an exchange, and a little creature that has few friends is made comfortable for life. Them's my views, ma'am, and I think Mr. Ashley had better come over to 'em as soon as possible."
               "Perhaps I may induce him to do so; but if I should succeed, what sum will be necessary to purchase your silence, and that of your sister on this transaction?"
               The woman hesitated a moment, and then said:
               "I think a thousand francs apiece will not be too much, and as long as the little one needs a bonne, I shall expect to remain with her at double my present wages."
               After reflecting a few moments, Augusta said:
               "That is not unreasonable, and I will see what can be done. You had better take the child away, now, and I will speak with Mr. Ashley."
               When Jane approached Babette to remove her she clung to her new acquaintance, and in a jargon strange to the ears of her new friends, flatly refused to go with her.
               "Ho! ho! you've taken a mighty fancy to your new papa," said the woman, with a meaning glance at Ashley, who smiled and replied:
               "I only wish she was mine, in place of the poor thing in the bed yonder."
               "If you will listen to Mrs. Ashley, sir, she will show you that where there's a will there's a way, as the proverb says," replied the nurse, as she bore off the struggling child.
               No sooner was the door closed on her than Augusta communicated to Ashley all that had passed between herself and Jane. When she named the sum the woman had demanded, he smiled and said:
               "That is a trifle: if she had known the interests at stake, she would have asked for much more. These women shall have the money, provided they will take a solemn oath never to betray the transaction, even in the confessional. Jane can go with the child as her attendant till we can find a favorable opportunity of getting rid of her. I cannot consent to be long hampered with her presence."
               "I agree with you, but for the present it will be best to keep on good terms with her," replied Augusta, "for she is passionate, and easily irritated. After we have made sure of the child, and the women themselves are compromised by assisting in the fraud, you can take such measures as will enable you to get rid of Jane. I should not fancy having such a Cerberus as she might prove watching over me all the time."
               While they thus talked together, the nurse sought her sister-in-law, and conferred with her on the proposed exchange of the children. On her first arrival at the farmhouse house, Jane had informed Madame Tompkins of the chance she would have offered her to rid herself of the child; but the latter demurred at parting with little Babette, and in reply to something her sister-in-law said, she replied:
               "You know, Jane, that my own baby died soon after this little creature came to me and she took her place in my heart. I have never felt that she is in my way, and the money she brought me bettered my circumstances so much, that I can well afford to keep her. What made you think of getting the child from me in such a shameful manner as this?"
               Jane regarded her with extreme displeasure, and she solemnly replied:
               "Maddy, you were always a soft-hearted dunce, and if I did not look after your interests, I don't know what would become of you. This baby has brought you good luck once, and I insist that she shall continue to do so. She is nothing to you, and if you sacrifice the interests of your own children by insisting on keeping her with you, when money can be made by giving her up, I will never forgive you—never!"
               To the weak-hearted Madame Tompkins this was a terrible threat, for she looked up to her stronger minded sister as her best guide and counsellor. She meekly said:
               "I think it will be wrong to do this thing, Jane; but if you insist on it, I suppose I must give up the poor child. But how do we know that these people will not treat her badly when once she has served their purpose?"
               Jane laughed scornfully.
               "I should like to see them attempt such a thing as that when I am near to defend her. But it's all nonsense for you to fancy such a thing. The sick child is the heiress to a large fortune that comes to her from her mother. If she dies, the money must go to a distant relation, and Mr. Ashley naturally wishes to keep it under his own control. It isn't likely that they would dare to treat the one that takes her place any worse than they would the real heiress: they're much too cunning for that even if Babette had not such a friend as I mean to be to her to take her part."
               "You then think of going away from me to travel with these people, for they will have to go far away from here for a long time to keep others from discovering the cheat that has been accomplished."
               "Yes—I am going with them to look after the child. In two years we can return to Paris, and no one will ever be the wiser about what has been done in this quiet corner. You will get a round sum to console you for giving up Babette, and I shall be making a great deal of money which will some day come to your children, so you may put up awhile with not seeing me."
               The widow sighed, and after a pause of painful thought, said:
               "I do not know that it will be right to put a poor child in the fortunate shoes of a rich one, yet I should like to think of little Babette as growing up to be a grand, rich lady."
               "How do you know that she wasn't born to such luck as that, and you're only restoring her to her birthright? If you thought of the child's good, more than of your own selfish feelings, Maddy, you would never hesitate a moment about accepting this chance to help her."
               Her sister wiped away a stray tear, and said:
               "I do hate to give the little creature up, even for her own good; but you know best, Jane, and you must arrange it your own way. As long as you stay with her, I will try and make myself satisfied about her."
               "Very well, all is right, then," responded Jane, in a more placable tone. "I thought you would be brought to listen to reason, and I assure you that I intend to stay with the child. That smooth-spoken woman and deceitful looking man may try to put me off as much as they will, but I shall prove more than a match for them, I'll warrant," and the shrewd virago nodded her head in a most significant manner.
               The preliminaries being thus settled, on the following day a regular agreement was entered into between the parties, that in consideration of the sum of two thousand francs, to be divided between the sisters, the child known as Babette Tompkins was to be transferred to Leon Larne, to be hereafter known as his daughter, and the heiress to the estates of her supposed mother.
               The sick child continued to sink from day to day, and at the close of Ashley's second week at the farm-house, it was evident that she could not survive forty-eight hours.
               The last act of the drama was then prepared for. A slightly sickening medicine was administered to Babette, which afforded Jane an excuse for putting her to bed, and representing to the elder children that she was too ill to be visited by them.
               A gentle narcotic was infused in her drink, and the child lay in a state of semi-consciousness which enabled Jane to manage her easily. On the second morning, after these measures were taken, the daughter of Grace Arden breathed her last; her wasted body was removed to Babette's bed, and the strange child placed in that of the little heiress.
               In the afternoon a coffin was brought from a neighboring village, and in the night, Evelyn Ashley was quietly interred in the garden attached to the farm-house; few questions were asked by those who were aware of the death which had taken place in Madame Tompkins' family; the little girl was buried beside her deceased husband, and the country people thought it was fortunate for her that the strange child no longer encumbered her.
               Babette received the name of the deceased, and the second day after the unceremonious interment of his daughter, Leon Ashley set out for England, in which country it was his intention to spend several years.
               The infant was soon reconciled to the change in her circumstances. She showed the greatest fondness for Ashley, and he, on his part, seemed to love her far more than he had loved the sickly child of poor Grace. He vainly tried to pension off the nurse; she firmly insisted that if she went, the little girl must accompany her, as she had promised her sister never to leave her.
               At length Ashley became reconciled to the necessity of keeping her, for when he decided to return to Paris at the end of a year, the child was left behind him in a country parsonage, with her nurse to take care of her. The clergyman and his wife were to instruct her till she attained her fifteenth year, when it was Ashley's purpose to transfer her to a fashionable finishing school at Paris.
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               JUDGE ASHLEY AND HIS WIFE SEEK HIS DISCARDED DAUGHTER.
               THE plebeian wife of the aristocratic Judge Ashley stepped as naturally and gracefully into the position to which he elevated her, as if to the manner born.
               The murmurs of the family servants were speedily hushed by the mingled dignity and kindness with which she treated them, and old Jupiter was heard to say:
               "Dat ef de new Mistis were white trash, she'd got the manners and de booktionary larnin' of a lady, anyhow."
               From his dictum there was no appeal, and she who had lately been regarded by the slaves as but one degree above themselves, was willingly treated with the respect she would not have failed to exact as her due had it not been voluntarily paid.
               The friends of the Judge received the information of the misalliance he had made with a spasm of indignation, and it was unanimously decided among them that the young wife should be entirely ignored.
               Little did the new Mrs. Ashley care for them or their decisions. To the amazement of those who supposed that she had married a man so much her senior only to spend his fortune, and drive him to distraction with her caprices, she quietly settled herself down at Ashurst, and seemed to have but one ambition in life,—to prove to her husband that she was happy with him, and needed nothing from the outside world to complete her contentment with the lot she had chosen.
               To prove to others how much he thought of his penniless bride, the Judge fitted up his stately mansion in elegant style, and added new apartments for Mrs. Ashley, which were models of exquisite taste in their appointments.
               He loved to see his young idol beautifully dressed, and for him alone she wore the most elegant and becoming toilettes that could be devised by a skilful city modiste.
               Margaret Wilde would have been most ungrateful not to love the hand which so lavishly poured out its profusion for her gratification, and she did love him after a fashion of her own. She clung to Judge Ashley as a child might cling to the parent whose protection stood between herself and the bitter evils of poverty and loneliness.
               To her temperament, it was supreme contentment to be surrounded by beautiful things; to be lapped in the soft arms of luxury, and know that she was the petted darling of a generous heart, even if the form that enshrined it was beginning to bend with the weight of years.
               To be loved was the great necessity of her nature, and she showed her grey-haired husband that his fond affection was the greatest blessing of the life to which he introduced her.
               Full of vivacity and joyousness, Judge Ashley's Daisy brightened the existence which, before her advent at Ashurst, had been so sombre, and for the first time in his long life, he felt that he was happy.
               The little Bessie was no unimportant personage in the family. She was brought forward in every way by her mother, and taught to use every childish endearment to win the heart of her supposed grandfather. As she developed into a most enchanting sprite, full of winning tricks and frolicksome ways, the Judge soon became almost as much devoted to her as Mrs. Ashley was.
               If a feeling of remorse for the exchange she had made, ever clouded the mind of her mother, it was quickly put aside with the consoling thought that Leon Ashley's daughter was quite as well off as if she were beneath the roof of her ancestors. Mrs. Ashley had no means of hearing from her, for she had cut off all chance of that by the false address she had given to Mrs. Allen; nor did she care to do so.
               She was one of those women who will not think of what is disagreeable; and assured in her own mind that the wrong to the child was not a great one, she gradually ceased almost to remember that she had purchased her present prosperity by an act which, if discovered, must deprive her of her husband's respect, and cover her with shame and confusion.
               Though she had acted wrong in a moment of temptation, Mrs. Ashley could not think, without a pang, that her child would be reared as an impostor; that she would inherit wealth to which she had no title, and she cast about in her own mind for some means of legitimating the claim Bessie might hereafter have to the fortune of the Ashley family.
               The sad story of the discarded daughter recurred to her, and she rejoiced that Mrs. Wentworth had a son who might hereafter be used to further her own purposes. His grandfather had hitherto refused to recognize his claims upon him but Mrs. Ashley decided in her own mind that the lad must be found—must be bound to herself by the ties of affection and gratitude, and in the years to come she would use her influence to bring about a union between himself and her child; thus restoring to him the family inheritance, with the encumbrance of a charming wife.
               In pursuance of this scheme, Mrs. Ashley privately caused advertisements to be inserted in several leading newspapers to the effect that if Mrs. Ellinor Wentworth would apply to the editor and furnish her address, she would hear of something to her advantage.
               Several months passed away before anything resulted from this, and Mrs. Ashley began to give up all hope of hearing from Mrs. Wentworth, when a letter bearing the Baltimore post-mark was forwarded to her by the editor of a paper in that city.
               Judge Ashley never interfered with the actions of his wife, for he had most implicit confidence in her, and the letter was taken into her though the sight of the writing on the envelope caused him to start and change color when his eyes fell upon it.
               The letter contained the following lines:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "If you are really a friend who is anxious to assist me, you cannot come to me too soon, for I am hurrying rapidly to that bourne where human help can no longer reach me. I am dying, but I have a child who will be friendless and homeless when I am gone; and for his sake I reply to the advertisement, which offers aid to me so long forgotten as I have been.
                           "I cannot believe that my hard-hearted father has relented at last, but if God has raised up a friend for my poor Frank in the hour of his deepest desolation, I shall die contented, and forgive the cruel mandate that drove me as an outcast from my paternal home, and left me to struggle with the hard world, of which I was so ignorant when I went forth from my father's house.
                           "Kind stranger, if compassion for my sad fate has really moved your heart toward me, hasten on your path of mercy, or it will be too late to reassure the broken heart of
                           
                              "ELLINOR WENTWORTH."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Deeply moved by the perusal of these lines, Mrs. Ashley pondered on the best means of informing her husband of what she had ventured to do; but he spared her all hesitation by coming into her room in a strange state of agitation, and asking:
               "With whom have you opened a correspondence, Margaret? This is the first letter you have received since our marriage, and I am curious to know who it is from."
               She smiled in his face in her most bewitching manner, detected there the emotion he could not conceal, and with ready tact replied:
               "You recognized the writing on the back of this letter, and I see that you are not offended with me for seeking to open a communication with one you have thrust from your path. Oh! my darling husband, listen to me, and try and understand my feelings on this subject. I cannot bear to live here in such luxury as it pleases you to surround me with, when I know that your own daughter and her son are poor wanderers on the face of the earth, as desolate and forlorn as I myself was before your generous affection lifted me to your side, and made me the sharer of your fortune."
               By the time she finished speaking, the young wife was clinging to his breast with tears standing in her beautiful eyes, and the tremulous tones of her pleading voice touched the finer chords of a nature originally noble, but warped by the sternness which years of arbitrary rule had fostered in him.
               Only of late had Judge Ashley known how sweet it was to bestow happiness by the exercise of a loving, and generous forbearance; with the sunshine of happiness, his adored Margaret had poured into his soul the oil of humanity, and, of late, the old man had regretfully thought of his discarded daughter, and her orphan boy.
               He now smiled grimly upon the beseeching face raised to his own, and gently said:
               "I am not displeased, my Daisy; on the contrary, what you have done elevates you in my estimation; few stepmothers would care to befriend a daughter who will probably turn from you with contempt when she understands the relation existing between you, and myself. Ellinor Wentworth is a woman of extreme haughtiness of temper, and if she had the power, she would trample you into the dust, my precious little Daisy. Why should you have opened a correspondence with her, and who informed you of her existence?"
               "Oh! I learned that before our marriage, and I have been scheming in my own mind ever since, how I should influence you to assist her. I felt sure she needed help, but I had no idea she was so much reduced as she states herself to be. Read this, dear husband, and see for yourself that if we would assist her no time is to be lost."
               She thrust the letter in his hand, and with much emotion tion he perused the blurred lines. When he had finished he gently said:
               "To you I shall owe it, my love, that remorse for my harshness to Ellinor will not follow me to my grave. If she had died in such a state of destitution, I would never have forgiven myself. I will go to her as soon as possible, and see that she has all she needs. The address here given is one of the poorest streets in Baltimore, and she must indeed be reduced to great extremity to take refuge in such a locality as that. Prepare to accompany me, for I must have you with me when I go."
               Mrs. Ashley seemed to shrink from the proposal with that shyness of going into the world which she had evinced ever since her union with him, but her objections were overruled and hasty preparations made for a visit to Baltimore.
               Bessie was left in charge of Winny, and Judge Ashley and his child-wife set out on their errand of mercy.
               They reached Baltimore without accident, and lost no time in seeking the humble quarter of the city to which Mrs. Wentworth had directed the person who was interested in her fate.
               It was arranged between them that Mrs. Ashley should go in first, and gradually inform the long-rejected daughter that her father had forgiven and was ready to receive her to his heart again. She was to show Mrs. Wentworth that this had been done at her own intercession, and then to inform her of the relation in which she stood to her father.
               The house before which the carriage drew up was even more squalid than the Judge had anticipated, and a great pang seized on his heart when he saw to what a child of his had been reduced through his own obstinacy and hardness of nature. It was a lodging-house of the poorest description in which Mrs. Wentworth and her son had taken refuge, and, as Mrs. Ashley alighted, the Judge hurriedly said:
               "I cannot stop here, Daisy; the place is too dreadful. I will drive around the square, and gain a more respectable street. In half an hour I shall return to see my poor girl. Heaven speed you on your mission, my angel wife."
               She smiled sweetly in reply, kissed her hand, and tripped up the dirty steps that led into a carpetless and squalid looking hall, which seemed to be used in common by all the lodgers in the house.
               On inquiring for number thirty-five, a red-faced woman, who was carrying a bucket of water, paused and asked:
               "Is it the sick woman you're asking after, ma'am? I don't think you can do much for her now besides buying her a coffin, poor thing!"
               "Is Mrs. Wentworth so ill as that?" involuntarily asked the visitor. "Pray tell me where I shall find her room at once."
               "I don't know what her name is, but number thirty-five lodges in the attic, and if you'll keep going up and up, you'll find her room at the head of the last stairs."
               Thanking the speaker, Mrs. Ashley daintily lifted her sweeping skirts, and ascended the stairs. The way darkened as she went up, and at the end of the third flight it was so gloomy that she was compelled to peer around to discover the number she sought.
               At last it was found, but just as she had raised her hand to knock upon the door, it was suddenly flung wide open, and a boy of six summers rushed forward with a frightened cry into the very arms of the visitor.
               "What is it, dear? Why are you so much alarmed?" she hurriedly asked.
               "Go in—go in there and see," sobbed the child. "My poor mamma looks so strange that she scares me with her wild eyes, and the rattling noise in her throat. Where's Mrs. Moody? I want her to come to her."
               "Never mind Mrs. Moody; come back with me, my son, and I will see what is the matter with your mother."
               The boy glanced up at her fair face, and seemed reassured by its sweet expression, and the gentleness of her manner. He turned back at once, and ushered Mrs. Ashley into the sordid apartment occupied by his mother.
               The room was lighted by two dormer windows, destitute of curtains, through which the bright glare of the sun streamed: there was nothing in it save the barest necessaries of life, and those of the commonest description. On the wretched bed lay the form of a woman, evidently hastening with rapid strides to the last struggle of life. All that remained of the once proud and lovely Ellinor Ashley was a wasted skeleton, lying on a coarser sheet than she would once have thought good enough for one of her father's slaves.
               The thoughtful visitor had provided for such a contingency as this; she had brought with her a small bottle of wine, which she hastily took from her pocket, and removing her gloves, she broke off the neck of the bottle, and poured some of the grateful stimulant into the half open mouth of the expiring woman.
               In a few moments its effects were perceptible, for life seemed to rally once more. Mrs. Wentworth fixed her glazing eyes upon the stranger, and with much effort asked:
               "Are you the writer of that advertisement? Have you come to do something for that helpless child? He is my only care now."
               "I have come to take you both away with me," was the gentle reply. "Drink more of this wine, and it will give you strength to hear what I have to tell you."
               Mrs. Wentworth put it feebly from her.
               "It is too late now; nothing can bring back life to me. I shall perish here in this foul den, forsaken of all who might have aided me, and saved me from what I have endured."
               "Not forsaken by all, believe me; for one friend has heard of your situation, and his heart is moved with pity and repentance. He has forgiven—he will receive you again as his daughter."
               The wan face lighted up, and the dying woman more strongly exclaimed:
               "My father sent you hither. He has relented at last, but ah! it is too late to be of any benefit to me. But why does he not come to me himself? Why does he send a stranger on this errand? Come here, Frank; you will no longer be poor and forsaken; your grandfather is rich—rich! When I am gone he will take you to his home, and make you the sharer of his wealth. Is it not so, Madam? Have you not come here to tell me that my child shall no longer be an outcast from the home of his forefathers?"
               "I have come to do more than that: I have used all my power to restore your father to you, Mrs. Wentworth, and he will be here in a few moments now; he is prepared for the meeting, and you must summon all your strength for the interview that approaches."
               Mrs. Wentworth uttered a low moan, and buried her face in the pillow; the relation in which her visitor stood to her father did not seem to have yet occurred to her, and she lay panting as if battling with the grim conqueror for the few remaining sands of life left to her.
               At the call of his mother, Frank scrambled upon the bed, and the eyes of the visitor now fastened themselves upon him with vivid interest.
               He was a fair, noble-looking child, with a broad brow, and a quantity of blonde hair hanging in neglected curls around it. When properly clothed and well fed, Mrs. Ashley saw that he would soon become a very handsome little fellow, and she smiled on him as she felt that her plans for the future were feasible at least.
               At length Mrs. Wentworth feebly said:
               "If the old man does not hurry, he will be too late, too late—for I feel that I am rapidly sinking. But who are you, and why has he sent you hither to prepare the way for himself?"
               "I am a particular friend," replied Mrs. Ashley, evasively. "It is I who intend to adopt your son, and rear him as my own. Judge Ashley has granted this to my earnest entreaties."
               A sudden light seemed to dawn on the sick woman, and her rapidly dimming eyes were fixed upon her visitor with an expression that was the reverse of friendly; a spasm of pride convulsed her heart, and she haughtily asked:
               "Are you the girl who has entrapped that old man into a marriage so unsuited to his years and station?"
               Mrs. Ashley bowed without speaking, although she acutely felt the contempt implied in the voice and words of the speaker.
               "And do you speak of taking my child as an object of charity. You, who were lately the hired nurse of my brother's daughter. Oh God! my pride is indeed brought low!"
               She sunk back, breathing with such difficulty that Mrs. Ashley believed she would lose her frail hold on life before the arrival of her father. Although Mrs. Wentworth had spoken so insultingly to her, she could not feel resentment toward a being situated as she was, and she hastened to administer wine to her, and to chafe the cold hands that lay upon the coverlet.
               This seemed to touch the dying woman, and after a few moments she burst in tears and murmured:
               "Pardon me—I was mad, and ungrateful to speak as I did. You are a good woman, even if you were born among the lowly ones of the earth; and I can see for myself that you are a fair and gentle-looking one. My father was not so much to blame after all, in making you his wife."
               Mrs. Ashley deprecatingly said:
               "I try to make him happy, Mrs. Wentworth; and I believe that thus far I have succeeded. I sought you out because I could not bear to think that a child of his dwelt in poverty while his wealth is prodigally lavished for my indulgence. Only consent to give me your son, and I will make myself responsible for his future. I will pledge myself to do all that is in my power to give him at least a fair share of his grandfather's estate."
               "You can never accomplish that," moaned Mrs. Wentworth. "My father never loved me as he loved Leon, and to his child all will be bequeathed. All will go to the girl, while my boy may be thankful if shelter, and an education befitting his birth, are afforded him."
               "For many years he will need no more than that," gently replied her visitor. "No more, save the tenderness of a mother, and that I promise to supply to him."
               Tears streamed slowly over the pallid cheeks of the listener, and quite softened toward her stepmother, she made an ineffectual effort to clasp her hand as she said:
               "Can you forgive the cruel words I spoke just now? An angel was sent to me, and I was ready to reject her ministrations with the hard scorn of my original nature. When God has brought me so low as I now am, the sinful spirit of pride should be dead within me, but it still flames up at intervals as it did just now. I give you my son, Mrs. Ashley; rear him as your own; make him a good and honorable man, and the Father of the orphan will care for the rest."
               "I pledge myself to do that," was the eager reply; "and in the future who knows but he may win the heart of the heiress, and in the time to come rule as master of Ashurst."
               From the dead ashes of her perishing life sprang the last throe of pride in the heart of the listener; and her large, black eyes blazed with excitement as she replied:
               "Oh, if that could be! if that could ever be, I should die happy."
               "It shall be," was the reply breathed into her ear, as a heavy, hesitating step was heard ascending the stairs, which finally paused near the half-open door.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               A GREAT PERIL.
               MRS. ASHLEY recognized the step of her husband, and she sprang to meet him, while Mrs. Wentworth, with a last effort of strength, half arose, and fixed her wild black eyes upon the door.
               Judge Ashley stepped in, glanced around the wretched apartment, and in an agony of feeling, threw himself upon his knees beside his daughter's bed. In suffocated tones he exclaimed:
               "Oh, my God, Ellinor, I never dreamed that you could be brought to such a pass as this!"
               A bitter smile curled the lip of his daughter, and she faintly said:
               "This is nothing to the privation I have known. More than once I have literally had no place on which to lay my head. The charity of strangers supplied to me then what my father so persistently refused."
               The old man seemed overwhelmed by this reproach; he spoke with intense emotion:
               "I have been too hard—too hard, and I am punished by finding you too late to offer such atonement as might have been possible. Oh! Ellinor, my child, forgive me for my cruelty—I believed you had resources within yourself which would enable you at least to live respectably."
               "Such as I possessed I used. I tried teaching, but without success, for my education had been too superficial to render me a good instructress to others. I then had no resource but my needle, and the scanty gains an unskilful seamstress can gain, barely served to keep life in my boy and myself. Oh, father, father, why did you put me from your heart for my one fault, when you have pardoned my brother so many of his?"
               Judge Ashley arose in deep emotion; he bent over the pale face of his daughter, and said:
               "When Leon angered me as you did by making a misalliance, I also sent him from me, though I did not cast him off. That I have sought you out should prove to you that I have also forgiven you, and restored you to the place you once held in my affections."
               Mrs. Wentworth made a vain effort to reply. The faint spark of life which the stimulant she had taken had thus far kept alive, now fluttered, and in spite of the efforts of her new friend to restore her, it faded out in the agitation of meeting her long-estranged father. She raised her chilled hand, and placed it on the shoulder of her son, and pressing him into his grandfather's arms, murmured:
               
               "Take him—be a father to him, and I forgive as I am forgiven."
               With the utterance of the words life passed away, though it was many moments before Judge Ashley could be convinced that she had really perished in the first hour of reconciliation. He was so overcome with grief and remorse that it tasked all his wife's efforts to console him. She at length persuaded him to return to the hotel, and send such assistance as was necessary to have the body of his daughter removed to a more respectable locality, from which it could be taken to the family burying ground at Ashurst for interment.
               Two of the lodgers, whom the wild cries of Frank had drawn to the scene of death, volunteered to remain with the dead and prepare her for interment. A larger sum of money than either of them had ever before possessed was forced on them by the repentant father in return for their proffered services.
               Mrs. Ashley left them with the assurance that in as brief a time as possible, such articles as would be needed in shrouding the corpse should be sent in, together with the undertaker's men with the sealed case in which Mrs. Wentworth was to be removed to Ashurst.
               Before removing Frank, she took him to his mother's side, and bade him give her his farewell kiss; she severed a lock of hair from her head to be given to him hereafter, and with some difficulty, at last bore him from the wretched spot on which so much bitter suffering had been endured.
               For many hours after their return to the hotel, Judge Ashley shut himself up alone, and even his darling Daisy did not venture to intrude upon him. She spent the intervening hours in soothing the passionate grief of little Frank, and providing him with garments suited to his new condition.
               A clothing store furnished every variety to select from, and a handsome wardrobe was purchased for the lad, and packed ready for removal on the next morning. One black suit was laid out for present use, the tangled locks of the child were clipped into short rings, which clung to his shining forehead after the ablutions Mrs. Ashley's servant gave him, and the neglected child of poverty was transformed, as if by magic, into one of the "curled darlings" of the wealthy.
               For a few moments Frank hushed his sobs to admire his fine clothes, but the memory of that ghastly face again came back, and the pitiful cry of "Mamma—mamma; let me go to mamma!" again arose.
               Mrs. Ashley took him on her lap, spoke soothingly to him, and presently induced him to listen to her words.
               "Your mamma has gone to live with the angels, Frank. The good Father of all earthly creatures has taken her to heaven, and you must try and be a good boy, to meet her there when you are called on to die in your turn."
               The child raised his head and regarded her with dilating eyes; he defiantly said:
               "What did God want with her? He's got plenty more to stay with him, and I had only poor mamma. Please, ma'am let me go back to her, for I know she is wanting me now."
               "Poor child! on this earth she will never want you again. I am your mother now, Frank. She gave you to me, and I will be as kind to you as she could be, if she yet lived."
               The child wistfully regarded her.
               "You are a pretty lady, but you are not my mamma, and I don't want you for a mother. Let me go back to the old room, and get her to speak to me again."
               "I cannot do that, my child, for it would displease your grandfather. You must now do as he wishes, and if you will be very good, perhaps he will permit you to look upon your poor mother again."
               The lad sobbed and cried piteously at this refusal; the idea of death had never before been presented to him, and he could not understand why he was separated from the mother he had left lying on her bed, looking as he had often seen her look when she only slept.
               Exhausted with the various excitements of the day, Mrs. Ashley at length gave Frank a composing draught, which soon quieted his moans in sleep. She lay down beside him, and fell into a light slumber which lasted more than an hour. From this she was suddenly aroused by the sound of a familiar voice which seemed almost beside her.
               With a cold dew bursting from her brow, she started up in extreme perturbation, and glanced wildly around the room. There was no one in it but herself and the sleeping child, and she listened eagerly for the voice to speak again.
               The evening was warm, the transom above the door was open, and the lull in the bustle of a great city, which takes place as twilight is gathering, enabled her to hear with distinctness every word that was uttered in the corridor near the door.
               With every sense strained to its utmost tension, Mrs. Ashley listened so long for something more to be said, that she began to hope it was not a vivid dream which had so startled her, when the same voice again spoke:
               "I would have sworn that it was she; yet, as you say, I must have been mistaken. The lady I took for Margaret is the wife of a wealthy Marylander. Of course she could never have attained such a position as that; but all my efforts to learn anything of her since I came in from my last cruise have proved ineffectual, and I am so impressed with the idea that this lady and the daughter of my old friend are one, that if I were not compelled to be on board my ship to-night, I would make some further investigations."
               "You would have your trouble for nothing," replied a voice that was unknown to the eager listener. "I know something of this Judge Ashley, and he is one of the haughtiest aristocrats in the State. He cast off his daughter because she made what he considered a low match, though the man she married had everything to recommend him, except want of fortune. You may be sure that he would never elevate the penniless daughter of a sea captain to the position of his wife."
               "What you say is reasonable enough, but still I would almost swear to her identity. It seems to me impossible that two women should be so wonderfully alike."
               "Pooh! nonsense, Martin, you have been drinking so much wine that you are not exactly in a state to judge of the resemblance which has so much struck you. Come to your room, and try and get straight before you report yourself on board."
               Martin replied, in a tone of vexation:
               "I am not drunk; my perceptions are as clear as yours, and if I were not going on a three years' cruise immediately, I would come to the bottom of this mystery. I am almost tempted to knock at this door now, and ask to see Mrs. Ashley."
               The speakers were standing exactly in front of her door, and their voices came to the ear of the startled listener with perfect distinctness. Almost breathless from excitement, she arose, and noiselessly drew near the door, fearing every moment that a demand for admittance would be made; but Martin was finally dissuaded from making an attempt to see her, though the two went on with their conversation, to which she listened in an agonizing state of suspense.
               
               A few more sentences were uttered which seemed to freeze the very blood in her veins, and pallid as death, with her eyes staring wildly at vacancy, she tottered back to the bed on which Frank lay, and fell senseless beside him.
               An hour later, when the servant brought up Mrs. Ashley's supper, she found her mistress looking as if she had passed through a violent spell of illness. Her features were colorless and drawn, and there was an expression of uncertainty and anguish in her eyes that alarmed the woman. She said:
               "You are looking very strange, mum. Shall I speak to Marster an' let him know that you are not well?"
               Thus aroused to the necessity of concealing her agitation, Mrs. Ashley replied:
               "There is no need of that. Nothing is the matter with me. I am only tired and worn out with all I have gone through to-day. Give me some tea and I shall soon be better."
               The woman silently obeyed, and at the command of her mistress soon withdrew.
               Left alone, Mrs. Ashley rose and paced the floor in a state of wild excitement that seemed allied to madness. Throwing her arms at intervals above her head, she muttered, in tones of smothered anguish:
               "Oh! if I could retrace my steps! if I could be as I was but one little year ago, how gladly would I go back to poverty—to truth—to honesty again! but it is too late—too late! My wrong has already borne its bitter fruit, and my punishment will prove more fearful yet. I dare not attempt to extricate myself from the maze of falsehood in which I have lost all—all! To do so would be ruin to myself—wretchedness to the poor old man who so tenderly cherishes me. I should be cast out into poverty and wretchedness worse than I have ever endured; my child possibly torn from me; no—no—no—I will bear anything sooner than that. Any degradation may come to myself, if I can only keep her, my darling and my pride."
               Exhausted by her rapid and continuous walk to and fro, she at length sunk down on a chair, and, veiling her face with her hands, tried to think—to determine what was best for her to do in the dire strait in which she found herself placed.
               Gradually through the chaos of her mind, penetrated the thought that she must go to Judge Ashley, and endeavor to comfort him under the remorse he was suffering for his long neglect of his daughter. By this time he would receive her, and doubtless was now expecting her to come to him, and probably feeling hurt that she had not before done so.
               She bathed her face, swallowed a draught of ice water, and putting the strongest constraint upon herself, knocked softly upon the door which opened into his apartment.
               He bade her come in, and when she stood beside him, he folded his arms around her, and said:
               "I have been expecting you to come in for the last hour, my pet; why have you stayed away from me so long?"
               She seemed to shrink from his caress, and after struggling to steady her voice, she replied:
               "Poor Frank grieved so much, and I had such trouble to soothe him to sleep, that I felt quite exhausted. I fell asleep beside him, and—and that is the reason I did not come to you before."
               Her voice sounded strange to herself, and its dull monotonous tones struck upon the ear of the Judge. He quickly said:
               "You have worn yourself out with that irritable child. Why could not Sally attend to him—what was the use of bringing her with you, if she could not spare you trouble of that kind?"
               "The child would not have listened to her, and it was not much to do for a motherless little creature like that. Don't feel vexed with him on my account, please; I shall be well and bright to-morrow. My head aches now, but a good night's rest will cure it. I will go back to Frank for to-night, if you will consent that I shall remain with him. I thought I could offer you some comfort by coming here, but I cannot—I cannot."
               The weary head fell upon his breast, and her hysterical excitement found vent in a passionate burst of tears. Judge Ashley took her in his arms and carried her into the next room, soothing her as he might have soothed a child. She clung to his hand after he placed her upon the bed, and faltered:
               "Would you believe that I could be guilty of a criminal action, even if others accuse me of it, Judge Ashley? Would you listen to any accusation against me if I told you that I was innocent?"
               Her excitement alarmed him, and he tenderly said:
               "No, my darling; if all the world accused you, and you declared yourself innocent, I would take your word, even if circumstantial evidence condemned you. But you are ill, Daisy; you must be delirious to talk in such a strain as this."
               A strange laugh came from her lips, and she said:
               "I believe I am distraught. I feel fever rising in my veins, but I must get home before I can afford to be ill. Yes—yes—I will get home and stay there. Don't ask me to come away from it again—pray don't. I am happy there, and safe—safe—Oh! I wish I had never come here—never heard—oh! my God! am I going wild! am I losing all power to restrain my tongue!"
               She looked so wild and feverish, that the Judge was thoroughly alarmed, and he insisted that she should retire to bed at once and endeavor to compose herself to sleep.
               It was easy enough to obey the first, but the last seemed impossible of attainment.
               Mrs. Ashley felt as if she should never again be able to compose the tumult of contending emotions that raged in her heart; but she laid her head upon its uneasy pillow, closed her aching eyes, and made the doting old man believe that she at length slept, in the hope that he would seek the repose she knew he so greatly needed.
               He refused to leave his idol, and ordered a couch to be placed near the bed on which she lay, that he might watch over her through the night. It was a weary, weary vigil to his poor crushed Daisy, who could not utter in his presence the moans of anguish that arose to her lips to be forced back again upon her aching heart. She believed the wrong she had committed was almost atoned for during those hours of suffering, and laid the flattering unction to her soul that since the deed was irrevocable, she might yet find pardon for her sin.
               On the following morning she was too ill to rise till late in the day, and she did not leave her room till the carriage which was to take them to the dépôt was at the door.
               Then, heavily veiled, almost sustained by the supporting arm of the Judge, she descended the stairs and stepped into the vehicle. She wondered if Martin was actually gone, or if he was in the crowd watching to discover some further proof of the fatal identity he suspected, and she trembled and grew cold at the thought.
               Mrs. Ashley dared not look around to see if a once familiar face was among the group near the door, and she cowered down upon her seat, and drew her shrouding veil more closely around her. She drew a deep breath as the carriage rolled away from the hotel without the detection she so deeply dreaded, and her usual presence of mind returned as the distance from the scene of danger increased.
               The dépôt was gained without any accident, and the party took their places in the cars. The bell was ringing, and Mrs. Ashley wished they would start without a moment of further delay, for every instant, she believed, was fraught with danger to herself.
               At length the train was put in motion, but so slowly that she could see what was going on without. A cab came rapidly toward the dépôt, driven by a young man in a naval uniform. Mrs. Ashley trembled, and sunk suddenly back upon her seat, for the occupant of the cab drew up to one side, and eagerly scanned every opening as the long train slowly got under way.
               With an air of extreme disappointment, he muttered:
               "Baffled at last! After all my trouble in getting leave to come ashore for the few last hours, the bird has flown, and I have not found out if it was Margaret Brandon. But I am a fool to think that she could ever become the wife of that old millionaire, even if she dared do such a thing."
               The train vanished, and whipping up his horse, Martin returned to the city, baffled for that time, but resolute to follow up the clue accidentally gained, whenever time and opportunity allowed him to do so.
               The heavy pulsations of Mrs. Ashley's heart did not cease till they were whirling along at a rate that defied pursuit, and she then became faint at the thought of the danger she had so narrowly escaped. She mentally murmured:
               "Three years—three years of safety—for he said he would be away that long. In that time I can take such measures to evade him as must prove successful. Yes, yes, I must—I must—for everything is now at stake for me."
               The Judge watched over her with extreme solicitude, for he saw that something had given a shock to her which threatened to produce serious consequences. Aware of his uneasiness concerning herself, Mrs. Ashley summoned all her energies to her assistance to enable her to sit up till she was again safe at Ashurst.
               Then, the long tension ended, there was no longer a necessity for self-control, and the sufferer succumbed beneath the mysterious weight that was pressing her to the dust. She was too ill to attend the quiet funeral of Mrs. Wentworth, and Dr. Manton was immediately summoned to her side.
               He pronounced her nervous system deranged by some recent shock, and ordered sedatives. The invalid listened to him vaguely, and slyly threw away his medicines, in place of taking them. She felt convinced that they could do her no good; the death struggle between the last remains of principle and the voice of self-interest was wearing her to the grave; but she persuaded herself that she had now no other path open to her than the one which led to sin and degradation. The first crime against a helpless infant had plunged her into a sea of wrong from which there was no escape for her without irretrievable ruin to herself and the child for whom she had risked so much; and slowly and gradually she reconciled herself to the position she felt in a manner forced to occupy.
               For herself there was nothing now left but to cling to the worldly prosperity she had purchased at the sacrifice of everything she had once valued, and her final resolution was to retain it at all hazards.
               Mrs. Ashley felt that she was a worse woman for every struggle in which she conquered, for she was rebelling against her best instincts, and clutching to her heart the price which had been paid for the soul which was once pure and noble, though it had veiled its crest before poverty and temptation.
               During this season of suffering, her conduct toward the Judge was even more capricious than it had been before their union. At times she would scarcely permit him to approach her, but seeing how unhappy that rendered him, she would repent of her coldness, and herself lavish caresses upon him, and entreat him to pardon her waywardness. This he readily did, for he still adored her through every phase of her capricious and inscrutable character.
               Many months of perfect calm at length in a measure restored her tranquility; her mind, long vibrating between right and expediency, finally settled on the last, and the struggle ended.
               Mrs. Ashley seemed to regain her old elasticity of temperament and gayety of heart, but a harder expression than was natural to her charming features settled upon them, and it was evident that a change had passed over her which was not for the better.
               Frank Wentworth fell naturally into his place in the family, and he soon fondly attached himself to the adopted mother, who, even in her moments of greatest irritability, never failed to speak kindly and gently to the orphan boy.
               He bore no resemblance to his mother's family, which was a source of regret to his grandfather; it was long before Judge Ashley could overcome his repugnance to the memory of his father sufficiently to caress his son; but gradually the fearless and clever lad made his way to the heart which had so long closed itself against him, and Frank took the place in his grandfather's affections and home to which he was justly entitled.
               The fondness of the lad for Bessie was the first thing that touched the old man; she now began to toddle about, and speak in the first imperfect accents of babyhood.
               Judge Ashley watched the children with extreme interest from day to day, as they played together, and it interested him to see with what care Frank would shield the younger one from every danger, and his tact and tenderness, he thought, gave a clue to the character of the future man.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXII.
               HUNTED DOWN.
               AFTER the clouded days which followed the visit to Baltimore, a long period of sunshine rested on Ashurst; and Judge Ashley seemed to grow younger in the genial atmosphere of peace and affection which surrounded him.
               Mrs. Ashley was certainly a model wife and mother, for she neglected no duty that devolved upon her; she made her husband happy; was adored by the children, and respected by her servants.
               Nearly three years lapsed away in this Eden-like calm, when the mistress of the house was again attacked with the nervous restlessness which had so nearly proved fatal to her once before. She secluded herself as much as possible in her own chamber, and even there she would start and change color at the approach of a strange step, or a sudden knock upon the door.
               Again the family physician was baffled, and she locked deep in her own heart the cause of her illness. Again that bitter struggle between principle and interest convulsed both heart and brain; but, as before, the latter conquered, though the bitter anguish with which she often muttered, "Too late—too late!" was pitiable.
               If she had sinned, she suffered, for by yielding to temptation she had entangled herself in a net from which there was no escape, yet which she feared was gradually narrowing around her with every passing hour. If detection fell upon her now, she was ruined, destroyed—nothing would be left to her but to hide her head in shame and die.
               During this season of suffering Mrs. Ashley would scarcely permit her child to be absent from her a moment. The very danger that menaced them both seemed to strengthen the fond maternal love she had always felt for her daughter.
               She would sit for hours with the little girl clasped in her arms, using every art to amuse and detain her; and this was easily accomplished, as Bessie's playmate now went regularly to a school in the neighborhood; and in Frank's absence the child was glad to have her Minny, as she called Mrs. Ashley, to play with and amuse her.
               Her passionate affection for the little girl was commented on by every one that saw them together; but with ready tact, Mrs. Ashley managed to avert suspicion by caressing Frank with nearly as great a show of affection when he was near her. She was really very fond of the bright and promising lad, but the only creature that entered into her heart of hearts was her own darling, who seemed all the nearer to her because others were ignorant of the tie that bound them together.
               One afternoon the Judge came into her room and found Bessie, with her little, dimpled hands clasped in those of her mother, on whose lap she was kneeling. She stretched out her fat arms to their utmost extent, and pressed her rosy lips to those of Mrs. Ashley, ending each performance with a burst of ringing laughter.
               He half-envied the perfect good understanding that seemed to exist between them, and the child turned her charming face toward him and said:
               "Dan'pa, we's mes'rin' love-ribbin; aint it nice?"
               "It seems to be, from the way you and Minny appear to enjoy it. I do believe, Daisy, that if this little creature were your own child, you could not love her more dearly than you do."
               Mrs. Ashley flushed and grew pale, as she replied:
               "Was she not my nurse child? Why, then, shall I not love her; especially as she took the place of one that was removed from me?"
               "True, my love; Bessie was sent as a consolation, and your tender heart accepted her as such. I understand the feelings you cherish for my pretty pet. It is strange, but neither of my grandchildren bear the slightest resemblance to my family. If it were not for the mark on Bessie's arm, I should be almost tempted to believe that she is not of my blood; and Frank is the living image of his father."
               For an instant the heart of the listener stood still, but she rallied her courage sufficiently to say:
               "Bessie may grow like your family as she advances toward womanhood. She is such a baby yet that you cannot tell what she will be in the future."
               The Judge lifted a ring of soft hair from the brow of the child, and said:
               "I can easily tell that this golden-brown aureole that crowns her like a halo will never darken to the dusky tint which my family derive from their inheritance of Indian blood; nor those limpid greyish-blue eyes ever assume the flashing blackness of those of my race. No—the child is a blonde. I suppose she is like her mother, and I am quite satisfied that it shall be so, for her father was anything but a pride and a comfort to me."
               
               He sighed heavily as he finished speaking, and anxious to turn the conversation from the dangerous topic of the little girl's appearance, Mrs. Ashley said:
               "You have never yet confided to me the mystery concerning your son, which you have more than once hinted at. As Bessie's father, I naturally feel a deep interest in learning what caused his early death. Will you tell me now? I am just in the mood to hear it, for I need something to arouse and excite me."
               "I have often wished to tell you this sad story, Daisy, but its very memory is so terrible to me that I always have shrunk from it. Since it is your wish to know what has been too long concealed from you, I will reveal the disgraceful secret now."
               Mrs. Ashley trembled in spite of herself, for there was something ominous in the voice and manner of the Judge, and she wondered why she should be moved at the prospect of hearing a revelation she had long desired; one which she had no idea could possess any peculiar interest for herself. She faintly said:
               "If it will not distress you too much, I shall be glad to hear the story now."
               He sat down beside her, kissed Bessie, and placing her on the floor, bade her run out on the lawn and play with Winny till her Minny called her again. Glad to escape into the sunshine, the child shook her radiant curls and rushed out, calling loudly on the name of her nurse.
               Mrs. Ashley arose and ran her slender fingers through the whitened locks of her husband, as she caressingly said:
               "Something has troubled you to-day, love. Shall I not share your burdens, as well as your joys? Tell me what has moved you, that I may endeavor to console you."
               Judge Ashley drew her down beside him, and after a pause said:
               "I have been thinking of that sad, sad time, my love, before you came hither to become the light and life of my desolate existence. Through all these happy years, Margaret, I have had one concealment from you which has now become a burden. My pride has hitherto withheld me from speaking of it even to you; but to-day letters have come to me of so unexpected a nature that I must speak of this new trouble to some one in whose sympathy and discretion I have perfect reliance."
               "You may trust me as your second-self," was the reply, and with a glance of fond confidence the Judge replied:
               "I know it, my good little Daisy, and I have come to you for consolation and advice."
               He paused, and she waited in a state of nervous impatience for him to explain himself. He vaguely went on:
               "We were speaking of Leon. Have you seen the grave-stone in the burying-ground which bears his name? But why should I ask such a question? of course you have seen it."
               "Yes—I have seen it many times."
               Judge Ashley regarded her steadily as he asked:
               "What would you say to me if I should tell you that the marble lies—that no son of mine lies below it?"
               Mrs. Ashley shrank from the searching glance he fixed upon her; she felt herself growing pale, and a death-like chill seemed to strike to her very soul. She faintly gasped:
               "Where then is he? What have you done with him during all these years?"
               He drew a long breath and said:
               "Let me tell you the story from the beginning, Margaret, and then you will be able to find some excuse for the deception I was compelled to practice. In those days I was hard—hard as the nether millstone, and pride was the strongest feeling of my nature. It led me to cast off my daughter when she made a poor marriage, and refuse all her prayers for forgiveness. It led me to pronounce upon my unhappy son the sentence of legal death; expatriation from his native land, and the renunciation of the name I no longer considered him worthy to bear. Margaret, you came to me as the spirit of mercy and love; you have changed my nature, and it is due to you to confide entirely in you."
               Mrs. Ashley listened in painful bewilderment. Was she to understand that the supposed father of the heiress yet lived? that he might yet, not only snatch from her daughter the inheritance she had sacrificed so much to secure for her, but he might use his parental authority to take from her protection the child he believed to be his own.
               The last thought almost deprived her of breath, and with difficulty she said:
               "Leon Ashley then lives. It was unkind to conceal this from me so long. Pray let me hear the story you proffered to tell me, that I may understand the necessity for banishing him from his home and country."
               "You shall hear it, Margaret, and judge between him and me."
               As concisely as possible Judge Ashley went over the story of that fatal bridal night; he concealed from her the forcible entry of his son into his library, but clearly gave his other reasons for dooming him to exile and supposed death.
               Mrs. Ashley listened like one in a dream, and then asked:
               "How has this secret been so well kept? I have been under this roof more than four years, and this is the first intimation I have had of the criminal course of your son."
               With some of his old sternness, the Judge replied:
               "My servants, when you first came, knew better than to gossip to a stranger about the disgraceful conduct of Leon. Besides, they felt it almost as a personal stigma on themselves. After you became my wife, of course their lips were sealed on such a subject. Old Jupiter is the only one who is aware that my reckless son yet lives, and he would be torn by wild horses sooner than betray it, unless I commanded him to speak."
               "Where is Mr. Ashley now, and what is his history since he left his native land?" she forced herself to ask.
               "He has travelled much, but at this time he is in Italy, and he has written to make the strangest confession to me. In spite of all my efforts to induce Grace Arden not to trust him with her life and fortune, she insisted that as their marriage was legal, she was bound to follow him into exile since it was his wish that she should do so. She eloped with him under his assumed name, and was again married to him on their way to Baltimore. She went with him to Europe, and at her request, I acted as agent for her, receiving her income, and transmitting it to her to Paris.
               "Until to-day I believed that Grace was contented with the lot she had chosen, and happy in the child she bore in the first year of her marriage; but I have the sorrow of now knowing that Leon has systematically deceived me for the last three years, and the woman he now claims as his wife, has assisted him to do so."
               "What woman? and what has become of Grace?" asked the deeply interested listener.
               Since Leon Ashley had another child who was the heiress to her mother's fortune, he would be likely to leave the abandoned one to those who had so long cared for her.
               The Judge sadly went on:
               "My son's last wife has recently become the mother of a son, and he has written to me to confess what has been so long concealed. It seems that at the birth of her daughter, Grace Arden lost her reason, and she has been in a mad-house from that time till her death, which took place about two months ago.
               "When assured by her physicians that Grace would never recover her reason, Leon obtained a divorce and married an American lady, who, he assures me, has made him a most excellent and affectionate wife."
               "And what is Mr. Ashley's object in writing this statement to you now?" she steadily asked.
               "Leon knows that I am an old man, and he fears that I will make a will in accordance with a promise made to him on that sad night, to bequeath the whole of my estate to the daughter of his first wife. He states that shortly before Grace lost her mind, she gave him a deed which entitles him to the income arising from her property during the minority of her child. Leon goes on to say that his habits are such, that he can save nothing from the large sum annually transmitted to him; and as the fortune of his last wife is trifling, the son just born to him will be destitute unless I make some alteration in my testamentary provisions, and divide the estate equally between the two children. As he relinquished his own claims on me in favor of his daughter, he demands that I shall make this change in my will."
               "It is a strange and exciting story; but what do you intend to do?"
               "I will do what I think just. I have made Leon a liberal allowance, in addition to the large sum he annually draws from the Arden estates; and if he does not choose to curtail his own extravagance for the sake of providing for his son, the child must do without fortune. The son of so deceitful and unprincipled a woman as this Augusta must be, shall never cut Frank out of his share of my estate, by being permitted to come in as co-heir with Bessie."
               A bright flash of triumph came from the eyes of Mrs. Ashley, and she lifted his hand to her lips, and said:
               "I felt sure that I could trust to your sense of justice to do what was right by little Frank. He is a noble boy, and he will be worthy to represent your family in the time to come."
               "I hope so—I believe so—for he is a lad of promise. The present Mrs. Leon Ashley has assisted her husband to carry out his deception by writing to me in the character of Grace, and I think she and her husband are suited to mate together. Their son is likely to prove no credit to his blood, and I shall do nothing for him beyond leaving a few thousand dollars to educate him. The bulk of my property I shall bequeath to the two children who brighten our daily life, and give us something to look forward to in the future."
               "You love them both tenderly—I can see that every day—and I think you are right to place Frank on a footing with Bessie. I have long wished to make a suggestion to you, and if you will listen to it, I think you will do better for them than they will be likely to do for themselves."
               "What do you mean, Daisy? You know that you have only to speak to be listened to with respect at least."
               After an agitated pause Mrs. Ashley said:
               "Frank is a fine child, and I feel assured that he will mature into a good and true man. I confess to you that I dread the thought of our pretty Bessie hereafter becoming the victim of a mere fortune-hunter, as so many girls possessing property do. Marriage is a lottery at the best in which more blanks than prizes are won, and if I had children of my own, I would endeavor to fix their matrimonial fate as far as it lay in my power to do so. Place the future of these children beyond doubt, by making it necessary sary to wed each other if they would enjoy your estate after you are gone. They love each other now—they must be happy together."
               Judge Ashley listened to her with some surprise; he thoughtfully said:
               "This is not the first time you have thought of this, Daisy; but it seems unfair to clog the inheritance of these little ones with the condition from which one or both may hereafter recoil."
               "Not unfair, if by that means you secure a noble husband for your heiress—a lovely wife for your heir," she eagerly replied. "Besides, in that case, the estate will remain intact. Frank can assume your name, and sustain the ancient prestige of his family."
               Mrs. Ashley knew that in this she was touching the Judge in his most vulnerable point, for he had long resisted the entreaties of his wife that Frank should share the estate with Bessie because he wished it to remain undivided.
               Confident of her power to induce him eventually to yield on both points, Mrs. Ashley had persevered until the first one was gained, and she now saw with alarm that unless her plans were speedily carried into effect, a counter influence might frustrate them, and leave the two young creatures whose future she so earnestly desired to rest in her hands, free to choose or reject each other, as their inclinations prompted.
               She must give her daughter a legal claim on the Ashley estate, and only by binding her irrevocably to Frank could this be done. The want of fortune, Mrs. Ashley believed to be the greatest of evils, and she had made up her mind that if either of these children ventured to oppose her will in the time to come, the one that thwarted her should bear the stings of as grinding poverty as she herself self had once known. But she comforted herself with the belief that her child would not be the one to suffer thus. Her training—her influence over Bessie—must prevent that; and to bend Frank to her will she had the dying wishes of his mother to influence him to the course she so ardently desired.
               Mrs. Ashley would not see that any obstacle could hereafter intervene to prevent a union so desirable to herself, and she used all her power over her doting husband to bring him over to her own views.
               Judge Ashley would not immediately give his consent to alter his will, but he left the question open to future discussion; and assured in her own mind of ultimate success, Mrs. Ashley went out to join her daughter on the lawn, while the Judge retired to his library to reply to the letter of his son.
               It was a soft, bright October day; the early frosts had thrown their gorgeous livery over the forest, and the trees blazed in garments of crimson and gold; the atmosphere was filled with the dreamy haziness of Indian Summer, and Mrs. Ashley sat down on a rustic seat to reflect on what had recently passed between herself and her husband.
               The prattle of Bessie broke in upon the thoughts that thronged upon her, and she commanded Winny to take the child in the house. After a few moments she felt too restless to remain seated, and she arose and walked toward a grove of ash trees which lay beyond the boundary of the lawn.
               Of late she very rarely went beyond the environs of Ashurst, but the beauty of the woodland lured her on, and she passed through a large gate and sauntered slowly along the winding path over which the arching trees cast a flickering shade.
               The fear which had lain so heavily at her heart was in a measure set at rest, for several months had passed away since the three years ended, and she had heard nothing of Martin. As they drew to a close, for the first time she would have asked to leave Ashurst for a season, but the increasing infirmities of the Judge compelled her to forego her own wishes, and she awaited in fear and trembling the advent of the man who had it in his power to ruin her.
               If "coming events cast their shadows before," on this day she should have thought of him, but she did not—she felt almost assured that he had given up a quest in which he had no personal concern, and she was safe.
               Her thoughts wandered far back to the home of her girlhood: on such a day as this she had walked in the woodland with her first lover; had listened to his avowals of undying affection; had received upon her virgin lips the first kiss of love, and in that hour Mrs. Ashley's heart was full of that past which had been so brief and beautiful.
               On the next day she and Frank Wilde were married, and after one little week of happiness, he sailed with her father on that voyage which had proved so fatal.
               She gained the edge of the woodland, and wearied with the unusual exercise, Mrs. Ashley sat down on a rustic bench which had been placed a short distance from the road, and gave herself up to bitter and unavailing regrets for the unprincipled act which had decided her whole future fate.
               She did not hear the sound of beating hoofs upon the road; absorbed in her own feelings, she had no thought for what was passing near her till suddenly a horseman drew up in front of her, and lifting his hat respectfully asked:
               "Will you be so good as to inform me, madam, if the mansion I am near is that of Judge Ashley?" and the speaker peered curiously at the veiled face. She repressed the cry that arose to her lips, and clutching her veil more closely to her face, she tried to disguise her voice as she tremulously replied:
               "That is Ashurst, sir, but Judge Ashley rarely receives strangers."
               "My business is not with him, but with his lady," was the response. "Does she also seclude herself?"
               "She seldom leaves her home, and I scarcely think she will receive you just now, for she has been much of an invalid of late. I see Mrs. Ashley every day, sir, and if you will communicate your business to me, I will inform her as soon as I return."
               "That is a cool proposal to make to a stranger, if you are one to me," replied the young man, as he leisurely dismounted and fastened his horse to a neighboring tree. Then approaching her, he added:
               "I am fully persuaded, madam, that Mrs. Ashley is before me now; is it not so?"
               With sudden fire she asked:
               "And if she is, sir, by what right do you address her in this insolent manner?"
               "By the right of old acquaintance, I am very sure. Pray, madam, throw aside your veil that I may look upon your face once more, and claim you as my old playmate, Margaret Brandon."
               Mrs. Ashley visibly trembled, but she steadied her voice and replied:
               "Your impertinence, sir, is beyond endurance. If it continues, I will seek with you the presence of my husband, and compel you to explain your meaning. Who is Margaret Brandon, and what is she to me?"
               "She is only your double, that is all," he retorted, with perfect nonchalance. "If I had not felt sure of your identity before I came hither, the sound of your voice would have set my last doubt at rest, in spite of your efforts to disguise it. Mrs. Wilde, why should you play off this farce with me? Three years since I saw you in Baltimore, and recognized you in spite of the change in your position. I made every effort to see you again, but was baffled, no matter how."
               "I have just returned from a long cruise, and I made use of my first days of leisure to come hither to unmask you. The confiding old man who has been made your dupe shall know you for what you are. You have no right to be here—no right to bear his name—and you know it. I little thought such shame would ever come to the daughter of so honorable and whole-souled a man as your father was."
               Mrs. Ashley cast herself before him in abject fear. She tore aside her veil, and entreated in broken tones:
               "Pity me, John Martin, and do not destroy me, as you threaten. For the sake of him who was the best friend your orphan boyhood ever had, have mercy on me. Even the man whom I have deeply wronged would never crush me as you are doing. Yes, I was Margaret Brandon, then Mrs. Wilde—now I bear the honored station of wife to the good old man who lives in yonder house. Have compassion on him, for he loves me; have mercy for me, for I am bound to him by chains of iron. I heard you talking near my room in Baltimore; what you said was intended for my ears, I understood full well, and the revelation then made crushed me almost into the grave. But of intended wrong I was innocent—I swear to you I was."
               She stopped, panting and breathless, and Martin raised her up and placed her upon the seat again. He seemed moved by her distress, and presently said:
               "How could you remain in the position you hold as Judge Ashley's wife a moment after learning that—"
               She raised her hand deprecatingly, and passionately asked:
               "What could I then do, but remain where fate had cast me? Oh, John, you will not be so cruel as to betray me; to cause me to be cast out with scorn and contumely from the only shelter I can claim on earth? If you can do this, you are much changed from the boy my poor father reared. If he could rise from his grave, he would bitterly reproach you for meddling with what you do not fully understand."
               Martin seemed deeply to feel this appeal, and placing himself on the seat beside her, he more gently said:
               "This appeal to the memory of your father shall not be made in vain, Margaret. I will spare you, and leave you to such happiness as you can find in the degrading shackles that bind you to this superannuated old man, if you will tell me what you have done with poor Frank's child. On my last cruise, I met with a man named Hunter at Oporto. We struck up an intimacy; I told him who reared me from boyhood, and afterward procured me a berth as midshipman in the navy; I incidentally spoke of Frank Wilde. The name struck him, and the mention of it led to his telling me of his acquaintance with you, the destitution in which he found you, and your employment as nurse to the daughter of some wealthy Southerner. When he called the name of Ashley, I knew at once that I had not been mistaken—that the woman I had seen in the hotel in Baltimore, who was the wife of a man old enough to be her grandfather, was indeed the playmate of my childhood."
               He paused, but Mrs. Ashley made no reply, and he hurriedly went on:
               "Oh, Margaret! Margaret! why have you done this? You have ruined your happiness for the enjoyment of wealth—lost your own self-respect, and forfeited the esteem of every true man or woman. But why do I reproach you! it is not my right, and if you are the same girl I once knew so well, your own self-reproach is sufficient punishment."
               "It is—it is," she moaned. "Do not add a straw's weight to the load I have to bear, or the additional burden will crush me."
               "I will not, poor girl, for you were not one formed to sin with impunity, and your own conscience will suggest all I could say. But where is the child? Hunter told me that you had given her to some rich woman in New York. Tell me where I may find her, for it is my right to claim and protect her, until—"
               Mrs. Ashley had by this time partially recovered from her overwhelming emotion, and she tremulously replied:
               "The child is dead. It is true that I gave her to one who would have provided handsomely for her, but she died before she was a year old."
               Martin fixed a piercing glance upon her; he saw that tears were ready to gush from her eyes, and he gave credit to her assertion; with a deep sigh he said:
               "Then the last link that bound you to the past is broken. Since you have chosen your own fate, I have no right to interfere; neither can I make up my mind to disgrace the daughter of the man who made me what I am. Are you happy in your bondage to that aged man, Margaret?"
               "I am as happy as I dare ever hope to be. Judge Ashley is good and true; he loves the very ground on which I step, and he lavishes on me all I used to say would make me happy in my childish days," she sadly replied. "Yes—he is far too good for me."
               He regarded her in silence a moment, and then bitterly said:
               "I remember well your childish pride and vanity—your excessive love of beautiful things, and I can understand that you were ready to sacrifice everything to their attainment when the temptation came to you."
               With some of her natural fire, Mrs. Ashley replied:
               "I sacrificed much—much—but not what you think, John Martin. I believed that I had the right to take my fate in my own hands, and I did so. To regret what is irreparable is but a weakness of which I have determined not to be guilty. I have long ago made up my mind to make the most of what I have won by the self-sacrifice I have made. There—we have said all that is necessary in this interview. I must now bid you good-bye, for I shall be missed, and sent for, if I remain much later. I regret that I cannot invite you to Ashurst, but you see yourself that it is impossible. A few miles from here is a very good tavern, where you and your horse can be taken care of. You have pledged yourself to keep my secret, John, and I know that I may trust you."
               "You may; but you are leaving me without asking a question about—"
               "Stop!" she cried out, imperatively, though her voice vibrated with emotion. "I have no right to inquire; neither have I the wish to learn what you could tell me. Go upon your way, Lieutenant Martin, and never breathe the name of Margaret Ashley in connection with that of the unfortunate Margaret Wilde. If you should again meet Mr. Hunter, mislead him as to my identity, unless you would have the shade of my father arise from the dead to reproach you for the evil you would bring upon the head of his only child."
               She waved her hand to him, and hurried away so rapidly that Martin was left in dumb amazement at her words and actions.
               After a bewildered pause he mounted his horse, and rode slowly toward the Jolly Angler, musing on the interview which had just passed.
               "Umph!" he muttered. "I came here determined to expose her, and she got the better of me, as she always did and always will, of any man who is not blind to beauty and fascinations. Oh! Margaret, Margaret, the honest love I once offered you was of more real worth than the splendor for which you have bartered all that should have been most precious to you."
               Mr. Samson nor his talkative wife could gain nothing from their taciturn guest on his return to their roof, though they used all their ingenuity to discover what brought him to the valley, and why he had rode in the direction of Ashurst on that afternoon. Martin kept his own counsel, and rode away at an early hour on the following morning, in time to catch the train for Philadelphia.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               THE SCHEMER AT WORK.
               FROM the day of that exciting interview in the grove, the health and spirits of Mrs. Ashley perceptibly mended. The great dread which had been the incubus of her life seemed to be sufficiently removed to give her breathing time at least, and her buoyant nature reacted at once.
               From time to time she recurred to the subject of the Judge's will, and used such finesse in her persuasions that he was finally induced to execute one to please her.
               In that, the estate of Ashurst was bequeathed jointly to his beloved grandchildren, Frank Wentworth and Bessie Ashley, together with all the stocks and other investments made by the testator, on the sole condition that at a suitable age they should be united.
               If either party refused to comply with the terms dictated, that one forfeited all right to any portion of the inheritance. Armed with this, Mrs. Ashley felt perfectly secure as to the future fate of the two young people.
               His large personal property, and such moneys as were deposited in Bank, were unconditionally bequeathed to his beloved wife, Margaret Ashley, who had been the joy and comfort of his declining years.
               No mention of his son was made, but a legacy of ten thousand dollars was left to his nephew Leon Larne, the half of which sum was to be devoted to the education of his son.
               The Circe was quite satisfied with this document, which was placed in her hands for safe keeping, and henceforth her life was devoted to the accomplishment of her future plans.
               The children were trained to implicit obedience to her will, though, at the same time, she contrived to gain from both the most fanatical attachment. The fondness of Frank and Bessie for each other promised all she could desire, and as they grew in years the charming traits of the young girl and the bright promise of the youth gave the scheming mother the fond belief that they were formed for each other.
               The years flowed smoothly by, leaving scarcely a ripple on the stream of time, and only by the development of the young people, and the silent decay of the Judge, could their fleeting progress be marked.
               Mrs. Ashley seemed untouched by the lapse of years; still lovely and enchanting as in those early days when she had carried her haughty master captive to her charms, time seemed only to mature her power to fascinate all who approached her. Truly had it been said that the magic cestus of Venus was her birthright.
               The prejudice against her supposed low birth and humble antecedents had gradually died out, as her exemplary course was observed by the surrounding families. The ladies at last called on her; were surprised and pleased by the quiet grace of her manners and the elegant ease with which she sustained her part in conversation.
               The measured praise they accorded her became rapturous applause when their husbands had an opportunity to make her acquaintance, for as poor Martin had said, her bright smiles and buoyant humor charmed them all, till not a man among them but thought Judge Ashley the most fortunate of men to possess a creature of such radiant mould.
               A thorough and highly accomplished education was bestowed on both Frank and Bessie. Mrs. Ashley would not be contented with superficial attainments; what they understood they must excel in, or gain her deepest displeasure. Luckily both possessed a fair capacity, combined with sufficient perseverance to enable them to attain the high standard she set up for them, and at the ages of twenty-three and eighteen it would have been difficult to find two more attractive young persons.
               Frank had graduated with honor at a college in his native State, and to academic learning he had added the lighter accomplishments which grace society. He was nearly six feet in height, with a strong and well-knit frame, the activity of a panther, and an untiring love for field sports. He was a crack shot: could wrestle, fence and box in a scientific manner, and he excelled in dancing.
               The Judge had well said that he resembled none of his family. He was fair, with flashing blue eyes, and a profusion of light brown hair that still curled lightly around the massive brow on which a fair intellect was enthroned. Yet with all these attractions, he was far from being the beau ideal of Bessie, though she loved him with a tender sisterly affection.
               Bessie grew up as lovely as her childhood promised. She was of medium height, with a charmingly rounded figure; a complexion of lilies and roses; a profusion of burnished hair that rippled around her well-poised head; and features possessing a most piquante attraction, though they could not boast of perfect regularity.
               Petting had not spoiled her, and she was the radiant embodiment of health, good humor and buoyancy of heart. Already had the fame of her attractions been noised abroad, and more than one father of a promising son had hinted to Judge Ashley that an alliance with his heiress would be desirable on the part of that young gentleman. But the old gentleman listened coldly to such intimations, and uniformly gave the speaker to understand that Miss Ashley was already betrothed to her cousin, and on her union with him depended the fortune she would inherit.
               Neither was Frank backward in claiming his property in Bessie. He loved her with all his heart, though he misunderstood the nature of his feelings when he imagined that Bessie was the one sweet minister who could alone render his future life happy.
               She understood herself better, and dear as Frank was to her, she often sighed that fate had not left her free to choose her own lot in life. But she was submissive to the will of her grandfather, and always obedient to that dominant power which had thus far moulded her life. She had no volition but that of her darling Minny, and such was her reverential affection for Mrs. Ashley, that she entirely surrendered herself to her control.
               Bessie had been taught to think that her earthly destiny was fixed, and she tried to be satisfied with it. Frank was invariably good-tempered; his bright eyes expressed the joy of young life and the kindliness of an unwarped nature, and she hoped that in time she could love him as a wife should love her husband; but she had no idea of marrying him for years to come, and dreamed not that Mrs. Ashley was already laying her plans to bring on their union before another year passed away.
               There was danger in delay; for if Bessie appeared in society, she might find one to charm her more deeply than Frank could ever do; for Mrs. Ashley, with her quick woman's wit, had already seen that if any difficulty lay in her path it would arise from the unwillingness of her daughter to give her hand to young Wentworth.
               Frank's devotion to Mrs. Ashley was that of a preux chevalier; he considered her as elevated far above the common level of her sex, and, with all her intellect, the loveliest type of a household divinity that it was possible to find.
               He often marvelled what could have induced so charming a woman to marry a man so much her senior as Judge Ashley was, but he had never been able to detect in her any regret for the sacrifice of her youth, nor any relaxation of the devoted care which evidently made the happiness of the old man's life.
               That Mrs. Ashley had been without fortune he vaguely understood, but the grace and refinement of her manners, the accomplishments she possessed, assured him that she had received the training and education of a lady, and further he sought not to know. He had been told that she came to Ashurst as the governess of the heiress, for the servants were strictly forbidden to refer to their mistress as having served in any lower capacity, and Frank considered his grandfather as wise to perceive the value of so bright a gem, and give it a fair setting.
               But if time had brought increased stature and maturing beauty to the young people, it had stolen from the Judge the fire of life, and left only the smouldering ashes of age and decay.
               His form was bent, his scanty locks fell in silvery waves over his wrinkled brow, and everything about him betokened that earth was ready to yield up her son, and the arms of mercy were opening to receive him to his well-earned rest.
               The placid happiness of his later years had stolen the sternness from his brow, and melted his proud heart into thankfulness for the good things granted him at an age when he had deemed life's promise gone, and the dreary dullness of advancing years spent in loneliness and gloom the only prospect left him.
               If Mrs. Ashley felt remorse, she stifled it by thinking how well she had played her part; how great a debt this feeble old man owed her for the happiness she had bestowed on him for the last seventeen years of his life; and with the sophistry we are prone to use, she assured herself that she had purchased the inheritance her daughter would possess by the immolation of herself, and the conscientious manner in which she had performed the duties she assumed.
               She plainly saw that the Judge could not survive his infirmities many months longer, and she became exceedingly anxious to ensure the union of the young people before his decease. Frank had lately returned to Ashurst to remain permanently, and assist his grandfather in the management of the property, which had now become a burden to him; and Bessie was quite old enough to understand her own feelings, and take on herself the responsibilities of a wife.
               Thus musing, Mrs. Ashley, on a bright evening in early summer, sat upon an ottoman at the feet of her husband, who reclined in a large cushioned chair, near an open window, in the library.
               She wore an embroidered wrapper, fastened up the front with knots of blue ribbon; and a head-dress of filmy lace, with fluttering streamers of the same color, covered her radiant hair. Her face, without a tell-tale line to mark the years she had lived on earth, was turned toward her husband with an expression of tender interest which was perfectly simulated, if she was not in truth a devoted wife.
               Judge Ashley suffered much from asthma, and he seemed to breathe with difficulty. She gently arose, altered the arrangement of the cushions at his back, and sunk down again into her former attitude.
               He looked down at her and fondly said:
               "My Daisy, flower of my old age, what would become of me but for your watchful care? You have indeed been a pearl of price to me, Margaret, and after I am gone, you will find that my gem will have a rich setting. I have given you a noble dower, my darling, and at a proper time, I wish you to share it with some younger lover, who can make you as happy as you have made the old man since you entered his home as an angel ministrant of peace."
               She pressed his hand with much emotion, as she replied:
               "I shall never wed again—never! I have enough. With independence and our dear children, I shall in time be perfectly contented with my lot. Do not fancy that I shall be in a hurry to exchange the quiet of my present life for the turmoil of the world in which another lover might be found. I have been happy here; I shall owe to you all that I may possess, and when we meet upon the farther shore, I hope to give you a good account of the use to which I shall put the fortune with which you say you have endowed me."
               The Judge tenderly pressed her hand, and after a pause, said:
               "Act as you may, Daisy, I know it will be for the best. I can implicitly rely on your judgment and good feeling to guide you in the future. I believe that you have been happy with me, love, and I am grateful that it has been so. The wealth I can give you is poor in comparison with the joy and peace you have poured into my heart and life. I am waning away, Daisy, and day by day I feel that the great conqueror lays a heavier hand upon me. When a few more have passed, I shall belong to the land of shadows. But I do not shrink from my approaching fate. God has filled my cup to overflowing with good gifts, and I thank him with all my heart. I have tried to use and not abuse the wealth he gave me; and the hardness of heart I once indulged has been subdued by your sweet influence."
               Mrs. Ashley seemed much moved. She pressed his withered hand between her own soft palms, and said:
               "It will be a consolation to me through all my future life to believe that I have been all this to you. In your turn, you have been the tenderest and most indulgent of husbands to me, and I have shared the happiness I bestowed. Dearest, you must talk no more now, for it excites and weakens you. Breathe the balmy air on this soft evening in quietness, and it will benefit your lungs."
               "Then sing to me, Daisy; your sweet voice soothes me more than anything else."
               She took her guitar from a stand near her, and after a brief prelude, struck into a low, plaintive song, murmuring the recitative in soft, melodious tones, which seemed to act as a sedative upon the invalid. He closed his eyes and soon slumbered.
               Gradually the white fingers ceased to wander over the chords, and Mrs. Ashley surrendered herself to reverie till her husband should again awake. Suddenly he started forward, unclosed his eyes, and asked:
               "Where are the children? I have scarcely seen Frank since he returned home. His young friends have so constantly gathered around him, that he has seldom been able to come to me. He is a noble boy, Daisy, and I thank you for bringing him beneath the shelter of my roof, and eventually into my cold and entranged heart. When I meet my daughter in the better land, I shall owe it to you that I shall have a good account to give her of my treatment of her child. She will pardon my harshness to herself when she learns how earnestly I have endeavored to atone for it to her son."
               "You have done for Frank everything that could be required by the fondest parent, and his future welfare and happiness are provided for in the union we have planned. My dear husband, it has occurred to me that it will be best to have our young people united before the provisions of your will become known to them. The union into which they will now willingly enter, may assume to them the appearance of being compulsory, if the possession of fortune is made contingent upon it. Young people are often capricious, and they are apt to take up such strange fancies about what is done for their benefit."
               "You may be right," replied the Judge, thoughtfully, "but they are yet so young to think of marriage. Bessie seems to me little more than a child, and I do not like the thought of putting the yoke of matrimony upon her at so early an age. It seems hardly fair, with the bright promise of life before her, to bind her to home duties, when she should be flitting about as a butterfly in the sunshine, enjoying the brief, bright season of youth."
               Mrs. Ashley listened patiently, but she earnestly replied:
               "You make a grave mistake, my love. You would give Bessie a taste for pleasure and excitement, and when the lesson is thoroughly learned, you would bring her back to the monotony of a country home, and bid her find, in the dull round of her daily duties, and in the placid attentions of her husband, the happiness you had taught her to seek alone in crowds. No, dear; I pray you spare Bessie such an ordeal as that. Before she plunges into the vortex of fashion and gayety, in which she may otherwise be overwhelmed, give her a strong, sustaining arm on which she may lean. That will be her only salvation."
               The Judge seemed buried in troubled thought a few moments before he replied:
               "You may be right, Daisy, and you certainly make out a strong case on your side. We will see what the young people say to an immediate marriage. If they do not object, it shall be settled as you wish, but if they do, I cannot consent to force their inclinations. I have known what a happy union is, and also what a dreary thing a conventional one was to me, and I shrink from forcing the last on any human being. If these children love each other, they will come together yet; if they do not, I am afraid that I have made an iniquitous will, and I confess to you that I have thought more than once of destroying it."
               "My love!" exclaimed Mrs. Ashley, in consternation, "Why should you do such a thing as that? for never in your life have you done a wiser or juster thing than you did in making that will. I assure you that no other affection these children have known is so strong as that which binds them together. I have watched them—I understand the signs, and I declare to you that Frank and Bessie are devoted to each other."
               "Then we can safely leave them to fix the time of their own union, without attempting to hurry matters," replied the Judge: "that will be the best course, and here they come to decide the question for themselves."
               Wentworth and Bessie, with their arms linked together, came from the shelter of some shrubbery, and slowly approached the open window. They were both evidently in high spirits, and the young girl was chattering to her companion with great vivacity; Frank's ringing laugh, full of blithe enjoyment, was borne to the ears of the two who were discussing their future with such vivid interest.
               They paused at some distance from the open window at which Judge Ashley and his wife were observing them, and went through an expressive pantomime, which ended by the hand of Bessie being pressed fervently to the lips of the young man.
               "There—do you not see for yourself how much they love each other?" said Mrs. Ashley. "Their actions show devotion on his side, and on hers, acquiescence at least. Oh! my dear husband, speak to them now, while they are in the mood to listen favorably, and let us have the wedding over without unnecessary delay."
               The Judge stifled a sigh,
               "I believe you are right, Margaret, and I will do as you wish," was the submissive reply, for Judge Ashley had so long seen only with his wife's eyes, had so implicitly followed the bent of her will, that he appeared to have lost all volition of his own.
               At a signal from her, the young people came forward and entered the library.
               Mrs. Ashley smiled on them as they came in, and said:
               "That was quite a pretty scene you were enacting just now, and I suppose it was but the prelude to the petition you came to make."
               Frank and Bessie looked at each other as if in doubt as to her meaning, and he gayly said:
               "What petition, Minny? we have none to prefer, that I know of."
               Bessie flushed, and then grew pale, as she caught something of Mrs. Ashley's meaning.
               The Judge with unusual animation, retorted:
               "You are a pretty young fellow, to be making love here under our very eyes, and then say you have nothing to say to us on the subject of our consent."
               Frank laughed and lightly replied:
               "I thought that had been understood long ago, sir. As to the love-making, Bessie and I were only rehearsing our parts in a charade we have promised to perform in at the party which is to come off at Mr. Welby's next week."
               "Acting the truth in pretended sport, eh? Don't you think that others will suspect that there is reality in the love-making, as Daisy and I did just now?"
               "I am perfectly willing," laughed Frank. "Bessie and I have no secrets, and everybody around here knows that from our childhood we have been intended for each other. I am more than contented with my bargain, and I hope she is with hers. How is it, my pretty rose bud?"
               "Oh, Frank, how recklessly you talk!" exclaimed Bessie, with considerable agitation. "I do not know whether I am contented or not. I am too young and giddy to think seriously about such things. Wait till I have seen enough of the world to compare you with others, and then I will tell you what I think of you. I have not yet made up my mind as to whether you will be a suitable bargain for me, or too high at any price."
               As she uttered the last words her color returned, a saucy smile broke over her pouting lips, and the glance she threw at him showed that in her nature there was a spice of coquetry; in her heart she rebelled against being taken as a bale of valuable merchandise, of which double the worth would be forfeited if it were not accepted; for in spite of Mrs. Ashley's recent words to her husband, she had incautiously betrayed to her daughter that the will of Judge Ashley gave herself and Frank to each other, and the one who receded from obedience to his wishes forfeited the inheritance.
               Frank was yet ignorant of this provision, and he replied to Bessie's last words:
               "I do not suppose that any price will be exacted, you little flirt. But I know one thing, Miss Ashley—I shall consider myself ill used if you bestow your smiles on any one save myself. Grandpa says that we are betrothed lovers, Miss Independence, and I intend to maintain my claim to the prettiest girl in the county, see if I don't."
               Bessie curled up her red lip, and made a grimace at him which caused him to laugh again in his gay, joyous manner, which brought a smile even to the faded lips of the old man.
               Judge Ashley presently said:
               "You are a pair of silly children, and it is high time that you were thinking of the cares that must soon come upon you. I am so old and exhausted now that I must soon succumb to the inevitable doom of all Adam's race, and it is the strongest wish of my heart to see you and Bessie united before I die. You are both quite as old as many that do marry, and if your union is to be a happy one, it cannot commence too soon. What do you say, my children, to removing this last care from the old grandfather's mind by having the wedding-day over at once, without any bustle or worry about it."
               Young Wentworth looked surprised, and he turned to Bessie to see what she thought of this abrupt proposal. She shrank back, trembling, with all the glow of life fading from her lips and cheeks.
               "What do you say to grandpa's proposal, Bessie?" he mechanically asked; and he stretched forth his arm, fearing that she might faint, and fall without support. But Bessie rallied quickly, and with more spirit than either of the listeners expected, she replied:
               "I am sorry to thwart grandpa, but our marriage cannot yet take place. We are both too young and inexperienced to assume the serious duties of life. I have always been told that we were to be married some day, but there is no need of being in a hurry. We can pledge ourselves to grandpa, that even if he is removed from us we will consider his wishes as sacred, and at some future day fulfil the contract we can form now for his satisfaction."
               "Bless the child! how glibly she talks, and how sensibly, too," said the Judge. "If I believed that you would only adhere to the contract, Bessie, it would answer my purpose just as well; but how am I to feel assured that neither you nor Frank may prove inconstant?"
               "Aye," broke in the persuasive voice of Mrs. Ashley, that is the vital point at issue. Better far will it be for you to remove temptation from your hearts, by vowing them to each other without further delay. It is the strongest wish of my heart to see you and Frank united, Bessie, as it is that of your grandfather. I know that you are suited to each other, and happiness must crown your union."
               "But we are first cousins, Minny; and to tell you the truth, I don't care about marrying one so nearly related to me. Frank seems almost like my brother," pouted Bessie.
               "Pooh! cousins marry every day, and so far as I know, they are as happy and prosperous as those that are not related. Bessie, have you no respect for Judge Ashley's wishes and mine? I scarcely expected this opposition from you."
               In spite of this rebuke Bessie persisted:
               
               "I can't see why you and grandpa insist that Frank and I shall be married, when we neither of us wish it for several years to come. There is plenty for us both, and I had rather give Frank the whole estate than to give him my hand before I understand my own heart sufficiently to know whether he is the man I ought to marry."
               Mrs. Ashley was about to reply, but Frank broke in:
               "Why Bessie, you little casuist, why should you doubt that? I am a right proper fellow, and I mean to make you the best of husbands. If I don't profess to adore you, and all that, I love you just as dearly as I can; as to the money, I don't see how that is concerned in it; the law will divide it between us, I suppose, after giving Minny her third. But I hope grandpa will live many years yet to enjoy his own."
               "Thank you, lad, but my course is almost run. Has it never occurred to you, Frank, that I may make a will, and make obedience to its provisions on the part of yourself and Bessie imperative upon you, if you would hereafter enjoy my wealth?"
               Wentworth looked surprised, and presently said:
               "I had no idea, sir, that you would think it necessary to compel Bessie and myself to choose each other. We are well enough disposed to obey your wishes, if you will give us time to make our own arrangements."
               "I hoped that no compulsion would be necessary. I certainly do most ardently desire to see you and Bessie united; and I have neglected nothing which can ensure the fulfilment of my wishes. You seem well enough disposed to gratify me, Frank, but I am sorry to see in Bessie a rebellious spirit, which will not contribute to her future happiness."
               His pained tone struck upon the sensitive heart of Bessie, and in a moment she was kneeling beside him, holding his hand in hers, and with quick penitence she said:
               "My dear, dear grandpa, I am quick of temper and free of speech, but I will no longer oppose you. If your heart is set on this thing, I will not thwart you. I am but a silly child, but if Frank is willing to take me as I am, I will not refuse to obey you. We might have waited till we are older and wiser, but if you command me to do so, I will give him my hand at once, and try and make him a good wife."
               Judge Ashley passed his hand caressingly over her bowed head, and said:
               "That is right, and you are my own good child again. Come, Frank—name the day on which you will take this submissive little martyr for better, for worse."
               "The sooner the better," was the ready response. "Since we are to be executed, let it be without delay. Don't look so solemn, Bessie; it will only be like taking a cold douche, and when it's over, we shall both feel the better for it. I know that I shall be as happy as a king—ought to be; and I promise to treat you en prince. There, darling, don't let me see tears in your lovely eyes, because they are giving you to me for my wife."
               Dimples broke over the charming mouth of the young girl, and she dashed away her tears as she placed her hand in that of Wentworth and said:
               "You are a dear, good boy, Frank, and I hope that I can love you as—as I ought. But you must give me time; you know we cannot school the heart all at once. Besides, it is so humdrum to marry somebody I have known all my life, with no romance, no difficulty about it."
               Frank raised her hand to his lips, and laughingly replied:
               "Oh! ho! little sentimental, that is where the shoe pinches, is it? We can get up some difficulties after we are married, you know. I have read some nice stories about ladies married without their full consent learning to love their husbands all the better after they were united for not caring a pin for them beforehand. We will follow in their footsteps, Bessie, and I will prove such a fascinating fellow that you will never be able to resist me. So that objection is settled, I hope."
               The listeners could only laugh at this nonsense, and Mrs. Ashley said:
               "I may congratulate you then, my dears, on the event that is so soon to come off. Since you are both agreed as to the expediency of a speedy union, I will name the day. Let it be to-morrow evening."
               "So soon!" exclaimed Bessie, in dismay. "Oh, Minny, I shall have no time to get ready."
               "Nonsense, child; you have everything you can need, even if you are married at once. You are not going on a bridal tour, and I flatter myself that your wardrobe is always sufficiently supplied for such a change as you meditate."
               Bessie would still have demurred, but Frank spoke with a tender joyfulness in his tones that contradicted the lightness of his words:
               "Come, little wife, since you must be a victim, submit to the sacrifice gracefully, and gain some credit for making it."
               Bessie became very pale, but she quietly replied:
               "Since there is no escape from the destiny that has been awarded us, we may as well consent to fulfil it at once. I am afraid that you will have the worst part of the bargain, Frank, for I am not naturally of a submissive temper, and I may prove anything but a suitable wife for you."
               "I am willing to risk it," was the confident reply, and Judge Ashley heartily said:
               "Then it is settled, and to-morrow afternoon the parson can come over and marry you as quietly as Daisy and I were united."
               Bessie kissed him and whispered:
               "Let me go to my room now, grandpa, to think over all this. It seems so strange, and I am in such a flutter that I must have time to compose my spirits before I can realize that I have actually promised to give my hand to Frank to-morrow."
               "Go, then, my pretty one, and think only of how happy you are going to be with so gallant and handsome a husband."
               She eluded the attempt of the young man to take her hand, and glided from the apartment, which he also immediately left.
               Well satisfied with the last hour's work, Mrs. Ashley sat stroking the wrinkled hand of her husband, and talking to him in a low tone till he fell asleep again, and slumbered on till twilight gathered round them.
               The labor of so many years was nearly accomplished, she believed, and in a few hours more Bessie would be safe. As the wife of the heir, she was sure of her daughter's future position as mistress of Ashurst, and her scheming mind felt the gratifying assurance that the great object of her life was on the eve of attainment.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               TIDINGS FROM ACROSS THE SEA.
               WHEN the supper bell rang, a strong young negro came in to assist his master into the dining room, for the Judge was now so infirm that he was compelled to lean heavily on his attendant, and old Jupiter was no longer able to sustain him. He roused up and said:
               
               "I do not wish to move from here. Bring in tea for your mistress and myself, and spread it on the library table."
               The lamp was lighted and the tea brought in. Mrs. Ashley came out of her reverie in time to pour out the steaming liquid and put into the Judge's cup the exact quantity of cream and sugar he liked.
               He smiled on her as he quaffed it and said:
               "Hebe never served more delicious nectar to the gods than this, and I have my doubts whether she was half as charming as my hand-maiden."
               She laughed merrily and replied:
               "You are a dear old flatterer, but I am not vain enough to credit half the pretty things you say of me."
               His reply was interrupted by the appearance at the door of the lad whose business it was to visit the neighboring post-office thrice a week and bring back the mail. He carried a small bag in his hand which seemed quite full, and the Judge set down his cup as he said:
               "I do hope there is a letter from Europe. It is so long, so long since I heard that I am uneasy. Pray examine the mail as quickly as you can, my dear, and if you find a foreign letter read it to me before looking further."
               Mrs. Ashley unlocked the bag and poured its contents on the table; the most of them proved to be newspapers and magazines, but at the very bottom was found a letter from Mrs. Leon Ashley.
               She broke the seal, glanced down the page, slightly changed color, and prepared to read at the command of her husband, though she greatly feared the effect of the tidings it contained:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "VIENNA, May 5, 18—.
                           
                           "Dear Uncle:—I write to you without the knowledge of my poor Leon, who is confined to his bed with an illness from which I sadly fear he will never recover.
                           "The climate of this place does not agree with him, and of late years his habits have been such that his constitution is prematurely broken down. I do not wish to complain of my husband, and I have hitherto borne with everything in silence because I married him for love and meant what I said when I took him for better or for worse.
                           
                           "But endurance, even on the part of a devoted wife, has its limits, and mine has at length failed me. Of late, Leon has given himself up to gambling and drinking to such excess as would terrify you if you were near him and could witness his mad acts.
                           "Even with our large income, he has long kept me on the most limited allowance, and his failure to pay all his gambling debts drove him from Paris to this place. I hoped the change would restore him to his senses, but he finds here plenty who have the same passion for dissipation which is destroying him, and our pecuniary condition is no better than when we came hither.
                           "I have taken advantage of Leon's illness to tell you the exact truth about our circumstances, in the hope that you can do something to produce a change for the better.
                           "We are living in lodgings in this city which are positively shabby for people of respectable condition. We have but two servants, one of whom is Evelyn's nurse, who will not consent to leave her. My son has been brought from England and placed at school here, and he is making great progress in his studies; he is a tall boy now, and a very handsome one, I must say, though strangers do say that he greatly resembles me.
                           "Evelyn has been removed from her fashionable Parisian school, because her father found that he could no longer afford to keep her there. She is quite a young lady now, and should be introduced into society, but Leon will not listen to such a thing, and seems anxious to keep her entirely to himself. I have no voice in the matter, for I have lost all influence over my husband, and the language he ofteen uses to me is dreadful.
                           "He now lies before me in a heavy slumber, looking as ghastly as if dead. The stimulants that are destroying him I am compelled to give him in small quantities to prevent him from sinking at once, for he has had a terrible attack tack of mania-à-potu. This is not the first one, but I feared it would be the last, for his sufferings were fearful to witness.
                           "He insists that he will return to the United States as soon as he is strong enough to make the voyage, and I think there will be little danger in his doing so, for he is so greatly changed that no one could possibly recognize the handsome L. A. in the bloated and grey-haired man who calls himself your nephew.
                           "Oh! dear sir, if you would only consent that he shall return to his native land, his incognito could be faithfully preserved, and we should all be happier and better off. Poor Leon also yearns for a sight of the daughter he has not seen since her infancy, and I think it will be cruel to deny him permission to return to Maryland before he dies.
                           "I am sure that he cannot live very long, and I dread the thought of his dying in a foreign land, leaving me helpless and destitute of means, for the money we draw from you is all due before it reaches us.
                           "Evelyn is a good and dutiful girl, and her father seems to think more of her since his last illness than he has since the birth of his son, and your refusal to make Maitland an equal heir with his cousins. You know best, but I think it was a hard decision.
                           "This is a rambling letter, but you must excuse it, as it has been written at intervals while my husband slept.
                           
                              "Your affectionate but deeply tried
                              "AUGUSTA."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               There was a postscript added three days later, in a scarcely legible hand, which ran thus:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Leon is worse; I scarcely think he will live through the night; and I am here with the two children dependent upon me, without fifty dollars in the world, and all the expenses of my husband's illness to pay. Pray send some one to my assistance, for I have no friends on whom I can call, and I am utterly unused to business.
                           
                              AUGUSTA."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Mrs. Ashley hesitated before reading the last lines, but the Judge insisted:
               "There is something more: read all; let me know the worst."
               She obeyed him, and he covered his face with his clasped hands, and sat so long motionless that she became alarmed, and laid her hand upon his shoulder to arouse him from the painful reverie into which he had fallen.
               When he lifted his face she was struck with the change that had passed over it; it looked drawn and unearthly, and she apprehensively said:
               "This distracting news has proved too much for you. But surely you have been prepared for it by what we have heard before. For years you have known that the supposed Leon Larne was leading a very fast life, in most dissipated and reckless company; and to break down in the heyday of existence is the natural result of such a course."
               With difficulty did Mrs. Ashley tone her voice to the requisite degree of sympathy, for in her heart was the exulting belief that by this time the man she so deeply dreaded was no more; that he was removed before the decease of his father placed power in his vicious hands which she felt sure he would abuse.
               The Judge mournfully replied:
               "I have long feared that such must be the end of Leon's ignoble career, but the pang is not less keen because it has been anticipated. I have unconsciously cherished the hope that he would, in time, repent of his evil courses, and make an effort to redeem himself. But now all is at an end, and the son for whom I once hoped so much has probably died the death of the drunken profligate. It is a bitter grief and humiliation to me, and I feel that his wretched fate will rend from me the remnant of life that might yet have been mine."
               His pale, sunken features and failing voice deeply alarmed Mrs. Ashley, and she rang, and ordered wine to be brought in. The stimulant revived his strength, but he complained of feeling weary, and no time was lost in removing him to his bed.
               When the servants had retired and left them together again, Judge Ashley immediately renewed the conversation his faintness had interrupted. She was sitting beside the bed, holding his hand in her own, when he suddenly unclosed his eyes, and, turning toward her, said:
               "Daisy, I have already determined on what is necessary to be done in this sad crisis of poor Leon's affairs. If he dies, that helpless fine lady he preferred to poor Grace must not be left there with my two grandchildren, with no friend to turn to, and no means of living. I could send money in the usual way, but it would be longer in reaching Augusta than if an agent from me sought her out without delay. Even if she were to receive it promptly, I do not think she has judgment to use it rightly. If Leon yet survives, he has by this time partially regained his health, and he will, of course, return to his old courses; in the indulgence of the absorbing passion that has consumed his resources, he will throw away such sums as I may send him, and his wife and children will obtain little benefit from my liberality. My son must not return to this country, but his desire to behold his daughter can be gratified in another way."
               He paused, earnestly regarding her bowed face, and Mrs. Ashley faintly asked:
               "What, then, do you propose to do? Would you consent to part from Bessie, merely to gratify a parent who has hitherto showed the greatest indifference toward her? One who merely makes this new-born desire to see his child an excuse for returning to the United States? Besides, Bessie is not aware that such a being as your son is still in existence. She has been taught to believe that her father died when she was an infant."
               "Margaret, I am sorry that you view my plan with dissatisfaction, for it must be carried out. It is well that we arranged that the marriage of Frank and Bessie shall take place to-morrow, for on the night train they must set out on a bridal tour to Europe. Frank can carry such assistance as she may need to the poor woman who wrote that letter, for even if Leon yet lives, what I send shall be for her use, and that of the young creatures my reckless son keeps in poverty. I do not think he will die, and Bessie will have an opportunity of seeing her father; we will leave it to him to reveal their relationship, if he should see fit to do so. I cannot rest till I have sent some one to look after Augusta and the children, and Frank is the only person I dare trust with the secret of poor Leon."
               After a pause, Mrs. Ashley replied:
               "It seems necessary for Frank to be your agent, but will it not be best to have the ceremony of marriage performed on the day of his departure, thus making sure of their union, and then send him on his errand unaccompanied by Bessie? She seems reluctant to marry just now, and this will be a fair compromise. In the months that Frank must be absent from her, she will make up her mind to receive him on his return with the tenderness of a true wife."
               "But that will scarcely be treating either her husband or her father with fairness," objected the Judge, "and I own to you that I wish my son, if still in life, to see what a charming young creature his daughter is. Can you not consent to give up your darling a few months, Daisy, that she may visit him who has the strongest earthly claim upon her?"
               Mrs. Ashley crushed down her extreme repugnance to the thought of placing Bessie in contact with a man she so deeply dreaded and despised as she did Leon Ashley, for she saw that her husband's heart was set upon it, and she knew that she could bring forward no reason that would be satisfactory to him for her opposition to his plan.
               In a resigned voice she said:
               "Perhaps I am selfish in my affection for the dear child, and I own that I am jealous that even her own father shall step between Bessie and those who have had the care of her from her infancy. He has done nothing for her, and we everything, and we have the best right to the first place in her affections. But if it is your will that she shall go on this journey with Frank, I will say nothing more to oppose you."
               "Thank you, my good wife; I knew that you would be reasonable as soon as you understood the necessity that rules me. It is right for Bessie to go, and therefore I must insist that it shall be so. I will release you now, that you may go to the dear child, and inform her of the journey that is before her. The prospect of a tour to Europe may reconcile her to her hurried nuptials. Send Frank to me; I wish to talk to him; I must confide to him the secret which has been so long kept, and prepare him for the duty he will have to perform."
               "Had you not better wait till morning? You are not strong enough to bear so much excitement."
               "I cannot rest till this is off my mind, so the lad had better come as soon as possible. The wine I drank has given me factitious strength, which will sustain me through the interview, and when it is over, perhaps I shall be able to repose peacefully."
               "Then I will send Frank at once."
               She arose, arranged his pillows more comfortably, and left the room.
               In a few moments young Wentworth entered, apparently much surprised at this unusual summons. As he took the vacant chair by the bed, he said:
               "Your message came at the nick of time, sir, for I was on the eve of taking wing for Mr. Welby's. Bessie refused to leave her room when tea was ready, you and Minny had yours in the library, and I felt myself so completely deserted that I was about to depart for the night in search of some companionship."
               The listener smiled faintly.
               "I supposed that you and Bessie would be glad to be left tête-à-tête, and I had no idea that the little gypsy would run away from you the very day she has promised to marry you."
               Frank had nothing to say in reply, and his grandfather paused so long after uttering these words that he began to fidget, and wonder what on earth he could have to say to him at that hour of night.
               At length Judge Ashley said:
               "I see that you are becoming impatient, but if you could divine the painful nature of the revelation I am compelled to make to you, you would feel little surprise at my hesitation."
               The young man was instantly quiet and attentive. He said:
               "Pardon me, sir; I never can keep still long, but I hope I do not disturb you."
               "Not much, lad; but it is useless to defer what must be said. Frank, I have implicit faith in your honor, and I believe that a secret confided to you will be held inviolate."
               Wentworth's eyes widened, but he promptly said:
               "Assuredly, sir; my word is as sacred as an oath would be to many persons. Besides, young and giddy as I am, I never betray confidence that is reposed in me."
               
               With some bitterness the Judge replied:
               "You will be sure to keep this one, Frank; for family honor is too deeply concerned in it to permit you to reveal to any other being what I am about to confide to you."
               Frank's interest was now vividly excited, and he bent his head to listen to the tremulous tones of his grandfather's voice, as he immediately commenced the promised revelation.
               To his intense astonishment he learned that the uncle he believed lying in the graveyard was still living in Europe under a feigned name, and the outlines of his disgraceful story were rapidly sketched for him. The necessity that he should visit Europe immediately, that he might carry assistance to the wife and children of Leon Ashley, was made known to him; whether he were living or dead, they would require protection from the selfish prodigality which impoverished them, and Frank alone could be the agent to carry assistance to them.
               When Judge Ashley paused, exhausted by speaking so long, the young man earnestly said:
               "This is a strange and sad story, sir, but you may rely on me to serve you to the utmost of my ability. I have long desired to visit Europe, and although I could have wished to go on a less painful errand, I shall still find much enjoyment in the tour, especially with Bessie for my companion. Poor girl! she does not know that she is going to see her father; and if I could I would always conceal from her that this unfortunate man stands in that relation to her."
               Judge Ashley impressively replied:
               "I wish you to understand that unless my son reveals himself to her in his true character, Bessie must remain in ignorance of the tie that exists between them. I shall leave Leon to decide on his course himself."
               "That will be best, sir; and I only hope that my uncle will preserve his own secret from the knowledge of his daughter. Dear Bessie is too bright and young to have her life clouded by such a revelation as this would be to her."
               "I think Leon will save himself the mortification of enlightening her. Now listen attentively to what I wish you to do, Frank. In my escritoire you will find a large sum of money, a portion of which was paid in lately by the steward of the Arden estates. I shall also give you an order on my banker in Baltimore for additional supplies. You will be married to-morrow afternoon, as has already been arranged, and take the night-train for the city. Your money must be converted into bills of exchange, and when you reach Vienna, seek out the helpless family you are sent to succor and do the best you can to relieve them from the pressure of debt. If my son is yet living, do not trust the money in his possession, for he would throw it into the same vortex which has swallowed up the large sums I have hitherto sent him; use it for the benefit of his family. You fully understand what I wish done, Frank?"
               "Yes, sir; I think I do; and I promise to obey you as far as I possibly can. If—if I find my uncle dead, what would you wish to be done with his family?"
               "In that event they must return to this country with you. His daughter is the heiress to the Arden estates, and her stepmother and brother can live with her in the family mansion till I can make some more suitable arrangement for them."
               Frank observed that the voice of the speaker sunk away into a faint whisper, as if all his vital strength was exhausted, and he arose and said:
               "I think I understand what you wish done, sir, and I pledge you my honor to fulfil your intentions to the very best of my ability. You are tired and worn out now, and it will be best to defer any further directions you may wish to give me till to-morrow."
               "God bless you, Frank," said his grandfather, feebly grasping his hand. "You are a comfort and a pride to me now, though I so long and so persistently thrust you from my heart. Forgive my long neglect, lad, and the hardness of nature that suffered your poor mother to die in poverty."
               It was the first time Judge Ashley had ever spoken to him of his mother, and the young man was deeply affected. He said:
               "Dear grandpa, your kindness to me has obliterated the memory of all that. I owe so much to you that I should be an ungrateful wretch to think of wrongs which have been repented of, and, as far as possible, atoned."
               "You are a noble fellow, Frank, and I hope that you and Bessie will be happy together. I sometimes fear that I have done wrong in making my will as I have, but it was intended for the best."
               "I have no more doubt of that, sir, than I have that Bessie and I will be a model couple. I am quite satisfied with my lot, as I told her this afternoon, and her objections arise from shyness more than from any repugnance to our union. You shall see, sir, what a happy pair we will make."
               The old man sighed, and faintly said:
               "I hope so, lad; and now leave me, for I feel utterly worn out."
               Frank bade him good night, and quietly left the room.
               After her interview with the Judge, in regard to Frank's visit to Europe to look after Leon's wife and child, Mrs. Ashley sought the apartment of Bessie, to communicate to her the news of the projected bridal trip. Opposed as she was to a separation from her daughter, she hoped that the promise of a European tour would reconcile her to the speedy marriage which had been arranged for her.
               She found Bessie pacing the floor of her room with cheeks flushed with weeping, and eyes in which the light of anger shone. She did not often show the fiery spirit that was within her to the beloved and respected guide of her young life, but there had been occasions on which it broke forth and swept all opposition before it.
               As soon as Mrs. Ashley looked at her, she saw that, for the present, all power over Bessie was at an end. The young girl turned toward the opening door, and when she saw who had entered her room without knocking, she defiantly said:
               "You took an unfair advantage of me, Minny, to carry out your own wishes. You knew that I dared not refuse my grandfather anything on which he seemed to have set his heart, for he looks so frail and wan, that thwarting him might kill him at once. If you had let things take their course, I could eventually have evaded this marriage, which, I tell you, it will be wrong for Frank and me to make."
               Mrs. Ashley composedly asked:
               "How would you evade it? By waiting till the old man is under the sod, and then violating his commands? I took no advantage of you, Bessie; do not think so harshly of me as that. You and Frank enacted that scene of love-making in our sight, and the Judge and I naturally thought you were in earnest. At his command, I called you to come to us, that he might make known to you how much he has your immediate union at heart. Do not blame me, my dear, for it wounds me to the heart to have you imagine, even for a moment, that I would do anything that would render you unhappy."
               Her voice assumed its most touching tones, and tears stood in her expressive eyes as she turned them on the impulsive girl, and Bessie threw herself in the arms that were opened to receive her, sobbing as if her heart would break.
               "Catch flies with honey, and not with vinegar," had been the rule of Mrs. Ashley's life; and annoyed as she felt with the conduct of her daughter, she pressed her tenderly to her heart, and whispered:
               "I came hither to console you, love; to show you all the advantages of this union, and tell you something that your grandfather has decided on, which must afford you intense pleasure."
               "Nothing can do that, if I am to give up the freedom of girlhood to marry Frank. I do not wish ever to be married, and I do not think that any girl should marry under twenty. I am but eighteen, and I have lived shut up in this old country house nearly all my life. If I go out in the world, I may hereafter see some one that I shall like a great deal better than Frank. It is wicked to force us into bonds that may become a burden to us, and I did not believe that you would help to do such a thing, Minny."
               "My dear," said Mrs. Ashley, soothingly, "you are excited now, and you do not talk rationally. It is absurd to speak of Frank and yourself as if you were two children, incapable of judging as to what is good for your own welfare. In this country, earlier marriages than yours are very common, and I am inclined to believe that they are the happiest."
               "That may be, if the parties love each other with all their soul and all their strength; but such is not the case with Frank and me. There is a strong bond of fraternal affection between him and myself, but the divine spirit of love has never breathed upon it. If you will force us into the path you have marked out for us, the day will come in which we shall both discover the fatal mistake we have made; we shall then loathe each other all the more for the irrevocable tie that unites us in a bond which, from that hour, will have no sanctity."
               The passionate vehemence of the speaker showed Mrs. Ashley how deeply in earnest she was, but lightly said:
               "My love, your excitement has made you eloquent. I scarcely expected such a tirade on love from the lips of my little Bessie. If you are not a mature woman, it seems to me that you think and feel very much like one."
               "Because this question was thrust upon me even in my childhood. I have always been assured that Frank must become my husband, and I have reflected on all the possibilities that may spring from a union based on such motives as ours will be, and the more I have thought on it, the more have I shrunk from fulfilling the contract which has been made for me."
               "Why did you not express all this to your grandfather when he spoke to you this evening, Bessie?"
               "You know very well why I did not. The love and reverence I cherish for grandpa has a strong element of fear in it. Somehow I have always felt as if I have no right to give him any trouble, and the most submissive obedience to his will can never repay him for what he has done for me. He demanded my consent to marry Frank, and I gave it: I shall redeem my promise, much as I resent the manner in which it was wrung from me."
               A slight shiver passed over Mrs. Ashley, and she changed color, but she calmly replied:
               "That will suffice, Bessie; but why you should imagine that you have no claim here is very strange. But for the efforts made by me to restore Frank to his grandfather's favor, you would have been sole heiress of Ashurst."
               "I wish to Heaven you had never done so, Minny; for I could have done justice to Frank after my grandfather's death, and avoided making myself miserable by marrying him."
               "My dear, you will smile at the recollection of all this romantic nonsense when you are a little older. Let us not discuss your sentimental wrongs just now, for I have something more important to communicate to you."
               Bessie sank resignedly into a chair, and said:
               "I am ready to listen; I suppose it is some message from my grandfather."
               "Yes; I came hither from Judge Ashley to inform you that it has become necessary for Frank to visit Europe immediately, and you are to be the companion of his voyage. Will not the prospect reconcile you to your speedy marriage?"
               The young girl's face brightened a little, but she quickly said:
               "If anything could do so, the promise of a visit to Europe would have that effect; but from the depths of my nature something cries out to me not to give my hand to Frank Wentworth. The spirit within me seems to rise up in warning against a union which I feel assured will bring wretchedness to both of us."
               Mrs. Ashley gazed on the excited face of the speaker with a feeling of dread creeping over her, which she found it impossible to repel. What if Bessie spoke the truth, and all her machinations should only end in making her child so miserable that the wealth which had been so dearly purchased could never gild the sombre darkness of the fate to which she was so eager to consign to her.
               She presently spoke in a tone so altered that Bessie regarded her with surprise and contrition:
               "My dear child, if it is not too late to recede, I will use my influence with the Judge to have the marriage postponed at least till Frank's return. If you are really so bitterly opposed to giving him your hand, I—yes—I will use all the power I possess over my husband to induce him to change the tenor of his will, and leave you both free to accept or reject each other, as you may desire."
               Bessie impulsively threw herself at her feet, exclaiming:
               "My best friend! my more than mother, if you will indeed do this, I shall be eternally grateful. We shall both owe you such a debt as we can never repay. Save me from this sacrifice, and I promise in the future to be guided by you in the choice I may make; and I pledge myself to marry no other than Frank without your consent."
               Mrs. Ashley raised her in her arms, and pressing her to her heart in deep emotion, she said:
               "I will do my best, my darling, and you need have no fears for the result. But I do trust that when you find you are not compelled to take Frank, your caprices will end, and you will see that he is the best choice you can possibly make. Promise me that you will use every effort to overcome your fantastic repugnance to the union your grandfather so much desires, and I pledge you my word to do all I can toward having the provisions of the will changed."
               Bessie's face was radiant; all the clouds had rolled away as if by magic, and she threw her arms around Mrs. Ashley, as she impulsively said:
               "Only save me now, Minny, and two years hence I may willingly give my hand to Frank. Only give me time to understand myself—to make up my mind that we can be happy together, and I ask no more."
               At that moment a knock was heard upon the door, and Mrs. Ashley extricated herself from the embrace of Bessie as she said:
               "I firmly believe that your decision will ultimately be all that I can wish, or I should not willingly undertake what I have promised. You do not know how much depends on your union with Frank, nor can I now enlighten you. Good night, love; compose yourself, and get to sleep as soon as possible: that is a summons from the Judge, I know."
               She fondly kissed the being to whom she had just conceded the overthrow of that which she had schemed to attain through so many years; but Mrs. Ashley believed that she had, in that hour, established over Bessie a power which would hereafter enable her to bend her to her will and make her the willing wife of Frank Wentworth.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXV.
               SUDDEN DEATH.
               ON the following morning Frank arose at an early hour to commence his preparations for the expected journey; but he soon sat down with a sober face to think that this was his wedding-day, and he ought to be wrapped in blissful thoughts of his fair fiancée; but in spite of all his efforts, they were common-place and dull enough. He muttered:
               "I am a stupid fellow, and not worthy of such a bright little will-o'-the-wisp as Bessie, or I would feel more elated at the prospect of claiming her for my own before another day is gone. I wonder if she is right, and that we shall both yet repent marrying in such haste?
               "But what can we do? If either one refuses the other, it seems that the governor will cut off that one with a mere pittance. I believe that I like Bessie well enough to take her without a sous for her dower; well!—since I feel sure on that point, I would be a fool to give up my share of this large property sooner than accept such a nice little girl for my wife. Heigho! I wonder what she will think of the tour to Europe? I will take her everywhere she asks to go, and try and make her as happy as a bride ought to be. I am sure I can do nothing more than that."
               With a feeling of dissatisfaction that made him angry with himself, Frank proceeded with his labors till the bell summoned him to breakfast.
               He found no one but Mrs. Ashley in the dining-room; she nodded good morning and said:
               "The Judge was indisposed in the early part of the night, but I left him in a calm sleep a little while ago. Bessie excused herself from appearing, and I just now sent her breakfast up to her. Everything that we shall need is before us, and I have sent the servants away that I may have some private conversation with you before I am again summoned to your grandfather's room."
               Frank took his seat opposite to her, and said:
               "You wish to know what Judge Ashley said to me last night. Is it not so, ma'am?"
               She poured out his coffee, smiled brightly upon him, and after he had helped himself to the good things before him, she replied:
               "I knew what he would say to you before you went in to him, Frank, for the Judge has no concealments from me. You understand his wishes fully, so we will not discuss them. What I wish to speak about, is this sudden marriage. Bessie seems very much opposed to it, and to tell you the truth, I am very unwilling that she shall go to Europe just now. I do not wish her to meet Leon Ashley; it would make me miserable if he should put forward any claim upon her."
               Frank listened to her last words in extreme surprise, and he said:
               
               "But how could Mr. Ashley do that, if Bessie becomes my wife? My claim would then be paramount to his, and I should be sure to bring her back to you after the lapse of a few months. After what passed last evening, I thought Bessie pledged to comply with our grandfather's wishes, and, excuse me, Minny, if I say that I thought you even more anxious to effect this match than the governor is."
               "So I am—it is the most ardent wish of my soul to see you and Bessie united; but I find her so much against this precipitate marriage, that I hardly know how to press it on her. She likes you, Frank; she appreciates all your true and excellent qualities, but she does not wish to marry you at once, though she almost pledged herself to accept you a year or so hence."
               The young man's lip curled slightly, but he made no reply, and Mrs. Ashley went on:
               "If I thought you would both remain true to your troth-plight, I would use my influence with the Judge to induce him to defer your union at least till after your return from Europe."
               Mrs. Ashley regarded him searchingly as she thus spoke, and after a brief pause Frank honestly said:
               "That will be best for both of us, perhaps. I have no objection to Bessie, but somehow it seems to me that in myself there is something lacking. She may have more heart wisdom than I have, and if she insists on putting off the wedding, I shall not be offended. For a year or two things can go on as they always have, and we can cultivate such an affection for each other as will make us happy as husband and wife."
               Mrs. Ashley smiled at this prosaic view of the grande passion, but she presently said in a most impressive manner:
               "One thing must be understood both by yourself and Bessie; and that is, that you are bound by your pledges to each other as sacredly as if the nuptial benediction had already been pronounced over you. You must not suffer your heart to wander from your betrothed, Frank, and I promise you to watch over your interests in your absence."
               "There is little fear that I shall prove inconstant, Minny. I love Bessie better than any one in the world, and there is little danger that I shall find one more attractive than she is. I shall esteem myself a lucky fellow to win so charming a creature for my wife."
               "She is as good as she is lovely, Frank, and with her hand you obtain wealth; without it, you will have nothing. I know that you are not mercenary, but it is well for every man to have an eye to his own interests. A word to the wise is sufficient, you know, and now I must hurry through my breakfast, and go in to the Judge. I have before me the task of persuading him to let you go upon your voyage free and alone. It may be difficult, but I shall accomplish it."
               Frank laughed.
               "Of course you will, Minny, for grandpa only sees with your eyes, and judges with your judgment. It is lucky for him that the weakness of his old age has such a guide as you are to him."
               She looked keenly at Wentworth, to see if he was perfectly in earnest, but seeing no sinister meaning on the candid brow and honest face before her, Mrs. Ashley proceeded to eat her breakfast in quiet content, congratulating herself that she had prevented a meeting between Leon Ashley and her daughter, yet held both Frank and Bessie more completely in her power than before. She knew that they implicitly trusted her, and upon that trust the fabric she meant to rear should be erected.
               As she arose from the table, a servant rushed into the room quite breathless, and after a pause to gain the power of speech, stammered:
               "Please, mum, you is wanted in marster's room immejit. He's—he's—oh, Lor'! I's feared to say what he is!"
               Mrs. Ashley scarcely heard the last words, for the scared face of the negro told its own story. She hastened from the room, and fled along the hall to the chamber in which Judge Ashley lay. The door was open, and Jupiter and the black nurse stood beside the bed.
               They stepped aside as their mistress entered, and she saw that her worst fears were verified. The worn face of the old man lay upon the pillows, calm and peaceful as that of a child, but it was fixed and stony as that of a marble image, and Mrs. Ashley knew that it was death on which she looked.
               The sleep in which she had left him had evidently lapsed into that peaceful slumber which finally seals the senses of the children of earth, snatching them from the cares of life, and giving to the vision closed upon this world the brightness of a fairer land.
               Mrs. Ashley threw herself beside him with a great cry, but she shuddered and recoiled as her bowed face came in contact with the hand which had so often caressed her, for now it was rapidly chilling into the rigidity of death.
               Frank had quickly followed her, and he raised her in his arms as he said, in a choked voice:
               "This is no place for you, Minny; let me take you away while the last duties are performed for the good man who is gone. He has ended his honored career at a ripe old age, and you must not be inconsolable."
               She quietly submitted, though her heart was filled with a tumult of regret for Judge Ashley's death. She must have felt it at any time, for he had made her life prosperous, and he had spared no efforts to afford her such happiness ness as their disproportioned union promised, but at this crisis, it was a positive calamity.
               Leon Ashley, with his dissipated habits, his reckless disregard of others, would now be sure to return to his native land so soon as he heard of his father's death. He would assume the control of Bessie's fate, and claim in her a deeper interest than she dared set forth.
               In deep perturbation, Mrs. Ashley locked herself up alone, to mourn the bereavement she had met and to determine on the best course of action to protect herself against the encroachments Judge Ashley's unprincipled son would be sure to attempt.
               She dreaded a meeting between himself and Bessie, lest the sure instinct of nature should assure both that the tie supposed to exist between them was baseless as poor Bessie's claim on the estate Judge Ashley had left behind him.
               Luckily for Mrs. Ashley, her daughter bore no resemblance to herself, but she beheld in her the living image of her young husband as she had known him in his boyhood, and she feared that Leon would not be so easily deceived as his father had been.
               The mark upon Bessie's arm was still there, looking dark and natural enough, but that was the sole proof to offer to Mr. Ashley that she was indeed his child.
               The final conclusion the restless schemer arrived at, was that the only path of safety left for herself was to unite Frank and Bessie before he set out on his European journey.
               Some delay must now take place before Wentworth could leave, and in the interim she would work on Bessie in such a way as to extort her consent to become his wife at once. The bride should remain with her in the seclusion of Ashurst till Frank returned, but this was all she could now yield to the entreaties of the shrinking girl.
               Many times during that melancholy day, Bessie came to the door of the room in which she had fastened herself, and petitioned for admittance, but Mrs. Ashley refused to see any one till the conflicting emotions of her own mind had sunk into the quiet of decided action.
               On the day of the burial, numerous friends gathered in to testify their respect for the memory of the deceased, but the care of everything was left to Wentworth, for Mrs. Ashley gave no orders, nor did she appear till the funeral cortege was ready to leave the house.
               Many wondered why the grave was placed so distant from that of his son, but Frank had selected the spot on which it was made, and his honest heart recoiled from laying the cold remains of his grandfather beside the sham tomb on whose tablet a lie was recorded.
               The words which consigned dust to dust were reverently spoken, the strangers departed, and the household was left to the gloom which pervaded it till the next day, when the will was to be read.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               PLOTS AND COUNTERPLOTS.
               NOT until her course was fully determined on, did Mrs. Ashley receive her daughter. A few hours after her return from the funeral of her husband, she rang, and sent a message to Bessie that she was now ready to receive her.
               She immediately obeyed the summons, and they wept in each other's arms, till calmed by exhaustion. Mrs. Ashley then placed her daughter on a seat, and tremulously said:
               "Do not attempt to utter the commonplaces of consolation, my love. They cannot reach my heart, or take from it one pang for the loss of our best friend. I grieve not only that he is gone, but that he should have been snatched away at such a crisis in your fate. Alas! Bessie, my promise to you cannot now be redeemed: all that remains for you, is to fulfil his last wishes, and I am sure they will be sacred to you."
               Bessie regarded her with a frightened expression, and pleadingly said:
               "Oh, Minny, don't say that, for Frank and I have talked over what you said the other night to me; he repeated to me the conversation he had with you the next morning and we have decided that things shall remain as they now are, till his return; you will possess all the authority that can be wielded over me now, and I promise to keep my heart free for him till he comes back. Do not ask me to marry him at present, even if my grandfather did wish it, for I am certain that Frank has as little of the right sort of love for me, as I have for him. Besides, I think it will be disrespectful to the memory of him that is gone, to have a wedding in the house so soon after his death, for Frank told me yesterday that he intends to obey grandpa's last injunctions so soon as he can make his arrangements for leaving this country."
               Bessie spoke in a rapid and excited manner, and Mrs. Ashley took several turns across the floor before she made any attempt to reply, she then sat down beside the young girl looking pale and resolved, though she tenderly said:
               "Bessie, you cannot doubt my deep affection for you; it has been demonstrated in every act of my life for many years past, and I believe that I care more for your happiness and prosperity than I do my own."
               "I know it—I feel sure of it, Minny," was the impulsive sive reply. "No mother could be more careful and tender of her child than you have been of me."
               Mrs. Ashley winced, but she impressively went on:
               "Will you believe me, love, when I assure you that not only your prosperity but your absolute safety depends on claiming Frank as your protector before he goes on this errand which has not yet been explained to you. You force me to touch on ground which should be held sacred; to give you a glimpse of the skeleton that inhabits this house."
               The lips of the listener parted, and her eyes expanded to their utmost size:
               "You speak in riddles, Minny, which I shall be glad to have explained. I had no suspicion that any disgraceful secret has been concealed from me. If it is a family heritage, let me know it at once; if Frank and I are joint heirs to a reproach which we must bear in common, it may draw us more nearly together; but until this moment, I believed our family honor to be untainted."
               Mrs. Ashley shrank from the pained expression on that young face, at the bare suspicion of dishonor, and she trembled before the possibility that her own crime might at some future day become known to her child. With some effort she went on:
               "Deeply as you are interested in this sad story, it has been kept from you because neither your grandfather nor I could bear to shadow your young life with the knowledge of the truth concerning your father. But you compel me to lay bare the shameful record, and show you on what a precipice you stand, unless you consent to accept the only protector who is able to save you from the evils that menace you."
               After a struggle to control her voice, Bessie said:
               "It is I, then, who have a taint upon my name, and poor Frank is to shield me from its blighting consequences. Speak, Minny, and enlighten me as to my true position, for your words only plunge me more deeply in the labyrinth in which, it seems, I have so long unconsciously wandered."
               There was a dignity and pathos in the tones of the speaker which proved that in this crisis she would not be wanting to herself; and conscience-stricken as Mrs. Ashley felt, she knew that she must plunge herself still more deeply in the slough of falsehood and sin, or risk the loss of all she had so long labored to gain.
               She steadied her voice and went on:
               "It is with extreme reluctance that I lift the veil from the past, but it has become my sad duty to do so, and I submit to the necessity that rules me. Bessie, the son of Judge Ashley was a murderer; he fled from justice, and took refuge in Europe, where he yet lives under an assumed name. He is a wretched, reckless profligate, who cares for nothing save his own enjoyment. He has formed other ties—has other children, who may come hither to thrust you aside, if you do not secure your own position by obeying the will of your grandfather at once. Leon Ashley will be sure to return here now his father is dead, and unless he finds you and Frank married, he may resume his own name and claim the estate as heir at law. Such things have been done before now, and they may be done again."
               Mrs. Ashley might have spoken much longer without interruption, for Bessie seemed frozen into immobility by this unexpected revelation. She sat, white and rigid, for many moments after Mrs. Ashley ceased speaking, and her mother was beginning to feel alarmed at her overwhelming emotion, when she uttered a convulsive sob and said:
               
               "My father living! a criminal—bearing the reproach of blood upon him! Capable of circumventing the last wishes of his only parent, of impoverishing his child! Oh! Minny! what a catalogue of evil to place at once before the eyes of his daughter! You were cruel to tell me this, for this man dare not return to his native land; he dare not assume his own name again."
               "My dear Bessie, the man I speak of will dare anything by which he can serve his own interests. He has already written for permission to return here, and he asserts that he is so changed that no one could recognize him as Leon Ashley; but now the Judge is gone, he will care little for that, and he will risk everything to carry out his own wishes. The crime for which he fled could never have been brought home to him, and he knows it. It was only the sensitive family pride of his father which forced Leon Ashley to the course which he took. Now the Judge is dead, he will be quite capable of returning; of laying on him the blame of the fraud that was perpetrated, and resuming his own name again. Should he do so, it will be with a view of stripping you and Frank of the inheritance bequeathed to you by your grandfather. Do you fully understand me, child?"
               Bessie pressed her hands to her forehead and vaguely said:
               "I believe I do; but my brain seems very much confused. I shall be able to think more clearly presently, and to comprehend what will be the best course for me to pursue."
               Mrs. Ashley urgently said:
               "There is but one safe course, Bessie. Think what you position will be if this unprincipled man comes hither, assumes the position of master in this house, and gives his wife the authority to control you. He will have the power to separate you from me; nay—he must do so, for I shall leave Ashurst before such a ruler as he will prove can enter its walls."
               The poor girl, thus sorely pressed, threw herself upon the breast of the wily speaker, with a burst of deep emotion, and sobbed:
               "I see—I see that there is no escape for me. Do with me as you please, Minny; if Frank knows this story, and is still willing to accept me as his wife, and protect me from my own father, I will no longer refuse to give him my hand. But we must be married on the eve of his departure, and he must leave me with you."
               "Of course, love," replied the triumphant schemer, clasping her daughter fondly to her heart.
               "I would never willingly consent to throw you in contact with Mr. Ashley, and if Frank goes to him as your husband, bearing with him a copy of his father's will, he may make no efforts to come back here when he finds that nothing is to be gained by it."
               Bessie extricated herself from her arms, and pleadingly said:
               "There, Minny—please excuse me now; I must leave you, and think over all this in solitude. When I am alone I can struggle to regain the calmness and self-control necessary for all that I have to go through with."
               Mrs. Ashley said:
               "You can remain here, love, for I must seek Frank and confer with him."
               She placed Bessie on a sofa, lowered the curtains and softly left the room for the purpose of informing Wentworth of the consent she had extorted from Bessie in so false a manner, that the ceremony of marriage should be performed before he left Ashurst.
               She found him in the library selecting such books as he wished to take with him on his voyage, and he listened to what she had to say with some surprise, for he and Bessie had mutually agreed that they would defer their union till after his return from Europe.
               Mrs. Ashley frankly placed before him her most urgent reasons for wishing it to take place before Leon Ashley became aware of his father's death, and she contrived to inspire the young man with so great a dread of his unknown kinsman, that he believed the only safe course for Bessie would be to take shelter from her father's authority under the protection of a husband.
               He gravely said:
               "I regret that you were compelled to throw this shadow on Bessie's life; but, as you say, it was the only course left open to you. Since she consents, we will fulfil the conditions of the will, and I doubt not that we shall ultimately find the blessing promised to obedient children. Reassure my poor cousin, and tell her that everything shall be arranged as she wishes. She shall remain here with you, and when I come back to claim her, and assume my rights as master here, my first act will be to retain you as our beloved companion and guide. Neither Bessie nor I could be happy if you were turned out of the home over which you have so long presided."
               Mrs. Ashley took his hand in both of her own, and tenderly said:
               "Dear Frank, I feel assured that so thoughtful and noble a man as you are, must make the happiness of any woman he may love. Bessie is as dear to me as if she were my own child, but I give her to you with the fond assurance that you are fully worthy of her."
               "I will try and prove that your confidence is not misplaced, Minny. But now I must leave you, for I have a hundred things to attend to before I can leave Ashurst."
               "And when do you propose to go?"
               "To-morrow night on the ten o'clock train; so Bessie will not have much time left for further wavering. If so much for us both were not at stake, I hardly think I would accept her decision; but I hope it will turn out for the best. The lawyer who made grandpa's will, promised to come here at four this afternoon to read it. In the morning I will procure the license, and have the minister here to give me my bonny bride before night falls. How does that suit you?"
               "You are a man of action, Frank," replied Mrs. Ashley, with a faint smile, as she turned away to leave the room. "Only deal as promptly with your uncle, and we may not have the calamity of having him come hither, to establish himself in our very midst."
               "He will hardly think of that," said Frank, in some dismay. "He might be arrested, you know, for what he did so long ago."
               "There is no knowing what such a man as Leon Ashley may not do," was the reply, as Mrs. Ashley disappeared.
               Frank sat down and wrote a brief note to Bessie, thanking her for the concession she had made, and assured her that he would never have taken advantage of her consent to become his under such painful circumstances, but for the conviction he felt that she would need his protection.
               Having sent this to her by Winny, he set himself resolutely to work to prepare for his speedy departure.
               In the afternoon, Mr. Lake, the lawyer, came over from the neighboring town, bringing with him his clerk as witness to the will which he had drawn up several years before.
               Though Bessie had been weeping as if her heart would break, she bathed her eyes, and forced herself to become calm enough to join the party in the library.
               
               She listened with painful interest to the precautions the testator had taken to secure her fate from the grasp of her supposed father, and she felt deeply grateful for his care for her future. She sighed faintly as she saw that only as the wife of Frank Wentworth could she avail herself of the magnificent provision made for her; if she refused his hand, she was to have but three hundred dollars a year allowed her during life, and her home was no longer to be at Ashurst.
               To Leon Larne, his beloved nephew, was bequeathed the sum of ten thousand dollars, secured in such a manner that it must ultimately descend to his son. To Mrs. Ashley was devised property amounting to fifty thousand dollars, independent of the third of his estate which the law would allow her as his widow.
               When the reading was over, the two ladies retired, and Frank gave a power of attorney to Mr. Lake to act for him in his absence. After a long discussion of the affairs of the estate, it was settled between them that they were to be carried on exactly as they had been during the life of the late owner of the place. Judge Ashley was a kind and considerate master to his numerous slaves, and Frank desired to walk in his footsteps, so far as they were concerned, as exactly as possible.
               The sun was declining rapidly when Mr. Lake took his leave, and Frank, tired of his long sitting, went out to breathe the fresh air. On his return, as he approached the door, the betrothed pair met, and the unnatural pallor of Bessie, increased by the effect of her mourning dress, struck him painfully. In a tone of concern he asked:
               "Are you ill, Bessie, or is it your mind that affects you thus? You look as if you had passed through a spell of sickness."
               "Oh, Frank, don't ask me," she hurriedly replied, "for I hardly know whether I am suffering from physical or mental illness. I know that everything is changed with me—that I am in a strange and unnatural position. But you are most noble to be willing to overlook the stain my father's guilt has brought upon me—to bring yourself in collision with him who may cause you so much trouble and humiliation."
               "My dear Bessie," he gently replied, "your father and myself must have clashed at any rate. But I shall go to him armed with power over your fate, carrying with me a copy of the will of our grandfather, against which there will be no appeal when once we are married. As to the stain concerning which you appear to be so sensitive, you seem to forget that Mr. Ashley is almost as nearly related to me as to yourself."
               "No, no—I am his child!" and she shivered at the thought.
               "Well, darling, you are not the less lovely and lovable on that account. You look ill and weary, Bessie. Let me take you to your room and leave you to repose: try and get back a little of your natural rosiness, love, before we stand up before the parson together, or he may think that you are really a victim bride."
               "Oh, no, Frank, I could never consider myself that, when so noble a man as you are is ready to take me to your true heart," was the impulsive reply. "I do feel weak and faint, and if you will go with me to the door of my room, I shall be glad to have your arm to lean on."
               When they had gained the foot of the staircase, she submitted to have him almost carry her to her chamber, for she felt so nerveless and weary that it seemed to her as if all her natural resolution had died out of body and spirit.
               As they parted, she whispered:
               
               "Farewell, Frank. When you come back from your journey you shall have nothing to complain of. I will do my best to make a good wife to you."
               "I believe it, darling, and I trust you implicitly."
               Bessie closed the door on him, bolted it, and refused to see any one for the remainder of the day. Even Mrs. Ashley's request for admittance was denied, for the poor girl felt that in solitude alone could she gain the mastery over her rebellious heart.
               She declined taking any supper; but on the next morning she permitted Winny to come in with her breakfast. But she scarcely tasted it; and when the woman was gone, she threw herself upon her knees beside her bed, and prayed as she had never prayed before. She fervently asked for strength and guidance in the painful path she was called on to tread; but the clue to the anguish she evidently struggled with was found in the passionate cry which broke from her lips as she arose from her kneeling position uncomforted:
               "Oh, God! if it is thy will that I impose these bonds upon myself, why dost thou permit my whole being to recoil from them thus! Poor Frank! I am cheating you, and for gold bartering every sacred feeling of the human heart."
               Late in the day she permitted Winny to bring her a cup of tea, which she swallowed with evident effort, but she sent Mrs. Ashley word that she was quite well, and she would meet herself and Mr. Wentworth in the drawing-room when informed that the minister had arrived.
               Mrs. Ashley was glad to be relieved from the necessity of soothing her through those hours of dread and suffering, for she feared that her own factitious courage might give way before the anguish of her child, and the purpose so vital to her be relinquished almost in the moment of accomplishment.
               So the day passed on till six o'clock sounded, when the Reverend Mr. Marsden made his appearance at Ashurst. He was the pastor of an Episcopal chapel which the family attended, and had been a frequent visitor at the house.
               Frank went out to receive him, and Mrs. Ashley, with a sudden feeling of doubt and dismay, saw him dismount and walk toward the door.
               What if she were committing an unpardonable sin in thus forcing her daughter into a union from which she evidently shrank? She had wealth of her own, then why should she not remove this darling of her heart from all chance of contact with the man whose advent she so much dreaded?
               But that course must involve the confession of her own crime, and she could not sacrifice the respect, not only of the outside world, but that of the being she so fondly loved. If Bessie so keenly felt the moral turpitude of the man she believed to be her father, what would her anguish be if the beloved Minny, who had been everything to her, should reveal herself as her mother and almost the equal of Leon Ashley himself in wrong doing?
               No—in that course unmitigated wretchedness lay; and with leaden steps she ascended the stairs leading to her daughter's room, to warn her that the hour for the sacrifice had arrived.
               The door of Bessie's room was now partly unclosed; she was seated beside an open window, in her deep mourning dress, and there was an expression of feverish restlessness in her manner which seemed to indicate impatience for the ordeal to be over.
               As Mrs. Ashley entered she arose and said:
               "Mr. Marsden has come at last. I am glad of it, for if this suspense had lasted much longer, I should have gone mad, I believe. Come—let us do what must be done as quickly as may be; when it is over, I shall feel more composed, for then my fate will be irrevocable."
               "My poor darling, all this excitement has been too much for you, for you have fever now," said Mrs. Ashley, apprehensively. "But why have you not changed your dress? You must not be married in black; it is unlucky for a bride to do so. I ordered Winny to dress you in the new muslin that came home last week."
               "I would not permit Winny to do such a thing. What difference can the color of my dress make, Minny, when my heart and conscience are wrapped in blacker clouds than these sable weeds? With my eyes open to the consequences, I am going to commit the wickedness of promising to love a man for whom I shall never have that feeling, as lovers understand it. But come along; I am ready, and my mind is made up."
               Though shocked and appalled by her appearance and language, Mrs. Ashley had not a word to reply, and she suffered herself to be almost dragged from the room by the impetuous movements of the excited speaker.
               All Bessie's strength and determination seemed to have returned to her, and she moved so rapidly in her descent to the lower hall, that her agitated mother could scarcely keep up with her.
               They gained the entrance to the drawing-room, and Wentworth advanced to meet them. With a glance of inquiry at the wild face of Bessie, he held out his hand to clasp hers and lead her before the clergyman; but with a ringing cry she suddenly evaded him and darted toward the front door as if making a last frantic effort to escape the fate she so deeply dreaded.
               In her blind haste Bessie lost her footing and fell forward ward, striking her head upon the stone steps. She was taken up senseless and bleeding from a wound upon her temple, and she lay so long unconscious that those around her began to fear that she would never recover.
               She finally unclosed her eyes; they fell on the anxious face of Wentworth, and she faintly said:
               "Don't look so scared, Frank; I was only foolish. I like you; indeed I do, but it's of no use to insist on having a wedding now—I can't consent; something tells me that I must not."
               Frank seriously replied:
               "Far be it from me to urge it on you any further, Bessie. I am convinced now that I could not do a more cruel thing than to bind you irrevocably to myself. You are half delirious now, but you can understand me when I say that I will never again urge you to fulfil the promise you have made."
               "Good Frank—noble Frank," she muttered, but everything faded and became dim before her, and she again lay pale and nearly lifeless before them.
               When convinced that Bessie was in no condition to play her part in the ceremony she so anxiously desired to see completed, Mrs. Ashley submitted to have her conveyed to her room, and placed in bed. She would have detained young Wentworth till her daughter was sufficiently recovered to act more rationally, as she expressed herself, but he peremptorily refused to allow another word to be said to her on the subject, and after writing a note of farewell to the sick girl, Frank took his departure that night from Ashurst. Two days later he embarked from Baltimore for Europe.
               Baffled in her wishes, in her parting interview with Frank, Mrs. Ashley so far forgot her caution as to entreat him to induce Leon Ashley to believe that he and Bessie were already united, and any attempt on his part to gain power over her would be useless. Wentworth listened to her with surprise and incredulity. He was far too honorable and straightforward to attempt to play a double part, and he believed that his respected Minny must be a little deranged to propose such a thing to him.
               So Mrs. Ashley saw him depart with many wretched forebodings as to the troubles which were to grow out of Bessie's wilfulness.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVII.
               A HAPPY PAIR.
               THE letter of Augusta to Judge Ashley scarcely exaggerated the condition to which Leon Ashley's habits of extravagance and dissipation had reduced himself and his family. He was now but the miserable wreck of the handsome Lothario who had once been irresistible to the fairer part of creation, and as he sat in the shabby room of his obscure lodging, bloated by excess, pallid from disease, and irritable by nature, but few traces could be found of the debonair deceiver who had broken at least two hearts, and bound to himself a third which still clung to him in spite of the poverty and humiliation to which his profligate courses had brought her.
               The faithful nursing of his wife and daughter had restored him to life, though there was little hope that he would ever regain health, and day by day he tormented those two untiring women by frightful outbreaks of temper which they often feared would prove fatal.
               For a few years after his union with Augusta, Ashley had surrounded his new idol with every luxury, but gradually his passion for gambling increased, and that which he felt for his wife decreased in the same ratio.
               Her indulgences were curtailed, not without a severe struggle on her side, which only alienated her selfish husband still more. Ashley almost ceased to cherish any regard for her, while she still felt for him a passion which seemed only to glow with fiercer power at each new proof of his indifference.
               The excuse he gave to her for narrowing her expenses, was the necessity of keeping the child he had taken in such state as became the heiress of so large a fortune, but his wife knew that the income derived from the Arden estate was quite sufficient to support them all in luxury if it were used for that purpose.
               Ashley seemed to become really fond of the little girl, and he regularly visited her as long as she remained in England. When she attained her fifteenth year he removed her to Paris and placed her in a convent in which a school was kept for the children of the higher orders of society.
               Every attempt to buy off Jane had signally failed; she would not consent to leave her charge on any terms, so she was perforce retained nominally as Evelyn's maid, but really as the attendant of Mrs. Ashley, and the bearer of much of her husband's ill humor. But the woman bore all patiently, in the belief that when Evelyn attained her majority, and came in possession of her fortune, she would be amply compensated for all she now endured.
               The irritated wife soon found that the expense incurred for the child was a mere excuse, for she too was made to feel the pressure produced by Ashley's heavy losses at the gaming table. The reckless fury of the unsuccessful gambler seized him, and no sooner did supplies reach him from the United States than they were recklessly thrown upon the écarté table, risked and usually lost.
               With difficulty, and at the expense of much contention, Augusta rescued enough to maintain her small household in meagre style. Society she had long since given up; faded in beauty and badly dressed, she, who had once been a queen in her little realm of fashion, would no longer appear among those who had once known her as la belle Americaine; who had complimented her on the evident devotion of the man who could now with the coolest indifference see her in want of the common comforts of life.
               When Evelyn was four years old, a son was born, and for a brief season Ashley seemed delighted with the child and his mother. He wrote to his father, announcing Maitland's birth and requesting him to change his will and make the boy co-heir with his half-sister to the estates to which he himself intended to put in no claim.
               While awaiting a reply, with perfect confidence that his wish would be granted, Ashley lavished presents on both mother and child, and poor Augusta believed that in her maternal character she had regained the waning affection of her heartless husband.
               But the new hopes that dawned on her were blighted ere they bore fruit by the reply of Judge Ashley refusing peremptorily to alter the disposition he had already made of his property in favor of the two grandchildren who had been received beneath his roof.
               He stated that a sufficient sum to educate the boy and start him in life would be set aside and bequeathed to his father to be used for that purpose, but he explicitly said that the son of the woman who had usurped the place of poor Grace while she yet lived and suffered, should never share his estate equally with his other heirs.
               In the fury of his own disappointment, Ashley forgot the contemptuous manner in which his father had spoken of his wife, and he rudely threw the letter to her as he said:
               "There—read the precious morceaux for yourself, and see that your petted darling will be a beggar. I hoped the old man would be so much pleased at the birth of a boy that he would come down handsomely, but he is as hard as granite. I wonder how much of this disappointment I owe to my precious step-mother. If she had any hand in it, I will yet find means to make her repent of it before I die. My father cannot live forever, and when he is gone, she will see—what she will see. I have never yet been able to learn anything of her antecedents, for the old man is as close as wax; but I will find means to know all about them when the right time comes."
               Augusta had taken up the letter, and was too painfully absorbed in its contents to listen to him. With intense disappointment, and much resentment, she read what was written with reference to herself and her son. She crushed the sheet, and angrily said:
               "Your father has very little respect for your feelings, or he would never speak to you in such terms of a wife who has proved her devotion to you as I have. He must be in his dotage, and if he cuts off your son with a bare pittance from his large fortune, you will scarcely find it difficult hereafter to prove that he was incapable of making a will."
               "I believe the old man is as sound in his mind as either you or I, but that will not prevent me from acting as you suggest whenever he is safe under the sod," replied her husband, with brutal sangfroid. "I did hope that he would increase my beggarly allowance, and I meant to give the addition to you and the boy. You could have made yourself more comfortable than you often are, but the old man is miserly. He may live to the age of Methuselah, so there's no knowing how long this half way life may have to continue."
               Augusta retorted, with a clouded brow:
               "If you would make a better use of the means you already have, we need not live in this wretched manner. Of late you have been more liberal to me, and why should you now cease to be so?"
               Ashley's face darkened, and he wrathfully said:
               "The Arden income is my own lawful spoil, gained by my own cleverness. If I am to keep the brat and rear her as a lady, I must derive some benefit from her. It is useless to save from the income, for if the exchange of children is ever discovered, the money would be wrested from me."
               At this suggestion Augusta grew pale.
               "Discovery can never ruin us, unless Jane proves false. Do you apprehend treachery from her?"
               "No, indeed—I merely spoke of possibilities. Jane is far too fond of the child to betray anything that could injure her. Evelyn is really a winning little creature, and I was fond of her before the boy came to rival her. But now I cannot help resenting the thought that this unknown child is to inherit wealth to which she was never born, while our son will have nothing worth speaking of. It is a bitter thought—a bitter thought."
               Augusta sighed, and regarded him searchingly before she ventured to reply. Then she uttered the thought that was in her mind in a low and guarded tone:
               "We must use every effort to make Evelyn fond of the boy. She may never marry, you know, and when she is of age, she may be induced to share the estate with him while she lives, and bequeath it to him at her death. Management can accomplish a great deal."
               Ashley burst into a bitter and sarcastic laugh:
               "So—o—you have really become a plotter since you had this mannikin to provide for! You are sharper than I, of late, have thought you, Augusta. For the present, things must take their course, but when my young heiress is grown into womanhood, you may be sure that I shall find means to give the larger portion of poor Grace's fortune to my son. He has a better right to it than this beggar's brat that we so strangely found just when we needed her."
               The face of his wife brightened, and she replied:
               "The child will owe us a great debt of gratitude, at any rate, for removing her from those low people and placing her in a good position. She will receive an education which will hereafter enable her to be independent should anything happen."
               "Why, what should happen to reduce her to that?" he peevishly asked. "I intend to keep my own secret, and I hope you are not likely to betray it."
               "I! no, indeed. I would suffer torture sooner than do such a thing."
               "Well, then, don't speak of such a contingency, unless you wish me to lose my temper with you."
               Thus warned, Mrs. Ashley was silent, and the conversation ended for that time, though both acted on the hint conveyed by Augusta. There was little need of any extraneous influence to induce Evelyn to attach herself to the boy. She showed such extreme fondness for him, that both mother and father finally parted from Maitland, and he was left in the English parsonage in which Evelyn's first years were spent, under the care of Jane, and the tuition of the reverend Mr. Wallis.
               When she was removed to Paris, the lad was at a troublesome age, and he was left in England at a public school, in which he acquired more slang than Latin or mathematics: from there he was removed at the time of his father's illness, and he was now at a school in the suburbs of Vienna, studying the German language.
               It was well for Evelyn that her life was spent far from the shabby genteel home of her reputed father, in which profusion or niggardliness alternately reigned as money was plenty or scarce. When she attained her eighteenth year she was suddenly removed from the seclusion of her convent, and told that a severe reverse in her father's fortune compelled him to stop the heavy expense incurred by her education. She did not demur at this, for she had made good use of the opportunities afforded her, and she possessed not only a sound English education, for which she had to thank Mr. Wallis, but she had acquired many brilliant accomplishments, the fruits of her three years stay in Paris.
               The young girl found Ashley and his wife in poor lodgings, which contrasted painfully with the simple elegance to which she had been accustomed in her aristocratic school; for Ashley had placed her in the best one, lest those who knew from what source the greater portion of his resources were drawn, should accuse him of meanness.
               That Evelyn was the true daughter of Grace Arden had never been questioned, for after several years of absence, when the dark-eyed little gypsy was presented to his friends as such, while on a brief visit to Paris, no one doubted that she was really the child of his deranged wife. A run of ill luck exhausted the finances of Ashley; his health broke down under his various excesses, and he precipitately left France to avoid the payment of gaming debts he found himself utterly unable to cancel.
               He was seized with severe illness soon after reaching Vienna, and from his bedside Augusta wrote the letter which reached Judge Ashley the night before his decease.
               The orphan child had developed into a lovely little fairy, with dark, soft eyes, and ebon tresses, which swept to the floor when unloosed from their bands, and allowed to float around her person. Her dark, clear complexion was brightened by the roses on her cheeks, and the vivid coral of her lips.
               Her slight figure was perfectly proportioned, and Titania herself was never more graceful or charming than this nameless wanderer on the face of the earth.
               Happily ignorant of her true position, she grew up with the sweetness of her nature unembittered by the knowledge of the ambiguous station she held in the family of the man she truly believed to be her father. In spite of the indifference he usually manifested toward her, Evelyn loved him with tenderness, and waited on him with such loving care during his illness, that a faint semblance of his early fondness for her was aroused in his selfish heart.
               But the coldness of Augusta was invincible, and she only tolerated the innocent interloper near her because she manifested such unaffected fondness for Maitland. The boy grew into a handsome, sprightly lad, and his belle sœur, as he often called Evelyn, loved him with a degree of tenderness scarcely surpassed by that felt for him by his fond mother herself.
               Mrs. Ashley smiled when she saw them together, and thought that the sacrifice which Evelyn would hereafter be called upon to make would not be so difficult on her part if her affection for her brother kept pace with her development.
               The decision that she should never marry, which had been made in Evelyn's infancy, only gained strength as years passed on, and a hint was given to the sisters under whose charge she was placed, that if she could be induced to take the veil after she attained her majority, a large slice from her inheritance should be added to the wealth of the institution.
               
               If any efforts were made to act on this intimation, they were completely neutralized by the influence of Jane, who was received in the convent as a lay sister while Evelyn remained in its walls.
               She had conceived a fanatical attachment for the child she had assisted to place in the brilliant position she believed Evelyn must attain, and she was determined that her protégé should never be buried in the obscurity of a convent while the fortune Ashley had adopted her to secure, was given to his son.
               Jane fathomed the wishes of the parents and coolly thwarted them, certain that they would never dare to find fault with anything she chose to do. In place of a quiet and secluded life becoming agreeable in Evelyn's eyes, her thoughts were sedulously filled with the worldly prestige to which she was destined, thus effectually preventing the peace of a religious life from assuming any charms in her inexperienced eyes.
               When convinced that Evelyn would never be induced to assume the vows, Ashley at once removed her from her expensive convent, and made her a partaker of the mean and shiftless life he had so long lived. As her shadow, Jane followed her, and at this crisis she was welcome, as his straitened means allowed him to keep but one other servant, and the English woman took upon herself the duties of housekeeper and waiting-maid much to the relief of the faded and fretful Augusta.
               Ashley, partially restored to health, sat in a large chair, with his swollen feet supported on cushions; near him was placed a table on which stood a decanter with a small quantity of wine in it, and a half empty glass.
               His wife and daughter were both in the room with him; the former in a soiled morning dress, with her hair still in curl papers; Evelyn in the dark grey robe she had worn in the convent, made of very fine material, and finished at the throat and wrist with a narrow edging of white linen. Her massive hair was coiled at the back of her head, and fastened with a plain comb, and she looked the very type of neatness and good taste. She was busily employed in embroidering a satin vest for Maitland, and her white fingers moved deftly among the flowers her skill created.
               The inflamed eyes of Ashley wandered from his wife, sitting in a careless attitude with a soiled novel in her hand in which she seemed deeply interested, toward the alert and pleasing figure of the girl, and he sneeringly said:
               "I think, Madam, that you would do well to follow the example of your daughter, and try and make yourself more presentable. Those papillottes are odious to me, as you well know, and the old dress you have on has scarcely become less so in my sight. Will you put down that trash of Eugene Sue's and listen to me when I speak?"
               Thus rudely attacked, Mrs. Ashley lowered her book, glanced deprecatingly toward her husband, and almost humbly said:
               "The dress is the best I have for morning wear, Leon. If you will spare me money to get a better, I shall be very glad; as to my hair, you never liked to see it dressed in bands, and I must, of course, keep it in papers till it will curl. Don't be unreasonable, love, for I do the best I can."
               Her submissiveness seemed only to make him more bitter; he tauntingly went on:
               "When I married you, Mrs. Ashley, I thought I was getting a wife to be proud of, but there is nothing left to boast of you now. You are hardly thirty-five, Gus, and you look as haggard as a witch. I have just been comparing your faded features with the freshness of Evy, and I must say that you gain nothing by the comparison."
               
               At his last words the angry color flashed into Augusta's face, and Evelyn raised her head with an expression of indignant surprise upon her features. She spoke with spirit.
               "For shame, father! How can you speak thus when mamma has lost her bloom in nursing you through your long illness? If you had seen her by your bedside at all hours, as I did, you would find it impossible to speak to her as you did just now."
               Ashley glared on her as he harshly said:
               "Hey day! who asked you to speak up, Miss? You nursed me as much as my wife did, and I do not see that you suffered from it. She has grown as ugly as Macbeth's witches, and I shall tell her so when it suits me. What is the use of having a wife, if I can't speak my mind to her without disguise?"
               Evelyn was afraid to utter the reply that arose to her lips, so she firmly closed them, and Augusta weakly moaned:
               "Once you called me beautiful and adored. Nothing was too fine or too costly to lavish upon me; but since your heart has turned to other idols, you have no tenderness for me—no forbearance toward me."
               He jeeringly replied:
               "Men have different idols at different stages of existence, Madam. You were one of mine in the verdant period of youth, and you had no cause to complain of me so long as the delusion lasted. I gave you more than I could afford; my devotion made you the envy of every woman of your acquaintance, but I was prodigal of that as I was of my money, and soon exhausted it in the same way. What would you have, Madam? Gold from an exhausted mine?—fruit from a blighted tree?—wine from withered grapes? Is it more reasonable to expect a lover's ardor from a broken down wreck such as I am? Pooh! don't be a fool, Gussy. It vexes me to see a woman cry; besides, it makes you even uglier than you were before."
               After this insulting tirade, Ashley coolly lifted his glass, viewed the effect of the light through the ruby liquid, and then sipped it slowly, as if enjoying its flavor with the gusto of a connoisseur.
               His wife arose, and hastily left the room; Evelyn laid aside her work, and her dilating eyes and quivering lips showed how indignant she was at the cruel want of feeling exhibited by her father. After a struggle to control herself, she spoke in a low, tremulous voice:
               "Sir—my father, will you permit me to speak with you on a subject that interests me?"
               "If I find it possesses any interest for me, you may," he yawningly responded. "But you must be quick about it, for I am getting deucedly somniferous under the influence of this good tipple. It's a shame that you and your mother stint my allowance as you do. Just wait till I am strong enough to walk about, and see if you will keep me from drinking as much as I please then."
               "The doctor strictly forbade your having more than a pint a day, father, and after your late attack, you know that it is necessary to be very careful. May I freely tell you what has been in my mind lately, sir? You promise that you won't get angry at what I am going to say?"
               "What the deuce are you driving at, Evy? What if I do get angry? I should think you are sufficiently used to that to care little about it. I won't lose my temper if I can help it, for you are a deuced pretty little rosebud to have about one, and I don't care about driving you away by my harshness."
               Evelyn smiled faintly at this doubtful compliment, and presently went on:
               "Our life here is not a pleasant one, and you seem quite tired of it, as well as mamma. Jane says that I am a great heiress; that I have large estates in Maryland, and if we were only there we could live in grand style. Why shall we not go there, father? I should like to see that great country, and visit the native home of my mother. If I am rich, you shall have everything you can desire—mamma should no longer annoy you by her appearance in a shabby dress, and Maitland should have the dogs and horses he is so fond of. Of course, what is mine would be equally yours to enjoy with me."
               Ashley sat mutely staring at the speaker, wide enough awake now, and when she finished her little speech, he furiously said:
               "What foolery has that old dotard been putting into your silly head? Heiress—umph! Suppose you are one, what then? You have no power over anything till you are of age, and your guardian will allow no more than is necessary to keep you respectably. I have no control over your mother's property, nor could I claim any if I returned to the United States. My uncle is your guardian, and he is as close as wax. As to going back to Maryland, I never expect to do such a thing, and I forbid you to speak of such a possibility again."
               For a few moments Evelyn was abashed by his harshness, but she presently recovered her courage, and went on:
               "If I am to have so much money when I am of age, is there not some way by which I could get enough for us to live on in greater comfort till that time arrives? In mamma's novels I have read of young men who had great expectations, raising money on—on some sort of promise to pay when they obtained their inheritance. Why can I not do something of that sort, and get means to obtain a better place for us to live in?"
               The suggestion was eagerly caught at by the needy and unscrupulous man, and he quickly said:
               "You are sharper than I gave you credit for, Evelyn, and you are an affectionate little thing to be willing to forestall your inheritance for the sake of your mother and myself. I do not know how it can be managed, but if you would join in a bond with me, perhaps the usurers might be dealt with. Only, you see your property is so far away that it will be difficult to do much, I am afraid. We may chance to find a broker who has friends in the United States; if we can do so, after such delay as will enable them to ascertain if the security is good, we may be able to accomplish something. I am so hard up just now that I am willing to resort to any means of raising the wind."
               Evelyn earnestly replied:
               "Do make the effort, dear father, for I cannot bear the thought that I have more than I need, yet those who manage my affairs deny you the enjoyment of what I would so gladly give you. Now that I am quite a grown young lady, will my guardian not consent to make me a larger allowance? It is but just that he should do so, and then I could make poor mamma happy by giving her so many things that she needs; neither should dear Maty ask in vain for such indulgences as boys of his age most prize."
               Ashley was as much moved as it was in his nature to be by her disinterestedness, though he made up his mind at once to see if anything could be done in the way Evelyn suggested, careless that he would thus implicate her in drawing money from an estate to which she had no legal claim. He cared little for that, however, so the necessities of the hour were provided for, and he more kindly said:
               "I will think of this, Evy, and see what can be done."
               She thanked him warmly, resumed her work, and sat wondering if all married people lived as wretchedly together as her father and his wife did. If so, she thought that people were best single, and she was rapidly making up her mind to the very course her father most wished her to pursue, when Jane interrupted her sage reverie, by coming in with a card in her hand, and a message to the effect that a gentleman was waiting to be admitted to an interview with Mr. Ashley.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVIII.
               LEON HEARS OF HIS FATHER'S DEATH.
               ASHLEY impatiently held out his hand, exclaiming, in a vexed tone:
               "Who can have found me out in this obscure place? I do hope it is not an infernal dun. Good heavens, what a life I live! Hunted by creditors; always in bodily pain; with scarcely a comfort around me! A dog could not be much worse off than I am."
               Evelyn arose, took the card from the hand of her nurse, and read the name aloud:
               "Frank Wentworth, from Maryland,' Oh! papa, this may be a messenger sent by my grandfather."
               In the surprise of the moment Ashley was thrown off his guard, and he bitterly said:
               "My nephew! what the deuce has brought him here? Sent by the old man to spy out the nakedness of the land, I suppose, and to report on my shortcomings. Well, let him come; it is cold comfort he will have to take back with him to the hard-hearted old heathen that fate gave me for a father."
               His words astonished and shocked Evelyn, and she hurriedly said:
               "Dear papa, don't speak thus of one so near to you as my grandfather is. I did not know that you had a nephew, but now he has come so far to visit us, he should not be kept standing so long at the door. Shall not Jane invite him to come in at once?"
               "Well, ye-es; I suppose she must; but do you vanish before he makes his appearance. What did I call him—my nephew? Ha! ha! I must have been demented. The young man is a relation of mine, but not so near as that—oh no, not so near by a good deal."
               He appeared to be tremulous and excited, and the finger he pointed toward the door through which he wished her to retreat shook violently. Though surprised at the denial of the relationship he had just proclaimed, Evelyn retreated without reply, wondering why her father had so long expatriated himself from his native land, and what could be the cause of the estrangement which evidently existed between himself and his own father.
               It had never been concealed from Evelyn that such a person was yet in existence, though she did not know him under his true name, and she was extremely anxious to see the messenger who had possibly been sent on an errand of forgiveness, for she vaguely knew that a strong feud existed between Leon Ashley and his father.
               With pardonable girlish curiosity Evelyn left the door through which she passed imperfectly closed till she obtained a view of the young stranger, who was promptly ushered in by Jane. Through the crevice she obtained a glimpse of a fine looking man, with a most pleasing expression on his candid face, and a quantity of blonde hair thrown back from his high brow.
               Feeling like a guilty eavesdropper, Evelyn softly closed the door as Frank came forward with his honest blue eyes beaming with sympathy for the kinsman he found so reduced in health and circumstances. He paused in front of the bloated figure propped up in the chair, and frankly said:
               "My dear sir, I am extremely concerned to find you still so much of an invalid. So soon as Mrs. Ashley's letter was received at Ashurst arrangements were made to send me hither, to afford to your wife and daughter such assistance as they might need in the event of anything fatal having occurred. I cannot tell you how glad I am to find that you have slipped out of the clutches of the grim conqueror."
               Ashley surveyed him with cold mistrust; he scarcely touched the offered hand, and haughtily replied:
               "Be seated, Mr. Wentworth. I scarcely expected you to be sent as a messenger between my father and myself. If he had the least consideration for me, he would have known that the man who has supplanted my son in his affections would never be a welcome ambassador to me."
               Wentworth looked surprised and a little offended at this reception, but a single glance at the broken-down man who thus vented his spite filled him with compassion for him, and he quietly replied:
               "You seem to forget that I too was the grandson of Judge Ashley. I had nothing to do with the disposition of his estate, for to that I presume you refer. He did with his own as he deemed right."
               With sudden interest Ashley asked:
               "What do you mean by speaking thus? Is the old man dead? Has he at last gone where he will meet the reward of his hardness to his only son?"
               Shocked beyond measure at his words, and the tone in which they were uttered, for several moments Frank could not reply. He at last spoke in a low, chilled tone:
               "My grandfather is dead, but before his decease the arrangements to send me hither were made. But for his earnestly expressed wishes on the night before he died, I should not have come at all. Now that I am here on a mission of affection dictated by him, I trust that I shall hear nothing disrespectful to his memory spoken."
               The unmoved son coldly said:
               "Oh, I dare say. You are paid to be respectful by the gift of half his estate, while I am probably left worse off than I was before. I do not know why I should affect grief for the death of the unnatural parent who turned against me years ago, who condemned me to exile and poverty; for the contemptible pittance annually allowed me bore no proportion to the wealth which I was justly entitled to share. Judge Ashley had lived his allotted time on earth, and if God saw fit to remove him, why should the son he had banished and injured pretend to feel sorrow that he is gone."
               He fixed upon the shocked face of the listener a pair of bleared eyes, from which all softness had long since vanished, though there was now in them a flash of evil passion that showed he meant what he said.
               Indignant and repelled, Wentworth said:
               "When I tell you that the last news from you proved his death blow, perhaps your hard heart may be touched. The letter written by your wife from the side of what she supposed your dying bed, was received by your father late in the afternoon. The next morning he was found dead in his bed."
               If Ashley felt any remorse, he was determined to conceal it from his visitor, and after a brief pause, he coolly said:
               "Then Mrs. Ashley for once did me a good service, though I was very angry when I was told of that puling letter. I have for years been looking forward to this event, and you cannot expect me to lament it when I tell you that the ban that keeps me from my native land is now removed. My father forced me to become a wanderer on the face of the earth, and I resented it while he lived; I shall scarcely cease to resent it now he is gone. The old man was nearly eighty, and nothing was more natural than the sudden going out of his life as an exhausted lamp. I am skeptical as to the belief that any news from his cast-off son could have affected him so seriously as to cause death."
               "You would think differently, sir, if you had heard him speak of you in his last interview with me. He then exacted from me the promise to come to your assistance which I have since carried out."
               A purple flush crossed the face of the invalid, and he harshly asked:
               "Are you aware of the cause of my expatriation? but of course you are, since you were sent on this errand; but tell me this—did the old man tell you all?"
               "My grandfather only referred to the unwitnessed duel between yourself and young Arden. He explained to me that he had himself insisted that you should escape the disgrace of a trial by the ruse he afterwards bitterly repented. That was the extent of his confidence in me, sir."
               Ashley drew a long breath, and his face assumed a more cordial expression; he said:
               "And now that my father is dead, and the consequent disgrace to himself, if the false burial became known, can never affect him, have you not come to invite me to return to my native land, to resume my true name, and take possession of the home of my forefathers?"
               Wentworth hastened to reply:
               "I certainly came hither with no such intentions. Judge Ashley never for one moment dreamed that you would think of such a thing. With the charge of murder still hanging over you, it would be madness to attempt it."
               "Ah! bah! that is nothing. The affair happened ages ago, and there is little danger that I should be troubled about it, even if I were to return to Maryland. Besides, as you say, it was a duel, and no man is in danger from killing his antagonist in a fair fight. But I wish it understood that I did not kill Ernest Arden. He was but slightly wounded, when he fell in the pond on the brink of which we fought. I was stunned, or I could have saved him, and the doctor's declared that the wound found on him was not mortal. But you have not yet said a word of that which is most vital to us. What disposition has Judge Ashley made of his fortune?"
               "I thought you had already been informed of his intentions. Here is a copy of his will, which I have brought for your inspection, and you can see for yourself how the estate is disposed of."
               He drew from his pocket a folded paper and offered it to his uncle. Ashley took out an eye-glass, and hastily ran over the few pages of closely written foolscap, the contents of which were so distasteful to him.
               When he had finished, he dashed the paper to the floor in a paroxysm of anger, and exclaimed:
               "It is infamous! But I should have expected no better treatment at his hands, from the way he has acted toward me for years past. I, who, as the only son and the representative of my family, should have the bulk of the property, am cut off with a pitiful annuity, and a legacy of ten thousand dollars so tied up that I can get no good from it. Not content with that injustice, he has clogged the half of the estate which goes to my daughter with a condition which really gives the whole of it to you. As the husband of Bessie you will take it, and if she refuses to accept you, you get all that is not given to the second wife. Again I say that it is infamous, and I think it extremely impertinent of you to become the bearer of such tidings to the son of the testator."
               Wentworth waited patiently till his wrath exhausted itself, and then quietly replied:
               "I obeyed the last injunctions of my grandfather in coming to you in person. It was his desire that your daughter and myself should be united before my departure, that Bessie might be the companion of my voyage. Your father naturally thought that you must wish to see the child you parted from in her infancy, now that she has grown to be a lovely young woman; but the sudden death of Judge Ashley, combined with other circumstances it is unnecessary to explain, put an end to all thoughts of marriage till after my return."
               "And now you may set aside all such expectations, Mr. Wentworth," said Ashley with bitter emphasis. "I shall resume my own name, return to Maryland, and contest the absurd provisions of the will. You must come in as heir at law to half the property, but the other half I will claim, and gain; and I will also take from my father's last wife the large sum given her over and above her dower."
               Wentworth maintained a disturbed silence a few moments, for he saw plainly how difficult it would prove to deal with such a man as his uncle. He at length said:
               "I must believe that you are merely uttering threats, which you have no intention of carrying into effect, sir. You are aware that Judge Ashley, with all his legal experience, would not be likely to leave behind him a will that can be set aside. Besides, there are so many reasons why you should not return to the United States, that I scarcely think you can be serious in the assertions you have just made. As to the unequal division of the estate so far as you are concerned, I understood from my grandfather that there was an agreement between you that Bessie should take the place you had forfeited, and inherit your portion of his property. So far as I am concerned, sir, I will promise on the part of Bessie and myself, that a third portion of our joint income shall be paid over to you as long as you may live provided you will not attack your father's will."
               Ashley's face cleared a little, and he hesitated a few moments as if considering this proposal; but he finally disdainfully said:
               "The half is justly my due, for while I live Bessie has no just claims on the estate; neither can I consent to sacrifice the interests of my son. He is entitled to as much as either of my other children; but Evelyn does not need anything from her grandfather, so I shall claim the property as mine, and give an equal share of it to Maitland and his elder sister."
               Again Frank remonstrated, though scarcely hoping that his words would produce any good result.
               "I think, sir, that you will risk a great deal by returning to Maryland on such an errand as this; nor do I believe that any attack made by you on my grandfather's will can be successfully sustained. I beg that you will think over my proposal calmly, for I believe you will then see how necessary it is to accept it."
               The visitor arose to take his leave, feeling that he had gained very little in this first interview with his intractable kinsman. With a lowering brow, Ashley sullenly said.
               "You spoke of being the bearer of assistance to me, yet you are preparing to leave without offering any. You must see from my surroundings that I stand greatly in need of funds."
               Frank remembered the caution of his grandfather about placing money in Ashley's hands; but he saw that he was now incapable of seeking his usual haunts of dissipation, and he thought it best to reply to his uncle's appeal by taking out his pocket-book. He drew forth an order for two hundred rix dollars, and offered it to the eager clutch of Ashley, as he said:
               "I was empowered to pay this sum monthly to your wife, but as I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting her, I will give the first instalment to you."
               The furious temper of Leon Ashley now completely overcame him, and for several moments he seemed choking with wrath. He then screamed in a harsh treble that pierced the ears of the listener almost as sharply as the shriek of a steam engine.
               "So-o—you have come here to offer me this insult too! You have the insolence to pretend to pay over to me a tithe of what is justly my due, and presume to say that into my wife's hands the money is to pass, as if I am incapable of managing my own affairs."
               Wentworth was now really angry, and sharply replied:
               "The condition in which I find you, Mr. Ashley, is sufficient proof that you are not to be trusted with money. The man who draws from the estate of one child an income of many thousand dollars; who annually receives from that of his father three thousand more, could never be found almost in want, if he made a just or honorable use of the means in his power."
               It was rare that the domestic tyrant met with any opposition in his family, and the spirit with which Frank spoke rather recommended him to his uncle, hard as were the truths he uttered. He saw that the young man was neither to be trampled on or trifled with, and he felt a rising respect for him, which caused him to speak less vehemently; but he contemptuously said:
               "What are all the resources you name to a man of my magnificent tastes, with half-a-dozen others to share them too? I have lived among men who would think little of losing as much as the half of my income at a single sitting. If I have a spirit equal to that of the highest, who can blame me that I am always out of means?"
               "Every good and true man will do so," replied the young censor, with severity. "No fortune can stand the constant drain made upon it by a reckless gambler. Knowing this, Judge Ashley has doubtless used every precaution to prevent any portion of his estate from falling into your possession, save the annuity he has hitherto allowed you."
               Ashley seemed scarcely to be listening to him, and he suddenly asked:
               "Is the sum you are to pay monthly to my wife to be added to the annuity?"
               "It can be, provided you refrain from attacking the will. You would only have the scandal of the attempt, without any ultimate benefit to yourself."
               Ashley mused a moment, and then said:
               "On second thoughts I believe you are right. It might bring me into a scrape with the authorities if I made myself too notorious after my return to Maryland. But it is my fixed resolution to resume my name, and go back to my native land as soon as I am strong enough to travel. I will not interfere with you and Bessie at Ashurst. I shall take up my residence at Arden Place, and from there negotiate with my natural enemies, the heirs of Judge Ashley, although one of them is my own daughter."
               "I am glad that such is your decision, sir; but indeed you will have no enmity to fear on our side; we shall do all that is possible to satisfy you."
               "Will you promise that on the part of Mrs. Ashley? Who was she, and where did my father pick her up? I have never been able to find out anything about her, and I think she must have humbugged the old fellow nicely to get so large a slice from his property."
               Frank flushed slightly, and with some hauteur replied:
               "Excuse me, sir, but I shall be glad to have Mrs. Ashley spoken of with the respect that is her due. She came to Ashurst as the governess of your daughter; my grandfather had the good taste to appreciate all her charming qualities, and she became his wife—a more devoted one I have never seen. She made the declining years of her husband peaceful and happy, and she has been a mother to Bessie and myself."
               The scornful lips of the listener curled as he listened to this eulogium; he repeated:
               "Governess! indeed! Why, the child was not three months old when she went to Ashurst. I see now how it was; my father, in his dotage, was silly enough to marry the nurse of his granddaughter because she was young and pretty. Proud as Judge Ashley was—hardly as he dealt with your mother and myself for the unequal marriages we made, this misalliance in itself proves that his mind was unsound when he made it."
               Frank shook his head and firmly replied:
               "No one acquainted with Mrs. Ashley could possibly take that view of the case. She is a highly cultivated and most charming woman. I have always heard her spoken of as the governess of Bessie, and if she accepted the inferior situation of nurse to the infant, a severe reverse of fortune must have reduced her beneath the position to which she was born."
               "Pooh! women soon manage to acquire all the airs and graces that set off high station; that is no proof that Mrs. Ashley was not a mere nobody."
               "But she is a well educated woman, sir; she possesses accomplishments which forbid the idea that she was so very much beneath my grandfather."
               "Ah! well, well; I shall soon be able to judge myself of her pretensions. She seems to have cast her glamour over you, as well as over her doting old husband; so I shall get no correct idea of her from your description. Where are you stopping, Mr. Wentworth? I must apologize for my brusqueness, Frank, but you will excuse it when you reflect that I am suffering both in mind and body, and the intelligence of which you were the bearer was not of the most soothing nature."
               His nephew was easily propitiated, for he had the sincerest desire to serve the wretched wreck before him, as well as to rescue his wife and children from dependence on a spendthrift, who threw away affluence with reckless disregard of their welfare. He gladly accepted the apology offered, and said:
               "I am at the Hotel Royale, where I have very elegant accommodations. If you will permit me, sir, I will make arrangements for the removal of yourself and family thither. I have already looked at a suit of apartments that I think will suit you, for I was aware from the letter of my aunt, that you are not as agreeably situated as could be wished."
               "No—that is easily seen; but I had not the means to pay for better lodgings than you find us in. I have had a devilish run of ill-luck lately, and am pretty well cleaned out. But it will hardly be worth while to remove from here for the few days we shall remain in Vienna. The doctors have ordered me to try the waters at Baden as soon as I can be moved. Until you came I did not know how to manage it, but since you represent Fortunatus' purse for me, I need give myself no further care."
               "Baden, sir; that seems to me a dangerous place for one of your tastes to venture to. I warn you that I shall advance only the money that is necessary for your actual expenses, and for such things as your wife and daughter may think necessary."
               "You need not play the part of curmudgeon, youngster; the season will be nearly over before I reach there, and after the severe lesson I received in Paris last spring, I shall not be in a hurry to burn my fingers with the painted papers again. I intend to turn over a new leaf; go back to the shades in which I was born, and take on myself the state sung of in the ballad of the fine old English gentleman."
               "I am glad that you have determined to relinquish gaming, sir; but I hope you will think better of going to Maryland. It might prove a dangerous move for you to make."
               Ashley recklessly snapped his fingers:
               "That for the danger! I shall risk it, for a season at least, till I have seen the old place again. If I find turning good too dull work, I will come back to Europe, and make the most of the life that is left to me."
               Seeing that further remonstrance would be useless, Frank said:
               "I have a desire to visit Baden myself before the season closes, and if you will allow me to do so, I will act as your agent in arranging for your departure as speedily as possible, and myself become the companion of your family on the journey."
               "Thank you," replied Ashley, more graciously than he had yet spoken. "That will be the best service you can render me in my present crippled state. But you must not leave without seeing my wife and daughter. Since you are the betrothed of Evelyn's sister, there can be no harm in letting you make the acquaintance of as pretty a sylph as can be found between here and fairy land."
               "Thank you, sir. I shall be very happy to see my aunt and cousin."
               Ashley rang a hand bell that stood upon the table, and in a few moments Jane appeared.
               A message was dispatched by her to the two ladies, bidding them make their appearance without delay, as he wished to introduce them to this young kinsman.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIX.
               DOMESTIC SCENES.
               AFTER a single glance at the handsome stranger, Evelyn retreated from the door, cautiously closing it behind her. She found Mrs. Ashley crying bitterly, and she used all her art to soothe and console her for the harsh and unfeeling language her husband had used to her.
               Evelyn succeeded so far as to induce her to dry her tears and make as careful a toilette as the state of her wardrobe permitted. The obnoxious papillottes were removed, the soft hair curled, her cheeks faintly tinged with rouge, and a more becoming dress assumed.
               By the time this was accomplished, all traces of her previous emotion had disappeared, and Augusta glanced approvingly at the person reflected in the mirror. But her complacency vanished when she accidentally caught a glimpse of the fresh young face of Evelyn.
               The taunting comparison made between them by her husband stung her anew, and she ungraciously said:
               "There, child; you need not make yourself so officious about me. I expect your papa will scold me again about putting on the best dress I have to stay at home in; but I shall tell him it was all your fault."
               "Oh! I will consent to bear the blame this time," replied Evelyn, gayly; "for he and I have been planning to make things a little better. Besides, there is a young stranger with him now who comes from Maryland. Papa first said he was his nephew, but afterwards he denied that the relationship is so near. We shall be sure to be sent for presently, and I thought you had better be dressed to see him lest papa should be vexed again."
               Mrs. Ashley seemed much excited, and she said:
               "A stranger from Maryland! Oh! Evelyn, who can it be?—and what has brought him hither? Leon's father may be dead, or the letter I ventured to write when he was so ill may have caused him to send some one to us. A young man did you say? What was his name—did you not hear it, child?"
               "I read it on the card he sent in. His name is Frank Wentworth."
               "Good Heavens! Judge Ashley's grandson.
               "But who is Judge Ashley, and what is he to us?' asked Evelyn, in surprise. "I never heard of him before, nor of Mr. Wentworth either till he called here to-day."
               "Oh, I forgot—you must have heard of the Judge, Evelyn, as the Uncle of Leon, and the agent who manages the Arden estates, and remits the income to your father."
               "I have often heard of the agent referred to, but no one spoke of him by name, which I have sometimes thought strange. But now that I know it is Judge Ashley, and this Mr. Wentworth is here on the part of his grandfather, I shall try and get him to have my allowance increased. If I am a great heiress, it seems very unjust that I am to have so little money till I am of age."
               Augusta listened in consternation. After a few moments' thought, she said:
               "My dear, your mother gave the control of your property to your father till you are twenty-one. Leon gives you what he thinks is right—or rather what he can spare from it. I must tell you the simple truth, Evelyn, for I perceive that it is no longer safe to keep it from you; but if you suffer my husband to know that I have betrayed him to you, he will never forgive me for it, nor will he forgive you for knowing what he has chosen to conceal from you."
               "Speak, mamma, I promise to keep your confidence sacred. It is something I ought to know, or you would not be so much excited about it."
               "Evelyn, do you not know that your father is a reckless and most unsuccessful gambler? Leon draws large sums annually, but they are swallowed up by the insatiate demon that possesses him."
               A flood of light poured into the mind of the young girl, and many things she had hitherto been unable to understand were explained now. She became pale and chilled as she recalled the conversation which had so lately taken place between her father and herself, in which such positive falsehoods had been stated. She faintly said:
               "I shall never betray you mamma; but you have given me a great shock by what you have just told me. I did not know that papa derived any of his resources from the estate of my mother."
               Augusta bitterly replied:
               "He might as well not do so, for any good he derives from the money. I have known the income of a whole year to melt away in a single month in the indulgence of the absorbing passion for play that devours him. Oh! Evelyn, no one can know what the wife of a gamester has to endure but one placed in that unhappy position. When I married Leon I never dreamed that I should be reduced to what I am, and what I have gone through no words can tell."
               Her confidence was interrupted by the entrance of Jane with Ashley's message, and after a few moments' delay to recover from their recent emotion, the two ladies proceeded to the apartment in which the gentlemen awaited their appearance.
               Ashley glanced with pleasure at the renovated appearance of his wife, for brutal as he had become, he still cherished some pride in the stately presence of the woman who had really enchained his fickle heart for a few brief years of his evil life.
               Wentworth bowed low before the faded beauty, whose tall person and ample skirts concealed the petite figure that entered in her wake. As he lifted his eyes, they suddenly fell upon the bright, girlish face of Evelyn, on which was an expression of earnest interest and expectation which attracted him at once.
               Their eyes met, and that glance sent an electric thrill through the heart of each, which would have set them on their guard had they understood its meaning. But neither dreamed of danger; and they bowed and smiled as Mr. Ashley said:
               "This is my daughter, Mr. Wentworth. Evelyn, there is no longer need of concealment as to the relationship existing between you. This young gentleman is your cousin, and the betrothed husband of your sister."
               Evelyn had been told in a vague manner that she had a sister living on the other side of the world, under the protection of her father's uncle; but she had never been able to obtain any satisfactory information concerning her, and she had almost ceased to think of a relative she never expected to meet. The announcement that the young stranger was the betrothed of that sister, deepened her interest in him, and she frankly extended her hand, as she said:
               "I am very happy to meet you, Mr. Wentworth; and I hope you will tell me all about the sister whose name I appropriated. I have heard my father say that when he heard the name of his eldest daughter had been changed to Bessie, he gave the rejected one to me."
               "A charming one it is," replied Frank, gallantly, "and entirely appropriate to its bearer."
               "Does my sister permit you to flatter other ladies?" she archly inquired; but before he could reply, Ashley almost brusquely said:
               "If Bessie does, I do not allow your head to be turned by such nonsense. Evelyn is very young, Frank; she has seen nothing of society, and I do not wish her initiated in its false and heartless ways. If we receive you among us as one of ourselves, it must be understood that it is in the character of the betrothed of my eldest daughter, and you are to treat Evelyn in every respect as a sister. Above all, understand that I do not wish flattering speeches bandied between you."
               Evelyn blushed vividly at this reproof, but Frank, with a bow of mock humility to the speaker, replied:
               "To hear is to obey, sir. If a man wishes to be admitted into Paradise, he ought certainly to walk in the straight and narrow path which is laid down as the only road to it. I shall be careful not to transgress the limits marked out for me, and I am sure that my fair cousin will do nothing to tempt me to break your commands."
               Augusta, who, as a ci-devant belle, was intensely jealous of being overlooked in favor of her step-daughter, here impatiently broke in:
               "Pray resume your seat, Mr. Wentworth, and let us hear to what we are indebted for the pleasure of seeing you here."
               They all sat down; but as Frank was about to speak Ashley interrupted him, and said to his wife:
               "You and Evy must prepare mourning, for Judge Ashley is dead. I cannot say as we are materially benefited by his decease, for he has left me very little more than the annuity on which we have so long vegetated, but that much outward respect must be paid to his memory. I have made up my mind to return to the United States as soon as my health is sufficiently restored to enable me to do so, and all you and Evy have to do at present is to get ready to go with me to Baden in a few more days."
               After making this brief summary he sank back, and cast his bloodshot eyes from one to another of the group, as if to observe the effect they produced.
               Evelyn clasped her hands in joyful surprise, but Augusta stared at her husband in mute affright, which he seemed greatly to enjoy. He slowly rubbed his hands together, and asked:
               "What do you think of that, Mrs. Ashley?"
               Recovering the power of speech, she faltered:
               "I—I should be glad to think it possible for us to go back home, but I am afraid it is not."
               "Nothing is impossible to the brave and daring heart, Mrs. Ashley, as I shall have the honor to prove to you very shortly. It is my intention to return to Maryland, take possession of Arden Place, and lead a regular and respectable life as long as I can."
               The mocking spirit which would break forth under every circumstance dictated the conclusion of his reply, and his poor wife was about to say:
               "I am afraid that would not be very long," when Evelyn saved her from such a faux pas by exclaiming:
               "Oh, how charming! I shall see my own mother's home, shall make the acquaintance of my sister. Oh, mamma, we shall be very, very happy in the change, I am sure we shall."
               Frank looked at the sparkling face of the enthusiastic girl, so brilliant with animation, so radiant with that dark beauty which possessed a deep charm for him, and he listened to the fresh young voice with a sensation of pleasure entirely new to him.
               Dearly as he loved Bessie, she had never moved him as this young stranger did, in the first hour of their meeting, and he had a confused sense that the intimate association in which they were likely to be thrown would be a most dangerous ordeal, at least for him. But it was one from which he could not now escape, nor, in truth, did he very much wish it.
               Already was there a delicious pleasure in watching the variations of that mobile face, in catching the full flash of those glorious dark eyes, which were so suddenly and shyly withdrawn if they met his own.
               Mr. Ashley spoke in reply to his daughter.
               "The information brought by your cousin changes all my plans. I hope you will be happy in your new home, my dear, for it is my fixed purpose to remove you to it as soon as possible. I am sorry to see that your mamma does not approve of our flitting. She looks as if struck dumb by the mere announcement that she is to give up the delights of a European life for the humdrum existence of an American planter's wife."
               The bitter sarcasm of his last words aroused some of Augusta's former spirit, and she quickly replied:
               "Any change will be welcome to me, Leon, after the bitter humiliations and privations I have borne as your wife. All I ask of you is, that when you have wearied of your new experience, you will leave me behind you in the seclusion where I shall at least command comfort and respect."
               He glared wrathfully upon her as he replied:
               "Your wish shall be gratified, Mrs. Ashley. When you are once transplanted to Arden Place, you may consider yourself safe from any effort on my part to remove you."
               "Thank you for the assurance," she calmly replied, and then turning to Frank, Mrs. Ashley entered into conversation with him with that tact and grace which had once rendered her so popular in society.
               In his heart the young man thanked her for this diversion in his favor, for he had begun to feel himself de trop in this matrimonial scene.
               Before Frank left for his hotel, their arrangements were finally settled. He was to telegraph to Baden and engage apartments for them, and in the few intervening days, to assist Mrs. Ashley in making arrangements for their speedy removal.
               On the following morning he promised to accompany Augusta and her young companion on a shopping expedition, and at an early hour he came to the door in a carriage he had engaged to carry them wherever they wished to go.
               Evelyn appeared in her grey dress and simple straw hat, and he thought her even more enchanting than on the previous day.
               Wentworth availed himself of the opportunity to explain to his aunt that he was sent especially to aid herself and her children, and offered her such a sum as would suffice for present use.
               Augusta thankfully accepted the money, and with a lighter heart than she had known for a long time, she proceeded to make such purchases as were needed to make a handsome appearance at the watering place to which they were bound.
               Knowing how slight a tie existed between Evelyn and the deceased Judge, she determined to put her only in half mourning, as she economically thought that the grey robes the young girl was so fond of wearing could be trimmed with black, and a few elegant jet ornaments would be the most expensive things she would require.
               For herself, Augusta indulged her long repressed extravagance, and the mourning she ordered was of the most expensive and dressy kind that could be made to come under that category. Her son was not forgotten, and everything that Maitland could need was at once purchased.
               In the afternoon of the same day, it was arranged that Wentworth should visit with them the school in which the lad was placed, and at the hour named he promptly drove to the door.
               After a pleasant drive of a few miles, they gained the place, and, after a slight delay, were admitted to the presence of the principal—a fat, good-natured looking German. Frank explained to him that he had come prepared to pay the bills of his young kinsman, and remove him from the institution.
               They were but trifling, for Maitland had been in the school but a short time, and an arrangement had been made with the principal to pay only for the time he remained. This satisfactorily arranged, the lad was sent for and soon made his appearance.
               Maitland was a bright, gay looking boy of fourteen summers, with whose intelligent face and frank boyishness of manner Frank was, at first, much pleased. When told that he was about to be removed from school, to be taken to Baden, and thence to the United States, his glee was so excessive as to annoy his mother, and she vainly tried to moderate his wild expressions of delight.
               Frank had hoped to enjoy some pleasant conversation with Evelyn on their homeward drive, but Maitland's noisy and boisterous behavior effectually prevented anything of the kind. His sister usually exercised more influence over him than any one else, but now she was powerless to subdue the exuberance of his joy at being released from school, and on his way to the freedom and enjoyment of so gay a place as Baden.
               Frank laughingly said to him:
               "Your teachers must have had a nice time with you, youngster, if I may judge from the little respect you pay to your mother and sister."
               "Oh!" replied the boy, with a shrewd twinkle in his eye, "I was afraid of them, but they did catch it sometimes, I tell you. I was up twice a week, at least, for the sly tricks I managed to play on the solemn old owls."
               "Up! what do you mean by that?" asked his mother, with a fond smile.
               "Brought up for trial, of course, ma'am; but I generally managed to escape the penalty. I was never punished but once; then I had half a dozen pages of Virgil given me to construe, and old squaretoes thought he had me safe for half a day at least. But the task was nothing. I went through it like a flash, and I think the don was rather taken aback when I went up to him in half an hour, and recited the whole of it without a blunder."
               Angusta admiringly regarded the speaker, and during the remainder of the drive Frank refrained from again interfering with so extraordinary a phenomenon of intelligence.
               Although he was seated opposite to Evelyn, who was looking most charming in her little grey hood, with pink trimmings, Frank was glad when the drive came to an end, and Maitland bounded out of the carriage, and exultingly ran up the steps in search of the father who had assiduously spoiled him from his infancy, and neutralized the good influences his mother and sister might have brought to bear upon him.
               When the lad was fairly out of sight, Wentworth proposed to the two ladies that they should accompany him to the Prater, to see some fine fireworks which were to be exhibited there.
               They gladly assented, and the carriage was turned in the direction of the magnificent public drive for which Vienna is so famous. It is a wood of beeches and oaks, situated on an island in the Danube, which is gained by a handsome bridge. The way was crowded with the elegant equipages for which the wealthy Viennese are celebrated; and it was a never-ending source of pleasure to the young stranger to watch the open carriages filled with lovely women, in summer dress, and drawn by horses of such beauty and speed as he had seldom seen before.
               At the entrance to the garden a large number of tents were erected, beneath which refreshments of every kind were offered, and from one of these Frank ordered a delicious little supper, which was eaten under the shade of the trees in company with hundreds of others similarly employed.
               On a given signal the crowd flowed toward an open space on which an amphitheatre had been erected, which was already crowded with ladies in light summer costume, wearing rouge and glittering with jewels. The fondness of the people for display was seen in everything around, but their gay appearance added to the festivity of the scene, and the strangers were not disposed to find fault with what afforded them so much pleasure.
               
               The fireworks were magnificent, but the enjoyment of Frank was a little marred by the glances of admiration he saw more than one gallant dart toward his young companion, and he began to feel an uncomfortable suspicion that Evelyn was becoming far more fascinating to him than the absent Bessie.
               A very fine band played with a precision and clearness that astonished our party, for there was not a single discord in the music, though more than a hundred instruments were played on in concert. Innocent and confiding, Evelyn enjoyed the brilliant scene, and talked with her cousin in a free and joyous manner, quite unconscious of the emotions and doubts every glance of her bright dark eyes aroused in his breast.
               The festivities were at length over, and then the most extraordinary experience of the evening commenced. The carriages, consisting of gentlemen's coaches, many of which had as many as six high-mettled horses attached to them, were mingled with hired vehicles, and moved in close array in a rapid procession toward the city. A single deviation from the track, or a vicious movement on the part of a horse, must have produced great confusion, if not loss of life; but on this occasion they made their return in safety, though Mrs. Ashley declared that the alarm she felt almost neutralized the pleasure with which she had looked on the gay spectacle of the evening.
               Augusta had many doubts as to how she would be received by her husband, so she insisted that Wentworth should go up stairs with them when they reached the door of her lodgings, in the faint hope that his presence would prove a restraint upon the expression of Ashley's rage.
               They found him in a fury, with his son doing penance by sitting sulkily in a corner gnawing his finger nails. Frank regretted that he had been induced to come in at that hour, for, regardless of his presence, his irate uncle greeted his wife and daughter with such a tirade of abuse for turning Maitland loose on him in the first exuberance of his delight at his new freedom, that Frank felt like seizing him by the throat and strangling his venomous words together with the life that was used as a bitterness to others.
               Mr. Ashley ended by saying:
               "He has turned the place topsy-turvy already, and after innumerable complaints from the servants, I have been obliged to make him sit down where I could see him myself."
               Maitland here spoke in his own defence:
               "I wasn't doing a thing but dancing a hornpipe in the kitchen, and trying to make old Jenny keep time with me by banging the shovel and tongs together. If the noise came in here how was I to blame for it, I should like to know. As to the complaints of the women, they did not mean anything, for they laughed till their sides ached."
               "Hold your tongue, sir, and get at once to your bed," shouted his father. "You shall have no supper, and maybe fasting will bring down your impudence a little."
               The incorrigible lad made a grimace and skipped off his chair, as he said:
               "Anything is better than being mewed up in the same room with a cross old codger like you. You are not a bit like you used to be, and I don't like you at all when you treat me as if I was nobody."
               Maitland effected his escape from the room just in time, for his irate father seized the bell which was placed near him and hurled it after his free-spoken son with such accurate aim that it crashed against the closing door.
               Augusta turned toward their young guest with a pathetic glance which eloquently said:
               "See what scenes we are compelled to witness—what violence to endure from this man who has ceased to care for anything save the indulgence of his own splenetic humor."
               Evelyn followed her brother as quickly as possible, and after an apology from Frank, in which he took on himself the entire blame of the evasion of his wife and daughter, Ashley smoothed his frowning brow, and condescended to say:
               "It is over now, and I will try and forget what I have suffered. The ladies owed you some return for all your kindness, and I must excuse the thoughtlessness of which they have been guilty. I am very fond of Maitland, but his exuberant spirits are too much for the shattered state of my nerves. To-morrow he and I will make up our little quarrel and be as good friends as ever."
               To this Frank replied:
               "Your son seems to be a clever and lively lad, but he requires restraint. I hope his spirits will tone down before we set out for Baden. By the way, sir, when do you think you will be able to leave this place?"
               "The doctor who attends me thinks it will not be advisable for me to remove before next week. Besides, the women must have their dresses made, and get their little fineries ready to display at the Spa."
               "Then I will arrange for our departure next Wednesday; does that suit you, sir?"
               "Precisely; that will give time for everything. I only wish that you had left the young cub in his den till the very day before we set out. He will torment my life out of me before we get away."
               "If you are willing, I will charge myself with the lad, and he can stay at my hotel with me. I will take him around with me sight-seeing, and thus keep him interested, and out of mischief."
               "If you can do the last, you will accomplish more than has ever been done before. You have no idea what you are undertaking, but you have my consent to deliver me from the infliction of his presence in these confined lodgings."
               Mrs. Ashley warmly thanked Frank, and went herself to communicate to her son his father's consent to his removal with his cousin. The lad soon came in, radiant with delight, and grasped the hand of his kinsman as he said:
               "You are a trump, cousin, and I mean to like you with all my heart. Come—I am ready; let us go at once."
               "But are you not going to thank your father for the permission he has granted you to go with me, Maitland?"
               The boy glanced askance at his father, and said:
               "It's no use—he'll only fly off at a tangent again. But if you wish it, I'll try."
               "I do wish it—so speak to him at once, youngster."
               Maitland made a grotesque face, and then poising himself ready to run, he said:
               "I say gov'nor, Frank wants me to say something to you, so I suppose I must. If I say anything I'll tell you the truth, and that is, that I'm precious glad to get out of this old poky house, and away from such a stupid muff as you've got to be. I'm much obliged to you for telling me to go with Frank, who seems to know what's what."
               At the close of this strange apology, Maitland effected a rapid retreat from the room, fearful, perhaps, that another missile might be hurled after him; but his father only laughed, and said:
               "I have spoiled the scamp, so I must not be too hard on him, I suppose. I hope you won't let him run quite wild, Frank; and I must say that you are very kind to relieve me of his presence while we stay in these small rooms."
               "Have no fears for either of us, my dear sir; I shall get along with Maitland very well, and I promise to keep him in bounds. Good night, sir; I must follow him now to guard against any new outbreak of his mercurial spirits."
               Frank was not a moment too soon, for the enterprising youth was in the act of mounting one of the horses attached to the carriage in spite of the remonstrances of the driver.
               With some difficulty Wentworth convinced him that a seat within the vehicle was all that he had bargained for, and a compromise was effected by permitting him to take a seat on the box beside the driver, though the latter reluctantly consented to such an arrangement.
               While on their way to the hotel, the horses made many eccentric movements, which Frank had no difficulty in tracing to the interference of Maitland in driving them; and when they reached their destination, the coachman sulkily said in English:
               "I never see sich a young un afore, an' I hopes I shall never see sich another agin. He's kep' my hosses ready to run off every blessed step we've come. He would strike at 'em with the whip every little while, an' if I hadn't held 'em well in hand, I don't know where we'd a bin by this time."
               Wentworth mollified his wrath by adding a trifle to his pay, and took the offender up with him to his own apartments.
               Before supper was announced, Maitland had explored every nook; he ransacked his portfolio without asking his leave, and finding there a photograph of Bessie, he danced, shouted, and declared he would tell his belle sœur that she must not lose her heart to her cousin, for he carried the picture of another girl about with him.
               When Frank explained who the original was, for the first time, the lad sat down quietly, and with dilating eyes, listened to what his cousin had to tell him of the sister of whose very existence he did not remember to have heard before.
               Wentworth finished by saying:
               "If your father carries out his intention of returning to Maryland, you will see Bessie before long, and I think you will be sure to love her very much."
               "No, I sha'n't, either," was the unexpected reply. "Evy's my sister, and I don't want any other. She's enough for me, and I don't mean to love anybody else as well as I do her. Ah, it's my belief that Evy's the best and sweetest little girl in the world, and when you have known her long enough to care for her, you'll think this one isn't to be compared with her. Pooh! I know she can't be, in spite of her pretty face."
               As he closed his speech, Maitland disdainfully tossed back the picture and closed the portfolio. Frank was amused at his earnestness, and willing to bear with his wildness in consideration of the strong affection he seemed to bear his sister.
               Already had his own heart confirmed the boy's words, for he found Evelyn far more attractive to him than Bessie had ever been. He recalled the reluctance of the latter to bind herself irrevocably to him; the almost fatal effect upon her of the attempt to solemnize their espousals, and he felt that Bessie would never willingly become his wife. He thanked her that he was free to think of another; to speculate on the chances that he and his betrothed might separate by mutual consent, sharing the estate between them.
               If that proved impossible, and Evelyn could be won to love him, he could well afford to resign his inheritance for her sake, since her hand would endow him with even greater wealth than he had relinquished for her.
               In these delusive dreams he buried himself, heedless of Maitland's pranks, till the summons to supper came.
               
               When the meal was over, his mercurial companion, wearied by the exploits of the day, was ready to seek the only quiet place he ever found—bed, and sound sleep.
               In the morning Maitland arose with the light, ready for any mischief that suggested itself to his active imagination. Long before Frank awoke, he was abroad in the house, changing the shoes placed in front of the bedroom doors, ringing bells wherever he could find a handle, till the whole house was in commotion, with servants running to and fro, and travellers swearing at being aroused out of their morning sleep.
               At length the enfant terrible was detected as the author of the disturbance, and forcibly conveyed to the room of his present guardian. Wentworth was aroused by the sudden irruption of half a dozen waiters, each one of whom preferred a complaint against the delinquent, who grinned, shook his fists, and defied them all in very bad German.
               With some difficulty Frank dismissed them, and retained his young kinsman in his own custody. At first, Maitland was unmanageable, but the threat to return him to the dingy lodgings of his father to remain there under his discipline, finally subdued him, and the youngster sat pouting, but for the time being quiet.
               Frank hurried his toilette, and commenced the duties of the day with some misgiving, for he began to comprehend what he had undertaken in assuming the charge of this young Orson. For two days he endured the martyrdom of carrying Maitland around with him, but on the third one he gave in, and engaged a gigantic Swiss courier, who was at the time out of employment, to take charge of the lad, giving him stringent orders never to lose sight of him for a single moment.
               During the remainder of his stay in Vienna, Wentworth scarcely saw the young scamp, who seemed to take a great fancy to his new attendant, and submitted to be kept in much better order by him than he could have been by his cousin.
               Evelyn and her mother came every day to the hotel to look after Maitland, and a few hours of pleasant converse were snatched in these brief intervals, when they were free from the presence of the irritable father and husband.
               By this time the acquaintance of Frank and Evelyn had progressed almost to intimacy; her first shyness had worn off, and she spoke with him with the frankness of a sister. She never dreamed that her heart could be in danger from the fascinations of her sister's betrothed lover, though she acknowledged a vague charm in the very presence of her new friend, and the bizarre humor he often displayed harmonized with something within herself.
               From the first day of their acquaintance, Evelyn felt that she and her cousin were congenial spirits, and to this conviction was added the delight of having a companion near her own age, who could understand and sympathize with her.
               They did not suspect how rapidly they were progressing toward a first and ardent love, though each one treasured every word and every expression of the other in the hours of solitary reverie that followed their partings.
               On Sunday they attended service in the cathedral, and listened to the fine music with hearts more deeply attuned to tenderness than ever in their lives before. Wentworth dined by invitation with his uncle, leaving Maitland to the care of his new Mentor.
               When dinner was over, both Ashley and his wife took a siesta, and the young pair enjoyed a most delicious tête-à-tête, into which not a thought of Bessie or of Frank's previous engagement intruded.
               Evelyn believed herself perfectly safe in admiring and appreciating the man who, she had been told, was hereafter to stand to her in the relation of a brother; but that her heart was in danger of too warmly attaching itself to him she had no fears.
               In her very security lay the extent of her danger, and innocent as Eve before the fall, she became entangled in the snare prepared by the tempter for her own especial case.
               Frank's kindness to her brother won her gratitude, his quiet humor made her laugh, and his society was what she had needed in her dreary home to brighten her spirits, and make life not only endurable, but delightful.
               His advent was like a new revelation of life to her, and she unconsciously put forth her most fascinating qualities to charm him to her side in every vacant hour he could save from other occupations.
               That she succeeded in accomplishing much more than this was evident, and on the day of their departure for Baden, poor Frank confessed to himself that he was hopelessly in love with one sister, while bound by every tie of interest to marry the other.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXX.
               LOVE'S YOUNG DREAM.
               HANDSOME apartments had been secured for the party before their arrival at the Spa, and with intense satisfaction Ashley and his wife took possession of a suit of rooms more luxuriously furnished than any they had occupied for years.
               Wentworth was located in an opposite wing of the hotel, and anxious to spare Mrs. Ashley and her stepdaughter the many outbreaks of temper Maitland's presence near his father would be sure to provoke, he good-naturedly took the boy into his own lodgings; he, however, still retained the services of the tall Swiss, who had managed to establish some sort of control over the young hopeful.
               For the first week of their stay the family remained in seclusion, as Mr. Ashley insisted that it would be indecorous to appear in public so soon after assuming mourning for his deceased father. But Wentworth soon detected the real motive of his uncle: changed as Augusta was, and little as Ashley seemed now to care for her, he was still jealously afraid of her attracting too much attention from others while he was still too much indisposed to accompany her to the public rooms himself.
               In addition to this, he betrayed extreme unwillingness for Evelyn to go into society at all, and in this he was passively seconded by his wife. To Frank's intense surprise and indignation, he found that his lovely cousin was to be detained in her father's room even when Mrs. Ashley was permitted to leave him for a short time under the escort of his young kinsman.
               On the first evening he went out with his aunt, Frank freely expressed his disappointment that Evelyn was not of the party; but she quietly replied:
               "Evelyn is too young to be exposed to the promiscuous society of a watering-place. Besides, as she is known to be a great heiress, she might fall into some entanglement which would give us much trouble, and herself a great deal of unhappiness. In the propriety of keeping her secluded, I quite agree with Leon."
               "You may be right," replied Frank, gloomily, "but I hope the prohibition will not be made to extend to me. I may see my cousin as usual, and she can at least be allowed to walk with me."
               "You are privileged, you know," replied Mrs. Ashley with one of her insipid smiles. "You are to become her brother at some future day, and there can be no impropriety in her walking with you, whenever the weather will permit. Just now, she is occupied the most of her time in reading to her father, or playing chess with him. But he is getting better very fast, for the waters are acting on his system like magic, and he will soon be able to walk out by himself."
               "I hope that time will soon come," said Frank, with some irritation. I think it is a shame to mew a young girl up in a sick-room all the time, especially when the invalid is so hard to get along with as my uncle."
               Mrs. Ashley sighed, but made no reply to this. After a pause, she said:
               "On some accounts I am glad that Leon is not yet able to mix with the gay company here. You can imagine why I shall be anxious about him when he becomes strong enough to do as he pleases."
               "I understand—but I shall keep a strict watch over him. My uncle knows that the money I can at present control will not suffice for our joint expenses, if any portion of it is appropriated wrongfully. I believe, after all, that it will be best for him to return to Maryland, and in the seclusion of a country home avoid the temptations that must always assail him among his old associates."
               With a heavy sigh his companion replied:
               "Do not imagine that your uncle will ever live in seclusion, Frank. I only hope that the house is large enough to afford me a suit of apartments removed from the noise and revelry that Leon is sure to bring into every place he inhabits. I speak frankly to you, because you are our only friend, and, by this time, you must understand the character of my husband."
               "Perhaps things will turn out better than you think," said Wentworth, with an implied trust in his uncle's reformation which he was far from feeling. "As to the house, it is an immense structure, built by the first Arden who came over to this country with Lord Baltimore. You will find plenty of room in the old place for many more than you will have to accommodate. Evelyn has a noble inheritance, and I think she is one who will endeavor to perform the duties of a just steward conscientiously and well."
               He turned to his aunt as he spoke, and he was struck by the change that came over her face when he uttered the last words. There was something inexplicable to him in the expression with which she vaguely replied:
               "Yes—Evelyn is a good girl; but such a fortune should never have fallen to a daughter, when our son will have so little. Just think of it! when Evelyn attains her majority, her father will be almost a dependent upon her. It is shameful!"
               Frank quietly replied:
               "If my cousin's property is well managed, there will be enough, and to spare from it. You need have no apprehensions on my uncle's account, for I have pledged my word to him that Bessie and myself will allow him a third of our joint income as long as he lives."
               "That is very liberal of you both; but it would have been better if you had kept back something to accumulate for Maitland. Poor fellow! surrounded by rich relations, my boy will be a pauper among them, for my fortune passed into his father's hands, and has been spent long ago."
               "Maitland will have the ten thousand dollars bequeathed to him by his grandfather, to begin the world with; he is a lad of fine abilities and I hope he will sustain the prestige of his family for talent, and develop into a good man. Never fear for the boy, Aunt Augusta; I will answer for his future, and with his exuberant vitality, it will be all the better for him to have his own future to carve out. With wealth at his command, he might go to ruin in a few years."
               "I will endeavor to think as you do, she replied; "but here we are at my door; will you go in and see how your uncle has spent the evening. He will be sure to ask innumerable questions as to whom I have seen in the public rooms, and you can help me to answer them."
               Wentworth did not require a second invitation, for he had scarcely obtained a glimpse of Evelyn for the last three days. He entered the beautifully furnished drawing-room, in which Mr. Ashley sat playing chess with his daughter.
               The hue of health had partially returned to his sallow features, and the bloated appearance which had so greatly disfigured him was rapidly disappearing under the influence of the mineral water, and continued abstinence from the fiery potations which had wrecked his health.
               A small quantity of wine daily was all he was allowed, and, for the present, he submitted to so strict a regimen, though he promised himself unusual latitude when once he was sufficiently restored to venture to drink without suffering from the immediate effect of his potations.
               Like many other men, what the future was to bring to him was silently ignored, while he went on accumulating poison in his system, which, at one fell blow might strike him lifeless to the earth.
               To reform one of his evil ways had never entered the mind of Leon Ashley; for if any man was ever thoroughly given over to a reprobate and hardened heart, he was that man. He argued that to him nature had made excitement and pleasure a necessity, and while health lasted, he would have as much of both as was to be attained, even through the most questionable means. When the power to enjoy was exhausted, life would no longer be worth possessing, and he was ready to "die as the fool dieth," hoping that the criminal record of his wasted life would be buried in the dust into which his body would resolve, and no awful voice ever call upon that sinful soul to arise and answer for the deeds done in the flesh.
               Evelyn, looking pale and dispirited, sat opposite to her father, and as Frank glanced toward her he felt an emotion of resentment at the thraldom in which she was held. Since their arrival at Baden she had scarcely been permitted to go beyond the narrow boundary of their apartments, and both health and spirits had evidently suffered from the confinement.
               Ashley's face was slightly flushed, and he eagerly turned to his nephew and said:
               "You have just come in time to decide a dispute between Evelyn and myself, Frank. She insists that I have made a false check, and I maintain that I have done no such thing. Look at the board and see what you think about it."
               Frank understood the game, and he glanced over the position of the pieces, saw that Evelyn was right, and was about to speak to that effect, when, divining his intention, she made a sudden movement, caught her open sleeve on the edge of the board, and swept the whole array down. She arose, laughing, and said:
               "There—that decides the game in papa's favor. He never likes me to beat him, though I am sometimes sorely tried at having to bear defeat so often."
               "Do you mean to insinuate that you could beat me if you wished it?" asked Ashley, with a frown. "You knew that Frank would decide in my favor, and you took that method of saving your own credit."
               Frank unclosed his lips to utter the truth, but Evelyn, who had glided behind her father, made a rapid movement to him, entreating him to refrain, so he said nothing.
               Augusta immediately begun to describe to her husband the gay scene in which she had mingled during the hours of her absence, and in the interest of the narration, he soon forgot all about the disputed game.
               He presently asked:
               "Did you encounter any one we have known before, Augusta? Do you know if any of my old set are to be found here?"
               "I think not. I saw no one with whom we have ever been acquainted. The gay men you associated with in Paris will scarcely be found at this place so late in the season. The most of the people now here have come for the benefit of the waters."
               "Hum! so much the better," he muttered. "It might be inconvenient to meet some of them just now. The small fund I have received for my especial use, must not become the prey of remorseless duns. It may be made the nucleus of a fortune to me yet."
               Thus, with the undying faith of the gamester in a change of luck in his favor, Ashley was yet looking forward to the restoration of his fortunes through the diablerie of play.
               While Ashley thus talked with his wife, a pleasant by-play was going on between the young people. Frank asked:
               "Evelyn, why did you destroy your game when it was evidently in your own hands?"
               "Did I not tell you why, when I said that my father cannot bear to be beaten? If I but win a single game he gets into such a passion as frightens me. To-night I was tired and reckless, so I tried to beat him; but when you were called on as umpire between us, I knew what your decision must be, and my last move was made to save you from causing a scene. It is dreadful to speak of one's father in this way, Frank, but you have been in our interior, and you know what a turbulent one it often is."
               He saw that tears of weariness were trembling in her eyes, and he gently said:
               "You know that you may trust me as a brother, Evelyn; but I find it difficult to contain myself when I see you treated as you are. You are growing pale from confinement to the house, though my uncle and aunt seem conveniently blind to it. It is not very late; do you think your father can be persuaded to let you promenade with me through the illuminated grounds? Your mother has already promised me that you shall walk out with me every day. It is a heavenly night, and nearly as light as day. Shall I ask him if you may go?"
               "Yes—pray do. I am dying for a breath of fresh air, and the sight of something more agreeable than the walls of this room. Mamma is amusing him now, perhaps he will let me go with you."
               Wentworth watched for a break in the conversation of the elder pair, and then preferred his request. At first Mr. Ashley objected; he said:
               "It is getting late, and it is all nonsense for Evelyn to wish to go out at this hour. Besides, it is hardly prudent."
               "Oh, papa, I shall be with my brother Frank," she gayly replied; "and you know I shall be quite safe under his protection. I so much wish to see the grounds illuminated, and I have never been permitted to go out a single night since I have been here, although I have spent my days in trying to amuse you."
               
               She threw her arm over his shoulder in a caressing manner, and Ashley half smiled as he said:
               "You are a good little creature, Evelyn, and I won't be hard on you. You shall go with Frank for an hour, but be sure to be back by twelve o'clock."
               "Thank you, papa, I promise to be prompt to the time," and she bounded into her own apartment to get something to throw over her head. When she returned with a large black lace shawl wrapper over her, Wentworth said:
               "What is the use of wearing that, Evelyn? The young ladies here walk out in their evening toilettes, and the air is so soft and warm to-night that there is no danger of your taking cold."
               She glanced timidly toward her father, who decisively said:
               "I never permit Evelyn go out with her face uncovered, especially at a place of this sort. She is pretty, and will be rich, and I do not wish to be annoyed by fortune-hunters seeking her acquaintance while she is, as yet, almost a child."
               Though the reasons given seemed absurd to Frank, he acquiesced, and drawing Evelyn's arm beneath his own, prepared to go out. As they were leaving the room, Ashley warningly said:
               "Remember, Evelyn, that you are to keep your mantilla drawn closely around your face. It is my will that while here you shall attract no one."
               "Certainly, papa; I shall obey you in every particular."
               Evelyn was sincere in her promise, but when she was fairly in the grounds, the flitting figures in gala dresses, the strains of gay music floating from the ball-room, and the lively chatter of voices speaking in many different tongues, formed a scene so novel and attractive to her that she forgot her father's caution, and suffered her veil to fall aside, revealing her dark bright face with its vivid charm of expression, and more than one cavalier turned to look after the fairy-like beauty and her tall, light-haired escort.
               Suddenly Evelyn became conscious that she was attracting a great deal of notice. She blushed, gathered up the folds of lace, and laughingly said:
               "I have been so heedless as to forget all about papa's injunction, but I do not suppose any evil consequences will follow my face being seen. I am sure that I do not think it so attractive as to burden him with suitors for my dainty hand; eh, Frank?"
               "If you ask my opinion, I should say that your father cannot be too cautious in guarding the precious treasure entrusted to his care. You are strangely beautiful, Evelyn, and I am sure your glass must have told you the same story."
               She laughed merrily—not a boisterous laugh; but a little ripple of mirth, as sweet and bewitching as her smile, gurgled over her red lips.
               "I am such a little scrap, Frank, that what there is of me should be as well fashioned as possible. I do not think much of my own looks, because I admire tall, fair, queen-like women, and when I contrast myself with such, I feel too insignificant to fancy that other people can admire me."
               "Does your taste in blonde beauty also extend to tall, fair men, ma petite cousine?" asked Wentworth, archly.
               "I have never thought about it; but I like one tall man quite well enough, and that one is my brother Frank."
               "Brother! pshaw. Evelyn, it is time to put an end to that delusion. If I tell you a secret, do you think you can keep it faithfully? that you will hold it in the profoundest depths of your heart?"
               
               His voice vibrated with emotion, and she turned her startled eyes upon him; her heart gave a great bound as she asked:
               "Why do you talk so strangely, Frank? If you are to be Bessie's husband of course you will be my brother."
               "Would you be contented with that arrangement, Evelyn? I frankly tell you that I should not."
               By this time she was in a tremor of distress, and faintly said:
               "Oh! cousin, do not say that you are ready to do what is wrong. You are pledged to my sister, and you shall not break her heart by deserting her for—for—"
               Her voice sunk away in an indistinct murmur, and she dared not utter the pronoun that suggested itself. Frank hastened to say:
               "Bessie's heart has no more to do with the contract that binds us together than mine has. I have a very great fraternal regard for her, but I now know that I have never loved her with that love which would leave me to sacrifice everything for her sake. It was a whim of grandfather's to marry the heirs to his estate together that his property might remain undivided. I consented to the arrangement, for I did not then know that there is a love different and far more enchanting than that I felt for my betrothed. But Bessie understood herself much better than I did, and her resistance alone prevented our union before I left Maryland. Luckily for us both, she evaded the wishes of Mrs. Ashley, and left us free to make another choice. Mine is already made; can you guess on whom it has fallen?"
               Evelyn listened with vivid interest, and she gravely replied:
               I will not affect to misunderstand you, Frank; but you are getting into a terrible difficulty in choosing me. I have good reason to believe that papa wishes me never to marry, and he will certainly refuse to accept the betrothed of my sister as my future husband. You make me very unhappy by talking in this manner, and I scarcely know what is right for me to say to you."
               "Oh, well, I think I can enlighten you as to that," said Frank, with a mischievous smile, with which some solicitude was blended. "Say to me, I love you dearly, Mr. Wentworth, and come what will, I mean to pass my future life with you. There, that is a charming speech, and I hope it has at least the germ of truth in it, Evelyn."
               Making an effort to cover her agitation, she lightly said:
               "Upon my word, you are a confident wooer. I shall say no such thing, nor do I think that I should stay here to listen to such improper language. It is a wrong to poor Bessie."
               "If you won't say it, you feel it," persisted Frank; "and as to Bessie, she will thank me with her whole heart for having given her a rival. Why should you fancy that your father intends to keep you single? Pooh! he will never be allowed to do such a thing as that."
               "I am convinced of it from many little things that have fallen from him; besides, he wished me to remain in the convent in which I completed my education, and consent to take the veil. He says that women are seldom happy when married, and I am afraid he speaks the truth, for he and mamma do not get along as smoothly as could be desired."
               The childish simplicity with which she spoke amused and interested him, but he replied, with some bitterness:
               "My dear Evelyn, I hope you do not consider your parents as a fair specimen of what the conjugal relation often is. If you do, I am not surprised that you listen favorably to him when he descants on the miseries of matrimony. It is to his interest to induce you to give up all thoughts of marriage, for your home will be his, and your income his chief dependence to supply his prodigal wastefulness. Then, he has a son, to whose interests his parents seem quite alive."
               "Oh, Frank, how hard you are!"
               "I but speak the truth, my love; so listen to me without being wounded by my candor. I do not intend that you shall be sacrificed to any such selfishness as that, and I mean to win you to be my own special darling, and the brightener of my life. You need never fear that I shall give way to such transports of passion as so often move your father to violence, for I have been reared to respect myself and those around me. Why, Evelyn, if I thought your life was to be wasted in ministering to so selfish a being as my uncle, I should be the most unhappy of men. The woman I love well enough to make my wife will be cherished and tenderly guarded from evil as a hot-house flower—that is, if she wears your smile, speaks with your bewitching tones."
               Evelyn seemed still to shrink from his avowal of affection, and she replied as if but one thing had struck her in this speech. She eagerly asked:
               "Why do you call papa uncle? Is he really your uncle? and, if so, what is the mystery that made him deny the relation the first day you came to see him?"
               "I have heedlessly betrayed to you what your father is not yet quite ready to reveal; but it is of little consequence now, as you must soon have learned all. He is the brother of my mother, and the son of the grandfather of whom you have so often heard me speak. Painful circumstances, all of which I cannot explain, caused Mr. Ashley to drop his last name, and he has been known in Europe as Leon Larne. But you must be on your guard, Evelyn, not to betray to your father that I have revealed his secret to you."
               She seemed painfully affected by this revelation.
               "And those circumstances, Frank? Was disgrace attached to them? It seems to me that nothing less than that should induce a man to relinquish his own name."
               "It was a duel—a sad affair. It took place without witnesses; and, as his antagonist was killed, my uncle was liable to a prosecution for murder. The sensitive pride of his father induced him to prefer that his son should feign death and expatriate himself, retaining only a portion of his name. Now that Judge Ashley is dead, and the whole thing nearly forgotten, it will be quite safe for your father to return to his native home."
               "But will it be right, Frank? By acting thus, he will give his dead father the lie; for if I understand you aright, it was his will that dictated the deception which seems to have been practised."
               "As to that, Evelyn, you and I must not sit up in judgment on my uncle. He acts to please himself; and since I have learned to love you, I can never find it in my heart to object to his return to Maryland. When there, we shall at least be near each other. Time will work things around in our favor; and if you will only consent to return my affection, we shall yet be united."
               "I cannot see how such a revolution in our favor is to be accomplished."
               Wentworth eagerly caught at the implied confession her words contained.
               "Then you are really not indifferent to me, Evelyn? I may hope that if I can overcome the obstacles to our union, your consent to become mine will not be refused. Only give me the assurance of your love, and I swear to do so. Bessie herself shall release me from such allegiance as I now owe to her, and I will make such pecuniary concessions to your father as to induce him to give his consent to the exchange of daughters which I wish him to make."
               Evelyn shrank from his love-beaming eyes—from the ardent impetuosity of his manner. She said:
               "Oh, Frank! you press me so eagerly that I scarcely know what my own feelings are. But I am quite sure that we are doing what is not right in talking in this way."
               "Pooh! Evelyn, don't be a Goody Twoshoes. I dare say my uncle would say that it is not right for us to do anything of which he would not choose to approve; but I do not happen to agree with him in opinion. We are but seeking what is every human creature's inalienable right—our own happiness, and in so doing we injure no other being. Your father's interest can be as well served by this marriage as by the other."
               "But your interests will be sacrificed. Unless you marry Bessie, you are to get nothing from Judge Ashley's estate."
               "By heaven! I care not! Bessie is welcome to the whole, and I am sure she will not play the niggard to her father when she gets it in her own possession. I have education, abilities, and industry, and if you will only consent to endow me with the priceless boon of your affections, I will give up everything, and toil to place myself in the way of well-earned independence. If your father, as the price of his consent to our union, asks the enjoyment of your estate for the term of his natural life, I would give it, demanding from it barely enough to support you in comfort, till my industry has won its sure reward."
               His earnestness and disinterestedness swept away the last barrier of prudence to which Evelyn had desperately clung. She tenderly asked:
               "Oh, Frank! would you indeed make so great a sacrifice for my sake?"
               "I would do much more than that, for the sweet reward of your love, Evelyn. If you will only consent to share such a future as I may be able to offer you, everything else will seem easy. Besides, where would be the sacrifice on my side? The fortune to which your are entitled in right of your mother, is much larger than the half of my grandfather's estate; and even if we relinquish it to your father for his life, it must eventually come to us. In the mean time, I shall make a man of myself by putting my abilities to some good purpose; you will cheer me in my new sphere, and make the humble home we shall be able to afford a scene of contentment and happiness. Dearest Evelyn, only let me deliver you from the violence from which you daily shrink, and make up to you for the want of affection—from which I can see that you so keenly suffer, and I shall be the happiest of men."
               By this time poor Evelyn's resistance had completely given way, and beneath her shrouding veil she wept tears of delicious emotion. She faltered:
               "Since you came a new life seems to have opened to me, Frank, and I now know that if I am compelled to go back to the old dreary round of unshared duties, with no prospect of change to brighten the future, I shall be most miserable. If Bessie willingly gives you up—if she shrinks from accepting this dear hand, there is no reason why it shall not clasp mine in mutual love. It seems wrong to suffer it to do so clandestinely; yet if my father dreamed of what has passed between us this night he would be fearfully angry; he would separate us at all hazards, and I might even be sent back to my convent, and left there when he goes to America."
               "I believe all that, love; but we must keep our own counsel sel, it is our only safety to do so for the present. Let not your tender conscience be wounded by the necessity of deception, since circumstances force it upon us. We must be extremely careful not to betray to any one the tie we have this night formed. When I have, in some measure, smoothed the path to the accomplishment of our wishes, I will speak out to my uncle, and demand his consent to give you to me. You can trust in my honor, dearest?"
               "As in my life," was the fervent response, and Evelyn passionately went on: "Oh Frank, until you came, I felt as if I were an alien in my father's family: he cares most for my brother, and if I were not useful to him, my presence would scarcely be tolerated beneath his roof. My stepmother does not attempt to conceal her coldness toward me, and I should have sunk under the blighting influence of their indifference, had not my good old nurse petted and consoled me for it as far as was in her power. You must make Jane's acquaintance, for you have scarcely spoken to her as yet. She is the best and kindest of creatures to me, and loves me with a tenderness almost equal to that of a mother."
               "I shall be glad to know Jane better, for I owe her much for her kindness to you, my precious one. When we are married, she shall always live with us; I promise you that."
               "You dear, considerate Frank! But you must not talk of marrying yet, for that is far in the future."
               "That depends on circumstances. After my return to Maryland, I shall take my own measures for releasing you from the thraldom in which you are held, and claiming you as my own."
               The lovers had taken possession of a retired seat in a shadowy nook in the grounds, and occupied by their own feelings, they forgot the lapse of time, and the promise which had been given to Mr. Ashley.
               The groups of promenaders gradually disappeared from the illuminated walks, the music still poured out its gay strains, but the gardens were almost deserted.
               Suddenly the voice of Maitland was heard close beside them.
               "Oh, ho! won't you catch it? that's all. Papa sent for me to come to his room, and I found him in a towering rage because Evy has played the part of a naughty truant. You had better run back, belle sœur, as fast as you can, or he may do something frightful before you get in. He was as red as a boiled lobster, and ma couldn't quiet him down."
               Evelyn started up in much perturbation, exclaiming:
               "Oh, how thoughtless we have been! Come, Frank, let us return at once. I am all in a tremor at what may happen when we get back."
               "My dear Evelyn, do not become so agitated. I will face your father's anger, and you will see that it is nothing so terrible, after all."
               Maitland glanced keenly from one to the other, and commenced dancing a wild saraband as he said:
               "I do believe that you and Frank have been making love to each other. Don't listen to him, Evy, for he's got another girl's picture in his portfolio, I can tell you, and he's only a gay deceiver."
               "Where is Gretel, and why does he allow you to come out alone at this hour?" asked Wentworth, sharply.
               The tall form of the Swiss issued from the shadow of the shrubbery, and he respectfully said:
               "Mr. Larne sent to your room for the young gentleman to go in search of his sister, sir, and of course I accompanied him."
               "Very well, take him off now and put him to bed at once. Come, Evelyn, let us go in. I will bear the burden of your father's wrath."
               
               Maitland was still disposed to tease; he evaded the Swiss, and said:
               "Oh, ho! master Frank, you are very snappish about my advice, are you? but Evy had better take it, or it will be the worse for her, I can tell her."
               "Take him off, I repeat," said Wentworth, peremptorily; but that was easier ordered than accomplished, for Maitland mounted a tree with the activity of a squirrel, and mimicked:
               "Take him off—take him off; so you may if you can, but I am lighter than Gretel, and I can get where he won't dare to follow me, so there now! I defy you, Mr. Frank, and I'll tell pa how you treated his messenger, that I will."
               The truth of his words was so apparent that nothing remained but to coax him down again, and Evelyn looked up at him with clasped hands, and pleadingly said:
               "Maty, darling, you won't get your poor sister in a worse scrape than she was before. Papa will be angry enough without any nonsense being told him. There, come down, love, and do not try to make me miserable."
               The lad listened to her relentingly, and he said:
               "I'll do any thing for you, Evy, but I owe Frank a grudge for setting that long kangaroo after me, so that I can't do a thing I want to without being dragged off to something else by him."
               "But Gretel takes care of you, Maty, and keeps you out of the scrapes you would be sure to get in every hour of the day."
               "Oh, well, perhaps he does, and I like him well enough, but you see he and I don't happen to think at all alike—what I consider prime fun he calls mischief. Mischief, indeed! as if I don't know what that is!"
               "I dare say you do, since you have graduated in it," said Frank, whose patience was by this time entirely exhausted. "We must go, Evelyn, and leave Gretel to deal with that intractable youngster. Every moment of additional delay will only exasperate your father more deeply."
               He drew her arm beneath his own and moved away; with a backward glance Evelyn said:
               "For my sake, Maty—for my sake go with Gretel quietly."
               He shouted back:
               "For your sake I'd do almost anything, sister, but I'll pay master Frank yet, though I promise not to tell on you."
               As the lovers moved toward the house, a small, dark man, with piercing eyes and gray whiskers, was leisurely advancing toward them through one of the lighted walks.
               As they drew near each other, Evelyn raised her arm to gather the folds of her mantilla more closely around her face. The open sleeve of her dress fell back, and the singular mark upon her arm became distinctly visible to the stranger. He started, then paused directly in front of them, and exclaimed, in an agitated manner:
               "In Heaven's name, young lady, who are you?"
               Evelyn shrank back in alarm, believing that he must be deranged, and Wentworth haughtily said:
               "Excuse me, sir, but your address is very singular. This young lady is a stranger here, and she is frightened by your rudeness."
               He seemed to recollect himself, and drawing aside, respectfully lifted his hat, as he said:
               "Pardon me, but—but something about you reminded me of one I once dearly loved; of one who has long since perished from the face of the earth, and I forgot myself. I hope I have not much startled you mademoiselle, by the abruptness of my address."
               Bowing low, he passed rapidly on, before Wentworth could again speak.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXI.
               THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER.
               WHEN the two delinquents drew near the door of Mr. Ashley's apartment, Wentworth found that his companion was in so great a flutter of excitement that he paused in the corridor, and firmly clasping her hand, said:
               "Do not attempt to go in till you are more composed, Evelyn. Should your father see your perturbed face now, he might suspect something of what has lately occurred between us. We cannot be too careful for a season, love."
               "It is not so much the fear of encountering his anger which has thus unnerved me, for I am used to the outbreaks of his temper. I am agitated by the singular conduct of that stranger. If he should follow me, or attempt to make my acquaintance in any way, papa will say that I did not obey him by keeping my veil around my face. He thinks that I am fond of admiration, and he says such cruel things sometimes than I can scarcely bear them. Oh! Frank, it is dreadful to stand in such servile fear of one's own father!"
               "My darling, sustain your courage with the thought that this condition of affairs cannot last much longer. I will rescue you from my uncle's violence at all hazards. Trust to me, Evelyn, and compose yourself, for every additional moment we remain here will only increase his wrath."
               After a strong effort for self-control, Evelyn subdued the outward tremor, and they drew near the door they dreaded to unclose.
               As Wentworth was about to place his hand upon the lock, it was violently thrown open, and Ashley, in his dressing-robe and slippers, was rushing out in spite of the efforts of his frightened wife to arrest him by clinging to the skirt of his outer garment.
               "Let me go, madam. How dare you attempt to stop me when I am but doing my duty by my daughter," he loudly cried; but, arrested by the appearance of the culprit exactly in his path, he recoiled a few steps, and furiously said:
               "So-o—you have come back at last, have you? You are a pretty pair to trust out of one's sight I must say. An hour, was it, you had leave of absence, Miss, and here it is past midnight."
               Frank here interposed and respectfully said:
               "It was entirely my fault, sir. The scene was so novel to both of us, that we forgot the lapse of time. Besides, we have not overstayed the limit you named more than half an hour, and that is nothing to make a row about. I insist that my cousin shall have nothing more on the subject said to her."
               Ashley glowered on him, and he angrily retorted:
               "And who are you, that you should presume to speak to me in such a manner, sir? I will tell you that I will say what I please to both you and her, and nobody shall dare to—"
               What further he had intended to say was cut short by the approach of the same stranger who had so abruptly accosted Evelyn a short time before. He was coming down the corridor, attended by a servant, evidently on his way to his own apartment. The lights from the open door streamed on his features, and the purple hues which intense passion had called to those of Leon Ashley, faded suddenly away. He tottered and would have fallen, had not Wentworth sprang forward and offered him the support of his arm. He faintly gasped:
               "Shut the door—I—I am ill."
               Though unconscious of the cause of his sudden attack, Mrs. Ashley hastened to obey him, and the door was closed just as the stranger made a slight pause in front of it, as if in doubt and surprise. After a moment of hesitation, he passed on, muttering:
               "It must be he—it must be; but this is not the time to solve my doubts. Dead, was he? A convenient ruse that, to escape from the rope he so richly deserved."
               Frank carried his uncle to a sofa, and Evelyn hastened to bathe his face with cologne. He presently raised his head and reproachfully said:
               "See to what condition your wilfulness and disobedience have reduced me. Dr. Blomberg says that excitement is the worst thing for me, and yet my own daughter deliberately does what she knows will produce it, and throw me into this state of suffering. I must say that it is extremely unkind."
               "Indeed, sir," said Frank, bluntly, "I think it is more your fault than Evelyn's. If you will not put any constraint upon your temper, how can she, or any one else, prevent you from suffering from its effects? After coming all this distance only for the purpose of assisting you; after doing everything in my power since I have been with you to spare you annoyance, I scarcely expected such treatment as I have received for merely detaining my cousin a few moments beyond the time named by you. It was all my fault, and Evelyn was not to blame, I assure you."
               The free, outspoken manner of his nephew never offended Ashley, and it even had much effect with him in his most irascible moments, possibly from its contrast with the abject submission to which he had reduced the vassals of his own household. He regarded Frank a few moments as if debating in his own mind what reply he should make to him. Finally, concluding that it would be best not to push matters too far, he said:
               "If it was really your fault, I forgive my daughter for this time for such flagrant disobedience. You are not under my authority, and I have no right to chide you for neglecting my commands; but I have the right to rule my own family in my own way, and I wish Evelyn to understand that this is to be the last offence of the kind of which she is to be guilty. If she takes to promenading in public with young gentlemen till after midnight, I shall return her to her convent, and take measures to keep her there."
               Frank turned away, and abruptly said:
               "Good night, sir; I shall not stay here to hear one of my own sex threaten and browbeat a woman because she happens to be in his power. As to my cousin, if she is put in a convent for life, the next heir of the Arden estates will be apt to put in his claim to them."
               With this parting shaft, and a sweeping bow to the ladies, the young man escaped from the room.
               Ashley, choking with rage, raised himself to a sitting posture, and impotently shook his clenched hand at the door through which his nephew had disappeared. He hoarsely said:
               "Wretch! how dare he speak thus to me. What rebellious ideas has he been putting into your head, you bold, forward piece? You are a nice specimen of a delicate and refined young lady, flaunting out in public with that impertinent lad, and no doubt trying to attract the attention of every man you met by showing your face, and giggling like the little fool you are."
               
               He paused for lack of breath, and Evelyn tearfully exclaimed:
               "Oh, papa! how can you have so little respect for me as to talk to me in this dreadful manner."
               "Respect! heyday! when did that idea get into your head? I thought that respect was due to elders, and obedience from children; but Master Frank has doubtless taught you to reverse the natural order of things. Come to me, you wretched girl, and tell me what passed between you and my nephew to-night. Mind—I will hear everything, and if I hereafter find that you have lied to me, it will be worse for you."
               Poor Evelyn, trembling in every limb, with tears streaming over her agitated face, was slowly approaching him, when a knock upon the door was heard.
               "Who the d—l is coming here at this hour of the night!" exclaimed Ashley; and again growing pale with apprehension, he sunk back, and motioned to his wife to go to the door.
               Mrs. Ashley obeyed him, and the fat and smirking face of Dr. Blomberg appeared; he spoke in the soft and insinuating tones he had assiduously cultivated for professional use:
               "Mr. Wentworth met me in the hall just now, and informed me that Mr. Larne is suffering from a sudden and violent attack of his late malady. He hurried me off to his assistance, for the young gentleman understands that your husband is in a most critical condition, madam; just oscillating between health and chronic ailment for the rest of his life. I must see him as speedily as possible if I would be in time to do him any good."
               Little frightened by this fluent address, but glad of any diversion in their favor, and internally thanking Wentworth for the ruse he had practised in sending the physician sician to the rescue, Mrs. Ashley courteously invited him to enter.
               Her husband no sooner saw him than anger usurped the place of his late fear, and he brusquely said:
               "What the deuce brings you here, Blomberg? I do not need you, nor did I send for you."
               The physician, with his fat, good-natured smile, made his way to the side of his patient, seized his pulse, and coolly said:
               "Mr. Wentworth was a better judge of your condition than you yourself are, sir. Your pulse is at fever heat, and all the inflammatory symptoms which my treatment had banished from your system are ready to return. It is a very serious thing, Mr. Ashley, for if you are thrown back again at this stage of your recovery, there will be little hope of permanent amendment."
               Much as Ashley abused his health, it was one of his weaknesses to be easily alarmed when he was really suffering from any derangement of his system. He listened to the doctor's words as to those of an oracle, and submissively said:
               "I have foolishly permitted myself to become much excited, doctor, and perhaps I shall need a sedative. Give me some of your globules, and I shall get along very well."
               Blomberg gravely shook his head—for Frank had dictated to him the course of treatment necessary on this occasion, and promised an additional fee if he would compel his patient to follow it. He fully entered into the spirit of the scene before him, and gravely said:
               "The mischief you have done yourself, Mr. Ashley, can only be remedied by your submitting to be packed at once, and you must remain in the wet sheets till the fever in your blood is entirely overcome."
               "Good God! do you put people in wet dabs of linen for merely getting in a passion? I sha'n't submit to any such nonsense."
               "Very well, sir," said the physician, with a sudden assumption of dignity, "if you refuse to follow my prescriptions, I must resign your case. You know whether my treatment has benefited you since you have been here. A prettier case, nor a more rapid recovery, I have never managed than yours has been; but if you prove stubborn now, I must leave you to your own devices and those of the quacks who will soon undo all that I have accomplished toward effecting a cure."
               This long speech, uttered with solemn gravity, had a great effect upon the invalid. He knew that Blomberg was the most successful physician at the Spa, and fearful that he might carry out his threat, Ashley reluctantly said:
               "If you choose to play the tyrant, I suppose there is nothing left for me but to submit, though it is a deuced uncomfortable way of spending one's night."
               "Habit—all habit, sir. You will soon find yourself comfortable, and in your present state you will sleep more soundly in the pack than you possibly could in your bed. Since you are now reasonable, I will call in the attendants to look after you at once, for the febrile symptoms are really alarming."
               Much to the relief of the harrassed wife and daughter, the man so imperious to them was taken off in as weak and submissive a state by the ministers of hydropathy as if they had been the agents of Fate itself. His effervescing wrath was cooled by the damp mists arising from his steaming body, and he did penance for the outbreak of his temper by lying several hours stretched out as stiff and immovable as if already dead, the wet linen clinging to his body, and the recollection of the gray-whiskered traveller seething in his brain.
               Altered as the man was, Ashley knew him at the first glance, and something in the face of the other also assured him that he was himself recognized, though under his change of name he devoutly hoped his old acquaintance would fail to identify him.
               He bitterly execrated his own imprudence in retarding his recovery by the passion into which he had fallen; but for the relapse with which the doctor had threatened him, he would have made his arrangements to leave Baden the very next day, and evade a meeting with a man who might insist on knowing him in spite of his incognito.
               In the new dread that assailed him, Ashley forgot Evelyn's delinquencies, and when they met on the following morning, he seemed in an unusually good humor. At breakfast he said:
               "I do not believe that I feel worse than I did yesterday, but I may thank Blomberg's promptness for that. At first I was inclined to be offended with that officious scamp, Frank, but I now believe he saw the danger that menaced me, and sent Blomberg to the rescue. If the lad calls this morning, I must apologize for my treatment of him last night. Only I must tell you, Evelyn, that you are not again to go out with him, or any one else, while we remain at Baden."
               When her father spoke of Frank so kindly, Evelyn brightened up; but at the last words her face clouded, and she said:
               "Mamma promised my cousin that I should walk with him every day. If it will not annoy you for me to leave you for an hour or two, I shall be very glad of the permission to take exercise in the open air. Indeed, papa, I feel the need of it, or I would not ask you."
               "Ah! bah! nonsense! You only want to flaunt yourself out among the other butterflies, in the hope that you can eclipse some of them. You are looking as fresh as a rose, and as to exercise, if you feel the need of that, you can open the doors of communication between all the rooms we occupy, and walk up and down them. I will warrant that you will soon have exercise enough in that way. As to what your mamma promised Frank, that is nothing. My word is the law in my family, as you have had reason to know before this."
               Mrs. Ashley made no reply to this disrespectful reference to herself; she silently poured out the tea, and Evelyn dared utter no further remonstrance. She trusted that Wentworth would soon come in, and use such influence as he seemed to have acquired over her father to induce him to alter his decision.
               But the day passed on, and Frank did not make his appearance. At an early hour Dr. Blomberg came in, expressed his delight at the summary manner in which he had arrested the symptoms which might by this time have taken a fatal turn; he prescribed a few globules to be punctually taken every four hours, and took his leave.
               The day passed wearily enough to Evelyn; her father kept her in constant attendance upon himself, and she read to him till her throat ached, and the lines dazzled before her eyes. With a sneer at her hoarseness, he then ordered her to lay her book aside, and find some other means of amusing him. She then played chess and backgammon with him, always permitting him to beat in both games, till her brain seemed bewildered and her forbearance almost exhausted.
               Listening, listening through all for that step which by this time had become familiar, and now was beloved. But it was never heard throughout that long, long day, and as sunset flamed in crimson and gold, the poor child stood beside her window with tears of weariness and disappointment ment trembling in her eyes. Her painful reverie was interrupted by a light crash, and with a startled glance she looked around, and saw a small roll of paper tied to a pebble which had fallen at her feet. In another moment it was in her hand, and she was eagerly perusing the following lines traced by Wentworth:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "I would not come to-day, Evelyn, nor will I come tomorrow, nor the next day, to be lectured by my uncle, and to see you insulted as you were last night.
                           "Some bills have been sent in to him which he cannot settle without me, and I intend to make him feel of what consequence I am to him. When he has learned his lesson he will be less brusque in his manners, not only to me, but to you and your mother.
                           "But I cannot dispense with seeing you, my precious Evelyn, and at ten to-night I shall be near your window, watching for your appearance. It opens to the floor, and if you will exercise a little courage, you can take the evening walk so necessary to the preservation of your health.
                           "I can easily lift such a mite as you over the balcony in my strong arms; and I hope that kind of packing will agree with you as well as Blomberg assures me your father's did with him. As you are an ignorant foreigner, and may not understand the play on the word, I must tell you that in western phrase, in my grandfather land, to pack, means to carry.
                           
                              Ever yours,
                              FRANK."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Evelyn dried her tears, laughed over the pun, and blushed at its explanation. With her eye she measured the distance between the railing of the balcony and the terraced walk beneath it, and decided that the feat of lifting her slight form over it, and depositing her safely on terra firma, would be by no means a difficult undertaking for a tall young man like her cousin to accomplish.
               But she had by no means decided that she would permit him to do such a thing, much as she wished to ramble through the grounds again, and listen to his cheering hopes for the future.
               
               Lost in thought, she stood leaning over the balcony, unconscious that any one was observing her, till a movement among the tall shrubs which grew near it caused her to turn her head, expecting to see Wentworth, but her eyes met those of the grey-haired stranger fixed on her with an expression of intense interest. He carried a book in his hand, and loitered slowly through the walks as if merely pursuing his own pleasure.
               Evelyn hastily retreated, without returning the low bow he made, and she sat down in some perturbation till she was summoned to supper. Who was this man, and why did he regard her with that earnest look in which eager questioning and mournful interest were blended.
               She could be nothing to him, but she feared to inform her father of the presence of this stranger, or to ask him if he could furnish a clue to the words he had addressed to her on the previous night.
               As soon as supper was over, Ashley, to her great relief, declared that he felt himself in need of immediate repose, and he retired to his chamber, bidding his daughter hold herself in readiness to go to him, and read him to sleep when he was comfortably established for the night.
               This was a duty always exacted of Evelyn, and it was her neglect to return in time to perform it on the previous night which had so enraged him. On this evening he took a fancy to have Dante's Inferno read aloud to him, and the many strange and horrible punishments imagined for the wicked, excited him so much that the clock on the mantel chimed the half hour after nine before he succumbed to the soothing influence of her voice, and fell into a sound sleep.
               She paused a few moments, listening to his heavy breathing, and assured that she was at last free for a few hours, Evelyn tripped lightly from the room. She spoke a few words to her step-mother, who was sitting in the drawing-room ing-room yawning over a new novel, informing her that her tyrant was at rest for the night, and she herself would retire at once to her own room.
               Quite unsuspicious of any underplot, Augusta nodded her acquiescence, and the young girl gained her apartment in which she found her nurse waiting her appearance.
               Jane had grown fatter and rosier with the progress of all these years, but she did not look materially older than when she first came to Mr. Ashley as nurse to his deceased child. She had never been more than good-looking, and time had dealt gently enough with her in some respects, though it had only hardened her resolution to keep the secret of the exchange of children which had been suggested by herself.
               When her young lady came in, she arose and said:
               "I have been waiting for you, Gypsy, for some time," using a pet name she always gave to her nursling when they were alone. "Why can't the mistress read to Mr. Ashley sometimes, in place of making such a slave of you? I declare, of late, you hardly get a moment to speak to me."
               "Papa prefers my reading to mamma's, Jane, and that is why I am so constantly called on. I am quite willing to do what I can for him, but I sometimes feel as if I am tired enough to lie down and give up. I am afraid that I am not good, or I should not weary of my duty as I do."
               "You not good, child! heh! you've got all that's in this family, anyhow, except what may be found in my old carcass, and I don't think that's much to brag of. The mistress puts everything on you, and gets out of the way of your pa's frightful temper as much as she can. She don't care how much you have to bear, if she is only screened herself. But I do say it's a shame to put so much on a young slip of a girl like you."
               
               "Dear nurse, don't try to make me feel hardly toward my parents. They are all I have to look to, and it does no good to point out to me what I must see, and feel for myself."
               The faithful woman took her in her arms as she would have done a tired child, and more gently said:
               "I know that I should not do it, my pretty; but my temper will get the better of me sometimes, and I say what I should not say. But you have a fortune of your own, Gypsy, and these people have no right to treat you as if you are their slave. I mean to speak up before long, and give your pa and ma a piece of my mind."
               "No, you won't, you dear old thing," said Evelyn, coaxingly, "for that would only make things worse for me. Papa might get angry and send you away altogether; then what should I do without you to pet and console me when I am tired and sad?"
               "Send me away! I should like to see him try that game," said the woman scornfully. "I am as firmly fixed in this family as you are, Gypsy, and father nor mother, nor a dozen more to back 'em, shall ever set me adrift while you remain with them. Oh, no—they had better not attempt such a dodge as that, I can tell 'em. It will be the worse for them, if they do."
               Jane so frequently expressed herself in a similar manner, that Evelyn, occupied with other thoughts, scarcely noticed her vehemence now. She was silent a few moments, and sat with her head resting upon the faithful breast on which all her childish sorrows had been wept out, and in her heart she felt the assurance that the strong good sense of her nurse would be her safest guide in the difficulty before her.
               She presently extricated herself from Jane's clasping arms, and blushing rosy red, said:
               "I am glad that you are here, nurse, for you can settle a dilemma in which I find myself. My cousin Frank is indignant at the way I am kept mewed up, and he insists that I shall step from the balcony into his arms, be set on the ground, and take a promenade through the grounds with him after my father has gone to sleep. Do you think it will be very wrong? for I admit that I am strongly tempted to do as he wishes."
               The nurse oracularly replied:
               "Mr. Frank is a very clever young gentleman, and I do not believe that he would ask you to do anything that could bring blame on you from anybody except them as thinks that you ought not to have any pleasure that other girls of your age enjoys. I only say this, Gypsy: If Mr. Wentworth was my cousin, and he was to ask me to step out of my window to take a little walk with him, I shouldn't be apt to say no to such a reasonable proposition. But you can do as you please, my dear."
               "Then I can go without—without Frank thinking light of me?"
               "Oh, ho—what does that mean, I wonder? What if he should; you are not going to marry him. Your half sister, they say, is going to be his wife; if you choose to walk with him, I can see no impropriety in your doing so, even if you have to get out of your window to take the exercise you ought to have, and would have, if anybody cared about your health."
               Evelyn had been in the habit of confiding everything to her nurse, but she remembered Frank's caution, and she turned her head away that her face might not betray that she had a secret to conceal. She quietly said:
               "I am glad that you do not object to my going, for I feel the need of a good walk. Frank must soon be here, so I will get ready at once."
               
               Happy to be able to circumvent Ashley in any way, and really anxious for the welfare of her darling, Jane officiously brought her young lady's mantilla and draped it artistically about her petite form. A few moments later a handful of gravel was thrown upon the balcony, warning them of Wentworth's arrival, and Evelyn passed through the open window to find him standing on a garden chair, with his head rising above the level of the iron network which enclosed the balcony.
               She stopped the words upon his lips by stooping and whispering a warning that Jane was within hearing. The next instant, the head of the nurse bowed beneath the window frame; she quietly lifted her young lady in her arms, and placing her in those of Wentworth, briefly said:
               "I know all about it, Mr. Frank. The poor child can't get her proper exercise with the consent of them as has her under their hands, but we'll get the better of'em this time. I told her she had better go with you, Mr. Wentworth, for I know that you'll bring her back safe and in good time."
               "I shall certainly do that, Jane, and I cannot tell you how much we both thank you for your consideration. There, I have your young lady safe now, and in an hour and a half from this time you may expect us back."
               "I shall be ready to take her in, sir. But I hope you have made sure that the little cantankerous rattlepate, her brother, won't be up to spy out what you're doing, for he'll be sure to tell on you."
               Frank laughed as he replied:
               I took good care of that by seeing Maitland in bed before I came for Evelyn, and Gretel has strict orders not to let him get up again to-night."
               "You're a sharp one, Mr. Frank, for you think of everything. I know what I wish might come to pass, if it wasn't wrong to think of such a thing."
               Her words were partially lost to the young couple below, who, by this time, were safe on the terrace, and Wentworth took the precaution to conceal the chair he had used in a neighboring clump of shrubbery, where it could be reclaimed when they returned from their walk, and restored to its proper place in the grounds.
               Jane watched the retreating forms till they turned into a lighted alley, and then returning into the room she closed the blinds, and prepared everything for the return of her young mistress.
               From long habit her mind had become so familiar with Evelyn's state as a great heiress, that she had completely set at rest every doubt as to her perfect right to enjoy the wealth of the dead child whose place she had innocently assumed.
               Jane never troubled her head with fears of a discovery, for she considered the fraud too cleverly consummated to dread detection, and she regarded Evelyn's future as secure as any earthly lot could be. She liked Frank; she had been told that he would be rich, without learning the condition attached to the enjoyment of his inheritance, and she regretted that his previous betrothal should have prevented her darling from making her position quite sure by marrying into the family into which she had been surreptitiously introduced.
               While Jane mused over the changes a few years might bring to the object of her tenderest affections, another individual was thinking no less earnestly upon the two who had evaded the commands of the tyrannical father.
               Wentworth and his fair companion had scarcely disappeared from beneath the window, when the dark-eyed stranger sat himself down upon the chair the young man had concealed, and muttered:
               "I will watch for their return, and after the girl goes in, I must stop the young man, and question him about her. She must be her child, though she is darker, and a trifle smaller, than my poor darling was. I must and will find out if my suspicions are correct."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXII.
               ON THE TRACK.
               WITH this determination the stranger remained quietly in his seat, solacing himself with a prime Havana during the period of the young people's absence.
               Frank and Evelyn at length returned, laughing and talking gayly with each other, though their voices were gradually lowered as they approached the vicinity of Mr. Ashley's apartments.
               They paused on the terrace, and the eager watcher heard Frank entreating the young girl to permit him to press a good night kiss upon her rosy lips. She at first resisted this with a coquettish grace which reminded the stranger still more vividly of one he had formerly known. But Evelyn finally submitted to receive the first kiss from her lover, on the condition that he should not ask for another till their engagement was sanctioned by her father.
               To this Wentworth consented with a sly smile, which plainly told that his promise meant just nothing at all, and was only given to soothe the fluttering emotions of a young creature placed in so novel a position, with no one to direct or advise her but the ignorant old nurse who now appeared on the balcony, and spoke in a suppressed falsetto:
               "It's high time you was in the house, Gypsy; you mustn't stand there with Mr. Frank, for who knows but your ma may be looking from her window right down upon you?"
               Thus recalled from the bliss of love's first kiss, the clinging lips parted, the slight form of Evelyn slid from Frank's embrace, and he hurriedly sought for the concealed chair.
               It was vacant now, and in a few more moments Evelyn was safely placed in the arms of her nurse, but as he resigned her, Frank whispered:
               "That was only a half a kiss, Evelyn. I must have it over again, or I shall feel cheated. The old woman startled me so that—that I only began to feel how sweet it was."
               "Make the most of it, for it is the last one till—you know when," she replied, as she crushed the shading folds of lace over her blushing face.
               Jane, who thought her young lady had stayed out rather later than she quite approved, gladly received her in her strong arms, and bore her into the chamber in safety. She at once proceeded to close the shutters, curtly bidding Wentworth go away without another word.
               Finding the nurse determined that he should gain no further glimpse of Evelyn that night, the young lover slowly turned away, and moved down a dimly lighted alley toward the more frequented portion of the grounds.
               He had just emerged from the shadow at a point where an illuminated walk intersected the one from which he issued, when the same man who had accosted Evelyn on the preceding night stepped just before him.
               Wentworth's eyes were cast down, and his mind full of the delicious interview he had lately enjoyed, and he moved forward, quite unconscious that there was any impediment pediment upon his path. When he came actually in contact with the stranger, he threw out his arm, and impatiently said:
               "Get out of my way. Who are you, that you should occupy the whole way thus?"
               A clear and decided voice replied:
               "I am one whose most earnest wish is to have a few moments' conversation with Mr. Frank Wentworth, and if it lies in my power, to serve him and the young lady from whom he has just clandestinely parted."
               These words effectually put to flight the lover's abstraction; he paused, cast a searching glance at the speaker, and haughtily said:
               "I perceive, sir, that you have been playing the part of the spy and eavesdropper upon me, but for what purpose I am utterly at a loss to imagine. The young lady you refer to, as well as myself, are perfect strangers to you; you have once already annoyed her by your rude address to her, and I demand an explanation of your singular conduct. Your grey hairs shall not protect you from the chastisement you merit for interfering in what does not concern you, unless that explanation is perfectly satisfactory."
               The stranger listened to his angry words with the most imperturbable calmness, and he coolly replied:
               "When we have talked together a few moments, you will regret your present violence, Mr. Wentworth. I believe that I possess a right to take a warm interest in this young lady, and to say the least of it, she is acting with great imprudence in taking nocturnal walks till a late hour of the night with you, without the knowledge of her father."
               "What is that to you?" asked Frank, with increasing fire. "Miss Larne is my cousin. Her father is a hypochondriac chondriac, who refuses her permission to leave him long enough while he is awake, to take the exercise absolutely necessary for the preservation of her health; so there is nothing left for her to do but to snatch it under my protection after he has retired. If it is your purpose to betray her, I warn you that such a course will be dangerous to you."
               "My passionate young friend," said the stranger, calmly, "have I not already said to you that I wish to be your ally, and also that of this pretty little creature, who, I feel almost sure, I have a kinsman's right to protect from evil."
               "A kinsman, sir? In what way can you be related to my cousin, for I know nothing of you—not even your name."
               "The last will not enlighten you much, I suspect, but it is at your service. I am known as James Hunter, and I put in no claim to kindred with you. On her mother's side, this young lady may have relatives, I suppose, who are quite unknown to her father's family."
               "True enough, sir, but this is the first time I have had the honor of hearing of such a personage as Mr. Hunter. If you will explain your connection with Miss Larne, I shall be much obliged to you."
               "Such is my purpose, but I must first clear up some doubts of my own. Let us sit down on this rustic bench, for what I have to say may take up some time. I also beg that you will listen to me as calmly as possible, for I have that to speak of which may startle and annoy you."
               "The last seems to be your chief object, sir, but you have excited my curiosity, and I will do my best to listen to you quietly."
               The two placed themselves side by side, and Wentworth turned toward his singular neighbor and fixed his eyes upon his dark and vivid face with an expression of eager interest.
               Mr. Hunter paused a few moments as if collecting his thoughts, and then spoke in the monotonous tone of a person recalling a half forgotten dream.
               "In the days that are long since gone, I had a false friend whose name was Leon Larne Ashley. He was the only son of a wealthy and distinguished man in Maryland. Ashley and I were at college together; we were classmates, and although I had a little respect for him, the vice to which we were both addicted formed a strong bond of union between us.
               "We were rusticated for some prank we played, and hearing Ashley deprecate the idea of returning to his own home to inform his father of what he would consider as a disgrace, I invited him to my mother's cottage, to remain with me till our joint probation was ended.
               "In my mother's house dwelt a niece of my father, who was my betrothed bride. I need not dwell on what ensued, it is the old story of treachery to friend and lover. The two were clandestinely united; when I urged Eva to fulfil her plighted troth, she fled to join her husband, and I was left to bear the double treachery as I might.
               "I shall not speak of myself; that old anguish has worn itself threadbare long ago, and will not bear talking of. It has borne its bitter fruit, but with that you have nothing to do. It is of others you must hear, Mr. Wentworth.
               "This plausible man who had lured my poor girl from a future which, at least, would have been secure, abandoned her, left her to die alone, while he wooed and won a bride whose wealth and high position were to him her chief recommendations.
               "Trusting to Eva's inability to prove her marriage, Ashley hurried on his union with Miss Arden, and married her."
               "Good heavens! not while the first wife was yet living!" exclaimed Wentworth, growing very pale, as he thought of the position in which this would place her he believed to be Grace Arden's daughter.
               In the same tone Hunter went on:
               "I see that you are vividly interested in my story, Mr. Wentworth, but I must hurry on. The life of his first wife would have been a small obstacle in Leon Ashley's path, provided he escaped detection and punishment for his crime. It was God's will that the second marriage should become valid by the death of my poor Eva on the very night he gave his hand to another. Half an hour before the ceremony was performed which united him with Miss Arden his first wife expired."
               He paused, and Wentworth said:
               "This is a strange story, sir, but I cannot see in what manner Miss Larne is connected with it."
               Hunter regarded him steadily as he replied:
               "You cannot? Then you are more obtuse than I thought you, young gentleman. Eva Weston left a daughter; that child was received by her father's family, and that child have I seen walking with you these last two nights. The man who calls himself Leon Larne has laid aside his last name, to induce the world to believe the fable of his death. The secret has hitherto been well preserved; but these eyes of mine certainly beheld Leon Ashley himself last night when I passed his door, as he was so furiously rating his daughter and yourself for remaining out later than he approved."
               "You will find it difficult to prove this, Mr. Hunter; it is all mere assertion on your part, and the young lady is certainly not the person for whom you have mistaken her."
               "I can easily prove my words by appealing to Ashley himself, for he will never dare deny his identity to me. As to the daughter, I recognized her by a singular mark upon her arm, which is an heirloom in the Ashley family. The man of whom we speak has it, and from him Eva's child inherited it. When I addressed her last night, it was the sight of that mark on her raised arm which so started me and made me forget myself so far as to ask her who she was. Why should you affect concealment with me, Mr. Wentworth? I have been making inquiries about this self-called Mr. Larne, and I have learned that he is about to return to his native land. If this be true, he must intend to resume his own name, then why make a mystery of his identity to me? I have no desire to injure him, I assure you."
               Frank reflected a few moments, and then said:
               "It certainly seems useless to do so, with a person who seems to be so well informed of the past history of Mr. Larne. But you will understand that what I admit to you must be in strict confidence."
               Hunter nodded, and briefly said:
               "Of course."
               "I must set you right on one point, and to do that I am compelled to betray the incognito of my uncle."
               He paused, uncertain how to go on, and Hunter said:
               "Now you speak like a man of frankness and honor, Mr. Wentworth. You may trust me, for I now have no motive for interfering with Ashley. When he made such atonement as was possible by placing Eva's child under his father's care, I abjured all thoughts of revenge, though I have always doubted the story of his sudden death. If he is kind to the poor girl now, I shall go on my way contented."
               "He has never had an opportunity of treating her either well or ill, for the daughter of Mr. Ashley's first wife has been reared in his father's family, and she is now at Ashurst with Judge Ashley's widow."
               "And the girl—who is she?" asked Hunter, in an excited manner. "I could have sworn that she is poor Eva's child."
               "The young lady you saw with me is the daughter of that Miss Arden who became my uncle's second wife. He sought her under his assumed name, convinced her that he possessed the right to claim her allegiance as his wife, and she accompanied him to Europe. Evelyn is her child, but her mother died while she was quite an infant."
               "Evelyn! that was the name given to Eva's daughter. How comes this young girl to bear it, if she is not related to her?"
               "My grandfather did not like it, and he gave the elder sister a family name; she is called Bessie for Judge Ashley's mother. When this daughter was born, my uncle bestowed the rejected name on her; I do not know what strange caprice led him to do so."
               "It would be impossible for any man to account for any caprice that such a man as Leon Ashley may take into his head," said Hunter, dryly. "I suppose the second daughter is a great heiress, and that is why her father is so shy of having her seen."
               "She is too young to appear in general society," replied Frank, with some hauteur. "Since you have gained such information as you desired, and are now convinced that you have no claim of kindred blood on this young lady, I hope you will no longer carry on the system of espionage you seemed to have commenced."
               
               Hunter turned squarely toward him, and gravely said:
               "I meant you no evil, young man; nor would I betray your nocturnal wanderings with this fair young creature to her irascible father. But why is it that you, who are so nearly related to Mr. Ashley, are compelled to steal your cousin from her window late at night, that you may enjoy a tête-à-tête?"
               "I should suppose that so astute an observer as you are might divine the reason. Her father is selfish and irritable, and he keeps Evelyn in such constant attendance upon himself that she has no chance to get out, unless she comes with me without his knowledge after she has read him to sleep."
               Hunter muttered:
               "I might have known as much. Wretched, selfish, voluptuary, Leon Ashley is incapable of regarding the health and happiness of any one dependent upon him."
               He then turned suddenly to Wentworth and said:
               "From all appearances, you are making love to this young lady. But I heard it asserted by a young American who came hither to-day, that by your grandfather's will you are compelled to give your hand to the eldest granddaughter, who I now find is my cousin. If you are attempting to play a double part between these two young girls, you but prove your near relationship to the false man who calls you his nephew."
               Frank flushed angrily and proudly said:
               "I do not recognize your right to address me thus, Mr. Hunter, even if you are nearly related to my cousin Bessie. But it is due to myself to set you right on this point. Bessie herself refused to fulfil Judge Ashley's commands, and I consider myself free to act as I choose. We shall find some means of evading the clause in the will which gives the whole of the estate to the one who is refused by the other. It will scarcely be fair for either of us to claim the whole, for our aversion to the proposed union is mutual."
               "You do not mean to impoverish Bessie then. I am glad to find that you have so fine a sense of justice, young man, and I hope the sacrifice you seem willing to make of half your grandfather's wealth may he repaid by gaining the hand of this pretty little sylph, who can endow you with the Arden estates."
               "Thank you, sir, but I have scarcely thought of them in connection with so charming a being as my cousin Evelyn. I may rely on your prudence not to betray anything you may have suspected from seeing us together? I have reason to believe that her father will be furious at the thought of a suitor for her hand. Besides, he does not yet know that the tie my grandfather sought to cement between Bessie and myself is broken."
               "So-o—you have your concealment, too! Mark my words, Mr. Wentworth: if it proves to Leon Ashley's interest to compel you and his elder daughter to comply with the conditions of his father's will, he will have no scruples in doing so. But he may find his own account in rendering null the conditions on which the estate descends, and he will be quite capable of impoverishing his daughter if he can find a pretext for seizing on what has been bequeathed to her."
               "If my uncle ever entertained such intentions, Mr. Hunter, I think he has relinquished them. But it grows very late, and I really must leave you. The state of Mr. Ashley's health is so precarious that I hope you will not agitate him by betraying to him the discovery you have made.'
               "It would be useless, since I have learned all I wished to know from you. Good night; explain to your cousin the cause of my apparent impertinence as well as you can. Of course, she knows nothing of her father's evil courses in the early part of his life?"
               "Nor shall she ever become aware of them with my consent," said Frank, earnestly. "I will only tell her that you mistook her for the daughter of an old friend of yours."
               The two who had held so singular a conference with each other shook hands and parted; Hunter to go to the gaming saloons in which his time had been principally spent since we last parted from him, the evanescent interest excited in his mind by Evelyn and her father fading from his thoughts amid the excitement of the game in which he was soon immersed.
               The years had passed on, whitening his hair and imprinting their tell-tale lines upon his mobile features, but the same reckless heart which Eva Weston's evasion had left in his bosom still beat there, and the chief joy of his life was found in the wild excitement of the hour in which half-maddened men stake fortune, honor and often life itself, but to see them swept into the fatal vortex which engulfs all that so many men have once valued.
               Hunter sat down to play against the bank; he had made elaborate calculations which induced him to believe that he should be able to break it, and at first it seemed as if he would easily accomplish his object.
               The game was rouge et noir, and he won the two Napoleons he first laid upon the board, betting almost for the first time in his life upon the red, for it had hitherto been his sombre practice to stake only on the black. It seemed to him more consonant with his life and fortunes, for they had long worn the gloomy hue he patronized, and he had a fancy that if fortune meant to favor him she would pour out her golden shower upon the color to which he had so long clung.
               With some surprise Hunter saw the result of the change; the bets were doubled with every turn of the card, and the uniform cry of "Red wins" was monotonously repeated till a huge pile of gold had accumulated in front of the eager gamester.
               Hunter saw before him the realization of his fondest wish—independence for his old age was welcome, even if it was won by such questionable means. He was thinking that after this night he would give up his disreputable calling, and seek to lead a less exciting and a more virtuous life.
               In the full career of his good fortune, a new player came in on whom his attention was instantly centred. He was dressed in half disabille, and from the sallow pallidness of his complexion it was evident that he was an invalid.
               The hat of Hunter was drawn down over his brows, and the new-comer, deeming him a perfect stranger, went up to the table, and seating himself opposite to him, placed a rouleau of gold in front of himself and began to bet in the reckless manner of an excitable and unprofessional gamester.
               The cool player opposite to him muttered:
               "What business has he here when his friends believe him in bed? I will soon clean him out, and leave him to sneak back to his room, and be on his good behavior after making such an escapade as this."
               Hunter understood at once that Ashley had evaded the watchful care of those around him, and overcome by his old passion, had ventured there at the dead hour of night to risk such sums as he had been able to scrape together, and he was ruthless in his determination to strip him of the whole, even if he afterward returned his winnings to his nephew.
               
               But to his surprise and chagrin, his good fortune seemed to desert him for the moment.
               Ashley began to bet upon the black. His pile of gold began sensibly to diminish, and before an hour had passed away, it had melted down to the original sum with which he had commenced playing.
               Up to this time, Ashley had been so intent upon his game that he had not once lifted his eyes to scan the man playing against him. But as he drew away his winnings and said, "I shall play no more to-night," Hunter's voice in reply caused him to start and look up. Their eyes met in recognition, and, stooping toward him, Hunter hissed into his ear:
               "It is not the first time that you have been the evil spirit on my path, Leon Ashley, but fate will not always work for you. My turn will yet come, and I shall surely use it."
               After uttering this menace, he passed from the side of the half paralyzed Ashley. It only served as a vent for the irritation of the moment, without possessing any definite meaning; but a guilty conscience needs no accuser, and vulnerable as Ashley knew himself to be, he nervously shrank from the recognition implied in Hunter's words, and gave more signification to his threats than they then merited, though, in the time to come, they were acted on under the spur of a new revelation.
               Ashley shivered, looked wildly after the retreating figure of his former friend, and unconsciously continued to bet, heedless that with the retreat of Hunter, capricious fortune had again changed, and once more smiled upon the red.
               In the confused state of his mind he sat still, merely nodding his head at each change of the game, till he was aroused from his painful abstraction to find that not only his winnings, but the sum he had brought with him were alike swept away.
               He arose in a weak, tottering manner, and in a stifled voice said:
               "I—I am very ill. Pray make way for me, gentlemen."
               Some one took him by the arm; he did not observe who it was, and until he gained the door opening into his own apartments, by the assistance of the man who almost sustained his steps, he was not aware that he was upheld by the very person whose contact he most dreaded.
               Hunter quietly said:
               "It was lucky that I returned to see how the game was going; but for my assistance, you would scarcely have been able to regain your room. Good night, Leon Ashley."
               He made a movement as if to leave him, but Ashley cried out:
               "Stop! who are you, and why do you speak thus? Why do you call me by a name long since buried in the oblivion of the grave?"
               "Yet it is one you intend to resuscitate, now that your father is no more," sneered Hunter. "Do not affect to be ignorant of my identity, Ashley, for such a pretence will not avail you. I am the man you so bitterly wronged—the relative of the poor girl you stole from her home but to break her heart. I am also the self-constituted guardian of her child, and I would not advise you to attempt any injury to her, or her fortunes, or you will find the avenger on your track. All your windings are known to me, and you had better be on your guard."
               "Ah!" gasped Ashley, and he would have fallen but for the arm extended to sustain him.
               After a few moments, he recovered sufficient composure posure to draw the key of his room from his pocket, but vainly did his shaking hand attempt to insert it in the lock.
               Hunter took it from him, opened the door, and leading him to a sofa, placed him upon it, and said:
               "With one more caution, I will now leave you, Ashley. If you persist in playing you will ruin yourself. Nature denied you the coolness which is necessary to a successful gamester, and you will do well to abjure it forever. As the price of the secrecy you seem to desire so much, I exact from you that you shall appear no more at the rouge et noir table during your stay here."
               "Why should I go there again? I have nothing more to lose," was the bitter reply. "But for your infernal presence there, and the words that so unnerved me, I might have borne away wealth—aye, wealth!"
               Hunter cynically replied:
               "It was but just. Long ago, you tore from me what I most valued in life. To night, your blighting presence marred the run of luck in my favor; and fortune, the fickle jade, enabled you to win from me the money which I need to enable me to give up a career which I feel to be dishonorable; yet it is the only one in which I can now gain my bread. To you that gold would only have proved a temptation and a snare, for you have no need to win to live; to me it represented comfort—respectability—peace. But it is useless to spend time in recrimination; it can do no good to either of us, so I forbear. I shall annoy you no more, for I have spoken all that I have to say to you at present."
               To Ashley's intense relief, Hunter left the room at once, carefully closing the door behind him.
               Racked with fear of this singular man; burning with anger for the money he had risked, and lost, Ashley staggered gered to his bed with a head throbbing with pain, and fever beginning to riot in his veins.
               On the following morning the skill of Dr. Blomberg was really needed to bring him around again; but the sick man concealed from every one around him that his besetting passion had lured him from his bed on the previous night, to risk health and fortune at the gaming-table.
               Since her husband's arrival at Baden, Augusta had occupied a separate apartment, and she was quite unconscious that he had arisen after she was wrapped in slumber, and gone out in pursuit of the pernicious excitement which had brought him to his present condition.
               The cause of Ashley's relapse remained a profound secret to all save Frank, to whom Hunter described the appearance of his uncle in the saloon, and the scene which subsequently ensued.
               Several weeks elapsed, during which the sick man gradually convalesced, and while the fear of death was upon him he proved tractable enough.
               At a hint from Wentworth, Dr. Blomberg insisted that a nurse should be provided whose duty it should be to alleviate the tedium of the hydropathic packings by reading aloud to the invalid. When informed that it was Evelyn's duty to do this, the physician protested against it, and declared that Miss Larne was already suffering from the protracted confinement she had borne in her father's sick-room; that, to save her from a threatened attack of illness, it was absolutely necessary that she should be allowed to spend several hours every day in the open air.
               Annoying as this was to Ashley, his objections were overborne by the energetic remonstrances of Blomberg, and permission was reluctantly granted Evelyn to walk out every day.
               Of course Frank was called on to attend his fair cousin in her rambles through the romantic paths around Baden, and long before Ashley was pronounced in a condition to travel, they both felt that to live apart would be an impossibility. The obstacles that lay in the way of their union must be overcome, or they must be wretched.
               As deep and true a passion as ever moved two youthful hearts bound them together for good or evil, and both believed that Fate could do no worse than separate them. During those charming strolls Evelyn no more encountered Hunter, for he departed for Paris soon after Ashley fell sick.
               By the time the invalid was sufficiently restored to travel with safety, every arrangement was made for their voyage to the United States, and the party set out for Marseilles, at which port they expected to embark.
               Mr. Ashley made a last fruitless effort to leave Jane behind—in vain he tempted her with a prospect of returning to her own family with a considerable sum of money; the nurse positively refused to be separated from the child of her affections, and declared that she would betray all if her employer insisted that she should remain in Europe.
               With hostile and bitter intentions in his heart, Ashley finally dismissed her with the assurance that he would make no further effort to separate her from Evelyn, but after the threat she had uttered he felt as if he could never again be safe so long as Jane retained her natural energy, and subtle judgment. He darkly revolved the means of ridding himself of this incubus, and he found means while in Marseilles to communicate with an Italian chemist whose preparations were renowned, and he obtained from him a few powerful sedatives which he was assured would paralyze the mental faculties without materially impairing the health, unless too large a dose was given.
               Armed with this, he waited for the occasion to arise in which he might find it necessary to use it. Jane, quite unsuspicious of the danger that menaced her, made a flying visit to her sister-in-law, and reached Marseilles on the day on which the steamer left the port.
               The further adventures of "THE DETHRONED HEIRESS," will be found related in the sequel to this work, just published, under the title of "THE HIDDEN SIN."
