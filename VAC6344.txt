                  CHAPTER I.
                  ON a cold, clear morning, late in the fall of the year, a small, insignificant looking man rang at the door of a large staring white house, situated in the outskirts of the town of L——. He muttered many curses, "not loud but deep," at the delay which ensued before his summons was answered.
                  At length the door was unclosed by a tall, severe looking woman, wearing a plain dress of black material, and a close cap, entirely concealing her hair. She coldly surveyed the new-comer before inviting him to enter, while he muttered under his breath something about a wish to face a nor'wester, sooner than such a piece of womankind as that. She at length requested his business in a calm and courteous tone, and he said,
                  "If you are the superintendent of this ere charity warehouse, I wants to speak to you, consarnin' a young gal as hasn't got a house to bless herself in; more's the pity, poor thing, for she's a winsome lass, though a mighty set up one."
                  "You are right, friend—this is the orphan asylum for girls; but as we're pretty full just now, your case must be a very good one to be accepted."
                  "Well, if that's the recommendation, I'm blessed if the gal ain't did at once: bekase you see it's the very worst kind of a fix she's in. She has neither father nor mother, nor house nor home; but I don't see the use of a charity house for them as has a good lot on yearth, no how"
                  "You misunderstand me, friend," replied the matron, mildly. "Your case seems a strong one, indeed, so come in, and state it to the lady directresses, who happen to be just now here in consultation."
                  The man followed her through a long passage, with doors opening from it on either hand, toward a small, comfortably carpeted apartment, in which blazed a bright fire. A table was drawn up in front of the hearth, and around it sat six ladies, who had just finished looking over the monthly report of the matron of the establishment.
                  The opinions of this special committee concerning the document in question, were as various as their characters were different. A small, stiff looking woman, dressed very precisely, pronounced the matron extravagant, because she had indulged the sick ward with a few delicacies she considered too costly for the use of paupers.
                  "Dear me," said a pretty faded-looking woman, attired in the latest fashion. "How can you object, Mrs. Flint, to such trifling indulgences to the sick? I am sure they were not much after all—only a few—"
                  "Never mind enumerating them, Mrs. Modely," sharply responded the lady addressed. "My opinion has already been expressed, and I presume it will carry as much weight with it as that of any lady belonging to the board."
                  
                  Mrs. Modely bit her lip, and glanced at her opposite neighbor, a look which expressed to her as intelligibly as words.
                  "Because she is the wife of a rich man, Mrs. Flint thinks she can with impunity dictate to those who manage a charity like this; although her subscription is no larger than ours, and her gratuitous contributions not half as great."
                  "For my part," said the lady, thus mutely appealed to, "I think it disgraceful to our humanity to pinch and save in every trifle in an establishment like this. The expense is divided among so many, that the extra outlay for a few delicacies demanded by the capricious appetite of sickness, can not be much felt by any; and we who have watched beside the sick beds of our own darlings, and ministered to their wants, should have a feeling of sympathy for those unfortunate orphans, whom God has thrown upon our benevolence."
                  "We all know the kindly temper of Mrs. Milamay, and her heedlessness as to results," said Mrs. Flint, in a sarcastic tone. "All I desire is, that our expenditure shall be limited to our actual means. Pay as we go, is my motto, and it has always been that of my husband. If the children are indulged in such luxuries as only of right belong to the rich, the means of doing extensive good must be curtailed, or we must overwhelm the institution with debt."
                  "Let us then increase our subscriptions by one-half their usual amount," said Mrs. Mildmay, good humoredly, for she was much too ladylike to notice the sarcasm of her hard-looking associate. "That the wants of the children shall be barely supplied, I should regard as acting the part of the unjust steward. The great benefactor has given prosperity to dwell within our walls, and we should not be niggardly in imparting it to those who are less fortunate. Let the young existence of these unfortunates have some rays of sunshine, that, in after years, when they, in their turn, have become women and mothers, they may not look back with a shudder, to the home Christian benevolence provided for their houseless childhood."
                  As she spoke, she took out her purse, and placed a piece of gold on the table.
                  "The rate of subscription is fixed," said Mrs. Flint, coldly—"and I for one feel no desire to go beyond it. There are as many appeals made daily and hourly to the benevolence of the rich, that if we listened to half of them, we should soon be paupers ourselves. Of course those persons who cherish such high-flown notions of generosity, are at liberty to make as many donations as they please; and the sums thus given, can be appropriated as they desire."
                  Having thus spoken, Mrs. Flint sank back in her comfortable chair, and placed her feet upon the fender just in front of its genial blaze. She certainly needed warming. She piqued herself on being a just woman, as if it were such an uncommon occurrence to find a sense of justice in the human breast, that no softer or sweeter feeling must be permitted to mingle with it, for fear of deterioration, I suppose.
                  "Let us then raise a fund for the especial benefit of the invalids," said  Mrs. Mildmay, with vivacity, and she pushed forward her piece of gold. Three of the four remaining ladies followed her example.
                  "This amount paid quarterly, will cover a portion of the deficiency, and I have many friends who will gladly assist in so laudable an undertaking."
                  At that moment the door unclosed, and the matron entered.
                  "Here is a new application for admittance, ladies," she said. "A man is in the house who wishes to recommend an object of charity."
                  "Let him come in," said Mrs. Mildmay, while Mrs. Flint murmured something about being overrun with applications of the same nature, and being too crowded already. The stranger entered, and stood as if slightly abashed at finding himself so suddenly ushered in the presence of ladies. Mrs Mildmay raised her clear, soft eyes to his face, and spoke in a tone of such quiet courtesy, as at once reassured him.
                  "You have a case of destitution to place before us, Mrs. Cummin tells me."
                  "Yes, ma'am; a worser case it would be hard to find. I am one o' the turnkeys o' the jail, ma'am, and this young gal as I come to speak about, is the darter o' a man what died in prison two or three days back. He was put in for debt, ladies, and for no crime o' his'n. It is now eight months since he was put in quod, and in that time his wife and two as nice pretty boys as one may see in a day's journey, all have died, and left none but this young girl."
                  "What caused their deaths?" inquired one of the ladies.
                  "The boys, you see, ma'am, had been raised in the country, and the city air didn't agree with     them, cos they was delicate and puny any how. The mother was a poor, frail creature, and it's my opinion when the father was tuck away and put in prison, they didn't get enough to live on. They hired a room close by the jail, and a dark, dismal hole it was for such as them to live in. The youngest boy used to ask his mother why the sun did not shine, and the grass grow any more, poor thing! They pined away, poor boys, and I believe the father would ha' been glad if all had died before he went himself; for he knew that consumption was a killin' him as fast as it could, when he came to the prison to be locked up."
                  "Had they no friends?" inquired Mrs. Mildmay, with much interest.
                  "No, ma'am—they was strangers from the country, and did not seem to know nobody. I heard from Mr. Elliot—that was his name, ma'am—that some relation o' his wife's, what had quarrelled wi' her about her marriage, and had been lawing with her ever since about some property, had got the upper hand o' him some how or 'nother, and it was him what had put him in prison. But the upshot o' the whole matter is, that Mr. Elliot is dead, and the darter is stayin' wi' my wife until we can get somethin' done for her. She is mighty down-hearted, and has hardly spoke a word since the burying."
                  "Poor child! What a situation to be left in," murmured the kind-hearted interrogator.
                  "Had this relation been notified of the events you have just related?" asked Mrs. Flint. "Perhaps he will relent, now the parents are dead, and not leave the orphan to the charity of the world."
                  "That was what I said to Miss Florence, myself, ma'am; but her pale face kind o' flushed up, and her black eyes flashed as she said 'she'd die sooner than take a crust o' bread from him whose cruel persecution killed her parents, and her dear little brothers."
                  "Hey day—how old may this independent young mendicant be? It is certainly the duty of her relation to take care of her, and she should be allowed no voice in the matter," said Mrs. Flint, decisively.
                  "She be a matter o' fourteen or fifteen, ma'am; but if you was to see the lass, ma'am, you wouldn't say she shall, when she says she won't. The Queen o' England herself havn't a grander way with her than this young gal."
                  "A little vixen, I have no doubt," replied Mrs. Flint—"but we can find a way to tame her imperious spirit."
                  "My good man, you have made out so strong a case that you may bring your young friend here to-morrow morning," said Mrs. Mildmay. "Mrs. Cummin will receive her, and I will endeavor to look in on her myself before our next monthly meeting comes round."
                  "Thank you kindly, ma'am, and ladies all. I'll try and 'tice her this way in the mornin', cos she's kind o' wilful a bit, and wouldn't like the thought of bein' put with the charity gals. I sometimes just think that the grief has made her light headed a little."
                  He made a low bow and departed, while the ladies arose and prepared to leave also.
                  "A troublesome new comer I am afraid you are likely to have, Mrs. Cummin," said Mrs. Flint, as she bade her good morning—"but you know you have discretionary power to repress outward insolence."
                  "Which power I trust you will use very discreetly in the present case," said Mrs. Mildmay, impressively. "This unfortunate child seems to be the victim of much suffering, hard to bear at her age. Deal gently with her, I beg."
                  And the truly christian woman and the strictly just one departed to their own homes, which truly mirrored the characters of the two. In one, reigned forbearance, love and happiness—in the other a stern discipline, that repressed every display of feeling, and substituted a cold sense of duty for the warm and impulsive charity which indeed covereth a multitude of sins.
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  A FEW days afterward, as Mrs. Mildmay sat in her own home, surrounded by her fair and cheerful children, a note was brought to her from the matron of the asylum. It contained the following words:
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              MRS. MILDMAY,—The girl Florence Elliot, was brought hither the day after your last visit, by the man who came to state the case to us. Our usual method of inquiry had established the truth of his assertions, and I received her with the kindness recommended by you. She seemed worn out, and half stupified with the grief that oppressed her; I conversed with her about her parents, and she answered me calmly and without tears. One unaccustomed to the evidences of utter prostration of soul, beneath the influence of sorrow, would have thought her hard and unfeeling; but I saw at once that unless some means could be found to alleviate the weight of anguish which pressed her to the earth, she must succomb beneath it.
                              "I regret to say that all my well-meant efforts were vain, and on the following morning I was not surprised to find her too ill to rise. Her malady has steadily increased, although on the second day I caused Dr. James to be called in. She now lies before me in a violent paroxysm of delirium, in which she raves of thoughts and feelings, I should scarcely have expected the breast of so young a girl to harbor. If her ravings give a clue to her future character, it will be one of strange daring and ungoverned sensibility. Poor child! I have rarely been so much moved as when I gaze upon her pallid features, and hear her feverish lips call wildly on the parents she has lost, with expressions of affection which almost make me shudder at their strength, when I know that on earth there is no voice to respond to them.
                              "Will you come to me, dear madam, for a few moments? You may suggest to me something that has not already been done, to alleviate the sufferings of this interesting girl though it seems questionable mercy to win back from death one so perilously endowed and so utterly friendless. Yet the sympathy she excites in my bosom, impels me to leave no means untried to save her. The interest you manifested in her history emboldens me to make this request.
                              
                                 "Yours, respectfully,
                                 MARTHA CUMMIN."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  Mrs. Mildmay rang and ordered her hat and cloak immediately.
                  "Dear mother, where are you going this cold, cold day?" inquired her eldest daughter, a child of ten years.
                  "I am going to visit a young girl, not many years older than you, my darling, who has lost both father and mother, and is now lying very ill."
                  "Won't you have her brought here, and be her mother, too?" asked George, a little lad of six. "I will be very good to her, and not pull her hair a single once."
                  "Are you quite certain of that, Georgy? You know you vexed Esther when she had the headache yesterday, and she is your own sister."
                  "But then Esther has you to love her, you know, and this little girl has no father nor mother, and she is sick. Let her come, do mother, and I will give her my wooden horse, and the beautiful soldiers Santa Claus brought me last Christmas. You know they are as good as new, only—"
                  "Oh, Georgy, you know that the ten soldiers have only four heads and six legs among them! A nice present they would be for a young lady!" interposed Esther, who, in her way, was as great a tease as her brother. "No—I'll give her my nice new doll, and it will amuse her to dress it and nurse it."
                  "My precious darlings," said the mother, "I am afraid poor Florence will need none of your playthings—but if she should recover, you will probably have an opportunity of bestowing some kindness on her. Be good and obedient to nurse now while I am gone, and mother will tell you more about the sick girl when she returns."
                  Kissing her hand to the little group, she closed the door upon them and proceeded on her mission of benevolence. As she approached the asyulm, she encountered Mrs. Flint, who appeared vexed and annoyed. She stopped and accosted Mrs. Mildmay.
                  "I suppose you are going to visit the new charity girl? She is an unmanageable piece, I assure you; and you, with all your forbearance with children, will think so too, if she goes on to you as she did to me. She is actually no better than a little heathen!" and the pious lady raised her hands in a species of holy horror.
                  "What has she said that is so terrible?" asked Mrs. Mildmay. "You should not be too severe in your judgment of a young girl whose mind is distracted by mental and physical suffering."
                  "You may rest assured that the natural character is shown more clearly under such circumstances than where reason and cunning can act to interpose as a shield to the evil within."
                  "We all share alike in the evil of our fallen race, but few of us would be willing to be judged by the ravings of delirium."
                  "Ah, well—that may be true; but still I have my own opinion, and that is, that the world will be none the worse off if this girl perishes while still comparatively innocent. Good morning."
                  With a strong feeling of curiosity and interest, Mrs. Mildmay entered the room of the sick orphan. Mrs. Cummin, who in spite of her cold and precise appearance, was a woman of warm and tender feeling, had taken the new inmate into her own apartment. On a cot bed, placed in one corner, near a comfortable fire, reclined a wasted form, wrapped in a dark, blue dressing-gown, which contrasted with the uncovered throat and pale features; so destitute of color as to be scarcely distinguishable from the white linen which covered the pillow on which her head rested.
                  A mass of curls of a bright auburn hue were thrown back from a broad brow, and the eyelids which were closed in the fitful slumbers of exhaustion, were fringed with long, dark lashes of uncommon beauty. The brows were clearly defined, and even in sleep were knit together so firmly as to give a character of fierceness to the death-like countenance.
                  Mrs. Mildmay had gazed but a few moments on the sleeper when she started from her pillow, and unclosing a pair of wild, black eyes, looked earnestly upon the sweet face of her visitor. Some cord in her reason appeared to be touched, for she put forth her hand and said,
                  "You look kind—tell me where I am—every thing seems so strange. I know I am not in Heaven, for I do not think angels wear bonnets and cloaks: besides I am not good enough to go to Heaven, I know."
                  "Why should you think so, my dear?" asked her visitor. "Christ said, 'Suffer little children to come unto me,' and you are as yet but a child."
                  "No, madam, I am no longer a child. I once asked my mother when I would cease to be a child, and she replied, 'When the knowledge of death comes home to you. When your hopes, your joys, your friends, lie like withered flowers around you; when you feel the cold sensation of utter loneliness and desolation; this, my daughter, is to awake from the illusions of childhood.' Ah, yes, she was right—all—all are gone—past into the darkness of the tomb, and I am alone. Who then can call me a child any longer?"
                  The energy with which she spoke, called a brilliant hectic spot to her cheek; and her large eyes lighted up with an expression of intelligence which was almost startling. Her language and manner were so superior to her present condition, that Mrs. Mildmay felt the assurance in her own mind that the parents of this girl, however depressed by poverty, must have possessed more than an ordinary degree of cultivation and refinement, which had been assiduously imparted to their daughter.
                  Fearing to excite her disordered fancy, Mrs. Mildmay said to her,
                  "Do not let us talk of such things now, my young friend. You asked me just now to tell you where you are. You are under the care of a kind woman, whose happiness it is to receive and assist the destitute and afflicted. You were recommended to her benevolence, and she will retain you with her, until you are quite well and happy again."
                  An expression of wounded pride crossed the features of the girl, and she spoke, with bitterness,
                  "Ah! I remember now, I am to be henceforth a charity girl. I know that I am in the orphan asylum; classed with the children of paupers, yet it should not be thus. I do not forget that I am well born, and have been gently nurtured; and were justice done—"
                  A wild expression of pain fiashed over her features, and she muttered—
                  "Justice—was it ever found on earth? To that man, justice would be mercy. He has slain—let the law be fulfilled, which says blood for blood—he deserves no better. O, I am but a feeble girl—too weak—too weak to accomplish any thing worthy of being called retribution."
                  She sank back utterly exhausted. Mrs. Cummin drew near. "I thought she was about to go off in one of her wild fits of raving," she said, "I am afraid, Mrs. Mildmay, that the law of Christian forgiveness, has never been impressed upon this young creature. She seems only to cry for vengeance on the person who has caused the misfortunes of her family."
                  "Poor child! she seems possessed of intelligence, far beyond her years."
                  Mrs. Cummin shook her head—
                  "I am realey afraid she will never put it to the best use. She is wild now with fear, to be sure, but if you had heard her words to Mrs. Flint a little while ago, you would have been amazed. It is true, she took hold of those beautiful curls rather roughly, and reprimanded me, for not having removed them on the first symptoms of an affection of the brain. To tell the truth, madam, I had not the heart to cut them off. Did you ever see any thing more beautiful? the hair is as soft and fine as silk, and with that golden tinge which a painter would be delighted to copy. And then she must have taken such pride in those curls, to have kept them in such glossy order, amid the wretched poverty she has recently endured."
                  "Incipient vanity, my good Mrs. Cummin, I am afraid was the inducement. But what said she to Mrs. Flint? I met her as I came hither, and she seemed much ruffled by her words."
                  "O, she looked at her with one of her fiery glances, and throwing her head to the other side of the pillow, said: "Can not misery wear curls either? Are you Mrs. Iceburg, just from the North Sea, with your frozen looks? no—now I see you are Mrs. Beelzebub, from the torrid regions, for you look as fiery as if you had just come out of Pluto's realm, as madam, I tell you that my hair shall not be cut, because my beauty is all I have now, and I intend to preserve that. Nobody shall make my head look like a mop, by cutting off the curls my mother used to comb so daintily." Then she shrieked, and moaned, over her mother's memory, until she sank into the slumber your entrance aroused her from. She is certainly the strangest young person I have ever had thrown under my protection. What would you advise about the hair madam?"
                  "I certainly think that such a weight upon the head, can not be beneficial to a person suffering from delirium; but as the Doctor did not order its removal, and the child herself would probably fret over the loss, it may be better to risk Mrs. Flint's displeasure, and let the curls remain. The crisis of the fever seems past, and with something to compose her to rest, I think she will be out of all danger in a few hours."
                  "I am glad to hear you say so madam, for I am strangely interested in her recovery. There is something so energetic, so soft—sustained in all her movements, that she strikes me as an uncommon girl; one born to no ordinary fate."
                  "You are romantic Mrs. Cummin. She is self-willed I fancy, and even in childhood her temper has been embittered by her misfortunes. She is certainly remarkably beautiful and of a most striking style too; but that may prove her greatest misfortune in years to come."
                  The girl seemed to have heard, and understood the last words, for she sudddenly unclosed her eyes, and said:
                  "No—no—it will be my greatest good fortune tune, for through it, I shall gain vengeance."
                  "Vengeance, poor child? What can you have to avenge?" asked Mrs. Mildmay, compassionately regarding her.
                  "All—every thing," was the rejoinder, uttered with bitter emphasis. "The wrongs of such helpless ones as I am, are passed silently by in this hard and cruel world; but God saw my need of some great gifts to enable me to accomplish the end for which I was created, and he bestowed two—beauty and intellect—they are woman's best dower, and sick, poor, and helpless as I now am, the day of their triumph will surely come. I can suffer and wait until that hour arrives."
                  The compassionate visiter regarded her with astonishment; but the flushed cheek, and sparkling eyes, indicated a high state of feverish excitement, and she forborn making any reply. Commending her to the care of the matron, she was turning away, when the girl caught her hand in her own burning one, and said in an earnest tone:
                  "You look good and kind—promise me that you will not leave me here. I shall die in this place; wearing the living of charity, my heart will break. O, let me serve you, slave for you, so I win my bread by my own industry; and in return give me the means to complete an education fitted to the station I was born to fill. Here I shall only become a torment to that good woman there, who has taken so much trouble with me."
                  She sank back exhausted. Mrs. Mildmay hesitated, for there was an expression of energy in her manner which demanded a decisive reply, and she feared to irritate her by a refusal. Deeply interested in the fate of the unfortunate girl, after a slight pause, she said:
                  "Be it so Florence, I will either receive you myself, or see that you are properly cared for by others."
                  "No—no—with you—you alone. You might place me with those who would never understand me; who would have no patience with my waywardness; for I am not like others. But I see you are good—your eyes are calm as were those of my precious mother."
                  The utterence of the beloved name seemed to overcome all her calmness; her lips quivered, and again the pallid hue of death overspread her features. Deeply touched by these evidences of strong feeling, Mrs. Mildmay imprinted a kiss upon her brow, and said:
                  "Be at peace, poor child, you shall come to me. Recover now as fast as you can, and so soon as you are able, you shall be removed to my house."
                  "Thanks, thanks, dear madam," murmured the girl feebly, and turning her face toward the pillow, she wept bitterly. Mrs. Mildmay with the consent of her husband, adhered to the promise she had made, though it was many weeks before the orphan could be removed to her own comfortable home. A relapse brought on by the irritability of her nervous system, followed apparent amendment, and for many days her life was despaired of. Her kind benefactress visited her daily, and ministered to her wants with the unsparing hand of genuine benevolence.
                  At length the hour came in which Florence was received beneath the roof of her friend. A woman of a different type of character, might have hesitated as to the propriety of assuming such a responsibility; but Mrs. Mildmay was not one to shrink from the duties which lie scattered so thickly upon our daily paths. She was in the truest sense of the word, a benevolent Christian woman; and the unhappy temperament of this unfortunate child of desolation, appealed in a powerful manner to her feelings. To train that wayward spirit to quietness and peace; to infuse into that early embittered soul a sense of the beauty of a well regulated mind, and humble Christian resignation to the will of Providence, was her earnest wish. Such were the motives which prompted Mrs. Mildmay, to accede to the prayer of the friendless girl, although she saw that a task of much difficulty lay before her. A hasty and passionate temperament; a determined will, and eloquent to detend the course she might choose to pursue, she clearly saw she had to deal with; yet she shrank not from the task, if she could preserve this highly endowed soul in the final struggle with evil.
                  
                  Florence came to her, and while the weakness, consequent on recent illness, lingered around her, she was mild, gentle, and affectionate. The children soon attached themselves warmly to her, and her new friends began to hope that they had gained a treasure in their young protegée; but with returning health, came back hours of willfulness, of bitter and passionate sorrow—sometimes succeeded by days of brooding melancholy. Then followed violent fits of weeping, which seemed for a time to clear the darkness from her soul, and she would go forth among the household, calm and ready to assist in any employment with skill and industry, but she was never gay.
                  Any allusion to her former life, would either arouse the slumbering fire of her nature, or bathe her face in tears; and by Mrs. Mildmay's orders, they were carefully avoided. When her health was sufficiently restored, her protectress considered it necessary to speak to her on the subject of her past life, and one morning desired her to accompany her to her own apartment, for that purpose. The young girl seemed to understand the painful interview which was to follow, for she trembled and grew pale, as she followed Mrs. Mildmay in silence.
                  After some slight hesitation as to how she should open the conversation, Mrs. Mildmay, said:
                  "I am sure, Florence, that you understand the interest I take in your future fate, and are fully aware that no idle curiosity prompts me to inquire into your past existence. Perhaps a knowledge of your previous position may enable me to serve you more effectually."
                  She stopped, and Florence, after a pause, said with effort—
                  "My parents were of education and refinement, Mrs. Mildmay. They loved each other sincerely—no stain ever clung to them, although my father perished in prison. He was the victim of baseness, but not base himself. It is bitterly painful to me to speak of the past; O, yes, it is an anguish you can not comprehend."
                  "Have you no relations, Florence?" asked Mrs. Mildmay, gently.
                  "No—no—all have perished—I am alone—alone in this wide and bitter world. I do not acknowledge him, the oppressor, the destroyer, as my relation; althougn he claims to be the cousin of my mother. No, madam, I am friendless."
                  "Not while I live, poor child. But this cousin—where does he reside? What position in life does he occupy?"
                  "He is rich—he stands high in the estimation of the world; but he is not the less a treacherous, black-hearted villain."
                  "You use strong expressions, Florence. Pray endeavor to moderate your impetuosity. It seems to me, that this cousin should be informed of your position—you have claims on him."
                  "Madam—Mrs. Mildmay," said the girl, starting up with curling lip and flashing eyes. "I would sooner beg—sooner debase myself to the lowest drudgery, than be indebted to him for kindness or protection. He crushed all that was dear to me. He—O, you know not what you say!"
                  "Tears interrupted her utterance. After a pause she dashed them indignantly away, and said:
                  "I intend at some future day to meet him—to confront him for the purpose of wringing his heart; but not now—not as a helpless feeble child, appealing to his bounty, but as a strong-hearted determined woman, capable of meeting craft with craft—wrong with wrong. O, yes, the iron shall yet enter his soul, and he shall recognize the hand that barbed the shaft as that of the child of his unoffending victims."
                  Mrs. Mildmay gazed in pained astonishment on the excited face before her. The slight figure dilating with the passionate emotion of the moment. She gravely said:
                  "You grieve me deeply, Florence, and I am half tempted to believe that the delirium of your late illness, still disturbs your mind. "Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord," and it is not for poor human beings like us, to arrogate to ourselves the right to redress our own wrongs. If you cherish such feelings, all the loveliness of your sex, all the graces of your womanhood, will be lost forever; even if no higher motive impels you to a different line of conduct. I shall think that would have much weight."
                  A smile of exultation gleamed on the lips of Florence, and she glanced toward a large mirror which reflected her person.
                  "I shall still be beautiful madam. I shall still have the brain to plan—the courage to execute. The leopard, with all its fierceness, is still considered the most beautiful of animals; it shall be my type—for I have a duty to perform which calls for the same traits of character. Oh yes—an imperative duty, but until the hour for its execution arrives, I shall not reveal my purpose."
                  Mrs. Mildmay now really believed her brain affected, and she inquired:
                  "Do you know the address of this cousin of yours? I wish to be informed of it."
                  "I might refuse to give it to you, Mrs. Mildmay, but I will not; because I feel within myself the power to defy him. My cousin is Colonel Talbot, of Talbot Hall, —— county." Write to him if you choose; but I will never receive assistance from him—will never see him as his dependent. No; the extremity of human privation will never induce me to accept assistance from him."
                  "If all the world should cast you off, poor child, and this relative alone remained to assist you in your need, would you still be relentless?"
                  "Yes, Madam, even unto death by starvation, if sustenance could only be obtained from him. Ah! you do not comprehend the terrible debt bequeathed me by my perished family. I watched the waning life as it ebbed from each breaking heart, and day by day I asked of God in vain to save them. When all were gone, I felt that retribution must come to him who has destroyed them. Years may intervene, but the bitter cup he forced the innocent to drain, must be returned to his own lips. Should the hour arrive in which my hand shall offer it, I shall be willing to die in completing the vengeance he so richly merits."
                  "Florence, my child, have you never been taught the beauty of forgiveness? Is the code of the Christian yet a sealed book to you, that you speak thus fearfully for one of your sex and years? Leave such terrible fancies to the robber and the assassin, who acknowledge no God—but for you, young, fair, highly-gifted, and above all immortal, there must be no such future as you wildly contemplate. Come to my heart, Florence. Let the soft stream of love glide through your imbittered soul, and banish such visions as now madden your mind; for no mind can be perfectly sane that yields itself to such terrible dreams."
                  Florence looked into the lovely eyes that beamed upon her with compassionate tenderness, and for an instant her soul was melted within her. She clasped her arms around Mrs. Mildmay, and wept a few delicious tears upon her maternal breast.
                  "Ah, if I was really your child," she mumured; "but I can never, never forget that I am an orphan and an outcast, whose only claim upon you is the benevolence of your noble nature. You con not love me as you love Esther and George, for they are truly your own. As well may the dove take a young eaglet to her nest, and seek to tame it to the gentle nature of her own offspring. O, no Mrs. Mildmay, amid all your kindness, I must still feel myself an alien; for no tie, save that of compassion on one side, and gratitude on the other, can unite us."
                  "It is then because you will it to be so, Florence. I offer you, in all sincerity, the affections of a parent: a tie exists between myself and my children, it is true, which Providence has wisely rendered the strongest of our nature; but interest, esteem for one an alien to our blood, can still be strong as death. Abandon your self-willed devotion to evil—suffer me to impress upon your youthful mind the milder characteristic of your sex, and as I behold you each day improving in all that is most lovely in the followers of the meek and lowly sufferer who took upon himself the burden of our sins, the more dear will you become to me."
                  Florence seemed deeply impressed with her words—after a few moments of intense thought, she looked up—
                  "I am afraid to answer for myself, Mrs. Mildmay. I do not believe I can ever become come what you wish, and there seems to me an undefined fear, in my own mind, that a desire to please you will influence me to the sacrifice of my true character. I have been told that I was born amid the crashing of as wild a storm as ever defaced the fair face of nature, and it seems to me it was typical of my future life. I can never tame down my soul to the commonplace existence of ordinary women. It surprises you to hear a child, such as I am, speak thus; but I am no longer a child in feeling. Suffering has matured my mind, and I feel myself a woman in thought and feeling. The months I passed in that terrible prison, and the impressions there stamped in the fiery ordeal of anguish such as you dream not of, can never pass away. Yes, I feel that I am one set apart for a peculiar and hapless destiny."
                  "This is very midsummer madness," said Mrs. Mildmay, as severely as she could speak, "You are worth the effort, at all events, poor deluded child; and, with the blessing of Heaven, I will endeavor to bring you back to a sense of your duties as a responsible human being."
                  "Thank you, dear Madam, beloved friend I will make the effort to please you, though, I fear, I fear you will be disappointed in the result of your efforts. I am a wayward and impulsive being, and such I fear I shall continue."
                  "Yet you seem to fancy that one fixed purpose is to rule your life, and work out its final wretchedness. Be willing to be saved, dear child, and I think, with the mercy of God, I can win you from the dread idea that now fills your undisciplined soul."
                  "I give myself to you, dear Madam; deal with me as you deem best, and, should you fail, impute all the blame to me."
                  Mrs. Mildmay kissed her affectionately; and, from that day, a system of such mild and judicious discipline commenced, that the hard character of the young orphan seemed visibly to soften beneath such training. Her eyes lost their flashing, defiant gaze, and her manner gradually acquired a grace and ease which before had been unknown to her.
                  Mr. Mildmay, a man worthy of his amiable and noble-minded wife, cordially co-operated with her in her labor of love; and both began to hope that the orphan girl would yet become a brilliant ornament to the sphere into which she had been transplanted.
                  They were independent in fortune, and the uncommon gifts of Florence were as carefully cultivated as if she had indeed been their own daughter. Mrs. Flint sneered at such preposterous expense being lavished upon a charity girl; but Mrs. Mildmay suffered her speeches to remain unanswered, conscious that she was fulfilling a duty toward a fellow creature, and in so doing, affording herself a pure gratification.
                  She wrote to Colonel Talbot, because she wished to satisfy herself on some point of the young girl's family history which she seemed unwilling to explain; and also because she thought it right that he should be informed of the situation of his young relative.
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  A NARROW and tortuous stream winds through the very heart of the dark and bloody ground, bearing the Indian name which has such fearful meaning. The sombre shadows of high and battling cliffs, in many places, are cast entirely across the darkly flowing water; in others, a solid wall of limestone rises from the shore to the height of more than a hundred feet, and from the crevices between the layers spring stunted cedars, whose dark foliage adds to the wildness of the scene; while on the opposite side, the hills sometimes open into a narrow valley containing sufficient land to form a small farm, whose flourishing fields, and neat improvements, are strikingly in contrast wiih the sublimity of the surrounding prospect.
                  In one of the most romantic of these gaps, stood, many years since, a square building two stories in height, constructed of the stone found in such abundance in the valley. This rough surface was concealed by a coating of cement, painted of a dark gray color; and a portico stretched along the front, supported by white pillars, around which were wreathed many flowering vines. The yard, shaded by a few noble forest trees, sloped gracefully toward the stream, on which a boat, with a white awning, lay easily rocking in the current, and a half-grown negro boy amused himself with making ripples in the water with one of the oars.
                  It was the early spring-time, and the soft air seemed moving on glad wings over the young blossoms of the year. Bright flowers peeped timidly forth to inhale the delicious, life-giving breeze, and in grateful return allowed it to waft upon its breath their sweetest odors. Spring is always beautiful: the awakening into life of the chilled and scentless herbage, seems to us a vivid type of our own changed state in the future; and the glad sounds which greet reawakened nature, are as the music of the heavenly harps which will welcome us in the better land.
                  Within this old gray mansion, comfort, united with elegance and neatness, reigned. A large airy apartment on the southern side, which looked toward the stream, was the principal sitting-room of the family at this season. A carpet which looked as if the fairies had scattered the brightest flowers over its surface, covered the floor; curtains of a delicate rose color hung in ample folds from the lofty windows, and a piano and guitar stood in different corners of the room, giving indications that one of the most elevated sources of pleasure was understood and appreciated in this solitary valley. Book cases, filled with the productions of profound and graceful intellect, occupied spaces between the windows; and from the appearance of the apartment, it was evidently the library and sitting-room of the master and mistress of the mansion.
                  The curtain was drawn back from one of the windows which commanded the most romantic point of view, and near it stood a small circular table on which was placed wine and fruit, the latter served in crystal baskets, the bottom of which were covered with green moss and clusters of the bright shining leaves of the laurel, from which peeps the ruddy fruit.
                  A man of about thirty-eight or forty sat beside this table, in a luxuriant arm chair. His figure was tall and well-proportioned, though a slight stoop in the shoulders indicated a lounging and careless habit, the offspring of his love of ease. His complexion was dark, and his features regular; in his black eye and on his compressed lips might be read the indomitable will of one who would not brook the slightest opposition to his wish. There was at moments a cold twinkle in that intensely dark eye which betrayed cruelty; though in the relations of every day life he was considered irreproachable. Like many men who are practical egotists, what was his own was carefully cherished. In his domestic circle, peace, joy, and happiness reigned, because the Sybarite had weighed life well, and philosophically pursued that course which would insure him most comfort in its enjoyment. He had married a delicate and very lovely woman, whose chief recommendation was her extreme gentleness of temper, together with a considerable fortune. To her he was kind, affectionate, and attentive, and he reaped his reward in the quiet devotion with which she regarded him.
                  But one child blessed this union, and to her he was also a model father. This man stood high in political life, and could claim friends in every part of the state in which he lived; yet he was but a consummate actor after all. To gain an end, he was all things to all men, and few could be found more unrelenting in the pursuit of his own interests; opposition must be crushed, even if hearts were broken at the same time; too indolent to labor himself, wealth must be secured by the efforts of others, and a hard, though a smooth spoken master he proved himself to those beneath him.
                  A sofa, covered with crimson damask, was placed in front of the open window, and on it reclined a small fair woman, wrapped in a large shawl. She was evidently in declining health, for her delicate pearly complexion was entirely destitute of color, and where the golden hair lay back from the temples, the azure veins might be distinctly traced. Her eyes, large, blue, and limpid, had an expression of thoughtful lovingness which deepened into tenderness as she looked upon her husband; for to her he was the beau ideal of all that is noble or manly in his sex.
                  
                  A child of twelve summers, with the waxen complexion, hair, and blue eyes of her mother, was running her fingers over the strings of the guitar, and eliciting from them a simple but graceful melody which she had learned by ear. The parents looked as each other and smiled at her successful efforts.
                  "Agnes, my darling, who taught you how to use the guitar," asked her mother.
                  "Oh, I learned from watching you, mamma. It is so much sweeter than the piano, that I love it best. I thought if I could play a tune, you would let me begin to learn."
                  "So you shall, love," said her father caressingly, as he drew her toward him. "My sweetest pet shall have a master so soon as I can procure one; but in this solitude such a thing is difficult of attainment. You are but a little lass yet, and have plenty of time before you."
                  "But mamma plays so beautifully," urged the child—"I think she might—"
                  "Hush, little one, mamma is not strong enough to undertake such a task. Look at her as she lies there, and tell me if you think she is able to undertake the superintendence of your accomplishments."
                  Agnes looked wistfully at her mother; and that thought of horror to the imagaintion of childhood, death, darkened over her young soul. She burst into a passion of tears, and, rushing to the couch, buried her face in her mother's shawl, and clung to her as if even the dread conqueror should not have power to tear them asunder. The mother tenderly clasped her arm around her, and, after some effort, raised the weeping face to hers, and tears trembled in her own eyes; for she knew that before the days of womanhood could arrive to that beloved child, her own heart would be forever stilled; her happy home bereft of her presence, and her daughter left without the guidance of a mother's experience—without the shelter of a mother's unalterable affection. She looked almost reproachfully at her husband, as she said:
                  "It was wrong, love: you know what ungoverned sensibility she possesses; it seems to me a word can reveal to her quick perceptions all that we would most anxiously conceal from her. Agnes, my precious child, look at me; I am not ill; I am only a little weak from the exertion of our recent visit to our friends, the Huntleys. I can and will teach you whatever you wish to learn, for I am quite strong enough. Papa is only uneasy about me, because he loves me so much. There, love, dry your tears."
                  The little girl raised her head, and a faint, doubtful smile quivered painfully over her lips.
                  "Was that all? Is it indeed so, mother? No wonder that papa loves you, for who does not that approaches you? Ah, I will be so obedient—I will not give you any trouble that I can avoid."
                  "Come hither, Agnes," said her father gravely. "I will tell you what you must do, my daughter. You must make an effort to overcome this unchequered sensibility. If your mother were seriously ill, such a display as you just now made would essentially injure her. For those we love, we must suffer in silence, when the expression of our feelings would be injurious to them."
                  "Ah yes, I know—I will try, dear papa. I will remember those last words; for it is beautiful to forget ourselves in shielding another who is dear to us as my dear mother is to me."
                  "Dear me, the child talks already with the precision of a book. So much for having her always with grown up people. Agnes, would you not like to have a playfellow?"
                  "Very much, if he is as kind as Edgar Huntley," she quickly replied.
                  "Oh-h, you betray a fondness for gentlemen's society already, do you, my incipient flirt? I did not tell you it was a boy I intended to provide you with as a playmate."
                  "You said playfellow, papa—and beside, I do not intend to be a flirt. I heard you call Miss Hilton, who laughed so loud at the springs, and danced so strangely, a flirt, and I am sure I shall never be like her. But who is to be my companion, father?"
                  "A distant relative of yours—a young girl, who will be an elder stster to you."
                  "Is she good? Is she pretty?" asked Agnes, leaning on him and fixing her eager eyes on his face."
                  "Those are questions that time must answer, Agnes. I have never seen her myself since she was quite a small child. She took such an invincible aversion to me then, that I could not induce her to approach me."
                  His wife raised herself on her elbow, and gazed on him with much surprise. In reply to her look, he said:
                  "It is the daughter of that poor devil, Elliot, and—and of my cousin Anna. They are both dead, I am informed, and this girl is the only surviving child. I have never heard from him since the suit I defended so long went against them, until a formal notification reached me through my counsel, that no further claims could be collected from Elliot, as he had famished in prison."
                  "And you were not aware of his situation?" asked his wife in a low tone. Talbot changed color.
                  "Do not question too closely, love. No friendship existed between Elliot and myself: he accused me of fraud—a charge I triumphantly repelled, but it left its sting in my mind. Beside there were old scores to settle between us. I did know he was in prison, but that was none of my business. His own obstinacy and wrong-headedness had brought him there, and as men sow they must reap."
                  "Still the power to be generous to a fellow adversary was yours, my husband. It would have been more noble to forgive and assist."
                  A sarcastic smile glanced over the full lips of the husband as he replied:
                  "Women know nothing of the business of life, Agnes, and you are one of the most childlike among them. Suffice it, that I could not act otherwise than I have done. Elliot and I were enemies of long standing, and I own it was a triumph to me to crush him; though I am sorry the poor wretch died as he did, and I am willing to adopt his child, and rear her as my own."
                  "How old is she?" asked Mrs. Talbot, in a subdued tone, for she was chilled by her busband's words
                  "Nearly fifteen, I fancy; and if her mother took that care of her intellectual culture which she was amply capable of, she must be a very superior girl. I am told that in infancy she was remarkable for the precocity of her mind, and the most indomitable temper that ever cursed a pretty woman."
                  "And you expect her to live with us?" inquired Mrs. Talbot, in a deprecating tone.
                  "There is no other place for her to go to, Agnes; and the world would blame me if I did not offer to receive her. Appearances—appearances, you know, must be kept up. She shall be no trouble to you; I will not undertake the management of her temper, and she can be of material assistance to you in educating Agnes."
                  Thus it was finally settled, and little Agnes looked forward with pieasure to the arrival of one near enough her own age to be a companion for her.
                  Colonel Talbot had written to an agent in L—— to discover the abode of the orphan, and to send her to his residence by the first escort that could be obtained—never doubting that the young girl would be only too anxious to accept his generous offer. He was, however, soon destined to be undeceived.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  A LONG silence ensued, and then Colonel Talbot aroused himself from a painful reverie, in which his thoughts had wandered back to the days of his early youth, when the cousin whose daughter he had so lightly spoken of, was the presiding genius of the very scenes around him. The old Hall had been the home of their infancy, as well as of their youth; but the events of after years had widely swerved them, and conscience whispered him, that not hers had been the fault. With an effort, he forced himself from the contemplation of a painful subject, and said:
                  "It is so pleasant, Agnes, I think a sail upon the river will be beneficial to you. The air is as soft and bland as if an Italian sunset were gleaming over the water. After all, I do not believe that Italy is so much more beautiful than our own country. The Englishman runs away from his land of mist and falls into rap tures with the first gleam of unclouded sunshine he happens to bask beneath, and it is principally from their productions we obtain our ideas of the radiant clearness of the atmosphere of southern Europe."
                  "I am patriotic enough to agree with you, especially on such an evening as this. My frame seems to gain new vigor as I inhale this bland air. Ah! if it could always be spring! But alas! the spring-time of life must pass, even as that of the year, and pass too, without a hope of renewal."
                  "Agnes, run for your bonnet, love." said her father, hastily. "And tell Kitty to bring mamma's hood."
                  The child left the room, and Colonel Talbot bent over his wife and carefully assisted her to rise; there was an expression of gravity on his features which amounted almost to sternness, for her words had struck a painful thrill to his heart. He saw that she faded by day, and he had become so accustomed to her thoughtful and tender love, that he could not contemplate the final rending of the tie which united them, without deep emotion. She was so patient, too—so loveable amid all her own sufferings, that it would have been a hard heart which did not recoil from the thought that the music of that lovely spirit must soon be translated to a higher sphere, leaving the beloved of earth to wander in desolation and loneliness
                  It seems a sad doom to die of consumption—to draw nearer, day by day, to the grave which slowly opens to inclose the fading one. Sad must be the vigils of that spirit which approaches, step by step, toward the portals of the uuseen world, and as poor Keats said, "Feel the flowers growing above their grave." Many hours of solemn communion of weak shrinking must be endured, for the fear of death which is our most bitter heritage, must darken many hours even of that soul which is at peace with Heaven.
                  The child was no sooner out of hearing than Colonel Talbot raised the wasted form of his wife in his arms as easily as he would that of an infant, and as her head rested on his shoulder, he whispered,
                  "Do not speak—do not think of leaving me, Agnes. You can do much yourself to ward your own recovery; for the human mind is so constituted, that what we will to struggle against with all the strength of our nature, we can usually overcome. You are weak, but disease has made no serious progress in your frame—for my sake, for that of our daughter, make one effort, and all will be well. I will travel with you this summer—change of scene will essentially benefit you."
                  "Thank you, love. On my part no effort shall be wanting, I promise you, and result as it may. I shall carry with me forever a tender memory of all your affectionate forethought for me."
                  Who would have believed that this cold, hard man of the world could be so patient, so tender with his invalid wife? Yet he who had little sympathy for the sufferings of others; who often ruthlessly occasioned them, was sincere in his love for his own. Like the Chinese, he seemed to consider his own little realm the world, and all the rest of the human family as "outside barbarians," whose struggles, hopes, and fears were unworthy of a thought.
                  The hood was brought, and the servant preceeded them with shawls and cushions, which were carefully arranged by the busy little Agnes, who seemed quite skilled in her employment. The mother and daughter were safely seated side by side; Colonel Talbot steered the boat, and a black boy managed the sail. A light breeze was stirring, and the bark skimmed over the water with a bouyant and pleasant motion. Agnes played with the rippling waves, and her mother reclined upon her pile of cushions and watched her cherub face, while a bright dream of the future came on the wings of fancy, and the mother forgot her weakness—her sad fears that life would not be granted to watch over that young existence.
                  Suddenly at a bend in the river, a voice of rude melody was heard chanting a boat song familiar to the blacks on the farm. The tall cliffs gave back the echoes more than once, and presently a boat, propelled by an athletic negro, shot around a point of land, and was soon along side of the one occupied by his master.
                  "Any letters, Cæsar?" inquired Colonel Talbot.
                  "Yes, massa, there be two. None for de missis, but bofe for you. None for little missie, neither—massa Edgar no write to her yet awhile—all in good time tho."
                  Colonel Talbot smiled, for the negro was a favorite, and was allowed his jest when his master was in a good humor, which, with the cunning of his race, he always knew when to offer.
                  The letters were handed in; one was directed in a strange hand—the other he knew very well, and laid it aside. Talbot broke the seal of the first, and as he hurried through its contents, his brows knit, and his face darkened. He seemed to ponder over it some moments, and then muttered,
                  "Well, it is a good riddance. I care not now what becomes of her. My daughter," he abruptly continued, "you will be disappointed in your playmate. Florence Elliot has found other friends, and she refuses to consider me in the light of a protector."
                  "Refuses!" repeated Mrs. Talbot, in surprise. "Surely, she is too young to decide in such a matter herself. You are her natural protector, and repugnant as is the idea of having a high-spirited, wilful girl, beneath our roof; still, for her sake, I am willing to receive her. Can you not demand the guardianship of this girl as her nearest relative?"
                  "I have no wish to make such a demand," replied her husband, drily. "The offer once refused, shall never be repeated. I shall take care that it is known that protection was tendered by me, and scornfully rejected. This Mrs. Mildmay who writes to me, seems a very good sort of woman, and she may possibly be able to eradicate the fiery passions of this unhappy girl. I am glad at all events, that you are spared the trial of her wayward temper and eccentric habits. The evening air grows chill—we will return to the hall."
                  Colonel Talbot retired to his private room immediately on his arrival at home, and when alone he broke the seal of the second letter. It appeared to possess absorbing interest for him, for he read and re-read it many times, and each time his brow grew darker, and his face more perplexed. He muttered,
                  "After all my hardness, my grasping after money, I am likely to be a ruined man. I can at all events manage to hold on to my property as long as I live. It is already secured to one whose friendships will not fail me while life lasts. Agnes will not survive me, but my child—how to provide for her future, should death suddenly overtake me; and who knows what shall be his doom, or when it will fall upon him? While life lasts, I can meet losses with craft, and secure to myself the enjoyment of that luxury, without which, existence is not worth having. But she, poor child, must not be left in the wreck to meet the difficulties I dare not face. Let me see, a thought strikes me, which seems feasible."
                  He meditated several moments, and his features gradually cleared. His thoughts took the following shape:
                  "I like the lad, too. He has an intensity of character which pleases me; and Agnes loves him now with a childish affection, which may easily ripen into a warm attachment. Charming as she is likely to prove, his destiny will only be too fortunate. I must see about it at once: the recent loss of his other children has given a severe shock to the constitution of Huntly, and I am afraid he will not last long. I must have the will executed at once—he is in my power, and dare not refuse, even if it were not an honor, after all that has passed, to permit my daughter to be betrothed to his son."
                  He placed himself beside a table and rapidly answered the letter which had announced heavy losses in some very hazardous speculations in which he had been engaged. He warned the person to whom he addressed himself, that the loss must fall on those who had embarked with him in the game, as his own estate was so secured that his creditors could never touch any portion of it. He alluded to the precarious situation of his wife, and spoke of his duties to his own family as paramount to all others.
                  In short, it was a letter filled with eloquent verbiage, which did not impose upon the person he addressed. He felt that he had been defrauded and deceived; but the high position of the man who had committed the wrong, forbade his comparatively obscure opponent from revealing to the world the treachery of which he had been the victim.
                  
                  Colonel Talbot then wrote a few lines to bis friend, Mr. Huntly, informing him that in two more days he would visit him on especial business. This letter was received by the person to whom it was addressed on the following morning, and it occasioned many a dark and bitter foreboding to his mind. Circumstances of a most humiliating character bound him to Colonel Talbot; he writhed beneath the terrible bondage, but he knew there was no escape from it—death alone could release him from the ignoble slavery which bowed him to the dust. The world considered them friends of long standing, because they had associated intimately—had been linked together by worldly interests; yet if there was a human being on earth for whom Mr. Huntly had a deep and concentrated abhorrence, it was Talbot. They exchanged the courtesies of life—their families visited, and their wives really liked each other, yet Mr. Huntly awaited the arrival of his visitor in a state of painful apprehension.
               
               
                  CHAPTER V.
                  MR. HUNTLY sat couched down in a large chair with his face buried in his hands; but the slightest sound on the road aroused him, and he would look up with an expression of feverish impatience, not unmingled with dread. A light step at length emerged from the doorway, and a tall, slender woman, clad in deep mourning, stood beside him. By the waning twilight, her face looked fair and colorless as marble, and a mass of pale brown hair was laid back from the high brow, as if no thought were given to the adornment of her person. Her sombre dress—her subdued air spoke of sorrow yet felt in all its bitterness. She laid her hand softly on the shoulder of her husband, and said:
                  "My love, you are far from well. Do not linger in the evening air—Colonel Talbot will scarcely be with us to-night."
                  "Yes, Dora, he will surely come," replied Huntly, with an accent of bitterness. "He has met with losses, heavy losses, I know. I have heard of them, and what infernal scheme he has in his head now, who can tell? Something to inflict new tortures on me, I know full well."
                  It was the first time he had thus expressed himself, and Mrs. Huntly gazed on him with fear and surprise. She said:
                  "What right has he to make demands on you, which you do not choose to meet? He has been a friend to you I know, but that simple fact should not confer the mysterious power he appears to possess over you, my husband."
                  He groaned in bitterness of spirit, and, after a pause, said:
                  "Dora, when I married you, it was with the firm belief that women should never meddle with the business of their husbands—that they should have the benefit of their prosperity; but never be permitted to glance into the difficulties which so often environ men engaged in the turmoil of life. By adhering to this rule, I truly believe that I have saved you from much unhappiness. Do not now seek to penetrate a reserve which is maintained from consideration for you."
                  "My husband," she softly breathed, "if, in the long years which have passed since we plighted our faith to each other, you could have accurately read my heart, you would have seen that this reserve has occasioned me more acute suffering—more hopeless despondency, than the knowledge of the severest calamities, which have ever befallen you, could have produced. I have often felt that a chasm yawned between us which no voice of consolation arose above, and felt it too, when I knew you most needed that sympathy which you disdainfully repelled. You suffer now and I—I—." She stopped, overcome by painful emotion.
                  "You understand now why I grieve," replied Huntly, almost sternly; for he was one of those men who seek to conceal emotion by harshness of manner. "Have we not wep together over the graves of our children Why then should you imagine other cause for the sadness which at times overpower me? Leave me—leave me, Dora—I can no bear reproaches now."
                  "I did not intend to reproach you, William you never will understand me, and yet I have devoted my life to you." There was something in the tone of her voice which touched him, and he drew her toward him.
                  "You have indeed been a model wife to me, my Dora, and I sincerely love you for all your goodness—but I am sadly changed; by what I can not tell you. You will bear with me—you will love me to the last, for I sometimes think that the end is not far off. A dark presentiment struggles vaguely in my mind, and the future looks dim, as if seen with the clouding vision of a dying man."
                  "Ah, speak not thus, I conjure you," passionately entreated Mrs. Huntly. "You are strong, you are well. Come in—let me look on you—I must behold your features."
                  She drew him forward with such energy, that he yielded to the impulse, arose and followed her into the lighted room. It was painful to see the eager gaze she rivited on the care-worn features of her consort. He made an effort to smile, and pointed to their son who was leaning over a book deeply absorbed in its contents.
                  "There is a fairer picture for your inspection," he said. "The lad seems an enthusiast in every thing he undertakes."
                  Edgar Huntly was a delicate youth of sixteen. He inherited the slight figure of his mother, with her transparent fairness of complexion, and brown hair; but the dark, penetrating eye, the aqueline nose, and expressive mouth, were those of his father. It was a deeply-interesting face to an observer, for it indicated power and strong will, combined with great tenderness of feeling.
                  Idolized as he was by her, the mother scarcely glanced at him now; for her eager gaze was seeking a contradiction of her husband's gloomy forebodings in his sallow and wrinkled features. She fancied she could see that the gray hair had grown visibly white within the last few hours; and the sunken cheeks yet more cadaverous, and her heart grew cold within her.
                  "You are ill," she said in a repressed tone, "And you seek to conceal it from me."
                  "No, Dora, I am only heart-sick and weary; O, how weary of this never-ending struggle. 'Suffer and grow strong,' says the proverb; but my sufferings unnerve me. I am weaker than a child to-night."
                  Edgar Huntly heard the murmer of voices, and he aroused himself from the deep abstraction which an interesting book had occasioned, and turned toward his parents. He noted the agitated features of his mother, and quickly asked:
                  "Has any thing occurred to distress you, mother?"
                  "Nothing—nothing, my son," replied Mr. Huntley. "Return to your book, my boy, and rejoice that you can as yet permit the ideal to shut out the actual. It is the enviable power of those of your years—I would it were yet mine. Hark! there is the sound of horse's hoofs upon the road—Colonel Talbot has arrived. I must go forth to meet him."
                  He stepped hurriedly to a table on which a waiter with decanters of spirits stood, poured out a considerable quantity of brandy, and, after slightly diluting it, nervously swallowed the whole. As he issued from the door, he met Colonel Talbot, who had already dismounted and reached the house.
                  "Ha! my good friend, Huntly, I am glad to meet you once more. Given me up, hadn't you? No wonder, for I should have been here two hours since; but that good-for-nothing hag fell lame, and almost refused to travel at all for the last half dozen miles. Mrs. Huntly, your most obedient. Glad to see you looking so well, and Master Edgar, too. Ha! boy, I wish you were mine, for a fine, active fellow you are, and likely to prove an honor to all connected with you. But who knows? I may claim you as a son yet; for my pretty Agnes must be won by some one—why not by you?"
                  The boy blushed slightly, for he was very far from feeling sensitive on the score of his attachment to so little a girl as Agnes Talbot. Like most boys of his age, he aspired to a lady-love much older than himself, and if his heart could have been peeped into, Colonel Talbot would have found enshrined there the image of a dashing belle of twenty-five, who sometimes visited his mother; therefore, the idea of a child of eleven, was rather ridiculous to his imagination.
                  
                  "Thank you, sir, for your good opinion," he gracefully said: "But I am afraid I shal never be worthy of Agnes."
                  "No," said his father, with greater sternness than seemed to be called for, "the boy will never be your son, Talbot. Thank God, he at least belongs to me, and your daughter can aspire to a greater match than Edgar Huntly is ever likely to prove."
                  "I wish for no better myself, if the maturity of your son equals his present promise. But do not let us dispute over such nonsense now, for I assure you I am famishing. I could procure but a miserable dinner on the road, and I have traveled over thirty miles to-day."
                  Mrs. Huntly immediately ordered supper to be served, and while discussing it, Colonel Talbot conversed with his usual ease and elegance. He would not remark the abstracted air of his host, nor the scarcely repressed tears that dimmed Mrs. Huntly's eyes more than once during the progress of the meal. That his presence was unwelcome he felt, but he would not betray his consciousness of it. He had come there for a purpose, and he was steeled to its execution, cost what it might to those who received him.
                  The conversation was principally carried on by himself and Edgar, who showed an extent of information, and a readiness of illustration which astonished and delighted his listener. There was also a modest deference in hismanner which was peculiarly pleasing to a person of Colonel Talbot's imperious temper.
                  These observations but added strength to the determination which was already fully matured in his own mind. Nothing, however, was said of it on that night; as he was retiring, he requested an early interview with his relunctant host on the following morning, as he had something of importance to communicate to him.
                  "I have promised to breakfast in Frankfort, at eight, with Miller," he added, "and I hope to have your company, also, as the business I have to propose will require your presence."
                  Mr. Huntly muttered some inaudible words in reply, and his wife saw that a deathlike pallor overspread his features, and he grasped the back of a chair to sustain himself. That night he slept not—he paced the floor of his apartment during the long hours, while he whose presence caused this bitter anguish, lay in a deep and refreshing slumber.
                  Mrs. Huntly dared not endeavor to soothe his sufferings, for past experience had taught her that, when her husband was in such a mood, he brooked not interference even from her; and she had learned to fear, almost as much as she loved him. Confined to his own breast was the cause of his sorrow, and in that narrow pent house it wrestled with the strong man, until he felt that the struggle was becoming too much for him; and prayer, which for years had been a stranger to his lips, arose, on the stillness of night, for pardon and rest to his overwrought spirit. Toward dawn, he laid down, and, from exhaustion, fell into a slight slumber; but the phantoms which had haunted him while awake, still pursued him, and after an hour of unrefreshing dreams, he awoke again to the consciousness of the interview which awaited him with Colonel Talbot.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  THE morning was cool and clear, and while the mist yet lingered in the valley, Mr. Huntly heard his guest come forth from his chamber, and inquire for himself. He immediately joined him, and, without exchanging a word, the two walked together toward a spot which had often witnessed their interviews before. This was a high bluff, rising abruptly from the termination of the garden, and ending in a rocky platform, near which grew a few stunted cedars. This point commanded a view in every direction, and no intrusive listener could approach without being discovered by those upon the eminence. Several rude seats had been erected here, and on one of them Colonel Talbot threw himself in an indolent attitude, while Mr. Huntly remained standing within a few feet of him. After a slight pause, he abruptly said:
                  "Now we are alone, and secure from interruption ruption, tell me at once, and without circumlocution, what new imposition you have come to practice upon me? What new abuse of your power you have resolved on? Speak! I have nerved myself for the worst you can do."
                  Talbot gazed on him as if he were some curious phenomenon which it would be well to study. He could not comprehend the depth of passionate anguish he had aroused; for his own nature was too cold to understand violent emotion; his own soul too hardened in iniquity to comprehend the humiliation of that haughty spirit which writhed to feel itself so fatally in his power.
                  "'Fore George Huntly, you take things too seriously. Why do you not follow my example? We can live but once, and I intend to play the comedy out bravely to the end; but you turn the whole into a tragedy of most fearful meaning."
                  "I have good cause," replied Huntly gloomily. "I have grievously sinned, and God has stricken me."
                  "We all sin as to that matter. You have repented, and the preachers tell us that entitles us to forgiveness. You have lost your children, but better men lose theirs without viewing it as the judgment of Heaven. Your mind needs medicine, good friend."
                  "Friend!" repeated Huntly, bitterly, "Let us not waste words, Colonel Talbot. Tell me, I pray you, what business now brings you hither? I have not now to learn that you never seek me but when your own interests are to be served. I have heard of the recent losses you have sustained, and I expect some new demand, which you know I am powerless to refuse."
                  "Shrewdly guessed faith," replied Talbot, sneeringly; "though this time I do not wish to make a drain, on your hoarded means, in my own person."
                  "What, then, is your purpose?"
                  "Sit down, and listen calmly, and I will tell you."
                  Huntly mechanically placed himself upon a seat which faced the one occupied by Talbot, and fixed his piercing gaze upon him, with an expression of feverish earnestness which nearly unnerved even the hard man he had to deal with.
                  "It is nothing new to you, Huntly, when I tell you that I should, to-day, be pronounced insolvent if a settlement of my creditors were demanded; but you also know that no man better understands the means of deferring such a catastrophe than I do. So much by way of preface. Now, although I am supremely selfish—and I don't mind telling you so—I still have a very strong affection for my daughter. Do you not see—can you not comprehend the drift of my intentions?"
                  A dark purple hue overspread the features of Huntly, frightfully in contrast with his recent death-like pallor. After a pause, he slowly said:
                  "Coupling your remarks to my son, last night, with what you have just said, I have a vague suspicion of your true aim; yet I would sooner see my boy—"
                  "Stop!" exclaimed Colonel Talbot, in a tone of authority, "Remember the past—remember the power you yourself placed in my hands. Insult my young, pure child, by one objection, and it may not be as well with you as it has hitherto been."
                  He paused for a reply; but Huntly offered none. He merely relapsed into his former paleness; and the twitching of his lips, with the nervous motion of his fingers, alone evinced the violent emotion which wrestled within him. Colonel Talbot continued in an emphatic manner:
                  "When I die, my estate must pass into the possession of others. I have no means of preventing it. My wife will not, in all probability, survive me, but Agnes must be provided for, and a method of accomplishing that end has occurred to me."
                  "Name it," breathed, rather than uttered the agitated listener.
                  "Your son pleases me—he is a lad of uncommon promise, and my daughter already cherishes a childish affection for him. I permit you to retain the estate you have accumulated without making further claims upon it, if you will forthwith execute a deed providing that, when your son attains his twenty-third year, he shall unite himself in marriage with my daughter; or, in failure thereof, surrender to her the whole of the property you can justly claim as your own."
                  "And bequeath to you the same diabolical power over the son which you have so ruthlessly wielded over the father!" exclaimed Huntley, with violence. "Never—never—were your child as beautiful as an angel, as innocent as a cherub, she would still be yours, and that would render her a curse to me and mine. My son shall, at least, be a free man, if he take poverty as his heritage."
                  "You seem to forget that this last can be at his own option," replied Talbot, coldly. "Agnes inherits from her mother enough that is pure and loveable to attach even as fastidious a person as your son has such good right to be. Tush, Huntly—don't be a fool! Look at my proposal calmly, and see that it is best for all."
                  "I take Heaven to witness, I would sooner die than commit this deadly wrong against my only child. It is but giving up his future life to your guidance; for I feel that length of days will not be granted to me; and into worse hands his promising youth could not fall, as I know full well."
                  "There are some things more to be dreaded than an imaginary wrong," said Talbot, calmly. "If the boy himself were consulted, he would say that disgrace to his name were well averted by such a compromise. I warn you that the vail shall be lifted from the past, if my will is thwarted in this matter. Comply, and I pledge myself to destroy the proofs of your delinquency. I never more will taunt you with the——"
                  "Forbear—speak it not, unless you wish to tempt me to hurl you from the spot on which you stand. The memory of it has sapped the life from my body—has turned my blood into ice—it has brought coldness, desolation, almost disunion to my domestic hearth. It has humiliated me to the dust, and will end by laying me in my grave, before half my days should have been numbered. And now the crowning treachery of my life is demanded—to disinherit my own child in favor of yours—to give to more than alien blood the independence I have labored so hardly to attain. Yet my God—my God, my own guilt deprives me of the power to refuse this iniquitous demand."
                  He strode to and fro on the narrow platform, in an agony of emotion. Talbot waited patiently until the paroxysm of passion had exhausted itself, and then said:
                  "In the future, your son may possibly think this the most fortunate circumstance of his life. My daughter will be very lovely—she will be good; for she resembles her mother."
                  "No—no—he never will love her," interrupted the father, speaking as if weakened by the violent conflict raging in his bosom "She will be quiet, sensitive, and affectionate—you see I can be just to her, though she is yours—but these qualities will never command the love of such a soul as I read in Edgar. He must be profoundly moved—deeply touched; and such a woman as Agnes will make, can never touch the innermost cords of his being. There will be no point of congeniality between them."
                  "Pooh! sentimental nonsense! I did not expect such language from you, Huntly. Beauty, elegance, youth, and, above all, fortune, will be too great a combination to resist Understand me, once for all, I will it to be so and it shall be."
                  Mr. Huntly covered his face with his hands and remained many moments quite silent His prematurely whitened hair had escaped from his hat, and hung in wild locks over his worn brow—his bowed figure expressed such depression, such desolation of soul, that even Talbot was touched as he gazed on him; but he did not waver from his purpose—that was immutable as fate itself.
                  At length the broken-down man arose slowly, and, after gazing around, as if slightly bewildered, he passed his hand over his brown and spoke with a quietness which renders his words doubly impressive.
                  "It must be so. This fair heritage which I have toiled to acquire, in the hope that I should transmit it to my own offspring, may become the prey to others; for my son will never wed your daughter. I feel it—I know it—the wealth will be hers; but it will never repay her for the evil it will bring with it and should the transaction of this hour ever become known to my son, I bid you beware. He loves—he reverences his father, and the vengeance I can not take will be as a sacred bequest to him."
                  "You forget that with it must also come a knowledge of your own delinquency, which must effectually destroy that affectionate respect which you hope will prompt him to turn against one who intends to be his best friend. To tell you the truth, I do not think you are long for this world, and it is dreadful, even to a sinner like me, to see you so ill-prepared for so great a change."
                  A lightning flash of scorn, anger, and bitter disdain, blazed from the black eyes of the tortured man, and he raised his arm menacingly, but instantly dropped it again, murmuring:
                  "Why—why should I recoil from the truth, although it comes from such false and base lips? I know that I am dying slowly; and this fiend, like Job's advisers, wishes me 'to curse God and die;' but I will not—I will be calm. Come," he continued, "the sun has risen; let us return to the house. I can not accompany you to Miller's to breakfast, for I am far from well. Before you leave, I can give you a rough draft of the instrument which is necessary to be executed. Bring it with you this afternoon, and I will sign it. In return, I shall demand of you the proofs of—of—"
                  "I understand you. It will be better to place both packages in the hands of Miller for safe-keeping. When the will is proved, the papers you refer to can be destroyed."
                  "And I must die with this uncertainty resting upon the future," retorted Huntly, bitterly. "Yet, should you permit this secret to transpire, it seems to me even the grave could not hold my ashes in peace. Swear—swear to me that my son shall never know the sin I so recklessly committed."
                  "I do swear it; and now let us go. We have had excitement enough for one morning, and I am beginning to weary of it."
                  The two descended the winding pathway into the garden, and Colonel Talbot insisted on following his host. In the state of mind Huntly was then in, he knew not what thought of desperation might prompt him to hurl him against the ledges of rock which guarded one side of the pathway, while on the other, was a considerable precipice, down which a fall would surely be fatal.
                  They soon reached the house; Talbot's horse was ordered, and, after receiving the promised schedule, the two parted—the one with triumph in his heart, the other so wretched, so debased in his own estimation, that he felt as if the very sunlight were a reproach to him.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  MR. HUNTLY remained in his own apartment during the morning, and even his wife dared not intrude upon him. She knew that he suffered, but the cause was unknown to her, and vague phantoms of dark omens haunted her troubled mind. The knowledge of the worst could have been more easily borne, than the consciousness of a cause of disunion between herself and her husband which she could not fathom, and in which he repelled her sympathy.
                  Quiet, amiable, and yielding, she had endured the caprices of an uncertain temper, and wounded spirit, until her husband seemed to forget, at times, that her feelings were not utterly hardened, and estranged, by his want of consideration. Absorbed by his own struggles, he thought not of the heart silently withering beneath such blighting influences. The recent loss of two promising children, had, for a time, drawn them nearer to each other; but again the chilling gulf of dissevered feeling opened between them—there was not perfect confidence; and both felt that the pure sunshine of affection was forever dimmed.
                  The mother turned, for consolation, to her last remaining child, and there she was met with a tenderness—a warmth of affection which came as a sweet promise to her sinking heart. In the wide waste of existence, one spot remained fresh and bright—one heart, at least, held her as dearest, in its strong capacity to love.
                  
                  Impetuous, ardent, and highly-gifted, Edgar Huntly promised, in the full development of his fine talents, to become a noble and high-spirited man. Generous to a fault—detesting meanness—impulsive, yet easily influenced by one he loved, his was a character to be watched over with intense interest by those to whom he was most dear: to be guarded from evil contact as far as possible; and the mother shrank with a cold thrill from the vague fear that Colonel Talbot was endeavoring to gain control over the future fate of her son. Mrs. Huntly had painful cause to mistrust him, and the thought that he should ever establish an influence over the plastic mind of her idolized boy, was full of terror to her.
                  That he had been the evil genius of her husband, she well knew; though she could not fathom the cause of his mysterious power over him.
                  She sat in her morning room, listening to the heavy steps of her husband above; her work lay idly on her lap; a half-open book was on the stand beside her, in whose pages she had vainly endeavored to interest her mind; and she looked forth on the landscape bathed in the bright sunshine, in utter unconsciousness of what was before her.
                  Her son, flushed with exercise, and sparkling with animation, entered the room, carrying his gun in his hand; but even his beloved step had not power to arouse her from the painful reverie into which she had fallen. He stood beside her chair, and placed his hand upon her shoulder, before she was aware of his presence.
                  "What is it, mother?" he asked with sudden seriousness. "You seem even graver, and more occupied with sorrowful thought, than usual."
                  A smile, so sweet, so full of affection, beamed on him, that it seemed almost joyful.
                  "I have no new cause of grief, my dear boy: let that satisfy you. You look almost radiant in health this morning, and it makes my heart glad to see you losing the recent delicacy of your appearance."
                  "Oh, I am strong and active as the wild deer of the forest, mother. I have been out with old Sambo, shooting at a mark, and I am so skillful that he declares I shall soon become quite a Kentucky sharpshooter, as unrivalled as those old fellows who first came into the heart of the dark and bloody ground, and forced the Indians to recede before them."
                  "Sambo is a good master in such exercises; but he is a strangely superstitious old creature, and believes firmly that he can look into the future."
                  "An' who for say I can't?" said a hoarse voice at the open window. "Not de missy; for she know what I tell her when she 'bout to marry massa Huntly, and wasn't it de God's trufe, madam, I tole you dat time?"
                  Mrs. Huntly started nervously, and looked toward the hoary headed negro who seemed to be in the last stage of existence, although his eye was bright and sparkling, and its sight evidently undimmed by age, and his form unbent by the weight of the years which rested on it. He was leaning on the sill of the window, within a few feet of his mistress, with the privilege of an old and highly-estimated servant. Mrs. Huntley made an effort to smile, as she replied:
                  "It was simply a lucky guess, Sambo; or, rather, as it has proved for me, an unlucky one; for I have known as much sorrow as you foretold: that, however, may safely be predicted to all human beings; for the Bible truly says, 'We are born to sorrow as the sparks fly upward.'"
                  The negro shook his head, and he was evidently displeased that his skill in divination should be held so lightly.
                  "You no believe what de ole nigger say; but never mine—I tell you dis, my missy, I ha' looked into the hand o' de boy, an' I see what tell Sambo to make him one dead shot. Dere is blood in his line o' life; but he will know how to defen' himself."
                  Edgar laughed aloud.
                  "Yes, Sambo, I shall probably fight the enemies of my country. We are a warlike people, and are always kicking up a row with some of our neighbors, and, in the melee, I may come to distinction yet. Who knows what his fate is to be?"
                  "Dat not my meanin', massa Edgar; but let it pass—let it pass. You will be 'pared to meet de danger when it comes, and dat be nuff for ole Sambo;" and, highly offended, he walked off in the direction of his own domicil.
                  "Mother," asked the youth seriously, "Do you believe Sambo can really predict any hing true? He has been foretelling to me the wildest destiny—warning me of evils which menace my future."
                  "My son, God sends trials to us all, that we may come from them pure as gold from the refiners' crucible. Every fate has temptations to struggle against; misfortunes to baffle, and much sorrow to endure; therefore, no reader of the future can fail in predicting that which surely comes to all. Sambo is a superstitious old negro, therefore take no heed of his idle talk. Remember that truth, integrity, and stability of purpose, can enable us to render the lot we have to endure at least that of contentment."
                  "I will endeavor to remember it, mother, for I must atone to you for all the unmerited sufferings which you have been called on to endure."
                  "He who sent them knew that I did need them, my son, or they would have been withheld. I confide in His mercy, and I find consolation; eventually, I shall find peace."
                  Edgar placed his arms reverently around his mother, and tenderly kissed her.
                  The dinner nour passed, and yet Mr. Huntly refused to leave his room He ordered strong coffee to be sent to him, and when Mrs. Huntly entered the room with it herself, she found him employed him in burning papers. His secretary was open, and all its contents seemed torn out, while the fragments of charred paper which lay beside the taper, shewed that he had already destroyed many sheets.
                  He looked up with a faint smile as he caught the expression of his wife's face, and said:
                  "I am setting my house in order, Dora. Such, you know, is the command of Scripture. We know not what a day may bring forth, and there was much packed away there, that would only have given my executors useless trouble."
                  "You pain me deeply," said his wife. "Has the loss of our children so disgusted you with life, that you have no value for what is still left to you? You have one noble child spared to you, and I—I—am I of no worth, in summing up all that may yet render existence endurable to you? Arouse yourself from this despondent mood, and live long to bless those who love you."
                  "God's will is immutable, Dora," he sadly replied. "Many laugh at presentiments, and in the hey-day of health and enjoyment, I have often done so too; but now I can not shake off the weakness which clouds my mind, and casts a dark shadow upon it, as of the approach of the night of Death. Give me your hand, Dora. I have often been harsh, inconsiderate, and, I fear, at times tyrannical; but I have ever preferred you before all others; always have appreciated your gentle and feminine character at its true value. Remember me kindly, Dora, and should any thing happen to me, heed my last charge in reference to my son: guard him from the insidious influence of Talbot. Whatever may be your future relations, keep Edgar aloof from him and all connected with him, until the boy's character is formed, and he is capable of judging fairly and dispassionately of the choice he may be called on to make between—yet, no—not yet—not yet must that be revealed. I would spare you yet a little while the fatal knowledge of that—"
                  The tread of a horse was heard without, and he stopped suddenly.
                  "Hark! there is Talbot again. Go down Dora, and receive him. In half an hour let him come up. We have business of importance to transact, which must be completed before sunset."
                  "And when shall this promised revelation be made?" asked his wife, softly.
                  He knit his brows, and after a pause said, with stern emphasis,
                  "When it can no longer be withheld. When I feel the chilling grasp of death upon my heart, I will leave it as a legacy of bitterness, which I would gladly have spared you, if I dared do so. Go—go—I hear Talbot's voice below. He must not enter here just, now. Give me time to clear away these evidences of my morning's employment."
                  When Mrs. Huntly descended, she found Talbot engaged in conversation with her son, and prejudiced against him as she was, she could not withhold her admiration of the tact with which he adapted himself to the society of the youth. The tastes and fancies of Edgar seemed perfectly known to him, and he skillfully chose such topics as would draw him cut, and enable him to converse on an equality with his mature friend. Before the half hour had expired, Edgar was more fascinated than ever with Colonel Talbot, for his suavity of manner and graceful address had always exercised much sway over him.
                  When the artful man of the world was summoned to his father, Edgar eagerly expressed his admiration of his many agreeable qualities, and ended by saying,
                  "I should really like to be the son of so elegant a man; and if that little shy Agnes had more life in her, I could look forward to the time when I might become so. But that little pale, waxen child, will never be my ideal of a wife."
                  "Pray what is your fancy on that subject?" asked his mother, making an effort to smile.
                  "O, a being with sprightliness, vivacity, and grace; and—yes, very black eyes—I like flashing glances. Blue eyes may do for those who prefer them, but for me, I like something striking—something noble. Such a face as I fancy Joan of Arc's must have been."
                  "Such a person as Miss Stevents, for instance," replied his mother. "Only she is ten years too old for you. However, you are too young to think of such things yet a while, my dear boy."
                  Edgar turned away with a conscious blush; for Miss Stevens was the dashing belle who had captivated his young affections, but in his wildest dreams he never thought of breathing into her ear a word of the boyish love which he cherished for her magnificent person.
                  In the meantime Colonel Talbot entered the room of Mr. Huntly. Every thing was re-arranged, and no vestige remained of the employment of the day. He motioned his unwelcome guest to a seat, and then said:
                  "You have the—the will with you, of course. Let me see it at once."
                  Talbot drew forth a parchment and presented it to him. With trembling hands, Huntly grasped it, and eagerly glanced over it.
                  After a long pause, he said,
                  "You have taken every care that its provisions shall not be evaded; but there is one subject, Talbot, on which I must speak."
                  "Go on—I listen."
                  "My son shall not be left to your guardianship. No power on earth shall force me to that. I shall appoint two of my neighbors, in whom I have perfect confidence, as my executors; and to his mother shall be left the control of my boy. When Edgar reaches that age which gives him the control of his own actions, he must learn the provisions of my will, and I leave it to his own decision, then, to seek your daughter, or relinquish his estate."
                  "Do you not think it will be better to permit the two who are destined for each other, to pass at least a portion of their time together, that an attachment may grow up between them?" asked Talbot, in a tone of vexation.
                  "And suffer you to wind your spells around his unsuspicious soul, as you once did around mine?" said Huntly, with bitter scorn. "No, no—the boy is too candid—too noble, to be placed under such tutelage. Besides, experience shows that parties reared together, rarely fall in love with each other. If you really wish him to wed your daughter, it will be best to educate them separately. I tell you, I will risk exposure, disgrace, anything, sooner than permit him to be placed beneath your influence, before he reaches his majority."
                  "Be it so, then," replied Talbot, haughtily.
                  "Miller will be here immediately. On his arrival the deed can be signed."
                  Even as he spoke, a gentleman alighted at the gate, and in a few moments was ushered into the room in which the two sat. Mr. Miller was a small, withered-looking man, who appeared as hard and wiry as if he had lived on the odor of musty parchment throughout the whole term of his life. The keen eyes of this person were instantly fixed on the wan features of Mr. Huntly, and an expression of surprise, unmingled, however, with sympathy, appeared on his features.
                  After the usual salutations had passed, the host said, abruptly,
                  "Let us proceed to business at once, gentlemen tlemen. I am not in a condition to talk much; and it seems to me expedient to finish this affair as soon as possible."
                  "Certainly—certainly," said the lawyer—quite right—'Take time by the forelock,' is an excellent maxim; though in my profession it does not seem to be appreciated as it should be."
                  The will was spread out on the table, and Mr. Miller took it up as if to read it.
                  "'Tis useless, sir," said Mr. Huntly; "its contents are known to us all. I simply desire you and Colonel Talbot to witness my signature to this document, which I wish to be established after my death in all its provisions, as my last will and testament."
                  "And your son, sir?" asked Miller. "Is he aware of the somewhat singular ——?"
                  "He is not sir," interrupted Huntly, sternly. "I have a right to dispose of my own without consulting a mere boy—"
                  "Certainly—of course—I merely suggested—"
                  "Never mind now what you suggested. I am not now in a state to listen to you. My head reels—my heart seems as if it will burst, Quick—give me the pen."
                  The two men saw with alarm that his recent livid paleness had been succeeded by a deep purple flush—all the blood in his body seemed surging toward his brain. Colonel Talbot sprang forward, and placed a pen in his hand, as he exclaimed:
                  "In another instant it will be too late."
                  Exerting wonderful self-control, Huntly grasped the pen, fixed his failing sight upon the paper, and, with tremulous fingers, signed his name for the last time.
                  "'Tis done," he muttered, and fell back in his chair in a fit.
                  "Remove the will," said Talbot, hurriedly, while I summon the family. It must not yet be seen."
                  Miller quickly obeyed, and then the wife and son were summoned to the assistance of the senseless man. We draw a vail over the scene which ensued. The dying man was conveyed to his bed, and a physician was soon beside him. He at once pronounced recovery hopeless.
                  "Can you not restore reason for one brief moment?" asked the pale wife. "I would give my own existence to exchange but a few sentences with him."
                  "I will use all my skill to effect that purpose, Madame, and I think he may recover sufficiently to know what is passing around him; even to speak collectedly."
                  "Thanks! oh Father!" murmured the deeply-tried wife, as she again turned to the inanimate form which lay so helpless before her; and earnest were the supplications which arose from that darkened room for his restoration to reason, even if it were only as the last flash of the expiring taper. She knew that some fearful secret weighed upon her husband's mind; and from his recent words to her, she fully comprehended that he considered it of the last importance to confide it to her before his death.
                  This mystery appalled her; for years it had encircled her life with coldness, gloom, and mistrust, and now at the dread portal of the grave, would the power to reveal it be denied? For many hours it seemed as such would be the decision of Fate; but as his breathing became easier, a slight moisture appeared upon his brow, and his pulse beat with a less heavy and tremulous throb.
                  On the third day from his seizure, he again unclosed his eyes, and looked intelligently upon the drooping form that watched beside him. She held his hand clasped in both her own, and she thought she felt a faint effort to press her fingers. She raised the palsied member to her lips, and wept upon it the tears of forgiveness—of unalienable love. He seemed deeply moved, and made an effort to speak, but his words were unintelligible. Vainly she bent her head to catch the fluttering whisper; vague and unconnected syllables were all she could hear; but his eyes remained fixed on hers with a soft and tender expression, which penetrated to her soul.
                  The physician came.
                  "Will he ever speak connectedly again?" asked Mrs. Huntley in a whisper. "There is something he wishes to say, that weighs upon his mind."
                  The Doctor looked at him attentively, and said:
                  "A strong will can sometimes triumph over the weakness of approaching death. It is possible he may have the power to utter what presses on his mind; but I warn you, Madam, it will be at the very latest moment of existence, and, with the effort, life will pass away."
                  Mrs. Huntly bowed her head, and sought composure and courage where alone they can be found in such extremity. Her son endeavored to sustain her, and together they watched over the waning life of the husband and father.
                  It was midnight; the lamp was screened so as to throw the bed in deep shadow. A window near it stood open, and through the budding foliage of spring the moon poured her beams into the death chamber. A few rays fell upon the figure of Mrs. Huntly, who sat in a large chair beside the bed. Edgar was on the opposite side, but the fatigue of long continued watching had overpowered his youthful faculties, and, with his head resting on the coverlet, he slept.
                  The sad vigil of the wife was suddenly interrupted by a strange hollow voice which had lost the power of modulating itself, pronouncing her name. She started up and leaned over her husband.
                  "Dora—I—leave—you," he uttered at intervals. "Do—not—rouse—the boy. I have—something—to say—to you—you alone. Pardon me for my coldness—my sternness—I have suffered—O, how deeply, no human heart can fathom. I have sinned, but it has been bitterly punished."
                  After a fearful pause, he resumed:
                  "My will is made, Dora. Do not dispute its strange provisions. I charge you on your faith to me, your love for me, to let them stand. My mind was clear when it was executed. Now bend down close—close. Let me whisper a dread secret in your ear, which—which has nearly maddened me."
                  Suddenly his palsied hand grasped her arm with iron force, drew her ear to his lips, and whispered a few words which seemed to startle life from her feeble and overtasked frame. She sank down upon his breast quite insensible. The faint cry she uttered as she understood the sense of those terrible words, roused Edgar from his slumbers, and he started up, and hurried to the side of his parents.
                  Mrs. Huntly remained long insensible, and, on examining the sick man, it was found that, with his last words, life had been extinguished in the darkness of death. Joy and sorrow were now alike to him.
                  A long and tedious illness to the widow followed the excitement of that night. She never spoke of the last interview with her husband; never mentioned the name of the departed even to her son; but a deeper expression of sadness overshadowed her face, and when she arose from her couch and again went forth to fulfill the ordinary duties of life, a marble paleness had settled on her features which never varied under any emotion.
                  The will was proved without any opposition on the part of Mrs. Huntly; the world around wondered at its singular tenor, but soon forgot all ahout it, in some newer topic of interest. A letter was found among the papers of Mr. Huntley, containing instructions for the course of his son until he completed his twenty-first year. He wished him to be educated at the Virginia University, and to remain entirely under the control of his mother.
                  Mrs. Huntley at once made her arrangements to accompany him, and, within a few months after her husband's death, the mother and son set out for Virginia.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VIII.
                  MANY weeks elapsed before Mrs. Mildmay received a reply from Colonel Talbot. When she had resigned the hope of hearing from him at all, his answer came. It contained the following words:
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              MADAM,—Yours, in reference to my young relative, Florence Elliot, came duly to hand, and should have been responded to before; but business of great importance to myself occupied my time to the exclusion of every thing else.
                              I would willingly have received Miss Elliot beneath my roof as a companion to my own daughter, and have treated her, in every respect, as my child; but since she declines the proffered home, I am quite as well, if not better satisfied that she remains an alien to me and mine. The past relations existing between her parents and myself render it an act almost of virtue in me to be willing to look on their offspring, much less to adopt her into my family; but considering her helpless and dependent condition, I was willing to waive all those objections and receive her.
                              She has probably informed you that I persecuted her father—that I ruined him, when, in reality, the desire to injure me, on his part—his own wrongheaded pursuit of what he legally had no claims on, consummated his ruin. A law suit existed between us for years, for property, mutually bequeathed to his wife and myself on certain conditions. She failed in what was required of her, and the whole estate came to me as the testator had desired. The suit was brought—a decision was given in my favor, and, as a natural consequence, my opponent, who was poor, was ruined. Can I be held responsible for that? Assuredly not, by any man in his sane mind.
                              I know not what this girl may have told you; but from all I have heretofore known of her, I do not fancy that she wfll be very scrupulous on the score of truth; but I assure you that from me her father suffered no wrong, unless it is considered wrong to contend for one's just rights. Miss Elliot's refusal to accept my bounty, exonerates me from all further responsibility as to her future fate; and, hoping you may not have cause to regret your own liberality to her, I remain
                              
                                 Yours, respectfully,
                                 W. TALBOT.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  Florence had watched for the arrival of this letter, and she insisted on seeing its contents. Great was Mrs. Mildmay's regret that she suffered her to read it, for its perusal was followed by a wild burst of passionate anger, which apalled her.
                  "He does not even scruple to traduce the dead," she said with flashing eyes. "What he says of myself, I care not for; but those I love shall never be thus spoken of with impunity."
                  "What can you do my child?" asked her friend mildly. "Women must bear with wrong; they cannot redress it. Your relation seems to be a hard man of the world, and as such, you must leave him to his own devices. Forget the contents of this epistle, and leave Col. Talbot to the justice of Heaven. If he has wronged the orphan, God will punish him in his own good time."
                  "God works by means," muttered the girl, "and I will not forget the vow made beside the corse of my father. No—I renew it—I clasp it to my breast as the cherished purpose of my life. Of what worth am I, but to fulfil my oath?"
                  Her words were inaudible to Mrs. Mildmay, but she saw from the working of her expressive features, that some strong and stern emotion was wrestling in her breast. She folded her arms tenderly around her, and said:
                  "My dear girl, do not force me to regret the arrival of this odious letter. You have done so well of late, that I look forward to much pleasure in our future intercourse."
                  Florence withdrew herself from her embrace.
                  "I am no longer what I was an hour ago," she said gloomily, "I would have forgotten a sacred duty, and learned to be amiable; to resemble you perhaps; but training cannot accomplish everything. The evil is within me; it prompts me to encourage a strong wish for vengeance on that heartles and cruel man, whose oppression certainly caused the untimely death of all I loved. Henceforth it is my will to encourage the evil. I will seek forever for the means and in time they must be found."
                  "Poor child," said her weeping friend. "What can I do to bring back softness to your heart? Pray earnestly, Florence, to have these terrible feelings pass from your mind, or they will result in your aim."
                  "I care not," repled the orphan with curling lip, "let me first bring destruction on the traducer of my parents, and I am willing to perish in his fall."
                  All Mrs. Mildmay's expostulations had no effect. From that day, the dark and brooding spirit resumed its sway over the uphappy orphan. Yet when she emerged from her gloom, as, at intervals one so young must do, she was irresistibly fascinating. There was a grace in her aglie figure; a wild charm in her dark eyes, an ever-varying expression, which arrested the most careless glance. She had truly said that she was beautiful; she possessed beauty of the rarest, highest order, for it expressed intellectual power as well as elegance, and Florence gloried in the conviction of her own charms. She gazed upon the reflection of her own image with savage pleasure. She sought to cultivate every art which could lend a deeper spell to her attractions, and she often murmured:
                  "I shall be loved wildly—madly—by some enthusiastic heart, and he will think no price too great to pay for my affections. Thus the deed my woman's hand would shrink from committing, will be performed by another, and that dark vindictive spirit meet its just reward."
                  Florence was fifteen, and she had truly said of herself, that she was no longer a child. The ordeal she had passed through within the two fast years of her life, had matured her mind, and sharpened her intellect, and she felt herself the superior of many much more advanced in years. She exulted in this.
                  "Intellect is power," she often repeated, and holding one vindictive purpose ever before her, she resolved to use every means to place herself in a position to insure its fulfillment. She withdrew herself as much as possible from the influence of her protectress, for she no longer desired to resemble her. A morbid wish to acquire the means of crushing him who had destroyed her family by the slow tortures of poverty and hopelessness, took possession of her mind.
                  She reviewed her true position again, and again; and felt how powerless she was to accomplish her aim, but that did not induce her to abandon it; she clung to it, with that tenacity which is the characteristic of a powerful will; and the conviction was in her mind, that she should yet find the means. A temperament so impetuous and undisciplined, could not be amiable in every day intercourse oflife, and often did the children shrink from the angry glance and bitter word; but when "the sun was shining on her soul," as she herself expressed her bright days, she was so kind, so bewitching in her playfulness, that they clung to her and lavished their young affections on her within stint. When she was gloomy, they soon learned to give her a wide berth; for once in a moment of ungovernable irritation, she had shaken Esther, until the breath had nearly left her body. This unexpected discipline frightened George so heartily, that he was never afterward tempted to exercise his love of teasing on her, when her countenance was overcast. Florence was very repentant, the moment after the indignity had been consumated, and poor Esther, the gentlest of children, never informed her mother of the circumstance.
                  The orphan girl often regarded these children almost with envy, for they were lovely both in person and character. The mild precepts, and judicious training of their parents, had developed their finer traits, and in their forbearance, their love of truth, and their childish evidences of benevolence, they strongly resembled their excellent parents.
                  "If I were only like them," Florence would often think—then the bitter experience of a portion of her childhood came back to her memory, and she felt that it was too late to endeavor to render herself like those charming little ones, whose happy spirits made glad music in the parental home.
                  One evening Mrs. Flint came, with several other ladies, to visit Mrs. Mildmay. Among them was a widowed and childless aunt of Mrs. Flint; a woman verging on her sixtieth year, who was rich, eccentric, and easily attracted toward those that amused her. Mrs. Mildmay was a great favorite with Mrs. Ilston, who was herself a quiet woman, with only one passion. This was a great fondness for theatrical performances, and dramatic talent always enlisted her kindly feelings in favor of its possessor.
                  Mrs. Ilston accidentally heard of Florence Elliot, her remarkable beauty, and uncommon talent for declamation, and at her earnest desire, Mrs. Flint had made the engagement to spend the evening at Mrs. Mildmay's, that Mrs. Ilston might have an opportunity of seeing the charity girl, as Mrs. Flint persisted in calling her. If she had dreamed of the consequences to flow from that meeting, she would have been far from promoting it.
                  Florence disliked Mrs. Flint, particularly, and asked as a special favor, that she should not be summoned into the parlor during the evening. Although scarcely old enough to be introduced into society, her musical talent and fine voice had caused it to become almost a matter of course, that, when company came, she should be called on to contribute to their entertainment; and Mildmay's lovely protegé was already known and spoken of, as one of the most remarkable girls of her age, in the city in which she resided.
                  Tea was over, and still Miss Elliot did not appear. Mrs. Ilston looked disappointed, and her niece at last asked—
                  "Where is your young friend this evening, Mrs. Mildmay?" My aunt hoped to see her. I have been telling her of her wonderful talent for the stage."
                  "Ah! yes," said Mrs. Ilston. "I adore dramatic talent. I have seen Cooper, Booth, Kena, and all the stars; but I am told that this young girl is something uncommon, both in the ways of genius and beauty. Does she think of going on the stage?"
                  "O, no, madam! Heaven forbid that such should be her fate. I regard her as my daughter, and as such, hope to provide for her in the future. She is such a child in years, that I do not like to bring her forward yet, but if you wish to see her, I will send for her, and ask her to give a specimen of her talent."
                  "Do—I shall be delighted."
                  A summons was forthwith despatched for Florence, who was not in one of her sunny moods, and she sent back an excuse. Mrs. Ilston looked so much disappointed, that Mrs. Mildmay felt annoyed, and arose to seek her herself.
                  "Pretty airs for a beggar to give herself," muttered Mrs. Flint; but Mrs. Ilston said—
                  "I like the girl's independence. She shows she has genius by acting with spirit."
                  "Pooh, it is nothing but ill-temper! I'll not deny that the girl has talent, but these good people don't understand her, and they spoil her entirely too much."
                  In the meantime Mrs. Mildmay reached the nursery, in which Florence was seated busily sewing, while Esther read aloud a child's book which interested them both. Mrs. Mildmay looked displeased.
                  "Florence, why did you compel me to come for you? When I desire your presence in the parlor, it should be sufficient. You must not agatn refuse to come down, or I shall be offended.
                  The face of the orphan flushed, and she bit her lip until the blood almost sprang from it.
                  "It is a pennance to me to be in the same room with Mrs. Flint. She is so hard—so insulting. I could not think you really desired me to come."
                  "It is not for her gratification, Florence; but for that of a very clever good woman, who may become a kind friend to you, my child. Mrs. Ilston particularly wishes to see you."
                  "O, Flory, she is very rich, and has no children!" exclaimed Esther, laughing. "You had better play the amiable to her, for she may take it into her head to adopt you, and then what a fine heiress you would be."
                  "I trust Florence is too happy with us, my daughter, to wish for such an event; but without any interested motive, I hope she is willing to contribute to the happiness of an old lady, who has not many sources of enjoyment, in spite of her wealth."
                  Florence looked keenly at the two, as they spoke, and she arose with alacrity.
                  "I will do my best, madam."
                  After smoothing her redemdant ringlets, she followed her protectress into the drawing-room, with many strange thoughts in her young mind. The words of Esther had opened a new world to her, and for the first time a mercenary feeling arose in her soul, mingled with a strong desire to mortify and disappoint Mrs. Flint in her cherished expectations. If she could make a favorable impression on this strange lady, and exchange the protection of the good, but not wealthy Mildmay's, for that of Mrs. Ilston, one step in her forward progress would be gained. Once established beneath her roof, she felt within herself the power to wind herself into the affections of her patroness, until she had established unlimited limited influence over her. She could then use that power for the furtherance of her own views.
                  Such were the vague fancies floating in her mind when she presented herself at the drawing room door, and bowed and smiled with charming grace to the ladies assembled there. Mrs. Ilston audibly expressed her admiration and as if attracted toward her at once, Florence moved to her side, and sat down on an ottoman.
                  "I am told that you are quite a little actress, my dear," said the old lady.
                  "O, no, madame, I do not aspire to any thing of that sort. I can only declaim such passages from the poets as please my own fancy."
                  "Who taught you, my dear?"
                  A slight paleness passed over the orphan's features, for it was always painful to her to speak of those she had lost.
                  "My father, madam. He was a man of varied accomplishments, and took much pleasure in instructing his children."
                  "And where are the others? you spoke of children."
                  "Dead—all dead," whispered the choking voice.
                  Mrs. Ilston was deeply touched and interested. She regretted having struck so painful a cord, and pressing the hand of the young girl, she said—
                  "Never mind now, dear. I did not think a moment, or I would not have asked you such a question. I am fond of music; I wish you would play for me—and sing—I am sure your voice must be charming."
                  Florence was grateful to her for her kindness. She sat down to the piano, and played and sang in her most skillful manner. She then declaimed several poems so touchingly, that Mrs. Ilston shed tears. The orphan girl was the wonder of the evening, and her own vanity was gratified by the plaudits bestowed on her by all save Mrs. Flint. She was stiff and proud as ever, and deigned no word of approbation. Flerence heard her say:
                  "It is a pity she should not be educated for the stage. It is all she will ever be good for."
                  "But it must be a dreadful life for a woman to embrace," replied the lady to whom she spoke.
                  "It is good enough for such as she is," was the scornful reply. "Do you not know that Mrs. Mildmay took her from a state of utter destitution, and she has not a friend in the world to take care of her?"
                  "Ah! Mrs. Iceburg," thought Florence as she listened with burning cheek and compressed lips: "I will circumvent your plans for this. Girl as I am, you shall not insult me with impunity."
                  A strange power of fascination had the orphan, when she chose to exert it. She seemed inspired on this particular evening, and all her wiles were directed toward the fair elderly woman who smiled so sweetly on her, and called her my dear, in tones as soft and kind as those her mother once addressed to her. Vainly did Mrs. Flint endeavor to repress her advances toward her kinswoman. Florence tacitly defied her, and treated her with as little consideration as when in the delirium of fever, she had so deeply offended that lady. She made several efforts to leave at an early hour, but Mrs. Ilston declared herself better than usual, and quite able to remain until eleven o'clock at least.
                  It was quite evident that Florence had won the heart of the kind old lady, and Mrs. Flint emitted sparks of anger in the shape of ill-natured speeches, to the young girl, which failed to move the serenity of her manner; though in her soul she really was accumulating a bitter spring of hatred to this callous and selfish woman of the world, who trampled on her because she was poor and helpless.
                  The evening at last ended, and tenderly kissing Florence, Mrs. Ilston told her she would be delighted to have her come to her in the spring, in her country home, and spend as long a time with her as she could be happy. The orphan eagerly expressed her pleasure, and hoped she would be permitted to go to her. Mrs. Mildmay heard the invitation and reply, and immediately said:
                  "I am glad you are so much pleased with my young friend, Mrs. Ilston. I can part with her to go to you, for I think your society will be a mutual benefit to each other. When the spring opens, if you still wish it, Florence shall visit you, and remain as long as she and you desire her to stay."
                  "O thank you. I shall claim the fulfillment of this promise with great pleasure, I assure you."
                  At length Mrs. Flint succeeded in rescuing her relation from the fascinatious of Mrs. Mildmay, and her protegée and as she threw herself back in the carriage in a very ill humor, she exclaimed:
                  "Tiresome people! I am sure I am glad to get away."
                  "I am sorry you were not pleased;" replied Mrs. Ilston, quietly. "I have spent a delightful evening myself. Of late years, I have seldom been so much interested."
                  "Excuse me, aunt; but you are so accessible to flattery, that even the flimsy pretensions of this beggar girl, have imposed on you, because she directed all her efforts toward making an impression on you."
                  "You are more candid than polite, I must say;" returned the elder lady, with a degree of spirit her niece had not expected. "But it is not strange that this poor child thrown on he benevolence of the world, should respond to the voice of kindness. I showed that I felt for her, and she was grateful for it. I really think your treatment to her this evening was a disgrace to your sex—to your maternity."
                  "Upon my word, this is too much! Is this pauper to come between you and myself, and create dissensions? If your knew how disrespectfully she has treated me heretofore, you would not wonder that I am cold and harsh toward her."
                  Mrs. Flint forthwith recounted a voluble history of the enormities Florenee had been guilty of, while in the delirium of fever. Mrs. Ilston listened attentively, but she still retained her own impressions of the gifted being, who had that evening passed before her dazzled vision as a dream of loveliness and grace. She anticipated, with pleasure, the reception of Florence beneath her own roof, from which youth and joy had so long been banished. Possessing refinement and cultivation, she could appreciate all the natural and acquired superiority of the young girl. She thought that such a companion would be exactly suited to her, if she could only gain the consent of Mrs. Mildmay to give her up; and she fell asleep with a vision of the bright eyes of the orphan dimmed with tears, as she spoke of her father. Such evidences of sensibility disarmed Mrs. Flint's sarcasms, of all their bitterness; they only had the effect to induce Mrs. Ilston to defer her proposal to take entire charge of Florence, until she had paid the promised visit. In the privacy of domestic life, she could judge of her capacity to contribute to her happiness as a companion.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IX.
                  DURING Mrs. Ilston's stay in L——, she was a frequent visitor at Mr Mildmay's, and at each interview she became more warmly interested in the orphan. When she was present, Florence exhibited a power of self-control which greatly surprised her benefactress, and caused her to reflect deeply on the singular being who had been thrown on her protection. Good and evil seemed so accurately mingled in her, that it was difficult to tell which would predominate in the future.
                  That she silently repelled good influences, Mrs. Mildmay had long seen: that she nourished a bitter sense of wrong, she openly avowed; yet she was generous, winning, and, at times, irresistibly fascinating; but when the elfish spirit was aroused in her, all must bend before it. As Mrs. Mildmay more accurately judged of the relations likely to be established between Mrs. Ilston and her protegée, she regretted the visit she had permitted Florence to promise. Mrs. Ilston was amiable, but weak; and she saw that the imperious spirit of the young girl would easily establish an influence over her kindly feelings, which would lead to evil consequences to the orphan herself. By retaining her under her own care, she hoped gradually to win this rebellious and haughty spirit, to feel all the beauty of humbleness, meekness, and charity: to render her, in time, a high-principled and conscientious woman. She, therefore, deferred the promised visit from week to week, much to the chagrin of Florence, and the delight of Mrs. Flint.
                  Mrs. Ilston wrote, complaining of her solitnde, and Mrs. Mildmay replied to her letter in that spirit of frankness which she considered right. She stated her objections to the proposed visit as politely as possible, and requested that, for one more year, Mrs. Ilston would permit Florence to remain under her influence. Then, if she wished it, the orphan could become a resident beneath her roof, either as a visitor or an adopted daughter. One more year of the discipline to which she wished to subject her, would either develope those traits she most desired to cultivate, or entirely disappoint her in its results. In either case, Florence would then be at liberty to go from her, and she would feel as if the duty she owed to the unfortunate girl had been fulfilled.
                  Mrs. Ilston thought her conscience too tender, but acquiesced on the condition that Florence should correspond with her in the interim. Thsee letters became even more dangerous weapons against the interests of Mrs. Flint than her presence would have been. Florence possessed an affluence of thought and expression—a passionate eloquence, as rare as it was interesting; and her epistles to Mrs. Ilston were composed with as much care as if they were to have been read before the whole world. The old lady perused them with delight—was charmed with their elegance—with the affection they breathed for herself. She exhibited them to her friends, and talked her quiet country neighborhood into quite an enthusiastic admiration for this extraordinary girl.
                  Spring had blossomed into summer; and in all her studies Florence made rapid progress; but her inner being seemed yet insensible to the softening influences which were quietly brought to bear upon her. One thought of wrong seemed ever before her mental vision, and that single black drop turned her whole being to bitterness. She, one day, said to Esther:
                  "I am not amiable, I know. I am unfit to play the part of dependent. Why will not your mother let me go to Mrs. Ilston? I am but a plague to her, but I could be useful to that kind old lady, who lives almost alone."
                  Esther looked up from her work with a comic expression which always irritated Florence.
                  "Are you sure, Flory, that you really care for the old lady's loneliness, or for the eclat with which she could introduce you as her adopted daughter?"
                  Florence flushed crimson.
                  "I am, as yet, too young to be introduced in any character. I know not why you should utter such a taunt, but for the purpose of insulting me."
                  "Oh Flory, dear, you know that is not so. We have lived together now many, many months, and I allow you the privilege of saying what you please to me. Pray, may I not return the freedom myself, most mighty Princess?"
                  The little girl skipped from her chair, and made her a courtesy of mock respect, with mirth beaming from her arch face. Florence was really angry, and turned away. Esther approached her, and made several efforts to induce her to look on her. At length she threw her arms around her, and endeavored to turn her face toward her own; by this time, the spirit of evil had triumphed over all that was good in the passionate nature of the girl, and she cast Esther from her with violence.
                  The action was so unexpected, that the child could make no effort to save herself from the fall. Her slight figure offered no resistance to the angry impulse which threw her off, and she fell with violence against a square table, the corner of which struck her a violent blow upon the breast. She uttered no cry, for she fell senseless upon the floor; and when the frightened and remorseful girl raised her in her arms, blood gushed from her mouth.
                  Her wild screams soon brought the family around her, and it was with difficulty the alarmed mother learned what had caused the frightful accident. For one instant Florence was tempted to utter a falsehood, and say that Esther had accidentally fallen herself. She knew the generous child would not contradict her statement, if she ever awoke from the stunning effects of the blow sufficiently to do so; butfaulty as she was, Florence disdained an untruth. She mournfully replied:
                  "It was I, Madam, who caused her fall."
                  "You, and she is my child!"
                  Volumes of reproach could not have expressed more than these simple words, uttered with such emphasis.
                  "I did not mean to injure her, God knows I did not; but she teased me, and—and—O Mrs. Mildmay, I am unfit to be with children. I am so miserable a wretch, that I have no power to control my temper. My poor little Esther! I wish it had been I that met with the accident. Oh! I shall never forgive myself."
                  "Lamentations are useless now, Florence. The mischief is done—all you can now do, is to aid in repairing it. Assist me to place her on the bed. Go quickly for Dr. James," she said to a servant, "and bid him hurry hither as quickly as possible."
                  The mother, although terribly shocked and alarmed, saw that Florence endured anguish even greater than her own, and she was too just to refuse her the consolation of contributing to the restoration of the little girl. She permitted her to bathe her face—to chafe her cold hands, while she supported her head upon her own bosom. Before the arrival of the physician, faint signs of returning life began to appear, and, at length, Esther unclosed her eyes, looked up at her mother, and smiled faintly.
                  When she saw the pale face of Florence deluged with tears, she put out her hand, and whispered,
                  "You did not intend to hurt me, Flory—I know that; but I was not expecting you to throw me off so suddenly, or I could have caught myself. I am not so much hurt after all."
                  "My darling little angel, I was a brute to treat you so. I never can forgive myself—never. Oh this blood—this blood, that comes from your poor lips, will stain my soul forever! Oh I know 'tis only a prelude to that which is to follow—wretch—wretch that I am!"
                  "Florence—Florence," said Mrs. Mildmay, sternly, "control yourself. This is no time for wild lamentation. See, my poor child faints again. Oh girl—girl if it would be a lesson to you to bend that stubborn temper of yours to submission, even this trial might be borne."
                  "I dare not promise what I fear I never can perform," whispered the subdued girl. "You yourself would lose all respect for me, if, in this moment of anguish, I vowed to accomplish what I believe no power on earth can enable me to do. No—the fiery elements of my nature are too surely like the powder which explodes with a spark."
                  "If no earthly power can aid, a heavenly one can, but that you perversely reject."
                  While this conversation proceeded, Florence had actively continued her cares of the fainting child, and, just as the physician entered, she again spoke,
                  "Mamma, do not tell the Doctor that Flory hurt me. He would blame her so much."
                  "My sweet Esther, I do not wish to appear better than I am. It is the penance due to my crime to have it known," said the orphan, with that haughty bitterness which was one of her cherished faults. She did not like the family physician because he had treated her rudely, on one occasion, and she shrank from the idea of concealment from one for whom she cherished a contemptuous antipathy. His good opinion was of no consequence to her, why then should she seek to retain it, at the expense of the whole truth?
                  Dr. James was a rough, good-natured man, very skillful in his profession, and really kind-hearted; but he was careless of the observances of society, and was quite unconscious of the offense he had given to the irritable sensibility of the young girl. He examined the child, looked serious, and asked how the accident happened.
                  "I fell against the corner of the table," replied Esther.
                  "With no other impulse than your own weight? You are a wee lassie to fall with such force against any thing."
                  "She tells but half the truth," said Florence. "She fell, but, in a moment of passion, I pushed her from me; and, if she is seriously riously injured, I shall feel myself unfit to live. Oh, Doctor, tell me how it is with her. I am in an agony of fear and impatience to know how much I have hurt her."
                  The Doctor looked grimly at her over his spectacles.
                  "And so it's a piece of your work, is it? Any one may tell by looking in that wild, black eye of yours, that there is a spice of the old father of evil there, that must not be trifled with when the temper up. My little Esther teased you, I suppose, and you would not bear it. Well, a little suspense will be of service to you, and teach you, the next time, to be more careful how you use your superior strength, with such a poor, delicate flower as this."
                  "Oh, sir, you are cruel—cruel. I am on the rack of impatience, and yet you have no pity for me. I suffer——"
                  "So does this child," he interrupted, pointing to the patient. "She says nothing, however, and you must learn to bear in silence; it is the destiny of your sex. I am no seer—I can not tell the result with certainty; but, with extreme care, Esther may outgrow the injury. I hope she will—constant and unremitting care must be taken of her; and you can show the sincerity of your sorrow by taking this fatigue from her mother as much as you possibly can."
                  "I will be her slave. I will watch over her day and night. Trust her to me, Mrs. Mildmay, I will be gentle with her as you can be—I will never suffer my unfortunate temper to ruffle her again."
                  "Ah, Florence, if I dared trust you; but I fear I can not," replied the sad mother, as she administered the remedies ordered by the Doctor.
                  Florence felt that she was right, yet she was angry and wretched that she could not be permitted to hold her penitent vigils alone beside the couch of the sufferer. For many days Esther was confined to her bed, and most assiduous was the orphan in her attentions; yet she saw that she was never left entirely alone with her, and this want of confidence gave a deadly wound to her irritable ensibility. She felt as if a dark pall had suddenly fallen around her, and blotted out all happiness for her beneath that roof. The very bread she ate was steeped in her tears, and her impatient spirit revolted against the feeling of dependence which bound her to those she had disappointed, and rendered unhappy.
                  The fact of her own culpability only added bitterness to this feeling, and she pined to go forth from the home which had been bestowed on her in her hour of need.
                  "I will bear with it," she thought, "until Esther is sufficiently recovered to need me no longer as a nurse; then—then I will go to my old friend, and confide my future fate to her. She may not understand, but she will at least love me."
                  Day by day this determination gained new strength, as Esther slowly recovered from the first effects of the blow. She continued pale and delicate during the summer, and, in August, her parents decided to take her to the east for the benefit of sea bathing.
                  Mrs. Flint had not neglected to inform her aunt of the terrible consequences resulting from the ungovernable temper of Florence, for all the household knew the cause of Esther's illness, and, of course, the constant visitors of the family were aware of what the young girl disdained to conceal.
                  Mrs. Ilston was shocked, but she waited to hear from Florence herself; many days did not elapse before a letter came, blotted with tears, and filled with such penitent remorse for her violence, giving such a vivid picture of her wretchedness beneath the roof of those she had estranged from her by her own evil temper, that the kind heart she appealed to was deeply touched.
                  "Now they will give her up to me," thought Mrs. Ilston, "for Mrs. Mildmay can no longer hope to infuse her own meekness into this brilliant meteor-like nature. Heaven help me! I am unfit to guide her, I know; but the best I can do, is to make her as happy as possible, and leave the result to God. She must come to me, that is very evident, and I 
                        willt hank
                        will thank
                      Heaven for the gift of so bright a spirit as the companion of my old age."
                  She immediately wrote to Mrs. Mildmay, using every argument to enforce her claims on the orphan; and the husband of that lady fully acquiesced in their justness. Less patient and less interested in the character of the young girl, Mr. Mildmay was anxious to remove from his household one who threatened to become a perpetual fire-brand to destroy that quiet he so highly prized. His wife, he thought, had done enough for her, and she would really be unmindful of the interests of Florence if she refused so advantageous an offer, for one so destitute of friends.
                  Mrs. Mildmay reluctantly yielded, and it was decided that Florence should go. She also had a letter from Mrs. Ilston, and knew the discussion that was pending. In deep anxiety she waited the result, and, when it was announced to her, a heavy weight seemed suddenly lifted from her heart. Her look of joy wounded Mrs. Mildmay.
                  "Florence, I believe you are glad to leave me," she said.
                  "Oh no, my beloved friend—my kind benefactress. I grieve to part with you; but I am not happy here. The pale face—the wasted form of darling Esther are a perpetual reproach to me, and I often feel as if the night of Hope had come to me, young as I am. I will revere you forever—will think of you as my bright ideal of womanly excellence; but I dare not hope to resemble you. To you I am but a burden; I very nearly became a curse; but to Mrs. Ilston I can be of use. There is no one there to arouse my unfortunate temper, and it will be better for us all that I shall go."
                  "I trust it may prove so for you, Florence; for wherever your lot may be cast, I must carry with me, to my last hour, a very deep concern for one who has so deeply interested me."
                  "Thank you—oh! thank you, Madam, for that. I have thought myself so worthless, so lost, that I was not deserving of a care on the part of one so good as you are. I will remember this assurance with deep gratitude."
                  "Ah, Florence, has it not been said, 'He suffereth not a sparrow to fall to the ground without taking heed of it;' and are you not of more worth than many sparrows? Poor child! God knows what your fate is to be, but I will not fail to pray for a happy one for you when I ask for mercy for my own. Here is a Bible marked by myself, which I wish you to peruse at least once in twenty-four hours Will you promise me this?"
                  "I will," replied Florence, perfectly melted by the tenderness of her manner; and she went forth more subdued than her proud spirit had ever before been.
                  The children wept bitterly at parting from her, and even Mr. Mildmay testified some regret, and made her a present of a bundle of tracts carefully selected by himself. They all turned on the duty of self-control, and the danger of indulging in sudden bursts of passion.
                  Florence examined them as the carriage rolled over the lovely forest road which led to Elmsby, and her mood changed. She laughed sardonically, for she had an aversion to what are called pious books, and wondered what effect that good man imagined such narratives could have on a mind constituted as hers was. Then her fancy wandered to the new home she was about to enter, and a sense of freedom already made her heart bound more buoyantly than it had done since that dreary night in prison, which had stamped its impress on her soul in characters of living flame.
                  Mrs. Ilston had been suffering from indisposition, and was unable to go in for her young friend herself, but she sent her carriage with a confidential servant; and under his escort she safely reached her destination.
               
               
                  CHAPTER X.
                  THE sun was setting as the carriage came in sight of Elmsby, and Florence gazed with delight upon the waving trees, the bright green sward, and rippling streamlet which imparted a character of the highest sybran loveliness to the scenery amid which she was henceforth to dwell.
                  The house was a single story in height, with green blinds and doors, and a gallery in front which seemed a perfect nest of flowers. The honey-suckle, virgin bower, and several varieties eties of roses, were twined around the pillars, and extended in wreaths from one to another, through its entire length. A group of elm trees, from which the place derived its name, arose in stately beauty around the building, and few retreats could have worn a more romantic and pleasing appearance.
                  Several large chairs, designed more for comfort than elegance, were scattered about the spotless floor, and in one of them reclined Mrs. Ilston. She was a small, fair woman, who wore her own gray hair smoothed beneath a plain muslin cap, which harmonized with her worn features and quiet expression much better than ribbon or lace could have done. A pearl-colored silk dress, and a white lawn handkerchief crossed upon her breast and fastened with a jet pin, completed her costume.
                  She arose to welcome Florence, but weakness compelled her to lean, for support, on a small ebony cane which stood ready beside her chair. With characteristic impetuosity, the orphan threw herself upon the breast of her friend, and wept so bitterly that Mrs. Ilston was compelled to check her emotion.
                  "Florence, darling, I am delighted to have you here as all my own; but I can not bear this love. I am weak—I have been ill, and can not stand so much excitement."
                  She sank back on her chair, and Florence knelt before her and clasped her hands in both her own, while she struggled to force back the rushing tears that blinded her.
                  "Pardon me!" she murmured, "I have often wept for bitter sorrow, but these tears are born of joy and thankfulness. Words are too feeble to express to you all I feel for your undeserved kindness to a poor, wayward being like myself."
                  "Say, rather, in seeking you I have been kind to myself, my dear girl. Is it not much to one worn out, lonly, and feeble as I am, that such a being as you should be given to watch over my infimities, and smooth my path to the tomb? I regard you as a gift from Heaven itself, and I will show my gratitude by seeking to render you as happy as possible in the confirmed sphere in which I move. For your sake, I wish it were more brilliant."
                  "No, no—just as it is, is best. I am country bred, and my soul has pined for the shadow of green trees, the melody of birds, and the breath of flowers. There is a sense of freedom here I have not felt for long: ah, dearest mother, for such I must henceforth call you, we shall be very happy here."
                  "I trust so, Florence. Yes, call me mother, I never had a child to lisp the fond name; but from you the title will be as dear as if bestowed by a daughter of my own blood. I know not what the spell may be, but I love you, dear girl, as I have never loved one of your years before."
                  Florence looked up, with her wild smile flashing over her expressive features.
                  "The power to win love is my only dower, and I firmly believe that it has been bestowed on me for a purpose."
                  "Yes, to enable you to enthrall all hearts," said Mrs. Ilston, with a smile. Could she have looked into the young heart which beat so tumultuously beside her, she would have been appalled to read the fell purpose for which she believed this power to enchant had been given.
                  "You must be weary and hungry, my love," continued the old lady. "Let us go in, and I will regale you with something more substantial than professions of affections, which time alone can test."
                  "Ah, they allay the hunger of my soul, dear mother. It is much for the poor orphan, to find a friend who can understand and feel for her."
                  Mrs. Ilston led the way into a room with a single window at the farther end, which occupied more than half the wall. An arched recess was in front of it, and the casement opened on a wide stretch of woodland, interspersed with sunny slopes and lovely dells, in which the partridge reared her young in safety.
                  In this recess, a table for two was laid; and the bright china, with its pattern of rosebuds wreathed around the brim; the snowy damask napkins, and the glittering service of silver, all bespoke the presence of refined taste, blended with the most exquisite neatness.
                  A few finely-colored engravings, plainly framed, hung against the walls, and porcelain vases, filled with flowers, were placed upon the table and mantel The furniture was plain, but selected with excellent taste, and each piece seemed fitted to the exact spot it filled.
                  A negro girl, in a light calico dress, and, white apron, with her hair picturesquely covered with a gayly-colored handkerchief, brought in the tea, and waited on them without any awkwardness or noise. Florence looked out on the gathering twilight, sipped her tea, and felt as if the spirit of peace must here enter her turbulent soul; but, in the conversation which ensued, Mrs. Flint's name was mentioned, and she skillfully drew from her hostess the history of her opposition to her adoption by Mrs. Ilston, and the proud glow which mounted to her temples revealed that, even in that quiet seclusion, the jarring passions and conflicting interests of the world could penetrate.
                  Lights were brought, and the tea equipage removed; but the old lady and her young friend sat absorbed in conversation until the negro girl again entered and respectfully reminded her mistress that it was later than her usual time for retiring.
                  "True, Phœbe, and I may make myself sick by sitting up so late. Thank you for your thoughtfulness about me. You, too, must be weary, Florence. Come with me, I will show you to your room.
                  Florence followed her into an airy apartment opening from her own chamber, and she was charmed with the evidences of affectionate care for her comfort which surrounded her. The floor was covered with India matting, and the bedstead and windows were draperied with floating clouds of snowy muslin. The toilet was also covered with white dimity heavily fringed; and the old-fashioned glass, with its quaintly carved frame, reflected nearly the whole of her figure.
                  A walnut book-case, filled with food for the mind, and a plain writing-desk and table, shewed that her friend had not been unmindful of her intellectual wants.
                  "I trust you will find contentment beneath my roof," said Mrs. Ilston, tenderly kissing her; "and, remember, love, it first requisite in domestic live, is perpetual confidence. Make me your mother, indeed, and we shall mutually bless the hour which brought to us a knowledge of each other."
                  When left alone, Florence unclosed the window shutter and suffered the moonlight to stream into her room. The soft radiance of an August moon bathed the woodland without in misty glory—the tall trees clustered in picturesque groupes, with open patches of green sward between, offered an object of delightful contemplation to her imaginative mind. She sat absorbed in reverie, until the glimmer of her expiring candle warned her that she would soon be left with only the light of the moon, and she hurried to her couch, forgetful, on this first night, of her promise to Mrs. Mildmay to peruse a portion of her Bible before retiring.
                  When she awoke in the morning, the first thing her eyes rested on, was an engraving which hung opposite to her bed. She had not remarked it on the previous night, but now it fastened her gaze, as by a species of fascination. The picture was coarsely executed, but with remarkable graphic skill. It represented Judith and Holofernes; he lying in the sleep of helpless intoxication, and she in all the pomp of festal attire, in all her wonderful beauty, with the sword of vengeance in her hand, ready to strike, while on her features there was an expression of stern determination, mingled with the natural shrinking of her sex, from such an unnatural crime.
                  It seemed a strange coincidence that this picture should have been hung in her room; and it illustrates the influence which the minor incidents of life have upon us. The young girl who first uncloses her eyes upon it in her peaceful home, acceptedit as an omen and a warning. There was danger that she should forget her mission, she thought, amid the quiet of her present lot, and this picture was placed before her as a daily memento of what one heroic woman had dared to do. Why, then, should she forget her vow? She arose and examined all the details of the scene, but the first look had stamped them as vividly upon her mind as if she had studied them for hours. She remem bered her promise, and, unclosing her trunk, drew forth her Bible, and turned over the leaves, until she found the history she sought. Eagerly did she read it, and deeply did she ponder on it; and from that day she never forgot the pledge she had given; but perhaps it would have been better if she had violated it, for she drew from the blood-stained narrative in the Old Testament, food for the fatal dream which enveloped her future life in the shadow of a terrible darkness. She seldom read the history of the meekness, lowliness, and sacrifice of Him who died for suffering humanity; to her morbid mind, it had few attractions. A God of vengeance, such as the older chronicles portray, was better suited to her state, than that saviour, whose teachings are of mercy, love, and forbearance.
                  Many hours of the day were necessarily spent alone by Florence, and thus her character was left to take its own bent, for Mrs. Ilston, amiable, gentle, and weak, was not fitted to deal with such an impulsive and original person, even if she had desired to influence her to become different from what she was. But Mrs. Ilston did not desire it; she found her a most charming companion, and she did not care to look beneath the brilliant surface to ascertain the existence of the lava flood which seethed under this attractive exterior.
                  Florence possessed a pleasant wit, and a power of expression which rendered her conversation interesting; she read remarkably well, and this last accomplishment was a source of never failing enjoyment to her protectress. Her fine perception of character and extraordinary dramatic talent, were exhibited in these readings, and even the good lady remarked the earnest interest with which a story of consummate retribution was always read and dwelt on by her protegee.
                  "One would think you had been deeply wronged yourself, my child, to see and hear you over such a story as you have just been reading;" she said one day, when Florence laid down her book and arose, in uncontrollable emotion.
                  "And so I have been. Not I alone—that I could bear, but those who were dear to me were destroyed."
                  "You must forget all about that now, my darling. The past is irrevocable, but the future belongs to you; and you can render it happy, if you choose."
                  "Forget!" repeated Florence, abstractedly—"Ah, if I dared!"
                  She left the room precipitately, and hurried into the open air, for, impulsive as she was, she never betrayed to her old friend the darker workings of her mind. Their characters possessed little in common, and she knew it would be dangerous to her future prospects, to lay bare the secret which spread day by day, and gained new strength as time rolled away.
                  The neighborhood in which they lived, offered little to distract her mind from its own dark broodings—there were no girls of her own age within visiting distance, and the elderly people who associated with Mrs. Ilston, possessed few attractions for Florence. She exhibited her accomplishments before them, and was complimented, and regarded as quite a prodigy; but gratified vanity, and affection for Mrs. Ilston, only, prevented her from showing how intolerably wearisome she considered them.
                  When her restless soul seemed as if it struggled to wing its way from the deadly monotony of the actual, she would go forth beneath the arch of Heaven, and wander until exhausted in mind and body, she was glad to return to the narrow seclusion ot the cottage. A poetic talent, as wild, dark, and incomprehensible as her own spirit, developed itself in these lonely wanderings, and many were the hymns which rang their harmonies through her soul, but they were rarely committed to paper. She feared that others might see them, and thus discover a clue to the sombre schemes which filled her mind, to the exclusion of the bright and happy dreams which usually make the May-day of existence. Alas, her spring was destitute of flowers—dark weeds, which she sedulously cultivated, had overrun the soil that should have brought forth better fruit.
                  It may be asked, while this young thinker endeavored to solve the problem of the evil fate she believed allotted to her, was there no thought for the future?—the life after this? Ah, yes—many—but she reasoned for herself, and concluded, that the teachings of the fanatic are not those of the great spirit of Love which pervades the Universe. She said:—
                  "I may commit evil, and God will punish me according to my deservings, but not forever: to believe that, would be to deprive him of his great attribute of mercy, and make him a spirit of torture; for the mind, which alone survives, is so constituted, that in the lapse of time it accommodates itself to its position, and to render punishment eternal, the Creator must be ever devising new tortures.
                  Thus she reasoned, and as the image of the Nazarene arose before her, she asked:—
                  "Wherefore should he have died, if the blood of God, the creator, the preserver, is not sufficient to ransom every human soul that may ever live? An irrevocable destiny impels me onward in the course of darkness—perhaps of crime, but He is not the less my saviour than the saviour of others."
                  By such reasoning she endeavored to reconcile the pursuit of wrong, with a belief in the unlimited mercy of God; but there were hours of dark and terrible misgiving. She remembered the denunciations against those who clearly see the right, yet wilfully pursue the wrong, and sometimes her soul fainted within her; but again the evil demon arose, with renewed strength, from the struggle, and at length established undisputed dominion over her.
                  During the dark days of winter, when cold, snow, and rain confined her within the cottage, she often chafed like a caged lion; but it was in the solitude of her own room alone, that she vented her impatience. The blazing fire that sparkled and leaped up the wide chimney, continually demanding more food, seemed to her a type of her own restless and ever-seeking spirit, which only asked for the power to consume. She would go forth after these lonely struggles, calm, and ready to minister to the pleasure of her protectress, whose feeble body and failing health demanded the tenderest care.
                  Florence did not neglect her musical studies, and while Mrs. Ilston reclined on a couch, the young girl would play for hours such melodies as she delighted to hear; and but for this singie softening influence, her character would have lost all its loveability.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XI.
                  The winter passed away, and as spring opened, Mrs. Flint came to pay her annual visit to her aunt. She was accompanied by Master and two Misses Flint, who were as unattractive as it is possible to imagine young scions of the human family to be. The girls were slender, angular looking children, with cadaverous complexion, and sandy hair. The son was just at that age when boys are most unbearable. Rough, dictatorial, and noisy, this youth considered himself far too manly to be under the control of his mother, "and he only came along," as he expressed himself, "to see that the old one didn't meet with no sort of ill-usage from that Florence, who had stuck herself up in his aunt's house, and, he believed, meant to stay there. But he would show her what was what, pretty soon, if she put on any of her airs to his maternal progenitor."
                  Florence was duly warned of this visit, and entreated by Mrs. Ilston to bear the impertinence of the children with patience. Mrs. Flint rarely remained over a week, and for that time she could arm her soul with endurance.
                  "You can walk or ride as much as you like, my dear," she said. "As Sarah and the children will be with me, I shall have company enough. It will at least give you more freedom to follow your own pursuits."
                  "Thank you, ma'am;" replied Florence, "but I am not annoyed at the prospect of this invasion, I assure you. Occupying the position I now do in your regard, Mrs. Flint will consider it expedient to treat me with more consideration than formerly."
                  In fact, Florence rather enjoyed the idea of Mrs. Flint's arrival. It offered a stimulus to her wearied mind, for she had long since discovered, that the quiet monotony of the country, with no other domestic companionship than an invalid old lady, was not the life for which she was formed. She rea
                      lost their charm, and she pined for human companionship, which could make her forget for a season the morbid dreams of her own fancy. Mrs. Ilston had made her a present of a fine riding horse, and for hours she would remain in the forest, careering fearlessly through its green arcades, and finding in the existence of such rapid motion, an exhileration of spirits which nothing else produced. Her steed was black as midnight, spirited and fiery, as herself, and many a wild gallop had they over the hills. A complete sympathy seemed soon established between them, and Lucifer would obey the softest word from her lips, or the lightest touch upon the bridle rein, while to all others he was unmanageable. Mrs. Ilston had given her the choice between two horses of equal value; one a steady, well-trained animal, and the other the spirited black. Florence did not hesitate a moment in her selection, although her old friend trembled to see her mount him for the first time. She soon saw, however, that the girl was his mistress, and from that time she suffered no uneasiness from her long stay in her daily rides.
                  On Mrs. Flint's arrival, she was polite to the orphan, but studiously cold in her manner. The children stared at her as if she had been some wild animal, and the uncouth, sandy-haired boy said, loud enough to be heard by her:—
                  "By Jupiter, the girl is pretty enough to turn a fellow's head, let alone that of my old aunty there. Guess if she was younger, she'd be shy of having such a heart-breaker about her."
                  From this moment Florence knew, that in this young cub she possessed a strong ally, if she chose to take the trouble to be civil to him. It was an amusement to her, to win him over to her side, and watch the irritation which his defection produced in the mind of his amiable mother.
                  On the second morning after their arrival, Mrs. Flint was electrified at seeing him spend some time at the glass, endeavoring to give a civilized appearance to his stubborn looking hair. He then spent a weary time with the nail brush and soap, trying to remove from his rough-looking hands the weather stains which had never before given him a moment's uneasiness. His mother watched him in silent dismay, and at length said:—
                  "What does all this mean, Johnny? Glad as I am, to see you endeavor to assume the habits of a gentleman, which I have vainly attempted to inculcate, still I must be surprised that you should think such care here at all necessary."
                  Her son regarded her with an air of sheepish defiance. "Why not here as well as any where else? It is never too late to mend, as you often say yourself; and the truth is, when I took hold of Miss Flory's hand, to help her on her horse, last evening, I was ashamed of my own paws, and thought I would try to mend their looks a little."
                  "And much good have you done them, scrubbing them until they are as red as boiled lobsters;" replied his mother, with asperity. "I can see very well, that this artful girl is trying to make a fool of you, while she laughs in her sleeve at your awkwardness, and your absurd devotion."
                  The youth colored to the roots of his hair, and angrily rejoined:—
                  "A fellow can admire a pretty girl, without being a fool, I suppose, and I tell you, that Miss Florence is the sweetest and most polite young lady I know. I think, ma'am, you have kept me in leading strings long enough, and I can't stand it no longer. I am nearly seventeen, and I think it is time to begin to be my own man."
                  Here was open rebellion! produced by that odious orphan, who seemed thrown on Mrs. Flint's path as a scourge for unrepented sins. She felt that her empire over her son had indeed departed, for he was too old to be treated any longer as a child, and, having once revolted, he would not again return beneath her iron rule. She quickly changed her tactics, when she found that Johnny was really irritated.
                  "My son, I only spoke for your good. You are too young and untutored, to be a match in cunning for Miss Elliot. It amuses her to coquette with you, because no better person offers here, and she knows it annoys me to see it."
                  "But suppose she is not coquetting?" asked the youth, blushing scarlet, and looking very sheepish; "suppose she may be in earnest, what then?"
                  "God forbid! that would be worse than the other. I tell you, her temper is awful terrific. Poor boy, she would tear your hair out, if you offended her."
                  "I would like to see that woman that would tear my hair for me, ma'am. No—no—I am not made of such milk and water as that comes to. Now, mother, I think it would not be a bad thing, to have this fine place, with such a handsome incumbrance in the shape of a wife, as Miss Florence would be."
                  "You talk as if the girl is sure of inheriting the property, which is by no means certain; besides, I am the rightful heir, and I do not wish one child to be benefitted at the expense of the others."
                  "Better half-a-loaf, than no bread at all, ma'am; and I happen to know, that the old lady has made her will over since Florence has been here; and it don't take much wit to know how the money's left, when we see how fond the old aunty is of her."
                  Mrs. Flint grew pale.
                  "If I thought she had wronged me and mine so much, I would leave her house within the hour. I tell you, stupid boy, that if this property is left to Florence, you will never be benefitted by it. She will play off her charms to ensnare your inexperience, and then laugh at your folly."
                  "Leave me alone to find that out;" said the youth, with a conceited look, which was infinitely absurd. "I am going to ride with her this morning, and if I can keep up with that confounded Lucifer, I will see if I am to be made a fool of."
                  "That is what nature has already done for you." retorted his mother, bitterly. "I wish with all my heart, that the horse would prove worthy of his name, and break her neck."
                  With these charitable words, Mrs. Flint smoothed her brow, called up a patent smile, and proceeded, with soft, cat-like tread to her aunt's sitting room. Mrs. Ilston was placed near a window, and Florence was on a low seat beside her, relating some incident with animation, which seemed to possess much interest for the listener. It cost the visiter considerable effort to retain her serenity of manner before her aunt, while Florence merely nodded, and went on with her story, without rising to offer her a seat.
                  Presently, Mrs. Ilston asked,
                  "Do you ride this morning, Florence?"
                  "Oh, yes, Madam, Lucifer is already ordered; I promised your son, Mrs. Flint, to ride a race with him this morning, and I am determined to win."
                  "In a race with you, Miss Elliot, every one seems to be distanced, therefore, it will not surprise me to hear that Johnny is defeated."
                  Florence laughed, and Mrs. Flint felt as if she could have stabbed her on the spot. To feel herself powerless before this girl, who evidently cared not for her displeasure, was gall and wormwood to her bitter spirit. As soon as breakfast was over, she would speak to her aunt, ascertain her true position in the family, and then take a final leave of her weak relative
                  Florence seemed in the gayest spirits during the meal, and jested and laughed with Johnny until he was in the highest exultation, and his mother in such a state of aggravation that it was with difficulty she retained her seat at the table. The offender at length arose and said,
                  "Our horses are ready, I believe, Master Flint. We will take our race before the sun gets too high to be pleasant. I warn you, if you can not ride like John Gilpin, you will stand no chance with me."
                  "Therefore, I think the effort had better not be made," said Mrs. Flint, in her stateliest manner. "Johnny only risks getting his neck broken, without any advantage to himself that I can see."
                  "And be backed out by a girl, mother? No, by Jupiter, that shall not be said of me Beside I hope to win something by the race."
                  Florence looked at him mischievously, and malicious mirth danced in her eyes.
                  "Yes, perhaps you will win a hard fall," she said as she left the room to prepare for her ride.
                  "Something better than that you black-eyed eyed devil," muttered the youth while he strode into the yard, and examined the girth of his saddle to see that it would bear hard service.
                  They had no sooner left than Mrs. Flint despatched her daughters on some errand, and commenced her premeditated attack on her aunt at once.
                  "I must confess, aunt, that I am surprised to find Florence Elliot occupying the position she does in your household. I thought her conduct at the Mildmay's would teach you the propriety of confining her to her true sphere."
                  "I do not understand you, Sarah. Florence is my adopted daughter, and as such, from the first, I distinctly stated I should receive her. She left the protection of Mrs. Mildmay at her own earnest request; they had no desire to cast her off, I assure you."
                  "Well, that only proves that she is an ungrateful creature; for they received her when nobody else would. And then the return she made for all their kindness was shocking. I am sure it makes my heart bleed to look upon the face of that poor, delicate child, whose life she came so near destroying."
                  "That is, indeed, a dark memory to Florence, and will be a warning to her, I trust, during all her future life. For that she has bitterly suffered; and one act of passionate violence should not stamp her whole existence with evil."
                  Mrs. Flint tossed her head, and said:
                  "I have but one question to ask, aunt, and I hope you will reply to it frankly. I see that you are quite infatuated with this girl, and I merely wish to know if she is to be a daughter to you in every respect?"
                  "If you mean as it regards the disposition of my property, I answer, yes. I can not reasonably expect to live many years, and I should feel myself criminal to neglect, making a provision for one who has been a bright spirit to me since she entered my house."
                  "And to what extent will this generosity extend?" asked the niece, white with suppressed passion.
                  "Possibly to the extent of my whole fortune. Your family is well provided for, therefore I need only consult my own feelings in disposing of my property. I have no other near relations, and Florence is very dear to me."
                  "That is very evident, and I must say the artful baggage has played her cards well," replied the incensed lady, rising from her seat, and violently ringing the bell. "Since I, and mine are of so little consequence to you in comparison with this beggar, picked up in an alms house. I shall no longer tax your hospitality. I shall leave Elmsby to-day."
                  "As you please Sarah," returned Mrs. Ilston, quietly. She had too often suffered from the tarrany of her niece, to offre any opposition to her departure. She understood the deadly offence she had given, and she felt too weak and ill to bear with the hurricane which she knew would ensue, if Mrs. Flint and Florence came to an open rapture, she was therefore quite well pleased that her niece should be ready to depart, by the time her adopted daughter returned.
                  Mrs. Flint left the room muttering:
                  "She is not in her right mind, and I will prove it when the right time comes. The will shall be set aside, and this girl be turned out the pauper she was, when she was received here."
                  In the meantime, the two equestrians had mounted their horses, and proceeded at a leisurely pace toward an open glade in the forest, through which a good road wound for several miles. From this point, Florence had decided to start, and the termination of the woodland was to be the boundary of the race. They drew up in the shadow of the trees and Florence said, with a smile:
                  "We have no wager on the race, Master Johnny. If we have no one else to back us, we can at least bet on our own success."
                  "I have nothing to bet, but this," said the youth, holding up one of his well-growu hands, thrust into a deerskin glove, much too tight for it.
                  "I do not understand you," said Florence.
                  "It is because you wan't them My hand, and with it my heart, is all I have to offer as a bet."
                  "But I shall certainly win."
                  "Do so, if you can. If you will accept them, I shall be happy."
                  Florence opened wide her wild eyes, and after staring at him a moment, burst into a peal of such merry laughter, that the leafy arch above them rung with her merriment. The youth seemed offended, and hurt; he turned his horses head as if about to leave her.
                  "Come back, cried the girl, easing her steed to spring forward, in such a manner as to intercept him. "I did not mean to offend you; but do you know that you are too young to use such language?"
                  "Young! I am nearly seventeen, and you are not older than that, I fancy."
                  "No—but I am a girl, and I may listen to love, while you are yet much too young to make it. Don't you see the difference?"
                  "No, I do not—five years hence, that will be of no consequence."
                  Again Florence was tempted to utter another ringing laugh, but she repressed her merriment, and endeavored to speak calmly.
                  "This is nonsense Johnny. You know your mother would sooner see you in your grave, than betrothed to me, and I have not the slightest inclination to become her daughter. You will go to college on your return home, and soon forget that such a being as Florence Elliot is, in the same world with you."
                  "I shan't forget, Miss Flory. Besides, if my aunt leaves you all this fine property, I think it but fair that you should share it with one of the family."
                  "Ah-h-set the wind from that quarter," said Florence, with a slight curl of her proud lip.
                  "I think that would be paying rather a severe penalty for the possession of fortune, Johnny. However, I will make an agreement with you. If you will never again allude to love, I will share with you, provided my dear old friend leaves me all—but not as your wife."
                  "But I—I believe I would rather settle it the other way, Florence. Do you know I think you duced pretty, only a leetle too fiery at times."
                  "Do you really?" asked the young lady, with an assumption of great implicity. "I am much flattered that your mother's son should so highly estimate me, for I know it is in opposition to her own opinion of me. One thing is certain, Johnny, I shall never suit you, for your mother is quite right about my temper. I do not deny that it is very bad, and I have not taken the pains to control it, which I should have done. Be assured of one thing, however, I shall never forget my first offer, nor him who made it. Now for our race."
                  As she finished speaking, she struck her spirited steed with her riding whip, and he sprang forward at such a pace, that Johnny soon found himself hopelessly distanced; and as he watched her light figure flying through the woods, he thought her more charming than ever.
                  "There is nothing to be gained in so wild a chase after so wild a spirit," thought he, so he sensibly checked his horse, and proceeded leisurely to the goal agreed on. When he joined Florence, he found her cheeks glowing, and her eyes flashing with the excitement of the gallop, and she laughingly, exclaimed:
                  "So after all you permitted yourself to be backed out by a girl—Fie, Johnny!"
                  "When nothing was to be gained by risking my limbs, I thought it quite as well to follow you at my leisure. No, Miss Florence, I have concluded that a dull plodding soul like mine, was never made to pursue the lead of such a will o' the whisp, as you are."
                  "Well and sensibly said, Master Flint; for I am one born to a peculiar destiny, and no spirit less excited, less impressable than my own, will ever claim kindred with mine. You, poor boy, could as soon look into the depths of the ocean, and behold all its wanders laid bare, as penetrate into the sweets of my dark and restless being. God help him who does! for it will be a revelation of doom to him."
                  All playfulness had vanished from her manner, and as her eyes looked out on the distant view, as though the future were unrolling itself before her vision; there was an expression in their dark depths the youth could not understand, any more than he could fathom the meaning of her last words.
                  In silence they turned their horse's heads toward home, nor uttered another word, until they dismounted at the door.
                  Great was the surprise of both when they learned the intended departure of Mrs. Flint; but Florence made no comment on it. She shook hands with her craft-fallen lover, and asssured him she would not forget the promise she had pledged to him in reference to the property. Johnny thanked her, and made an awkward attempt to kiss her hand; but she hastily withdrew it, and passed into her own room, where she remained until the visiters had departed.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XII.
                  FLORENCE sought her old friend, and faithfully repeated the conversation which had taken place between herself and John Flint; her lively powers of narration always amused Mrs. Ilston, and she laughed merrily over the awkward attempts at love-making by her young nephew; although a vague feeling of discomfort was in her mind, when she remembered the occurrences of the day.
                  She did not love Mrs. Flint, and had long been weary of her attempts to dictate to her in the management of her own affairs; still domestic broils always leave a sting behind them, and this discomfort is deeper in proportion to the kindliness of temper, and warm feeling of the parties concerned in them. Mrs. Flint could go on her way embittered by anger, and complain to the world of the injustice with which she had been treated, while the quiet aunt silently writhed beneath the consciousness of unmerited censure, which she yet disdained to repel. Mrs. Ilston made no effort to detain her niece, because past experience had shown her that no concession on her part could now restore peace between them; and she detested dissension too heartily to be willing to see it take up its abode beneath her roof, even for a day. Solitary and unloved had been the greater portion of her existence; and the lonely orphan who brought the sunshine of affection to her heart, was cherished in its deepest recesses, as we cherish the memory of the few bright spots in a dark and gray landscape. The occurrences of the morning had only made Florence more dear, more necessary to her; and she rejoiced that the power was hers to render the future life of her darling free from all pecuniary care.
                  Florence, after her narration, fell into a fit of musing. She suddenly looked up, and asked:
                  "Mother are you really in earnest about leaving me all this property?"
                  "Yes, my love, it will all be yours when I die."
                  "But consider, dear Madam, it is much more than I shall ever need. I would not have the world say that my attentions to you are but mercenary; for indeed, indeed, I love you very dearly."
                  "I do not doubt that, my child, and therefore I choose to reward that affection in my own way. As to what the world may say, Florence, heed it not; it always misjudges us. Our friends overrate us often, and our enemies underrate us always. The indifferent, who make up far the larger class, join either the one party or the other, as their sense of justice prompts them, or according to the influence they may be under at the time. We can not act in such a manner as exactly to please any two persons; so the only course is, to cultivate a spirit of independence, that shall only be amenable to the law of God."
                  She paused, and Florence asked—
                  "Shall I have entire liberty to do a I please with this money?"
                  "Certainly, I shall not restrict you in any manner. But how do you wish to dispose of it? Have you formed any plans of your own?"
                  "God forbid that I should do such a thing, dear friend, while you live to enjoy your own; and that life may long be spared you to do so, is my fervent prayer. Neither will I tell you the thought that prompted the inquiry, because it might have some influence with you, and that I could by no means wish."
                  "You are quite mysterious, my love, but never mind; one thing is assured. All I die possessed of, descends to you at my decease, and if it compensates you for the loss of the old friend, whose dearest wish is to benefit you, my will, will be accomplished."
                  Florence silently kissed her, and said no more. Her own determination as to the final disposition of the estate, was already formed, and her overweening pride of character was gratified by the thought, that she could yet prove to Mrs. Flint, that her soul was free from the taint of meanness or selfishness, whatever other faults she might possess.
                  The next visitors who came to Elmsby were the Mildmays, and Florence was delighted to see that the rose once more bloomed upon Esther's face. Her mother said her physician pronounced her entirely recovered from the effects of the blow upon her breast, and how gratefully this information was received by the self-condemned girl, few would have believed. The thought of the child's suffering had been an arrow to her soul, and fancy had often pictured the generous, affectionate little creature bearing an incurable wound through her own unpardonable violence.
                  She now expressed something like this to Mrs Mildmay, who replied—
                  "It is, indeed, a cause of deep thankfulness to us all, Florence, and you, I hope, will not forget to whom praise is due for all his mercies."
                  Florence appeared embarrassed, and remained silent. Mrs. Mildmay went on.
                  "I hope you have not neglected your promise, to persue the Scriptures, diligently, my dear girl. They are the fonntain of all truth—all mercy."
                  Florence certainly had not read them in that spirit, and she hesitated what reply to make. Mrs. Mildmay observed it, and asked:
                  "Have you not found them so?"
                  "I dare say you will think me wrong; but—but the Old Testament does not represent things in the light of mercy and forgiveness. God, in that, is rather a consuming fire."
                  "And why have you dwelt on those old histories of the Hebrews, in preference to the new revelation of love, long suffering, and forgiveness? O, Florence—Florence I fear that you willfully prevent the means of grace that Heaven offers you. I had hoped the peace, the holy calm of the country would produce a different state of feeling."
                  "According to your creed," replied Florence, with bitterness, "many are born to destruction, and it would be nothing strange if I were one of them. If it be the will of God that I perish, all my efforts will be unavailing to avert the evil destiny."
                  Mrs. Mildmay took her hand tenderly in her own.
                  "Such is not the creed of the Christian, perverse child. 'Come unto me all ye who labor and are heavy laden,' said the Savior of mankind. See how comprehensive—how all embracing is his love; and yet you turn from the record of his life to the blood stained anuals of the Jews. Believe me, Florence, this should not be."
                  The young girl turned away, determined not to be influenced by her words. Many such conversations took place during Mrs. Mildmay's stay at Elmsby, but without any satifactory result, and she began to think the orphan the most inpracticable person she had ever encountered. She then endeavored to arouse in the mind of Mrs. Ilston a desire to influence her protegée, to consider those truths which she considered as of the last importance; but the good lady thought Florence quite as near perfection as there was any necessity for being, and seemed surprised that Mrs. Mildmay could wish for any change in as charming a creature.
                  "She is charming, I admit," replied that lady. "But she acts from impulse alone; and I warn you, my dear friend, that some higher motive must be given to such a temper as Florence possesses. If she does not become a consciencious and high-principled woman, she will be—what I shudder to think of."
                  "Really, Mrs. Mildmay, this is not Christian-like, I must say. We are told to 'judge not lest we be judged,' and you are subjecting this young girl to an ordeal which is far from kind."
                  "I am sorry you should think so, Mrs. Ilston; but I have carefully studied her, and I take a very warm interest in her future welfare There are depths in that young girl's soul, you would shudder to look into; she cherishes in her heart a desire for vengeance on the cousin who so bitterly wronged her parents, to which time seems only to add intensity. I could once have smiled at her threats, if they had not filled me with horror; but now I do not consider them so peurile. She exhibits a power of will—a tenacity of purpose, which will enable her to accomplish whatever she undertakes."
                  "You astonish me; how have you made such discoveries, madam?"
                  "The first clue to the state of her mind was obtained during the delirum of fever, when I found her in the asylum. Her voluntary confession of extreme bitterness against Colonel Talbot, and my own observations, have led me to my present conclusions."
                  "Still I think you are in error, Mrs Mildmay. It is now nearly a year since Florence has resided with me, and I have discovered none of this bitterness. She sometimes seems wearied with the monotony of our country life, but she is always considerate—always companionable. She never mentions her relation, and I believe seldom thinks of him. Ah, you may be sure you wrong her greatly."
                  "I trust it may prove so," replied Mrs. Mildmay, sincerely; though she could not yield her own conviction, glad as she would have been to do so.
                  She observed Florence, keenly, during her stay, and she was pleased to see that her manners at least had softened by the quiet influences around her. She was more thoughtful—more attentive to the wishes of others, than in former days, and Mrs. Mildmay hoped that time would work the same change on her fiery temperament, and subdue it into meakness. She could but pray earnestly for the wayward one, and Florence understood the expression of tender interest with which her eyes often followed her, and deeply thanked her for it.
                  With Esther and George, the young girl seemed to have recovered her childhood again. She spent whole days rambling in the woods with them, in search of flowers. She took them with her to ride, and under her superintendence a swing was erected in a shady dingle in the park. She exerted herself in every way to render the visit of the children a gala, long to be remembered by them.
                  Mrs. Ilston was delighted; she called the attention of Mrs. Mildmay to the amiable traits Florence thus exhibited; and that lady began to doubt the accuracy of her own impressions. Her heart was completely won by the kindness of Florence to her children, and she confessed that she might have misjudged her.
                  Yet in all this, the orphan but obeyed the promptings of her age and sex. At heart she was still unchanged. The dark purpose of her life no longer floated before her as an impalpable vision. She began to see her way to its accomplishment, clearly, and girl as she was, there was no shrinking in her soul. With something of the spirit of Brutus, she looked forward to the fulfillment of her purpose, as an atonement due to justice. Had she been gifted with less keen feeling—less vivid affections, she might have suffered the wrongs to sink in oblivion, and have borne them in silence, as many others have done; but with her, every strong emotion was exalted into a passion, and this one she cherished as a holy duty delegated to her. The more helpless she appeared, the more imperative seemed it her mission to seek out the means of accomplishing her vow.
                  Time rolled by, and months lengthened into years. A reconciliation was effected between Mrs. Flint and her aunt, and she continued to pay her annual visit to Elmsby, to "find out what was going on there," as she expressed herself. Johnny never again accompanied her, and took no other note of the existence of Florence, than sending his respects when his mother made her annual appearance. They were delivered with grim stateliness by Mrs. Flint, and received by Florence, with a smile, and a desire to be remembered to him in return.
                  Thus had ended the passion of her boy-lover; but since that woodland race, Florence had been sought by others, more suitable to her in years and station; but hitherto she had remained unmoved by all proffers of love.
                  At nineteen it would have been difficult to find a more elegant or attractive girl. Her tall figure was commanding as that of a Juno; her clear complection glowed with health, and her finely moulded features, beamed with intelligence and spirit. There was an air of regal pride in her carriage, which invested her person with an expression of majesty that seemed to command the homage of all who approached her.
                  Her large black eyes would have been too brilliant, but for the long lashes which half vailed their brightness; and her wealth of glossy hair curled and waved around her nobly formed head, like ripples of shining silk.
                  Yes, she was a woman to bewitch one's soul until life, hope, honor, were not too great a price to pay for the guerdon of her love. And she knew this—she exulted in it. She fully believed her power to fascinate, had been a gift from heaven, to enable her to accompish what a fiend from the inferno might have promoted.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XIII.
                  DURING the progress of these years, Mrs. Ilston faded and grew thinner, until she more resembled a white shadow moving over the earth, than a human being. She believed that her heart was diseased, but such was not the opinion of her physician, and Dr. Baily at last concluded that a trip to the —— Springs would prove beneficial to her. At all events, the change of scene, and amusement would be of service by breaking in on the dreamlike monotony in which she lived; besides he took a sincere interest in Florence, and cherished a great admiration for her. Dr. Baily thought it quite time that so brilliant a girl should go forth into the gay world, and win the attention he conceived due to her.
                  We will not say how many of these ideas were insinuated by Florence; for she possessed infinite tact, and knew how to gain her point without making it obvious that she had any decided wish on the subject.
                  Mrs. Ilston yielded to the wish of Dr. Baily, and every thing was soon in readiness for their departure. On the evening before, the physician called to leave his final directions for the invalid. Florence accompanied him some distance on his homeward route, and he walked beside her, leading his horse.
                  "Does not the anticipation of this journey give you pleasure," he asked. "You look unusually pale and depressed this evening."
                  "You will laugh at me," she replied, "but a weight has been on my spirits the whole day, which all my efforts are powerless to shake off. I feel as if the shadow of a dark destiny is settling around me: yet why I should dread it I know not; for I have never anticipated a bright fate for myself."
                  "There is no reason why you should not, for you are gifted beyond most women; if Fate can not give a happy lot to her most brilliant child, it will be that she chooses to play the part of the jealous step-mother to her."
                  "Tell me, Doctor," said Florence, abruptly, do you not think we should all live for a purpose?"
                  "Undoubtedly—that was the object of our creation. But your path seems open and clear before you; thank God, it also promises to be a sunny one."
                  "Ah, who can tell? Fairest promises are often deceitful. Should we shrink from the performance of what we consider a holy duty, because it may bring suffering to one we love? anguish to our own bosoms?
                  "Miss Florence, you are quite an enigma to me this evening. Our duties are usually so plain and simple, in this prosaic world of ours, that to perform them well is the surest guarantee of happiness."
                  "But sometimes it is not so: there are painful exceptions to the common lot. Should my fate prove such—would I not be right to cling to the performance of what I have vowed—for which I have lived?"
                  She appeared violently excited, and Dr. Baily looked at her with surprise.
                  "If you are firmly impressed with the belief that you are right," he slowly said, "only gain assurance of that fact, and all will be clear before you."
                  Her features brightened.
                  "Thank you—until to-day I have never wavered; but now a shadow—a doubt crossed my soul. I have a presentiment that I go forth from this seclusion to accomplish my destiny, and——"
                  "Yes," he interrupted, "the usual destiny of your sex. You will marry some clever fellow, and seek to render him happy."
                  "Florence grew slightly pale, and a tremulous emotion seemed to agitate her frame.
                  
                  "Ah, if I could only steel my heart to love," she muttered, "there—there is the danger."
                  The doctor caught the meaning of her words, and he turned and stared at her a moment before replying.
                  "Bless my soul, young lady, you are not surely in your sane mind! I trust you would not marry any man without a due quantum of the divine affiatus—the spirit of divinity which breathes into existence it most joyous life. You must have strange notions for a young beauty to cherish."
                  "Many women marry without love," replied Florence, coldly. "Why shall not I, if I deem it necessary to do so?"
                  "But where is the necessity? and such a woman as you had better throw herself into the ocean—better plunge into a gulf of living flame, than marry without love."
                  "You grow earnest, Doctor. Have I said any thing so terribly blamable? You know yourself that I have merely uttered a truth, which is demonstrated every day."
                  "Yes—by the weak, the vain, the cold-hearted; but never by a woman worthy of the name. Why, do you understand what you do when you link your fate with that of another for all time to come? for the influence you must possess over that one will live through the countless ages of eternity."
                  Florence shuddered.
                  "Ah, that is a terrible responsibility! If I fully believed that, I would abjure marriage altogether."
                  "It is, nevertheless, true; but it is easy to do the best we can, and leave the rest to Providence. What more can be required of us, my young friend? God is a more lenient judge than man. But I see no good in this discussion, and we are at the road. My best wish for you, Florence, is, that you may love as earnestly and truly as it is given to the human heart to do; then you will feel, then you will understand the sacrilege of which you just now spoke."
                  "Thank you, my good friend—I believe you take a truly fatherly interest in my welfare. But tell me, before we part, do you really think this journey will benefit my mother?"
                  "It will amuse her. She seems to be gradually fading toward heaven, as the mists are absorbed in the beams of the rising sun, and all we can do is to smooth the passage to the tomb. I am confident that medicine can render no assistance; its use would only hasten the catastrophe. Follow the written directions I have left, and remember my words in reference to yourself. You are a strange puzzle, Florence, and I sometimes tremble for the happiuess of your future, for I do, indeed, take a parental interest in you."
                  He pressed her hand warmly, and, mounting his horse, rode quickly away, while Florence returned toward the house with slow steps, and a preoccupied mind.
                  Hitherto she had looked forward, with keen interest, to her entrance into a wider sphere; for there she knew the problem of her life must be solved. Yet, as the ordeal approached, for the first time she shrunk from it: she doubted the validity of her purpose. Her good angel, for the last time, spread his sheltering wings above her soul, and whispered thoughts of mercy—mercy to herself—to him she might choose as the minister of Fate. Yet the hesitation was but momentary; the fixed purpose of her life was not so easily cast aside, and once more she raised her proud head, fixed her defiant eyes on the cloudless heaven above her, and in the depths of her spirit, repeated the vow which had been first breathed above the rigid corse of the last of her family.
                  On the following morning they left Elmsby, and Florence looked back from the carriage window into its pleasant shades, and speculated, within her own mind, on the changes which might occur in her destiny before she again beheld it. It was now July, and the woods were dark with overshadowing leaves; the wide fields were laden with the ripening harvest, nearly ready for the reaper. Flitting clouds ever and anon obscured the brilliancy of the sun in spots, leaving others in the full glare of his beams.
                  The invalid looked forth also, with chastened sadness; for she thought it probable that her gaze rested on those familiar scenes for the last time. She had no hope of benefit from the waters, and her daily increasin weakness warned her that the powers of nature were nearly exhausted: the failing body rapidly assimilating to the dust from which it originally sprang. Yet she shrank not—hers had been a life of simple benevolence and pure uprightness—she troubled not her mind with the dogmas of the learned—she read her Bible with perfect faith in the promises it contains, and she asked, in the name of Christ, to be received into his Paradise, with the full conviction that she was indeed but going home to the All Father.
                  Beautiful is such simple, earnest faith, and fortunate are they who possess it. Rather are they the "Sunday children of God" than those gifted with genius, to whom this expressive phrase has been applied.
                  It had been arranged that Mrs. Ilston and her young companion should join the family of Mr. Mildmay, who were about to remove to the Springs for the remainder of the summer. Cottages for their accommodation had been secured, far enough from the main building to insure that quiet which the invalid needed.
                  The place was beautifully situated, and adorned with much taste. A wide park, combining hill, dale, and woodland, stretched away on every side of the castle-like dwelling; and picturesque cottages were scattered about beneath the shade of the trees. The fountain of health was in a romantic dell at some distance from the house. An open saloon of Moorish architecture had been erected over it, and from a marble reservoir gushed the sparkling, but nauseous draught, which so many pilgrims came to quaff.
                  Mrs. Ilston bore the journey better than had been anticipated; and on the evening after their arrival she was able to sit in a cushioned chair, on the light veranda which extended along the front of the cottage, and look out at the groups of promenaders that passed toward the fountain.
                  Florence leaned over the back of her chair, and many an admiring glance was cast toward the brilliant face brought in such striking contrast with the pale and worn one of the invalid. Mrs. Mildmay was there, also, gand as her acquaintance among the assembled company was extensive, she pointed out many of the most noted among them as they passed.
                  At length a gentleman drew near, who almost supported the slight figure of a young girl in deep mourning; and her dress was but a feeble type of the sorrow mirrored in her expressive features. It was a lovely face, so pure, so fair, so faultless in outline, that one involuntarily thought of the mother of God, or the the angels of heaven as the eye rested on it. That the gentleman who accompanied her was her father was evident from the resemblance between them, although it was difficult to tell in what the likeness consisted. He was tall, strongly-built, and glowing with health; yet the pale lily by his side bore on her person many of the traits which distinguished him.
                  Florence experienced a painful contraction of the heart as she looked on them, and she become pale as death.
                  "I do not know who those persons are," said Mrs. Mildmay. "They must have just arrived. The young lady interests me much; what touching sorrow is depicted in her countenance!"
                  Florence had scarcely remarked her; her gaze was fascinated to the face of the gentleman; but she now glanced at the delicate figure of the girl.
                  "If she should die and leave him alone," was the thought that came to her mind. 'Yet he would soon find consolation. No—no—retribution from my hand must yet be his! I never before have known how deadly is my hatred toward him, until he drew near me, and cast the spell of his baleful presence npon the very air I breathe. The last time I beheld that man, he stood beneath my father's roof; he spurned the prayers of my frantic mother—he trampled on the breaking heart of my perishing father, and shall I shrink from avenging them? No—forbid it, Heaven! Behold his self-satisfied air, his lordly tread—this pride will I yet lay in the dust."
                  Mrs. Mildmay happened to glance at her, and caught the expression of flame which followed the receding figures of the father and daughter. She asked,
                  
                  "Do you know them, Florence?"
                  With some effort she replied with assumed calmness:
                  "The gentleman is my relation, Colonel Talbot, and his companion I presume is his daughter, though I have never before seen her."
                  "I am surprised that you recognized him so readily. It is now many years since you saw him."
                  "Yet he is little changed. There are some persons we never forget, and the scene in which I last beheld Colonel Talbot, was one to be remembered as long as life lasts."
                  Mrs. Mildmay watched her expressive countenance as she spoke; but Florence had acquired a power of self-control which completely baffled her. She wished the meeting had not occurred, but since it had, and the orphan looked and spoke so calmly, she must have abandoned the wild schemes of vengeance which once floated through her mind.
                  "They shall not see me," thought Florence. "I will remain in strict attendance on my mother until after they have left. It would mar my future plans to have Colonel Talbot become acquainted with my person."
                  On the following morning Mrs. Mildmay again spoke of Colonel Talbot and his daughter. She had learned that they merely stopped at the springs for a few days, in the expectation of being joined by the betrothed husband of his daughter. Immediately after his arrival, the party would leave for Talbot Hall. She went on to say that Agnes Talbot was only recovering from a severe illness occasioned by violent grief at the loss of her mother, whose feeble health had for many years rendered her an object of almost exclusive devotion to her daughter.
                  "The gentlemen are quite enraptured with her pure Madonna style," she continued, "and I think it a pity, Florence, that, that you do not come forth while she is here, to show the striking contrast there can be between two beautiful women."
                  "I am not ambitious of the comparison," said Florence, proudly. "It would be intensely painful to me to meet either father or daughter, and I shall, therefore, remain in the cottage with my mother until after their departure."
                  "You are right, my love," said Mrs. Illston. "Avoid arousing bitter feeling as much as possible. Your pathway is far removed from that of Colonel Talbot, and unless you will it, they need never meet."
                  "Who is this lover?" asked Florence, after a pause.
                  "It is Mr. Huntly; and there is a curious history attached to the betrothal, if such it can be considered. It seems that the father of the young man was an intimate friend of Colonel Talbot, and bequeathed his property to his son solely on the condition of his wedding Agnes Talbot. He has been educated in Virginia; and when they meet to-day, it will be for the first time since their childhood."
                  "And what was the motive for so singular a will?"
                  "Ah, there lies the mystery which no one can fathom. The elder Huntly died very suddenly, and the widow removed, with her son, to the place in which he was educated. They have very recently returned to this state, and I suppose young Huntly will make up his mind to fall in love with this beautiful girl as quickly as possible."
                  Florence mused deeply on what she had heard, and she watched the passers-by with unusual interest throughout the day, though she took care to sit in such a position as to screen herself from observation.
                  At length, as the sun was sinking behind his gorgeous drapery of purple and golden clouds, two persons appeared coming down the winding pathway, and in the black-robed figure she instantly recognized Alice Talbot. She leaned on the arm of a tall, slender young man, who moved with freedom and grace; and his head was bent toward his companion until his dark curling locks nearly mingled with her own pale brown ringlets. They appeared to be earnestly conversing together, and, as they drew nearer, Florence saw that he possessed that style of person which is most attractive to imaginative women. His complexion, of a clear paleness, seemed to indicate the habits of a student; and his intellectual features, his broad, thoughful brow, and darkly-flashing eye, were eminently pleasing.
                  "Now I will try what magnetism there is in a strong will, and an earnest glance," thought Florence, and she arose from her seat, leaned slightly forward, and fixed her eyes on the face of the young man. There was, at the moment, no defined purpose in her mind; she merely wished to test a new theory which Mr. Mildmay had advanced on the previous day. They had been discussing the merits of Mesmer, for Florence had been reading a history of that remarkable man to Mrs. Ilston, and it had strongly impressed her imagination.
                  The scene of my story is laid in those days when the mysteries of magnetism were as yet as a sealed book to the million, and Florence had only a few isolated facts to speculate upon; but to one of her cast of mind it was a subject of absorbing interest. She now resolved to attempt the simple experiment of attracting the gaze of a passer-by, whose history and position interested her. She, therefore, turned her eyes on the face of Edgar Huntly, and willed him to return the glance.
                  The pair came slowly forward; they reached the open space in front of the cottage, and Florence began to think her magic would fail her, when suddenly the young man raised his head; their eyes met, and an electric spark seemed to penetrate the soul of each. The lips of Florence involuntarily parted in a bright smile, and Huntly bent his head as to an acquaintance. She slightly returned the salutation, and vanished within the cottage, not quite satisfied whether the experiment had been successful, or his sudden glance the offspring of accident.
                  "Do you know the young lady who stood on the verandah in front of that cottage, a moment since?" asked Agnes Talbot, who had remarked the salutation.
                  "I must have met her somewhere before, but I can not remember where. Strange, too! that I should forget so strikingly beautiful a creature. Did you remark her extreme loveliness?"
                  "I—I scarcely saw her," replied Miss Talbot, with a painful feeling of jealousy; for, with the intuitive tact of her sex she had already fathomed the true state of Edgar Huntly's feelings, and she knew that his contemplated visit to her father's house would be made with the deliberate effort to try and love her on whose acceptance hung his hopes of inheriting his own estate.
                  The position of Agnes with regard to Huntly was one of extreme pain to a sensitive and refined mind. She had been reared with the conviction that Edgar was to become her husband at some future day, and she cherished a sincere affection for the handsome boy she so well remembered. Her life had been passed between her studies and the care of her mother's declining health, and it was not strange that the childish impression made by her boyish associate should have deepened into a feeling of interest, which only needed a meeting, and a few tender words to spring to life as an enduring passion. But in the first hour of their reunion Agnes felt that such words would be withheld unless they sprang truly from the heart of Huntly.
                  He must be won, and she painfully felt that one so quiet, so reserved as herself, was not the person to achieve the conquest of his affections. It is true, she possessed extraordinary beauty, but that alone would never enchain the affections of an impulsive and ardent nature such as Edgar possessed. Without feeling the conviction that she was the voluntary choice of his heart, could she accept the hand which a desire to retain what should have been his even without any such clog, might alone prompt him to offer? No power was left her to refuse; for in that event he was deprived of his inheritance as surely as if he himself had declined the alliance. She must await his decision, and be accepted or rejected at his pleasure; and her pale cheek glowed, her frame thrilled with indignant shame at the thought of the false position in which her father's grasping spirit had placed her.
                  She had once proposed to Colonel Talbot to cancel the will, but he assured her that it was impossible. The property was settled on her in such a manner that there was no method of evading the provisions of the instrument; and Agnes sighed and prayed for strength to bear her burden of humiliation as she best could.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XIV.
                  THE bright moonlight streamed over hill and dale, throwing a pale glory around the most commonplace objects, and investing them with a poetry and beauty entirely its own. Mrs. Ilston had retired, and seemed to slumber quietly, while Phœbe watched beside her, or, rather nodded; for, like all of her class, she was a most inveterate sleeper.
                  Florence sat alone in the verandah, and, for once, yielded her spirit to the softening influences of the hour. A vague, dreamy reverie filled her mind, to which the sounds of distant music from the ball-room, wafted at intervals on the night breeze, lent its magic charm.
                  She had sat thus for an hour, perhaps, when the sound of merry laughter aroused her to a consciousness of what was passing around her. Four young girls came, arm in arm, down the pathway, escorted by a lad of fifteen, the brother of one of them.
                  "It is so much pleasanter here than in that hot and crowded ball-room," said one.
                  "Yes, especially as we are not old enough to be of much consequence there. Never mind—our day of bellehood has yet to come, and I intend to queen it properly when it does arrive."
                  "Then you must consider yourself handsome. Hear Anna Lewis, girls. She says she will be a belle!"
                  "They all laughed, and the same voice replied—
                  "I am aware that I am far from beautiful, but I have good sense, tact, and —— money. Tell me if these three combined attractions are not superior to mere beauty?"
                  "I believe you are right. Yes—if you are resolved to accomplish it, you may become a belle."
                  "For my part, I had rather be lovely, and beloved, than generally admired," and in the speaker Florence recognized Esther Mildmay.
                  "Sensible Esther!" said Anna Lewis. "At your birth the fairy Good Sense must have endowed you with her own qualities. Your ruby lips only unclose to drop out pearls of wisdom like the Princess of whom we read in the Arabian Nights."
                  "My dear mother is my good genius," replied the young girl. "From her I obtain all the wisdom. I possess, and, after all, I am afraid it is not much."
                  Their voices died away as they descended to the saloon, and, presently, a servant came after them, bringing a guitar case. These youthful votaries of romance had evidently forsaken the ball-room to enjoy music by moonlight, and presently the tinkle of the guitar came up on the summer air, and a soft, clear voice soon joined its melody to that of the instrument.
                  Florence felt an irresistible desire to join these bright young spirits; and, after a brief hesitation, she arose and stepped forth upon the green sward. A few moments brought her near the pavilion, but she lingered under the shadows of the trees, fearful that the appearance, in their midst, of a person so much older than themselves, would check their mirth. Esther Mildmay saw and recognized her, and, after a few words to the others, she ran quickly up the steps, seized the hand of Florence, and said—
                  "Dear Flory, I am so glad you come. We would have asked you as we came by the cottage; but we were afraid of being intrusive; for you know you are a young lady now. It is beautiful down there, come and join us."
                  Florence yielded very willingly, and she was soon seated in the center of the group. After a few more songs, it was proposed to tell fairy tales, and Florence was solicited to begin. Willing to contribute her share to the enjoyment of the evening, she readily complied, and her skill as a narrator soon fascinated the attention of the others.
                  When she had finished, they unanimously declared that they dared not attempt any thing after her story, and they all united in soliciting her for another. Florence was in one of her most amiable moods, and she readily complied. Then Anna Lewis said,
                  "Miss Florence, there is an expression in your face which almost frightens me when you are excited. I fancy you could sing the Maniac magnificently."
                  "She does—I have heard her," said Esther, "and she sings it far better than the gentleman who attempted it to-day. Do, dear Flory, sing it for us—it will sound so finely in this clear moonlight."
                  Florance took the guitar they hastened to offer, and, after preluding a few seconds struck into the magnificent song which had been solicited. As the wild strain echoed through the saloon, the young hearers shuddered and grew pale at the wonderful fidelity with which the personation was given. But they were not the only listeners; behind the shadow of a neighboring tree stood a gentleman who had been attracted by the sounds of music, as he wandered through the park, and he drew near in time to hear nearly the whole of the song.
                  From his concealment he had a full view of the singer, who sat where the moonlight fell upon her, and, breathless, entranced, he gazed on the brilliant beauty which once before, on that day, had dazzled him. There was a depth of passionate power—a thrilling cadence in the tones of her voice that vibrated through the innermost cords of his soul, and an attraction which he could neither define nor resist, held him spell-bound.
                  The last note died away, and Florence bowed her head upon her hands, as if seeking to recover from the impression the wild strain had made on her own imagination.
                  "Terrific fate!" she muttered—"yet it seems to me that my own state of mind is often allied to madness. Oh, death! come as a deliverer sooner than that!"
                  She raised her face, from which all her brilliant bloom had faded, and, in the pale light of the moon it looked almost deathlike.
                  "You are ill—the song has been too much for you," said a mellow, manly voice; and Edgar Huntly came forward and offered her a glass of water from the fountain. She motioned it from her, and looked at him with an expression of surprise which seemed to demand some apology for his abrupt appearance.
                  "Pardon me," he gently said, "but I think we must have met before. I am under the impression that we have been known to each other in past days; though how I could be so dull as to forget the when and where is past my comprehension."
                  "You are mistaken," replied Florence, "unless we have met in some former state of existence, or in our dreams; to-day witnessed our first encounter."
                  "Ah, believe that it was in some former state of being we were known to each other; for that would establish an electric sympathy between us which we would possess neither the power nor the will to break."
                  He glanced at the group of young girls, and, with a smile, continued:
                  "Here is a young friend of mine who will perform the ceremony which is considered necessary even to mortals who have been linked together in their ante-mundane state. Miss Lewis, will you extricate me from my embarrassing position?"
                  Anna Lewis instantly stepped forward, and named Florence Elliot and Edgar Huntly to each other.
                  He seated himself beside her and glided into conversation with an ease and grace that irresistibly captivated her. After discussing music and poetry, those exhaustless topics to the young and romantic, Huntly asked,
                  "Have you traveled much, Miss Ilston?"
                  "Only on the wings of imagination. I have read many well-written books on different countries, and my imagination is so creative that it can portray before my mind vivid images of the scenes which are well described. I sometimes fancy this method of arriving at a knowledge of foreign countries is quite as satisfactory as to encounter the annoyances and perils which meet most travelers."
                  "Ah, that may answer for one of your sex, but not for ours. We need the personal struggle to gain something unattained by others; the collision with men of different nations, to develop the latent strength within ourselves. Your imaginary traveling has, I presume, been principally confined to Europe?"
                  "Certainly—since more books are written of that continent than any other."
                  "Yet our own country, in its broad extent, combines as much that is grand and beautiful in scenery, as any other quarter of the globe. I never knew how deeply the human soul can be moved until I looked upon Niagara ara, and heard its grand dispason rise to heaven, as the noblest anthem the world has yet harkened to; watched the waters flashing beneath a blue concave as pure and brilliant as that of boasted Italy, and borrowing a thousand iris hues from as bright a sun as God has given to shine above any of his children."
                  "But our native land lacks the poetry with which genius and art have invested some of the countries of the old world."
                  "True—but she possesses that which is of far nobler import to the children of the human family: space—a career for the downtrodden and famishing sons of poverty from those worn-out shores. Great is the destiny of our favored land among the nations of the earth; nor will the halo of genius be wanting to embalm her name. We already boast some nobly-gifted ones among us, and time will surely develope more."
                  "I believe it," replied Florence, catching his enthusiasm.
                  "We may not live to behold it, but the musician, the poet, and the sculptor, born beneath our own skies, will, at some future day, render our own shores world-renowned as the home of genius, as well as the asylum of the oppressed."
                  Thus they conversed until the moon began to sink behind the trees, absorbed in each other, forgetful of all the world beside. The young girls had soon resumed their music and their prattle, but neither of them heeded it, and these youthful observers were quite conscious of the fact. They smiled, and made their own comments on the pair in an under tone.
                  "Colonel Talbot had better keep a keen watch on his chosen son-in-law," whispered Ama Lewis to Esther. "I think he is much more fascinated now than he seemed to be with Miss Agnes."
                  "Yet it is a great pity that Florence should win Miss Talbot's lover from her. I heard mother say, to-day, that there were strong family reasons why Mr. Huntly should marry that beautiful Agnes. I am sure she reminds me of the holy angels every time I look at her"
                  "Yes—but as I said before, beauty does not always win; though, to be sure, Miss Florence is very beautiful herself. They seem to forget that the moon is setting and I am fearful we must be rude enough to remind them of it; for my mother will be displeased with me if I remain here after the ball closes. Let us make a move, and see if they will second it."
                  The young party arose; the youth who accompanied them slung the guitar across his shoulder, and, bidding Florence and her companion good night, they departed. Florence also arose, and Huntly offered her his arm, but they lingered until the others were half way up the glen; then the two ascended the pathway slowly, and, after several pauses at the most beautiful points of view, they reached the cottage door. As they stopped on the threshold of the verandah, Huntly said—
                  "Will you permit me to call to-morrow, Mrs. Ilston, and form the acquaintance of your mother? She is not too much of an invalid to receive visiters, I believe."
                  "No, she will be pleased to see you, Mr. Huntly; but, excuse me, I was under the impression that you intended leaving to-morrow with Colonel Talbot and his daughter."
                  "I had such an intention, but I have changed my mind. The visit to Talbot Hall can be deferred—any other time will answer as well for that."
                  His emphasis did not escape the ear of Florence, and her lips curled in haughty triumph. She had dealt the first blow to her detested relative already. The pale face of Agnes arose before her, and she asked—
                  "Have you been long associated with Miss Talbot?"
                  "To-day witnessed our first meeting since Agnes was quite a child."
                  "Good night, then, Mr. Huntly. Not adieu, but au revoir."
                  "Yes, to meet again is my sweetest hope. Good night, Miss Ilston."
                  And the two parted—he to dream of that gorgeous loveliness, which took his soul by storm; and she to ponder on the one terrible dream of her existence, blended with new emotions and brighter visions than were often admitted within her breast.
                  "The agent is found," she mused, "but dare I devote that noble being to such a destiny? He seems to me elegantly rather than strongly endowed. Ah! should I tempt him to stain himself with guilt, and his soul should prove too weak to bear the burden of after reflection, I must become unspeakably wretched; for this man is one to be loved with fervor. After all, will not my affection be his reward? Hence, vain doubts! I will be guided by circumstances;" which, with Florence, simply meant, that she would bend circumstances to her own iron will.
                  She spent the remainder of the night in reflection. She recalled the history of Huntly's singular connection with Colonel Talbot, and felt convinced in her own mind, that some great wrong to his father had been perpetrated by his soi-disant friend; could she gain a clue to that wrong, she could use it as a weapon of deadly power in her warfare with her kinsman.
                  The sun was rising as she at last fell into a troubled slumber, which lasted only a few hours. Before she arose, Colonel Talbot's carriage drove to the door of the main building, and he soon issued from it escorting his daughter. He appeared much annoyed, and looked eagerly among the group of persons, who had assembled to witness their departure, as if seeking for some one. With evident disappointment he turned to his daughter, and said in a low tone:
                  "This is very extraordinary conduct, on the part of Huntly, I must say. I shall make him understand that I feel such neglect is unpardonable."
                  "Dear father, he may be indisposed, or overslept himself."
                  "Very likely the latter, for I have heard that he was playing the gallant to some girl in the saloon, until nearly midnight; such conduct is not very flattering to you."
                  Agnes shrank from his words with a feeling of wounded pride, but she simply said:
                  "Here comes Mr. Huntly now."
                  Edgar approached them with a quick step, and apologized for his tardy appearance; he had been detained in his room by the call of a friend, and had no idea that Colonel Talbot would depart so early.
                  "We shall barely have time to reach the Hall before sunset, as it is too warm to drive very fast. I hope you are quite ready to accompany us now."
                  Huntly colored.
                  "I have just met several old friends from whom I have been long parted, and if you will excuse me for a few days, I will follow you to the Hall in company with Eppes, who is one of the new arrivals. He hoped to be able to see you before you leave, but as he was up a part of the night, I left him asleep in my room."
                  "Ah, my old ward; I shall be glad to see him, but I can not wait his wakening. Your mother will be with us to-morrow, and she will be disappointed at the violation of your promise to meet her."
                  "My mother and I have been nearly inseparable for seven years, and she will not grudge me the free use of my wings in my first flight from her. Two or three days can make no difference to her, as her visit is to extend over several weeks. My apology is rather due to Miss Talbot, for my seeming want of gallantry."
                  Agnes murmured some words which were not very intelligible, as she gave him her hand to assist her into the carriage, and as they drove off, Col. Talbot said:
                  "I shall expect you in three days, Edgar, without fail, and I must say, you have not treated me well."
                  "Pardon the necessity, sir; I will endeavor to atone for my apparent rudeness when I do come."
                  The excuse made by Huntley, was quite true, though it was not all the truth; for he would have left his newly arrived friends, if the haunting face of Florence had not risen before him, and urged him to remain. He was aware that his worldly interests were greatly dependent on his union with Miss Talbot, but he was still too young, had felt too little the need of money, to be willing to barter his hand for its possession. His mother was independent, he had a good education, and fine natural talents, then, why should he not enter the arena, and gain a distinguished name, while he accumulated an independence for himself? Cheered on by the love, the approbation of such a woman as he fancied Florence to be, he could certainly accomplish this, and the visionary sketched a future as bright as the fervid heart of youth could desire. Such were his morning dreams, and under their influence he walked toward Mrs Ilston's cottage.
                  Florence was slightly paler than usual, but her eyes had a darker fire in their depths, her voice a deeper meaning in its tones, as she addressed him. Mrs. Ilston was well enough to receive him, and she was not less pleased with his appearance and manners than Florence had been.
                  The hours of the morning rapidly passed, and the trio were startled by the sound of the dinner bell. As Huntly arose to leave, he said:
                  "I believe you have not yet made your debut in the ball room, Miss Ilston. Will you allow me the honor of being your escort this evening? I think your mother seems well enough to spare you."
                  Mrs. Ilston eagerly spoke:
                  "I have wished her to go every night, but she would not leave me. Consent to do so this evening, dear Florence. I am so much better that Phœbe can very well attend to all my wants."
                  Florence knew that Col. Talbot had left, and she at once consented, with a bright smile, and a few words so gracefully uttered, that Huntly left the cottage in quite a state of rapturous excitement.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XV.
                  In the evening, Florence arranged her toilette with extreme care for the ball. She wished to make an impression, and few were more conscious than herself of the spell of her wonderful beauty. She wore a rich lace dress, over floating folds of snowy muslin; her white arms, bare nearly to the shoulder, were encircled with a single braclet of large pearls, while around her slender throat, a necklace of the same jewels were clasped with a fine diamond. Her magnificent hair curled and glittered around her beautifully moulded head, a fitting coronal for a queen; and her dark eyes were never more brilliant than on that evening of anticipated triumph.
                  As she stood before Mrs. Ilston, smiling and graceful, no one would have imagined that beneath that brilliant exterior lay such wild purposes, such dreams of terror, as were even now assuming a form of reality.
                  "My darling girl," said the old lady, fondly, "you are so lovely, that I begin to think I may lose you. Heretofore you have been cold to all proffers of love, but among the crowd assembled here, I think it probable you will meet one not unworthy to win you"
                  "If I should, you would consent, I know,' replied Florence, with a gay smile.
                  "Willingly, for I feel that many more days are not allotted to me on earth, and it is my earnest wish to place you under the protection of some good man before I die. If this young Huntly should prove the fortunate one, I should be very happy, for he seems honorable and true, as well as prepossessing in appearance."
                  Florence repeated the word "fortunate," and then added:
                  "If you had said that before Mrs. Flint, she would have considered you mad. Do you remember what an ogress she made me out to be, when she thought her darling Johnny was about to fall a victim to my fascinations?"
                  "Ah, yes—but you are changed since those days. You no longer suffer your temper to gain the ascendancy which it once did."
                  A cloud passed over the expressive face of Florence, and she thought:
                  "If I am changed, it is not for the better. I am only more deceitful than I was in my childish days. I have learned the necessity of appearing what I am not, and I practice my lesson well. Ah me! what will be the end of all this? I know well myself, for I dare not falter—I will not recoil from the path I see lying so plainly before me."
                  A knock at the door announced Huntly, and, hastily throwing a thick vail over her head, Florence bade adieu to Mrs. Ilston, and joined him on the verandah.
                  It was a considerable distance from the cottage to the ball room, and delicious was that quiet promenade to the enamoured Huntly, for already was he irrevocably in love with the enchantress beside him. Florence lingered in the moonlight more than once, and suffered the shrouding folds of her vail to fall from her head, and reveal her loveliness by those magical beams, which, she knew, invested her with even a greater charm. It was with an' effort Huntly restrained the expression of his ardent admiration; but the thought of their recent acquaintance caused him to fear a rebuff, if he was too precipitate in his declaration, and they slowly wandered forward, eloquently conversing on topics suited to the hour and the scene.
                  At length they reached the ball room, and at its entrance met Mr. Mildmay, who was stationed there by his wife, to look out for the arrival of Florence, and conduct her to that part of the room in which she was seated. The dancers had just finished a set of cotillons, and many admiring eyes were turned on the handsome pair, as they walked the whole length of the room, to the place occupied by Mrs. Mildmay.
                  Florence was as stately and composed as though such scenes had been familiar to her whole life, although it was the first time she had ever found herself in so fashionable a crowd. There are some women who feel themselves sovereigns by the decree of nature, and to them the "pomp and circumstance" of brilliant social life, are the true element in which they were formed to exist. That nightmare of the soul, timidity, is unknown to them; they pass on their way, serene, and self-possessed, acknowledging no superior, and always equal to the position in which they may be placed. Of such was Florence, and her spirit was as unruffled amid the whispered inquiries of those around her, as it had been while standing alone on the cottage verandah on the previous evening. Huntly was vividly impressed by this stately composure. It indicated, he thought, high natural endowments, and a true estimate of the small value to be placed on the criticisms of the world around her, for he knew that half of them were "nothing if not critical."
                  He had begun to love Florence as a charming woman; but he now adored her as a very superior one. A few moments after their entrance, the band struck up a waltz, and Huntly asked his fair companion if she ever joined in that dance. She had never waltzed in public, but she felt confident of her skill in an accomplishment which was not then, by any means, as fashionable or common as it has since become; and there was, at that time, but few ladies who would venture to appear in its graceful mazes.
                  She arose without hesitation, and permitted Huntly to clasp her slender waist, while her head rested against his breast, and her breath fanned his cheek, as they whirled around the spacious room; he oblivious of the crowd, the lights, the murmur of the voices, of every thing but the beautiful being his arm encircled; and she, with eyes half closed, and lips half parted, enjoyed the bounding motion, the entrancing music, and, above all, the murmurs of admiration which greeted her on every side.
                  Two gentlemen stood together near the door way. They were the friends of Huntly who had arrived that morning; one of them had been his classmate at college, and took a warm interest in all that concerned him. He had been a ward of Col. Talbot, and had spent much time beneath his roof, yet, strange to relate, he was ignorant of the tie which bound his friend to Agnes; for in the family circle at Talbot Hall, the subject was tacitly avoided, and Agnes never herself had courage to allude to it before George Eppes, Huntly, although on the most intimate terms with him, had never imparted to him this clause in his father's will, because he had always cherished a vague impression that it would never influence his destiny. It was a subject of painful interest to his mother, and gradually ceased to be mentioned between them: in fact, until his recent return to his native state, and his meeting with Col. Talbot and his daughter, Huntly had scarcely thought of its signification himself.
                  A wish to keep himself informed of the incidents of Huntly's college life, had induced Col. Talbot to place Eppes at the same institution, and it was through the medium of his letters that the interest of Agnes in her possible future husband was kept alive. Eppes had only reached the springs that morning, in a state of great fatigue, and, to his vexation, had missed meeting his quondam guardian and his fair daughter, by passing in sleep the time which might have been given to them, could he have prevailed on himself to appear before Agnes with jaded looks, and half-arranged toilette.
                  As has been related, Huntly availed himself of the arrival of his friend, as an excuse for his own prolonged stay; but Eppes was not long in discovering the true cause of his detention, and in his secret heart he was rejoiced ot it, for a vague feeling of jealousy was rising in his breast, since he had ascertained the anxiety of Talbot to take Huntly home with him. From boyhood, Eppes had cherished a warm admiration for Agnes Talbot, which only needed a gleam of encouragement, to brighten into ardent love, and he had no wish to see his friend enter the lists as his rival. Therefore he gazed upon the pair who flitted before him, and rejoiced that Huntly's heart had found so fascinating a claimant; for he felt, as he looked on the lofty brow, the superbly flashing eyes, and stately mien of this dazzling girl, that she was one who, once beloved, could never be forgotten.
                  "A fair woman, by my faith!" said his companion to him, as he levelled his eye glass at her." Huntly seems to be in for it. Who is she, Eppes?"
                  "I believe her name is Ilston. She is the daughter of a wealthy old lady, who is here for the benefit of her health."
                  "Ah, I know something of her, then. She is not the child of Mrs. Ilston, but her adopted daughter. The old lady happens to be a distant connection of mine, and I am certain she never had any children of her own. Ah ha! this is the girl, then, who has raised such a tempest in the Flint family. She is, by all accounts, a regular clipper, for her temper is like gunpowder."
                  "She looks as if she could queen it right royally," replied Eppes. "But it is something worth risking, even, to be ruled by such a woman as that."
                  Turner shrugged his shoulders.
                  "Every man to his taste, but for myself, I would prefer a domestic horizon less liable to tempest, than the one of which she is to be the sunshine."
                  "I can not deny that I agree with you. I prefer the timid violet to the dragon flower; and I believe we are not singular in that choice."
                  The waltz was finished, and Huntly led his partner from the crowded room into the long piazza which extended in front of the ball room. The cool breeze of night was delicious after the stifling atmosphere they had just escaped from, and Florence sat down in a large chair, so placed that the moonlight fell like a halo around her person. Huntly stood in front of her, and talked like one inspired. Fiery excitement was burning in his veins, and words of eloquent meaning flowed in a torrent from his lips. There are some persons who at once touch "the electric cord wherewith we are darkly bound," and the stores of the mind are laid bare before them; and there are others in whose presence we are dumb; there seems to be no point of sympathy—the soul lies torpid and motionless before their glance; a feeling of repulsion, for which we can not account, fills the mind, and the idea of again encountering that individual, fills us with disgust.
                  Florence on this evening was destined to experience both these opposite emotions. Enthralled, captivated by the brilliant eloquence of Huntly, she gazed on his earnest face, his impassioned air, and felt that it would be impossible to resist loving such a man. She must be won, and a fearful gift she was about to bestow upon him in endowing him with her affections; yet such seemed to be the course of Fate, and she resigned herself to its dictates.
                  They had conversed thus for half an hour, when Eppes approached them, and said:
                  "Huntly, I must accuse you of being a most unmerciful monopolist. Here are half the young men in the house wishing for an introduction to your fair friend, myself included among the number."
                  "Ah, pardon me. I was forgetful that others have claims on Miss Ilston, beside myself self. Permit me, Miss Ilston, to present to you my particular friend, Mr. Eppes."
                  Florence raised her eyes to the face of the young man, and bowed, but her usual fluency deserted her. She felt as if she suddenly had received a blow upon her heart, and if she had been superstitious, she might have fancied that at the hands of this man she was to sustain the most deadly injury; yet his appearance was far from unprepossessing.
                  His figure was slender and well proportioned, with a good, though not decidedly handsome face. His open brow denoted candor, and the light of his calm blue eye spoke of a soul at peace with itself; but the expression of the mouth, the decided curve of the thin lips, told of an iron determination, and a rigid sense of justice. These might have found an answering cord in the soul of Florence, but it is not those who possess a similar organization, who always attract each other; and she was repelled almost to the verge of abhorrence.
                  Eppes attributed her coldness to irritation at being disturbed in her flirtation with Huntly, and moved by a desire to teaze, he asked her to dance with him. She briefly declined, under the plea of the heat of the evening; but the tête-a-tête was interrupted, to be no more renewed. Others following the example of Eppes, solicited an introduction, and it was insinuated that, if the evening was too warm for dancing, it was charming for a promenade on the long piazza.
                  She complied with the invitation by taking the arm of Huntly, and allowing another cavalier to walk on her other side. Her spirits rose; all her natural gayety was aroused, and, surrounded by a small crowd, attracted by her witty sallies, she electrified the grave matrons in the house, by her defiance of the conventional rules of propriety.
                  Mrs. Mildmay was annoyed, and at the same time a little amused at the remarks she overheard; but she knew it would be quite useless to remonstrate, for Florence cared not for the criticisms of any one, and would pursue her own course now, as she always had done, regardless of the comments of others.
                  At a late hour the party broke up, and Florence refused the escort of all save Huntly. Again they loitered along the pathway, and her impassioned eyes looked into his, with that soft gaze which has all the influence of magic upon the soul, and he felt that the world were well lost for such a woman.
                  It was now his turn to listen to the musical tones of that seductive voice, as she gave him a brief sketch of her life, and the events which led to her adoption by Mrs. Ilston. It was a mere outline, for she reserved the darker record for an hour of more ominous import: for the hour in which her influence over him should be tested by an ordeal which would be as appalling as unexpected.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XVI.
                  The following morning was slightly overcast. A thin white haze seemed to float between earth and heaven, veiling the ardent glories of the sun, without absolutely shutting out his cheerful influence; and a slight breeze just stirred the foliage of the forest.
                  A fishing party to a romantic stream in the neighborhood was proposed, and eagerly acceded to by the younger portion of the company. Esther Mildmay was sent down to Mrs. Ilston's cottage, to invite Florence to join them, which she readily promised to do. As she was expecting a call from Huntly, she thought the freedom of the forest would be more agreeable for their interview, than the confined precincts of the little building she tenanted, though to his enamoured eyes that was more desirable, more conformable with young Love's dream, than the splendors of a palace.
                  So soon as Huntly was informed of the proposed excursion, he hastened on the wings of impatient love toward the temple that enshrined his divinity. Florence stood on the verandah, dressed in white, with a gipsy hat, trimmed with rose colored ribbons, on her head, and the lover doffed his own with the feeling of reverence with which he might have bowed before a goddess. The brightest smiles beamed from her rosy lips, as she said:
                  "I have taken it for granted that you will be my cavalier to-day, Mr. Huntly, and I have prepared myself for an excursion in the greenwood. Have you heard that a fishing party goes to the Fairie's Cove this morning?"
                  "I have, and therefore hastened here to forestal all others who might desire to become your escort"
                  "That was an honor, especially reserved for yourself," replied Florence in her most gracious manner. "An ordinary companion in the depths of God's temple, the green forest, can not be tolerated, at least by me. There, we should forget the faded commonplaces of every-day life, and infuse within our souls a fresh spring of existence from the breath of nature. The impulse which leads us to speak, should be derived from this quickening power, and what is uttered be stamped with the genuine feelings of the heart."
                  "You believe, I perceive, with Berkely, that beauty does not reside so much in the object, as in the mind of the beholder."
                  "It must be so; the power to appreciate the beautiful must in some measure be a gift from Heaven; but it is principally the result of cultivation; or why should not the unlettered sons of toil enjoy the beauties of natute, as intensely as the poet and the artist? I too, can quote from the work you refer to, and a precious gift it is, to one who like myself, has been familiar with the solitude and grandeur of nature. The imagination and the heart of man are the twin beautifiers of the creation. The dwelling of beauty is not in the light of the setting sun; nor in the beams of the morning stars; nor in the waves of the summer seas; but in the human spirit. I raise my eyes to the midnight heaven sparkling with its innumerable world's, and my spirit seems elevated to a kindred with them. I recall the poetic legends connected with them, by the earlier races of mankind, and my thoughts travel back to that hour in which the morning stars sang together, and my soul is filled with devotion; but another may stand beside me, to whom they are but twinkling fires placed there to give light to our insignificant world in the absence of the sun."
                  "Why should this be so, if it is not true, that our own soul is the sun which sprinkles beauty on the universe? Flower and star are lovely, because the mind has breathed upon them."
                  She paused, with flushed cheek, and flashing eyes, and Huntly whispered—
                  "Go on, I could listen forever to such glowing words, uttered by lips eloquent as yours."
                  She laughed.
                  "A compliment in return for my rhapsody! Fie, Mr. Huntly! That smacks of every-day life, I am afraid. The inspiration is past, and my harrangue at an end, for which you may consider yourself fortunate. How are we to get to our rendezvous? I have seen no one beside Esther, and know nothing of the ways and means."
                  "I have already procured a conveyance, and if you will allow me the honor, I will drive you to the river, where boats are provided to take us to the Fairie's Cove."
                  "Thank you; the arrangement suits my fancy marvellously well. We will have a drive, a sail on the river, and a ramble in the forest, for I warn you I shall not fish. I can not understand how so many of my sex should be so fond of the sport, for, to me, it is the dullest of all amusements."
                  "Shade of Isaac Walton! harken to this heresy," said Huntly, laughing. "I suspect your aversion to the honorable sport of fishing, is to be traced to your feminine fondness for talking; and the two we know are incompatible."
                  "Very likely, for with the true spirit of perversity, which is declared to be the inheritance of woman, I am always seized with a violent desire to talk, just when I should be most quiet."
                  As this conversation proceeded, they walked slowly toward the place of meeting; where beneath the shade of the trees, stood a group of merry talkers, amid the bustle of preparing for their departure. Horses and carriages of different descriptions, stood ready to receive their occupants, and leaving Florence under the protection of Mrs. Mildmay, Huntly hurried to see after his own especial mode of conveyance. He found Eppes awaiting his arrival, in charge of a handsome gig, to which was harnessed a magnificent bay horse. His friend laughed, and said—
                  "From your face I judge that you were not forestalled. In what a breathless state you must have arrived at Mrs. Ilston's cottage, if you kept up the pace at which you started, I am afraid matters are becoming serious in that quarter—Ah, Huntly?"
                  "Never was more serious in my life, George. So you see it is of no use to attempt quizzing."
                  "Candid at all events. Well, I am only sorry that your chosen one should have manifested such coolness toward me last evening. At first, I thought it pique at the interruption I gave to your flirtation, but as it continued throughout the evening, I could no longer interpret it in that way."
                  "Perhaps," replied Huntly, with a slight smile, "she had some intuitive knowledge of the prediction, made by the old soothsayer at my father's house, when we were boys. He fortold that you would be the minister of fate to me; do you not remember how deeply we offended him by laughing at the idea?"
                  "Yes, and an absurd one it was. Unless I should be so unlucky as to dispatch you by an accidental shot when we are hunting together, which I shall be careful to guard against, there is no chance that his words should prove true. But let us start—some of the company have already driven off."
                  He sprang upon his own horse, and Huntly seized the reins to draw up in front of the spot on which Florence stood, surrounded by a circle of gentlemen, with whom she conversed with a dignified case, which quite surprized them after her extreme gayety on the previous evening; but Florence possessed great tact, and she had no intention to be approached too familiarly by the idle gentlemen at the springs;
                  On her first appearance, she was willing to show how charming she could be, only to intrench herself behind the feminine reserve, which she knew to be indispensable to the maintenance of her power. The gossips were taken quite by surprize at this change in her manner, and wondered if it could be the same girl who had defied all their ideas of propriety on the previous evening. They finally concluded that Mrs. Mildmay had been giving her a lecture, which led to her present demureness.
                  Florence sprang lightly into the seat by the side of Huntly, and bowing and smiling to her admirers, was driven rapidly away. As they gained the forest road which wound picturesquely through its umbrage, Eppes overtook them. He paused a moment beside the gig, and said to Florence, with a mischievous smile:
                  "Have a care for yourself, Miss Ilston. The horse Huntly drives is very spirited, and I am afraid he is not particularly attentive to his duties this morning."
                  "Thank you, Mr. Eppes," replied Florence, briefly. "I am not afraid to trust myself with your friend," and again that painful contraction of the heart deprived her smile of all geniality. Eppes felt its chilling expression, and rode on, musing on the singular influence his presence seemed to have upon her. To all others she was courteous, and for him alone seemed reserved a coldness that was almost disdainful.
                  She was evidently fascinated by his friend, yet she repulsed the man who claimed his most intimate companionship; there was some mystery about her which he would fathom—yes, he must learn more of her before Huntly became inextricably entangled. That she wos not Mrs. Ilston's daughter he knew, and he would ascertain her early history that it might afford him a clue to the apparent enigma of her character.
                  In the meantime Edgar drove leisurely beneath the shadow of the trees, determined to prolong his delicious tête à tête as long long as possible. Eppes kept just within sight of the pair during the whole drive, and, observing that the eyes of Florence followed his figure constantly, Huntly said to her—
                  "I am afraid my friend has not made an agreeable impression upon you; yet he is one of the cleverest among men, and sincerely attached to me. When you know him well, you will like him for his kindliness of heart, and admire him for the resources of his intellect."
                  "I do not doubt it," replied Florence, gravely, "but I can not change my manner toward him. His presence oppressed me. It seems as if a sudden coldness falls on my heart when he draws near me and speaks. You may think it strange, yet it is quite true; I have had the same feeling toward one other person in my life, and it showed itself when I was a mere child. Subsequent events proved that this man was the deadly enemy of me and mine, and I can not mistrust my instinct. Mr. Eppes is yet to become the minister of bitter grief to me, if not of something more fatal still"
                  Huntly listened to her words in amazement. He turned and looked in her face, but he saw that she was quite serious, and slightly pale.
                  "When I look at you, I can not doubt your earnestness; yet, pardon me, Florence, if I say this is cherishing a strange superstition, which leads you to great injustice toward one of the best of men.
                  "I can not help it; the feeling is involuntary. I would gladly receive your friend as one of my own; but in this case I have no power to resist the repulsion that chills my whole being toward him. He seems, as you say, to be clever, amiable, and warmly attached to you, and I regret my incapacity to appreciate him as he deserves."
                  "I regret that it should be so; for I would have all who are dear to me cherished by you. Although our acquaintance is brief, dear Florence, the influence you have established over me is strong as death, and lasting as eternity itself."
                  Florence had looked for this declaration, but she received it so differently from what he had hoped, that he began to think he had been too precipitate. She betrayed no outward agitation, either by tremor of voice, or change of complexion; but could he have read the expression of the drooping eyes, he would have seen that his words were neither unexpected or unwelcome.
                  "You use strange images for a wooer," she said, with a slight shudder. "'Strong as death.' Ah, such a word, with all its fearful train of terrors, should never be used in uttering a declaration of love."
                  "Yet what is stronger? what more resistless? it, therefore, expresses my meaning well. Any image that would impress you with a conviction of the fervency and truth of my affection will be welcome to me. Speak, beloved Florence—dare I cherish the hopes which have already become so unutterably dear and precious to me?"
                  Florence raised her bright eyes to his, filled with light, hope, and love. With that fascinating gaze fixed on him, she said slowly, almost reluctantly—
                  "Should it then prove necessary to put this love to a test—a severe and unexpected test, would you shrink from it?"
                  "Never—any test—any ordeal that a man of honor could submit to, I would undergo. Yet why should you require such a proof of my love? You can not doubt my sincerity."
                  "Oh no—but all women have some favorite fancy, and—and this is mine."
                  "What, then, is this test? Let me know at once; for it can not be any thing from which I would shrink. You could not ask what would be incompatible with the honor of the man who aspires to the happiness of becoming your future husband."
                  She cast down her eyes before the honest glance which rested on her, and murmured—
                  "Not now—not now—I dare not yet. Our acquaintance is too brief. I give you hope; but I do not pledge myself to you; that, it seems to me, were unmaidenly, with the few days we have known each other."
                  "I may then seek to win your love? thanks, dearest Florence! I hope soon to obtain the right to the knowledge of this terrible test."
                  Florence sighed deeply as she caught the enraptured expression of his countenance, for at that moment all the enormity of her purpose flashed on her mind, and she felt that she was making the purest love a snare to his open and ingenuous nature. Yet of what had she dreamed during years of her life but this very consummation? The impulsive, excitable nature—the keen susceptibility of Huntly's mental organization, pointed him out as the most suitable agent for the task she intended to accomplish, even if she had not been so irresistibly attracted toward him herself. She had contemplated her vision of retributive justice until it had lost its repulsiveness in a great measure; and in the pride of her beauty, and talents, she reflected that her love, her devotion should be his reward, and would not that be sufficient compensation for the execution of the deed on which their possession must depend?
                  She would bind him yet more closely to her: she would wind her spells around him, and when his soul was knit to hers so indissolubly that it would be death to sever them, then she would reveal the dark secret of her life, and demand his assistance in consummating her purpose, as the price of her hand.
                  Florence knew that she must soon be freed from all domestic ties, for it was impossible that the worn frame of Mrs. Ilston could bear the chilling blasts of another winter. She would then be free to pursue her plans unmolested; in the meantime she would rivet her fetters around the heart over which she already wielded such powerful sway.
                  But few more words were spoken during the remainder of their drive toward the river; the mind of Florence was occupied with the thoughts we have endeavored to sketch, and that of Huntly was revelling in a dream of bliss as bright as ever nestled in the heart of hopeful, trusting youth.
                  They at length reached the stream, which was narrow and winding, and almost inclosed in high walls of limestone, that looked as if some violent commotion of nature had rent them apart, and given a passage to the dark flowing water which rushed and eddied over ledges of precipitous rocks, or lay in silent pools, where some natural obstacle interrupted the torrent.
                  The Fairies' Cove was a small basin lying in a curve of the shore, where the rocky wall suddenly sunk into rounded hills on which grew many evergreens; the cedar with its sombre foliage predominating among them. A narrow pathway opened between the hills, and led into a small valley as beautiful as the happy valley of Rasselas; and thus the aboriginal inhabitants seemed also to have considered it, for it had been selected as the site of one of their strongholds, and the remains of an Indian fort were still distinctly visible.
                  The high embankments remained perfect in many places, and their antiquity was demonstrated by the aged trees which grew upon them. Some of the party remained by the shore, busily engaged with rod and line, but nearly all the more youthful portion preferred a ramble in the valley.
                  Groups were formed beneath the trees, and occasionally a voice would carol some thrilling stanza from a song, which might have rendered the feathered warblers envious at such rivalry in their own domain. Long remembered was that golden day by the two who moved from group to group, with words of courteous greeting for all, but with thoughts wrapped alone in each other.
                  A new soul seemed to awaken in Florence under the influence of those bright hours, and for the first time she began to comprehend all the beauty, all the nobleness of devotion to another. She had a glimpse of that happiness which might be hers if she did not perversely turn from it; she forgot her cherished scheme of vengeance—she was only the confiding, the loving woman, and, as such, the spirit of Huntly bowed before her almost in admiration.
                  Eppes did not again approach them throughout the day, but he marked the devotion of Huntly, the encouragement of Florence, and he became the more anxious to ascertain something more of her early history. He recalled Turner's assertion on the previous evening, that Mrs. Ilston was a connection of his own, and he thought it possible that from him he might gain what he desired. He looked around for that gentleman, and, after some difficulty, succeeded in finding him sitting quite alone beneath the shade of a distant tree calmly smoking a cigar.
                  "Fie upon you!" exclaimed Eppes, laughing. "When so many lovely girls are present, how can you forsake their society for your own selfish enjoyment?"
                  "Ah-h-h—it soothes my nerves, and takes away the memory of a dangerous smile even as the smoke curls upward and gradually disappears in the atmosphere above. You had better recommend a course of such remedies to Huntly, for he has neither eyes, thoughts, nor words for any one save that dangerous Florence."
                  
                  "Yes—he seems quite infatuated. By the way, can you tell me any thing of Miss Ilston's history before her adoption by your relative?"
                  "I can, for I have been refreshing my memory only to-day, and I was thinking of her when you joined me. I talked of her to Mrs. Mildmay; but she does not choose to speak of her faults; but just before I started this morning, who should arrive but Johnny Flint. We rode out here together, and it was difficult to find out what I wished to know from him."
                  "Well?"
                  "Well, indeed! it is ill, rather; for I am afraid poor Huntly is getting into a devil of a scrape. It seems that my wooden-headed cousin was once in love with her himself, when he was a lubberly boy, and mamma repeated all sorts of scare-crow tales to frighten him from his devotion; but withal there must have been some foundation for them."
                  "And of what nature were these stories?"
                  Then followed the early history of Florence, related with tolerable accuracy; and there was much in it that furnished food for painful thought to a friend of Huntly's.
                  "This must not go on," thought Eppes, "but how to stop it, is a question I may well ask. This artful girl sees the impulsive temperament of my poor friend, and she knows she can work on it, and turn it to her own evil purposes. If I had not seen her, I would not have believed that a woman could harbor such deadly designs as are attributed to her, but having seen her, I know that she belongs to that class of women of whom Media is a representative. A purpose once formed, she will never, never relinquish."
                  In the meantime the sun was declining toward the west, and it was proposed to have a row on the river previous to their departure. Boats, with sable oarsmen dressed in white, were in attendance, and nearly all the younger members of the party hastened to the shore.
                  Florence found herself seated opposite to a tall, sandy-haired young man of singularly awkward appearance, and ungainly figure. He looked at her as if he thought she should recognize him, but it was several moments before she could recall the features of her quondam admirer, Johnny Flint. She bowed and smiled, for the memory of their last interview instantly occurred to her, and it never failed to elicit the spirit of mirth.
                  "How de do, Miss Flory?" he said. "Glad to meet you looking so handsome. How is my aunt, to-day?"
                  "She is better, thank you, Mr. Flint. When did you make your debut at the Springs?"
                  "I suppose you mean when did I come out from ——? As I never use the confounded French lingo myself, I don't pretend to understand it. Plain English is good enough to express all my thoughts in; well, I came out a horse-back this morning; and if my gray can't beat that black Lucifer of yours, I will own that you can get ahead of me again, Miss Florence."
                  Florence laughed.
                  "You still remember the race we were to have run, Mr. Flint; for, if I recollect rightly, you declined the contest when you found the chances were unequal. Lucifer has lost none of his spirit, I assure you; nor his mistress any of her ambition."
                  "Ah, that last I would swear to, if swearing were admissible in the presence of ladies. And you have lost nothing in another respect, either, for you are handsomer than ever."
                  Florence bowed and smiled: she asked,
                  "Did your mother accompany you this morning?"
                  "No—but she will be along to-morrow, or, perhaps, this afternoon, as she is very anxious about my aunt."
                  "Ah," thought Florence, "I shall then have this Argus-eyed woman watching me daily, and making her ill-natured comments on all my actions."
                  Mr. Flint appeared extremely anxious to obtain some private conversation with Florence, and made several awkward attempts to edge himself nearer to her, so as to be able to speak in a low tone.
                  "You had better be careful," she remarked to him. "The boat is too narrow to be very safe, and we may be upset, which would be far from pleasant."
                  "I should then only be instrumental in introducing you to your native element," said Johnny, bowing gallantly; "for if we are truly informed, Venus sprang from the foam of the sea."
                  Thereupon Mr. Flint looked important, for he thought he had achieved quite an elegant compliment.
                  Florence laughed, and said,
                  "I am, nevertheless, very much afraid of my native element, I assure you, and should by no means enjoy a plunge in its lucid depths to-day."
                  For a few moments he became quiet, but being again seized with a desire to communicate something to his fair vis-a-vis, in stooping forward to do so, he suddenly lost his balance and fell into the water. The ladies shrieked, but when it was found that Johnny was so tall, and the stream so shallow, that he could stand on the bottom, and still have his head above its level, their shrieks turned into laughter. He scrambled to the land, wet, draggled, and miserable, and, mounting his horse, was soon lost to view.
                  The sun was at last set, and the party returned to the Springs, faded and worn out with the fatigues of the day: yet two among them was as happy at its close, as at its commencement.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XVII.
                  FLORENCE alighted from the carriage at the same spot on which she had entered it; for the pathway to the cottage was too narrow to allow its approach to the door. She was bidding adieu to the party, and preparing to walk toward her domicil, when Johnny Flint, looking less like a water god, but even more like a frightened man than when he was in the river, approached her and said,
                  "My aunt is very ill. Her seizure was sudden, and she has dispatched several messengers for you within the last hour. I went to her cottage as soon as I exchanged my wet garments, and found her in a very critical state."
                  "Has a physician been called in?" asked Florence, glancing over the crowd, while her blanched cheek testified the emotion with which she heard of the danger of her old friend.
                  "There are several here;" said Huntly. "I am well acquainted with one who is considered skillful. I will go for him immediately."
                  "Thank you—pray, do so," breathed Florence as she turned away and rapidly proceeded toward the cottage.
                  "Young Flint paused a moment to whisper a few words in Huntly's ear: he looked shocked, and remained on the spot in which she had left him, until he saw Johnny join Florence, when he slowly followed their footsteps.
                  Florence heard the voice of young Flint calling on her to stop, but she did not heed it: there had been something in his face, when he announced Mrs. Ilston illness, which struck a chill to her heart, and she thought—
                  "While I have been indulging a dream of bliss as delusive as vain, the warm love that has made my life pleasant for years, was passing from me forever. I must lose no time in reaching her: O, motherly heart, cease not to beat before the child of your affections is once more clasped to you!"
                  While she thus muttered, Johnny succeeded in overtaking her; checking her hurried walk for an instant, he drew her arm in his, and said, nervously,
                  "Miss Florence, pray do not go so fast. I have something important to say to you, and I—I really am quite out of breath."
                  Florence turned her pale face toward him and stopped.
                  "I see—I know it all," she said. "You would not seek to detain me if my dear mother could yet recognize me. She is dead."
                  "Really—really, Miss Florence, you jump to such strange conclusions, and take me up so quick, that I hardly know—"
                  "Say no more," interrupted Florence, hastily. "I know how it is. She is dead, and I was not there to receive her last look of love. I was dreaming of happiness, in which she had no share, while the angel of death hovered over her. I am rightly punished for permitting such a thought to come to me, doomed one that I am."
                  
                  The excited girl rushed onward so rapidly that the young man found it impossible to keep up with her, and as he rather dreaded the outburst of her sorrow, when she should reach the scene of death, he wisely slackened his pace, and permitted her to go on alone.
                  In a few moments Florence reached the cottage, and stood for an instant on the threshold, gazing on the scene the room presented.
                  Several ladies were there; but Florence scarcely saw them. She only beheld the wan figure, stretched like a waxen image on the couch, clad in its usual robes of snowy muslin; and so placid was that marble face, that had she not known death would greet her on her entrance, she would have thought her old friend slept. Softly approaching, she stood with clasped hands and tearless eyes beside the gentle woman, who had manifested for her orphan state the care and tenderness of a mother, and Florence formed a prayer in which she returned thanks to Heaven for the gift of so much love for so many years of her life.
                  Phœbe was wailing softly beside the bed, and after a long gaze upon the still features, her young lady turned to her, and asked in a low tone—
                  "How did it happen, Phœbe? Tell me all; I know you have not left her."
                  Her emphasis seemed to imply a reproach to herself, and the girl answered—
                  "Neither would you, Miss Flory, if you had dreamed that this would happen. She seemed much better than common, when all at once she put her hand to her heart, and asked me for some drops. I got them directly; but when I came to her, she was sittin' in her chair a leanin' back, and her eyes had sich a look they frightened me. I spoke to her, and took hold on her, but 'twant no use; her hands was cold a'ready, and its my belief that the breath left her body when she asked me for the medicine."
                  It was some comfort to Florence to know that the spirit had passed away without inflicting suffering on its earthly tenement, and she retired to the solitude of the next room, until the visitors had departed.
                  At her own earnest request, they left her to watch alone beside the dead body of her beloved friend, during the long hours of the night. They thought it a singular whim, but as Florence was an extraordinary person, they complied without comment. Mrs. Mildmay and Esther came in the course of the evening, and insisted on remaining with her, but she gently, yet firmly, declined their offers; this last service of love was all she could perform, and that she would do in solitude, which would permit her to brood over the future, and arrange her plans.
                  Florence had long looked forward to the summons which came so abruptly; but she hoped to stand beside the dying one, and receive her last look of love, ere the parting spirit passed into eternity. She had not that horror of death which many cherish, for she had long ere this been brought face to face with it, in its most ghastly form, and had learned to look upon its mystery, with calmness.
                  Length of days for herself she expected not—she scarcely desired; for until a very few hours she had not believed it possible that happiness should ever be hers. She had accustomed herself to think of her own life as a fearful dream of retribution, until the trust and hopefulness of youth were absorbed in its gloom; and now, when a new sun had risen above the cold shadows which had so long brooded over her: when bright beams of love, of trust, of future happiness, were diffusing themselves throughout the little world within herself, this sudden warning came, and destroyed the oasis which was beginning to bloom amid the arid waste of her darkened soul.
                  She accepted it as an omen, and in the solitude of that lonely watch, she calmly reviewed the past, and endeavored to decide definitely upon the future. She was free to pursue her own plans; the power to accomplish her dire purpose was hers, but again a nameless horror thrilled through her soul, and had she dared, she would have recoiled from the task which lay before her. But pale phantoms evoked from the wretched past, arose before her fancy, and seemed to wave their shadowy arms with gestures of menace at her wavering purpose.
                  While yet agitated, perplexed, tossed upon a sea of doubts and fears, she heard a light step on the verandah, and her name was softly pronounced by a voice which already had power to thrill her spirit to its inmost depths. Phœbe was soundly sleeping in the next apartment, and Florence moved at once to the open door, and extended her hand to Huntly.
                  "Pardon me," he said, in a suppressed tone, "but I have wandered near you for hours without the courage to make my presence known. You suffer, dearest Florence, with no one to console you—no one to receive your tears and sighs as a blessed link of sympathy between the afflicted and the comforter. Ah, if that were my privilege, how fortunate I should esteem myself."
                  "It may be—it is yours," she replied—"for amid the struggles of my soul this night, but one image of hope has arisen over the darkness of the future, and that was—"
                  She paused, and seemed overwhelmed with emotion.
                  "My undying, devoted love," said Huntly, fervently. "It shall replace that you have lost—fond and tender as a mother's—adoring as a lover's, it shall be. O, Florence, I have no words to tell you how much dearer in affliction you have become, than you were before this blow fell on you."
                  He had drawn nearer to her as he spoke, and passing his arm around her trembling frame, he folded her gently to his breast. Pale and agitated, she suffered her hand to rest upon it for a few brief moments, but overcoming her emotion after a struggle, she released herself from his embrace, and taking him by the hand, drew him into the room where lay the placid sleeper who would wake no more to the sorrows of earth. Florence gazed upon her with tearless eyes, and then said,
                  "She was my best friend. She did not seek to change my nature, but accepted me as I was. She pardoned my faults—loved me in defiance of them. Do you think you can be all this to one so wayward as I am? Stop—do not speak yet. Let me tell you that there are dark secrets in my soul: terrible revelations yet to come from that prison house. Dare you face them all?"
                  Huntly looked at her—she was deadly pale, and trembling with emotion. He believed the lonely watch beside the dead had slightly affected her mind, and he replied.
                  "I would look into your soul, Florence, and read its capacity to bless me, for that would be all I should care to see. Give me your earnest undivided love, and I ask no more."
                  "Would that compensate you for every evil?" she asked.
                  "I believe so—yes—I feel assured that it would."
                  "Then it is yours; and in the future, should it prove incapable of doing so, remember your own words, and attach no blame to me, should the boon of my love bring sorrow and repentance with it."
                  "That is impossible! How shall I thank you? O, Florence, beside the bed of death I dare not express the raptures of the lover, but they are not the less sincerely felt."
                  "Make no attempt to utter them: you will be required to prove the strength of your love before we can be united, but here I dare not reveal to you the service I demand. I will only tell you that strong affection, utter devotion to my wishes in one particular, can alone enable you to win the hand you see."
                  Huntly was about to reply, when Florence raised her head, and stood in an attitude of intense listening.
                  "There is some one without. I heard a footstep as it passed the door. Leave me, for innocent as our interview is, the comments of the malicious might cause me to regret that it ever took place."
                  He would have paused to say a few more words, but she pointed to the door with an air of such imperious command, that he felt forced to obey.
                  "You will be alone," he said, as he stepped over the threshold.
                  "My servant sleeps in the next room, and I am not alone when I feel that your love encircles me, and breathes hope into my saddened heart."
                  The soft tones of her voice, the tender glance of her dark eyes encouraged him to disobey her gesture, and again he approached her and pressed her hand to his lips.
                  "I leave you the happiest, the proudest of men. O, Florence, the interview of this night has made me yours forever."
                  In another moment he was gone.
                  The night was clear and star-lit, and as Huntly looked forth he saw a dark figure apparently awaiting his appearance, for he stood perfectly still with his face turned toward the cottage. With quick steps Huntly approached and recognized Eppes. He hurriedly whispered—
                  "I awoke and missed you. I surmised at once whither you had gone, and followed you. Return with me, Edgar; it is not seemly that you should be holding even a death-watch alone with this young girl. For her sake you should be more careful; for, in a public place like this, one can not be too cautious of appearances.
                  "I had no intention of entering the cottage when I came, but she was alone and in sorrow: I forgot every thing else and made my presence known to her. I do not regret it; on the contrary I rejoice that I did so, for I have obtained an assurance which has rendered me inexpressibly happy."
                  "If I understand you, Miss Ilston has accepted the love which I must say was proffered under very peculiar circumstances."
                  "Eppes, breathe not a word that can be tortured into disparagement of an angel, or our friendship is at an end," said Huntly, passionately. "I wish you had witnessed the interview, and then you would have known that the woman I intend to make my wife has no cause to blush when she recalls this meeting beside the death couch of the friend who has been a mother to her."
                  "I believe you, Edgar, and I had no design to wound by my words," replied Eppes, quietly. But is your determination irrevocable to make this young lady your wife; and has she consented?"
                  "She has, and my own purpose is fixed. Have you any objections to urge?"
                  "I had, but it is now too late. Since matters have procceded so far I shall be discreet, and hold my peace. Here we are at our own room; let us enter and sleep like sensible men, and not go wandering about like grim ghosts scared from a churchyard."
                  Eppes felt that this was not the time to bring forward the early history of Florence, and the singular bitterness and tenacity of purpose which distinguished her early girlhood. Vaguely as it was known to himself, he feared to say too much, and he knew the enthusiastic character of Huntly too well to venture to argue with him on the probable chances of happiness in the union he contemplated, while he was in his present state of mind. He, therefore, quietly addressed himself to the drowsy god, while his restless roommate paced to and fro, knocked over chairs in the dim light, and performed many other feats peculiar to unquiet lovers, he kept his eyes resolutely closed determined to be entrapped into no conversation on the perfections of a mistress toward whom, in his heart, he had a deep prejudice to combat. Toward dawn, Huntly threw himself on the bed and fell into a troubled slumber.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XIX.
                  ON the following morning, Mrs. Flint arrived at an early hour, and testified great grief and horror at the sudden fate of her respected relative. Under her superintendence active preparations were at once commenced for removing the remains of Mrs. Ilston to Elmsby, where there was a family burying ground in which her parents and her husband had been interred.
                  Mrs. Flint treated Florence with stately courtesy, reserving to herself the right to change her conduct after the will was opened; for that exemplary individual had resolved that no amount of persecution should induce her to acquiesce in the validity of a document which dispossessed the natural heirs of the property, and bequeathed it to a stranger. Florence was calm, self-possessed, and polite, and Mrs. Flint pronounced her deficient in natural feeling because she made no display of the sorrow she really felt. She was glad to be released from the charge of ordering things, and permitted that lady to have her own way in every thing.
                  While these preparations were going on, Mrs. Flint established herself in great state in the cottage, and received the visits and condolence of her numerous friends. Florence, oppressed with the subdued bustle, wandered out in the forest, and spent many hours in solitary grief beneath its shelter. Huntly sedulously kept himself informed of her "whereabouts," and, after he had allowed her a sufficient time to brood over her bereavement, he joined her, to offer such consolation as his society could afford.
                  Subdued by affliction, this stately and haughty girl was more attractive to him than ever; and his softened tones and tender words added new strength to the love Florence knew she cherished for him. Both felt that a stronger and dearer link was added to the chain which united them by the sympathy of those precious communings; and when the hour of departure at length arrived, Florence was fully impressed with the belief that the love of Huntly would refuse nothing to win her to be his bride, while he clasped to his honest heart the sincerest trust in her avowed affection for himself.
                  They parted with the understanding that he was to visit her at Mr. Mildmay's in three weeks, and then the mysterious service she demanded of him should be revealed.
                  Mrs. Mildmay accompanied the party to Elmsby, as she wished to pay that much respect to the memory of her old friend, and also to save her young one fom being left entirely at the mercy of Mrs. Flint. With many tears the kind and benevolent mistress was consigned to her last resting-place, and on the following morning the will was to be opened.
                  At an early hour Mrs. Flint and her son, Mr. and Mrs. Mildmay, Florence, and the lawyer who had drawn up the instrument, assembled in the usual sitting-room of Mrs. Ilston. Mrs. Flint was more stiff and upright than was customary even with her, and sat with her eyes elevated toward the ceiling, as if she was invoking the spirit of her departed relative to look down upon them, and if she had not been strictly just in her testamentary relations, to repent of it even in the celestial regions to which she had attained entrance.
                  Johnny seemed nervous and anxious to remind Florence of something, but she sat calm and immovable as if chiselled from marble, with her head supported on her hand in an attitude of deep meditation. When Mr. Jones unfolded the important document, and prepared to read, she raised her head and glanced at Mrs. Flint: there was a faint movement of sarcastic contempt in the curved lips as she noted the expression of that lady; she felt that her own triumph approached, and she enjoyed the idea of her old enemy's indignation when the contents of the will should become known to her.
                  Florence never once moved her eyes from that cold, hard face, while Mr. Jones went on in his monotonous voice to read the pages before him, and as he proceeded she saw surprise, anger, and disdain flash over her usually impassive features; for every acre of the real estate was bequeathed to Florence, together with the slaves, and all the outstanding moneys due to the deceased, with the exception of two thousand dollars which were to be equally divided between Mrs. Flint and her children.
                  The lawyer laid down the parchment, and Mrs. Flint said, in a voice tremulous with passion,
                  "I shall contest the will, Mr. Jones. My aunt could not have been in her sane mind when it was executed."
                  "I beg your pardon, Madam, but Mrs. Ilston was then comparatively well, and I never heard that, even in her most reduced state, she was at all weakened in intellect."
                  "That document proves most conclusively that she was. What! would any sane woman have taken a beggar——"
                  "Mother," interposed Johnny, "pray, be more——"
                  "More respectful to the usurper of my just rights, I suppose you would say," interrupted Mrs. Flint, harshly, "but I shall not submit to be trampled on by such as she is, I assure you."
                  Florence arose and confronted her, and there was such intense scorn in the expression of her face, that even Mrs. Flint was daunted. She said,
                  
                  "You will soon learn, Mrs. Flint, that such as I am, I disdain to trample on so contemptible an adversary as yourself. Your son remembers a promise that passed between us long ago, that I have always intended to ratify. Mr. Jones, pray produce the papers you have prepared by my direction since Mrs. Ilston's death."
                  The lawyer obeyed, and proceeded to read an instrument by which the Elmsby estate was divided into three portions, one of which went to Mrs. Flint, a second to her son, and the third portion, consisting of the ready moneys, was retained by Florence.
                  Mrs. Flint listened in bewildered surprise, and she scarcely believed in the reality of what was passing, until she saw the signatures of the party affixed to the papers. She then made an awkward attempt to compliment Florence on the justice with which she had acted, but the proud girl turned away and said—
                  "Make no acknowledgments to me, madam. I am too well able to judge of their sincerity by what has preceded them. The house in which we are now belongs to your son, and I am willing to remain as his guest until tomorrow, when I leave Elmsby forever."
                  As she was leaving the room, Johnny caught her hand and attempted to press it to his lips, but she hurriedly withdrew it, and quickly passed out. Mrs. Flint then relieved herself of a sense of the generosity which had been displayed by the heiress, by stating to Mr. Mildmay and his wife, that Florence must have been perfectly aware that, in a contest for the estate, the law would probably have decided her claim to be worthless, and she, therefore, had wisely taken the only course to secure to herself a fair portion without litigation.
                  The remainder of the day was spent by Florence in wandering over every part of the old domain—in visiting her favorite nooks, and bidding farewell to the negroes, with all of whom she was personally popular, and they heard with regret of the transfer which had given them to another. She planted flowers above Mrs. Ilston's grave, and watered them with her fast-falling tears.
                  Dr. Baily came in the afternoon to bid her farewell, and, as a parting gift, she bestowed on him the spirited black steed which had so often borne her restless heart, in her wild career, through the surrounding woodland. He said to her,
                  "I have learned from young Flint that my prophecy is likely to prove true, Miss Florence. The attentions of Edgar Huntly, nor the manner of their reception have not escaped him. I take the liberty of alluding to this affair because I am deeply inserested in your welfare, and Huntly himself is not entirely unknown to me."
                  The interest of Florence was at once aroused.
                  "When and where have you known him, Doctor?"
                  "Years ago I lived in the neighborhood of his father, and, at the time of his death, I was one of the physicians called in. The elder Huntly was well known to me."
                  "You can, then, probably throw some light on the singular clause in his father's will which gives Edgar Huntly's hand or his for tune to Miss Talbot?"
                  The Doctor shook his head.
                  "No—that was and is a mystery. I have always believed myself that Talbot had some secret hold on him, which forced the concession from Huntly. I know that he was seized with appoplexy immediately after signing away the unconditional right of his son to his estate; and I myself witnessed the extreme anxiety of his wife to communicate with him before his death."
                  Florence fell into a fit of musing, and, after a pause, Dr. Baily again spoke on the same subject.
                  "If the maturity of Edgar Huntly is what his youth promised, you will be a fortunate woman, Florence, in the choice you have made; and I am sure that I need scarcely say that no one will be more sincerely rejoiced to hear of your prosperity than myself. May your good angel always conquer your evil one, is the earnest wish of your old friend."
                  "Thank you, dear Doctor, but I am sadly afraid it will prove the reverse, and the evil overcome the good."
                  "Not if you will it to be otherwise, Florence; for I consider you strong to accomplish any destiny you may desire. Under the guidance of a good man, you will yet make one of my pattern women. But are you sure that you love him, Florence? Remember what I said in our last parting interview, and look well into your heart."
                  Florence blushed and smiled, and the good Doctor took her hand, and said—
                  "I see how it is, my Queen of Hearts, you have at last found a conqueror, and my best wish is, that you may love him more and more each year that you dwell together."
                  And with these words the kind man bade her farewell.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XX.
                  TWO weeks had passed away since the death of Mrs. Ilston, and Florence was once more settled beneath the roof of Mr. Mildmay. Nearly every day brought her a missive from Edgar, filled with ardent protestations of attachment, and glowing anticipations of their future happiness. He had not yet revealed the secret of their love to his mother; for, almost in the first hour of his arrival at Talbot Hall, she had been seized with a violent illness, which left her in too depressed and nervous a state to bear the knowledge that the long settled union between her son and Agnes Talbot was not likely to take place.
                  During those hours of suffering, the youthful mistress of the hall had tended her so carefully; had won so much on her affections by her gentle and womanly bearing, that Mrs. Huntly forgot her objections to the father, in her admiration of the daughter. She was fully aware of the nature of Colonel Talbot's power, and was deeply solicitous that Edgar should appreciate all the traits of excellence which she discovered in the fair Agnes; but with the quick intuition of her sex in such matters, the young girl soon discovered that she was not the one bright spirit which could make the happiness of his future life. He was friendly, attentive, and polite, but never lover-like; and the long reveries he indulged, would have revealed to her something of what was passing in his mind, even if the sly allusions of Eppes had not afforded a clue to the state of his affections.
                  Poor Agnes could only school her own heart to bear its disappointment and humiliation, without betraying them to their object; and few who looked on the placid face and heard the even tones of her sweet voice, would have dreamed of the struggle it often cost her to maintain this outward appearance of calmness.
                  She devoted the greater portion of her time to her attendance on Mrs. Huntly, and Eppes soon wearied of his quondam guardian, and the self-absorbed Huntly. He remained but a few days, and then departed on a visit to some friends, who lived in the same town in which Mr. Mildmay's residence was situated. In a small town every event is a subject of interesting gossip, and Eppes found the recent occurrences in the life of Florence, the subject of frequent comment. He listened with deep interest to the various opinions offered of her character and disposition, and after weighing well the information thus gained, he came to the conclusion that it was absolutely necessary to prevent the marriage of his friend, with this imperious and unscrupulous girl.
                  To make an appeal to Huntly, he felt assured would be utterly useless; but he knew that with all her faults, Florence was generous; and he believed her to be warmly attached to Edgar; he therefore came to the conclusion that an interview with her must be obtained, and from herself should come the decision which would break the inauspicious tie, that he felt assured must link his friend to wretchedness.
                  Eppes did not attempt to call on her, for the aversion she had already testified toward him, assured him that she would refuse to see him; but he ascertained that she took frequent lonely walks in the country around, and one evening he watched for her appearance, and followed her. When she had gained a sufficient distance from the town, to render it improbable that they should be interrupted, Eppes quickend his pace—made a slight détour from the pathway, and advanced on the one she was pursuing, as if to give their meeting the appearance of accident.
                  Florence was walking slowly, with her eyes riveted upon an open letter she held in her hand, and the intruder at once conjectured that it was one of the inpassioned epistles of Huntly. He advanced almost near enough to touch her, before she was aware of his presence; but when she raised her face, beaming with softened emotion, Eppes could scarcely believe it was the same woman, who one moment afterward looked upon himself with such an air of freezing and repulsive coldness. She bowed, and would have passed on, but he took off his hat, and stood directly in her path.
                  "Pardon me Miss Ilston, for my seeming rudeness; but I have sought this interview, with the hope that you will grant me a few moments conversation."
                  "To what purpose sir?" asked Florence, haughtily.
                  "For one, which I am afraid will seem to justify your dislike to me, Miss Ilston; but it is nevertheless the duty of a friend to interpose, and if possible avert certain wretchedness from one he loves."
                  "I do not understand you sir;" but her voice faltered, and the color faded from her cheeks, as she looked upon him, and seemed to read upon his features, his knowledge of the fell intentions which animated her heart.
                  "I am afraid that I understand you only too well, Miss Ilston, and I come to warn you from the precipice on whose brink you hold a man, whom it will destroy to plunge into guilt."
                  You use strange language, sir;" breathed, rather than uttered the agitated girl.
                  "Strange words to utter, they may be, but they are only too familiar to your mind, I am afraid. I have ascertained much of your early history, and from what I have learned, I am irresistibly compelled to come to the conclusion that you cherish the intention of gaining complete ascendancy over one impassioned heart, through your wonderful beauty and fascination; then you will tempt that loving nature to become the agent in consummating some wild scheme of vengeance, which has been cherished from childhood."
                  Florence had believed those early and childish threats to be forgotten. Her life had been so quiet, her actions so self-controled for years past, that she little expected to have her former violent language remembered and repeated to strangers, evidently to her prejudice. She stood pale and trembling, while Eppes went rapidly on.
                  "You can not deny this, for amid all you faults, truth is still cherished in your breast. I read a confirmation of my words in your changing complexion, and now I appeal to your own better nature, and ask you to spare the man you profess to love, the commission of evil to gain your hand. I warn you that his nature is not like your own; it is tender and keenly susceptible to the reproaches of conscience. In a moment of weakness he might commit a deed that would stamp his whole life with wretchedness and repentance, of which you can not realize the depth and horror. I know him, and if, as I believe, you really love him. I tell you it will be greater mercy in you to plunge a dagger to his noble heart, than tempt him to commit a guilty act. This appeal I dared not make to him, and I hazard it to you, for I must be right in my supposition, that your love is sincere, and if it is, you dare not condemn him to certain destruction."
                  He paused, and after a struggle, Florence replied—
                  He paused, and after a struggle Florence replied,
                  "My love is sincere, and I will prove it by my acts. Good evening, Mr. Eppes: seek not to follow, nor address me again. I have heard enough—no words can add to the bitterness of what you have said to me but now."
                  She turned, and hurriedly retraced her steps toward the town in a tumult of feeling and passion it would be impossible to portray. For the first time all the hideousness of her purpose stood naked before her. The words of Eppes had stripped it of the drapery with which she had sedulously concealed its most revolting features from herself, and she found that his impressions of Huntly were true. Such misgivings had already occurred to herself, but she silenced them by endeavoring to persuade herself that her devotion would be sufficient to soothe the pangs of remorse; but with this warning ringing in her ears, she could no longer believe it would possess that power.
                  Immediately on her return home she locked herself in her own room, and refused to see any one. The deep conflict with her own soul which raged within her, she could permit no human eye to dwell on, and after many hours of anguish, she seized a pen and rapidly wrote to Huntly:
                  "I can not say that my life has been destitute of brightness, for one sweet dream has cast its brief but delusive halo over its turbid current. I fancied that we might be happy, Edgar, but a faithful voice has laid bare the recesses of my own soul, and from their inmost depths rises a warning which I dare not disobey.
                  "Beloved, too-fatally, dear Edgar, you will behold me no more, though my hand falters in writing it, and tears dim my vision, it is my own decision that we part forever. I love you too sincerely to plunge you into an abyss of guilt and wretchedness. My life is vowed to one sacred purpose, and but for your good angel, who has interposed in your behalf, and turned my soul from its cruel intention toward you, I should have doomed you to the misery that must be my earthly portion.
                  "In thus renouncing you, I give you the strongest proof of my undying love for you. I can bid you forget me, though it wrings my heart with anguish; and as I write, the chilling damp of agony starts upon my brow. Yes—go among the gifted, the lovely, the high in station, and seek one who may be more worthy to claim the sacred name of wife, but no other can love you so fervently, so despairingly as she who now returns to you the vows of truth and fidelity you so lately plighted to the wretched Florence."
                  The unhappy girl sealed this letter, but retained it until she had matured the purpose which floated indistinctly through her mind. To leave Mr. Mildmay's house, and plunge into some obscure retreat to which she could not be traced, must be her first step, and a considerable sum of money which lay in the bank at L——, subject to her order, offered her every facility for doing so. She availed herself of an invitation to visit an acquaintance in the country, to accomplish her plan with greater security against detection. There seemed to her now but one object in her dreary life—to fulfill her fatal vow, and then die. Her struggling spirit yearned for the peace and quiet of the grave, but much remained before her ere it could be gained. To trace the condition of her mind for the few days which intervened before her departure, would be impossible. Her kind friends saw that some evil influence had again cast its spell around her, but they could not penetrate the icy reserve in which she wrapped herself; and seeing that her health suffered from the state of her mind, they encouraged the proposed visit, hoping it might divert the deep melancholy which threw its shadow over her.
                  She left Mr. Mildmay's residence to remain a week in the country as the family supposed, but in place of stopping at Mr. Morton's, she went on to L—— in the stage, and on her arrival there, sought out a Scotchman who had lived at Elmsby as gardener a number of years. She had been extremely kind to the wife and child of this man, and she knew she could depend on his fidelity and secresy.
                  The limits of our story will not permit us to follow Florence minutely in the course she pursued to destroy all clue to her retreat. The money she drew from the bank was the last evidence of her existence that the utmost exertions of Mr. Mildmay could obtain, until a month after her disappearance. Then a tall, solemn looking man in mourning, called on him, and informed him that his name was McConnel, and he had once been gardener and superintendent for Mrs. Ilston. Shortly before her death he removed to the neighborhood of L——, and heard nothing from the family from that time, until about a month since, when Miss Florence came to his house in a wretched state of depression and ill health, and requested them to accommodate her with lodgings, as she could no longer reside at Elmsby. He and his wife gladly complied, for they were much attached to the young lady; but on the day after her arrival, she was seized with fever which rapidly terminated toward the brain, and on the fourth day she died. A lucid interval which immediately preceeded death, enabled her to execute a brief will by which she bequeathed to McConnel and his wife the money she had drawn from the bank a few days before.
                  Mr. Mildmay's inquiries confirmed the truth of his statements in every particular; he was deeply shocked at her sudden fate, and his wife wept many tears over her loss, but both soon came to the conclusion that it was better thus perhaps than that length of days should have been given to one who seemed born to restlessness and discontent; and with them the fate of that impulsive and wayward being seemed soon to pass into oblivion.
                  It was not thus with Huntly. The reception of her letter brought him to L——, and there the news of her mysterious fate greeted him. He refused to believe it, but his half-maddened inquiries only tended to convince him that the brilliant and beautiful meteor which had crossed his path had indeed passed into the shadowy mists of eternity.
               
            
            
               PART SECOND.
               
                  CHAPTER I.
                  IN the heart of the dark and bloody ground, on the banks of a wild and turbulent stream, seeming to nestle in the rough crevices of the broken hill-side, stood a small cottage, the windows of which looked forth on the eddying waters below, and on the beetling cliffs that reared their rocky heads above and around it. A complete eagle's nest seemed this little building, and narrow and tortuous was the pathway by which it was approached.
                  Within the cottage all was simple and rugged as its outward appearance would seem to indicate; no appliances of luxury, no objects of beauty were assembled there to give ease to the body, or pleasure to the eye. The most ordinary preparations for every day existence could alone be found, and the only articles which indicated refined habits and cultivated taste, were a guitar and a common wooden case filled with a small but well-selected library.
                  On the opposite side of the stream a sunny landscape stretched away in many a dell and grassy knoll, on which the stately deer raised his antlered head in proud security. Where the hills sloped down to a gently swelling lawn, stood a large mansion, to which the pillared front and the noble trees that clustered around it, imparted an air of almost baronial grandeur.
                  In the Eyrie on the hill side, a young female lived almost alone—for her only attendant was an elderly slave who declared herself as ignorant of the former station of her mistress as those among whom she now resided. She had been purchased by Miss Ellis as she passed through L——, and immediately accompanied her new mistress to her present abode.
                  The curiosity of a country neighborhood is proverbial, but after a residence of many months at the Eyrie, as the place was called, Miss Ellis had so effectually contrived to baffle all the efforts of the curious to discover who she was, and whence she came, that she remained as much of a mystery as ever. She was rarely seen beyond the precincts of her own wild domain, and she received no visiters there, with the exception of her nearest neighbors, the proprietor of Talbot Hall and his daughter, with whom accident had made her acquainted.
                  Had Miss Ellis been either old or ugly, curiosity might soon have been lulled to sleep by the insignificance or want of attraction in her who excited it; but such was not the case. All who beheld her were struck with her rare and distinguished style of beauty. Accomplished, and highly educated she evidently was; and she possessed manners as remarkable for their elegance as their singular power of fascination; yet she appeared to shrink from all intercourse with society, and in the solitude of her romantic abode, devoted her time to the cultivation of her literary taste, and her talent for music.
                  Some said she had been disappointed in love, and avenged herself on the insensible swain by secluding from all the world charms which might have commanded the homage of any other heart. Others insisted that she was a poetess engaged in composing her first work, and had sought the solitude of the country to avoid the interruptions of society, and as proof positive, a few lines written in Agnes Talbot's album were brought forward.
                  These rumors occasionally reached the fair recluse, and elicited a transient smile of such peculiar meaning, that a physiognomist would have been puzzled to decipher it. Once she muttered, "'I bide my time,' and these silly gossips little dream of the fearful purpose which chains me to this lovely spot." Whatever the motive might be which brought her there, she continued to pursue the even tenor of her way, without troubling herself concerning the opinions of those around her.
                  It was toward the close of a pleasant evening, in the latter part of April, that Miss Ellis sat in the rustic portico in front of her cottage, with a book from which she read aloud one of Byron's most impassioned strains, for with her it was a favorite occupation to give utterance to those wild bursts of feeling which often touched an answering cord in her own impetuous heart; and her flexible voice, her clear enunciation, and perfect emphasis, gave an expression to the words she uttered, which would have charmed a lover of the histrionic art.
                  As she sat there with the gleams of the fading sunset falling around her, her brilliant face alternately beaming with animation, or shaded by thought, she must have enchained the interest of the most careless observer, for hers was indeed a rare and most attractive style of loveliness. Tall, queenlike in the majesty of her beauty, with features cast in the most commanding mould; eyes of such dark and flashing brightness as could well express the deepest and strongest passions of the soul: a ruby lip which could become tremulous with the softness of woman's gentlest mood, or curl with the unrepressed scorn of a haughty nature.
                  We have said that her eyes were very dark, and the lashes which vailed them were of the same hue, as also were the perfectly arched brows; but her hair which was peculiarly beautiful, was of a rich, golden auburn, such as a painter chooses to reflect the brightest tints of light. The tresses which have their starry representation in the midnight heaven, were not more beautiful than the silken sheen which was wreathed around the head of Florence Ellis.
                  A few straggling curls fell over the crimsoned cheek as she bent over the page before her; and a stranger gazing on her for the first time would have been struck not more with her extraordinary beauty than with the singular expression of the face. There was earnestness, passion, and pride, but no joyousness, no hope; yet she was much too young to be living the lonely and independent life she led.
                  She at length arose, and throwing aside the book, exclaimed,
                  "'Tis madness thus to indulge my morbid feelings by studying those strains which I sometimes fancy I might have written myself, so exactly do they often portray my own soul. Let me look around, and in viewing the beauties ties of nature, feel that I am but an atom in creation, and learn how trifling are my sorrows in the eyes of Him who made this bright and beautiful world. Even I, so lost, so friendless, can feel the glory of yon setting sun; a few more fleeting moments and it will vanish, leaving darkness to vail this lovely scene. Each tint is fading now as hope from my sad heart has long since taken its flight; yet yon blessed orb goes to other climes as fair, to give them life and beauty, while my life's sun is forever darkened. Alone—alone in this wide universe? My soul shivers at the thought, strong as I once believed it. This thickly peopled world is to me but a wide vacuum, which only sends back the echo of my wailing spirit for the sympathy I dare not seek—dare not accept. To suffice unto myself has been my earnest prayer; and but once have I faltered in my dreary path. But once! Ah, the recollection of that is madness! Dead—dead to him, to all who were ever interested in my fate, I am, and will be. Yet at times I am weak enough to dream of what might have been, until my soul grows faint within me, and my resolution falters. Ah, that fearful vow! When my heart would unclose to the sunshine of affection, that stern remembrance comes to chill me into stone!"
                  A footstep startled her, and quickly turning she beheld a gentleman standing within a few paces of her, and as he addressed her in a studiously respectful tone, she pressed her hand upon her heart as if to quell its tumultuous throbbing, while for an instant every shade of color retreated from her face.
                  The person who caused this emotion was a man who might have passed his forty-fifth year, but his figure was still symmetrical, and his carriage graceful. The handsome Talbot, as he had once been called, still retained many claims to the appellation, for his high brow was unseamed, his smooth cheek bore the impress of high health, and only a few threads of silver had begun to gleam amid his dark, luxuriant hair. Eminently pleasing as his appearance certainly was yet there was an expression in the habitual smile that rested on his lips, in the extreme suavity of his manners, which left the impression of insincerity with those who possessed the touchstone of truth in themselves.
                  The emotion with which he was received did not escape him, and he traced it to a cause flattering to his own vanity. With a bland smile, he said,
                  "So my fair friend, in the absence of all society, consoles herself by conversing with the trees and shrubs. Methinks they are more insensible than those the poet has immortalized, or your voice would surely elicit a reply."
                  A slight smile curved the lips of the lady, but its expression was so equivocal, it rather puzzled him.
                  "They have often replied to me, Colonel Talbot—for when in sorrow, they return sigh for sigh; and in this solitude it is not difficult to fancy the rustling of their leaves, the voice of smypathy for griefs the world knows not of."
                  "And are you so enamored of this worldless sympathy as to reject all other, lovely Florence?" he asked, with an expression which caused her to feel as if a blast from the polar regions were thrilling through her frame. "Ah, fortunate will that mau be, who shall be privileged to offer it."
                  She made a disdainful gesture, and her lips slightly curled as she said,
                  "That person does not now exist."
                  "What—so young, so enchanting, and so distrustful of the future? The volume of your life can not already be closed."
                  "No—but the end approaches," she replied, with her glance fixed on the far distance, as if she beheld some airy picture painted on the ruddy clouds that lay on the edge of the horizon.
                  "And is it not a happy one?" he asked, as he drew nearer to her. She shrank away into the farthest corner of the portico, and after a struggle said,
                  "It might once have been, perhaps; but now the irrevocable seal of fate is on it. No—happiness can never—never be mine."
                  "Ah, say not so, most lovely, most adorable girl! There beats at least one heart which would sacrifice much to bring joy to your desolate lot."
                  Florence looked on him so coldly that even Colonel Talbot was repulsed, and after an embarrassed face, she said,
                  "I presume you are the bearer of some message for me from Agnes, as I do not fancy you took this rugged walk merely to pay me a few unmeaning compliments."
                  "You are right, my charming friend. I am an ambassador from my daughter, who earnestly requests the pleasure of seeing you at the hall this evening."
                  "Agnes is disposed to be exacting," she replied, with a faint smile. "I gave to her a portion of yesterday, and now she demands this evening. I can not permit myself to be so often lured from my solitude, lest it should become distasteful to me."
                  "Ah, that is what we wish, above all things. To restore one so fitted to adorn a brilliant station to the pleasures of social life, is the earnest wish of both my daughter and myself."
                  "That can never be," she quickly replied. "Is Agnes quite alone? You know I never leave the Eyrie to encounter strangers."
                  "Not quite—but my present guests are entirely unknown to you, so you need fear none of the impertinent curiosity with which you have often been annoyed since your residence here. George Eppes, a former ward of mine, has just returned from Virginia, where he has been many months settling his claims to some property left him by a distant relative, is at the Hall; my other guest is a young friend who has suffered much from bad health and distress of mind within the past year, but I am now happy to say that he has quite recovered both health and spirits, and visits my house in the character of my future son-in-law."
                  Florence turned away her face, that the deathlike sickness of soul which she felt was portrayed on its expressive lineaments, should be unseen by the self-satisfied speaker. She forced herself to say,
                  "And my friend Agnes is betrothed?"
                  "Yes, and has been from childhood. The marriage would have taken place some time since, but unfortunately Edgar met with a brilliant girl who fascinated him so entirely that he forgot the contract which already existed. I am pleased now, however, to see that he seems to consider its fulfillment the only avenue to happiness for him."
                  The listener breathed a sigh so deep that he was about to make some comment on it, when she hurriedly asked,
                  "And the rival? What became of her?"
                  "She fortunately—perhaps I should not say so—but in fact it was fortunate, on many accounts, that she did die, for she would not only have won my daughter's betrothed husband from her, but she would have played the mischief with myself; for I ascertained that she was a distant cousin of my own, who imagined she had some deadly cause of complaint against me."
                  "And was there no foundation for it?" asked Florence, with eyes which gleamed so fiercely that if the gathering twilight had not concealed their glitter, he must have been startled.
                  "Why, ye-e-s, perhaps there was; but it is long ago, and I forget. I never permit myself to think of what is disagreeable."
                  Florence felt as if she could have struck him as he stood. Yes, he had forgotten the bitter wrongs which had brought ruin and death on all her young heart clings to, and stamped her own lot with desolation that would yet end in crime. By a violent effort she controlled the emotion which blanched her cheek to the hue of death, and said,
                  "I can not leave home to join your party, Colonel Talbot. I am not in spirits to enjoy society this evening."
                  "I deeply regret your decision, my fair friend, as it will deprive me of all my anticipated enjoyment. Here is a note from Agnes; her eloquence may prevail where mine has failed."
                  "I will deprive it of all chance to do so, by declining to read it in your presence. Tell Agnes, if you please, that I am not disposed to see company: she is accustomed to my wayward humors, and knows how to excuse them."
                  Finding his eloquence of no avail in changing her decision, Colonel Talbot reluctantly took his leave, and carefully descended the narrow and precipitous pathway which led toward the bank of the stream, where a rustic bridge, formed of two immense moss-covered logs, spanned its breadth.
                  With many varying emotions, Florence watched his receding figure, and her lips grew white with repressed passion, while words broke unconsciously from them.
                  "Aye, there he goes! the crafty, the deserted! The destroyer of the parents and the wooer of their child; yet must I greet him with assumed calmness until the hour arrives in which I shall dare to make the terrible revelation of my identity with that Florence he thinks in her grave. Ha! not yet—not yet. Before Fate folds her pall around me, you must learn why I came hither, O, most forgetful of men! Bury the wrongs you have inflicted in oblivion—I will dig them up again, and hold them before your shrinking eyes in such a lurid flame of vengeance that they shall scorch and wither your cowardly soul."
                  Nearly a year had passed away since Florence caused to be acted the sad drama of her own death. Through the agency of McConnel the Eyrie was rented, and herself safely settled in it under an assumed name, without a suspicion of her identity on the part of any one: thus cut off from every former association, her mind had brooded with deeper intensity on the one absorbing theme which she firmly believed Fate pointed out to her as the only object for which life had been bestowed on her. Separated forever from Huntly, she was indifferent of the future; to die in accomplishing her fatal mission, was her earnest wish; yet with the natural shrinking of her sex from the actual commission of a deed of blood, she had hitherto withheld her hand from striking the final blow. In her present position she was restless and wretchedly unhappy; she began to feel life a burden she would gladly lay down, and vague thoughts of self destruction had already startled her mind.
                  She broke the seal of the note as she continued to mutter,
                  "This, too, I must bear, and teach myself to rejoice in, for I would have Edgar happy. Yet am I soon forgotten! A few brief months and he is consoled by the smile of another. Yet Agnes is worthy of him; methinks were she the child of any other man, I could love her passing well."
                  Yet spite of her words, there was a cold and deadly feeling of despair clinging around her heart. She had relinquished Huntly herself; had placed even the ban of death between them, but it was with the full belief that her memory would be long and dearly cherished, and the announcement so unexpectedly made by Colonel Talbot, had shaken her to her inmost soul. With such a woman as Florence to love once was to love forever, and after all her efforts to conquer this feeling, she still found herself its future slave.
                  The note from Agnes contained but few lines:
                  "Come to us, dearest Florence; it is my earnest wish to make my best-loved friend known to him who will soon claim me as his bride. He is here, beside me now, while I trace these lines, and my trembling heart is filled to overflowing with happiness too deep for words. Come, beloved Florence, and by your sympathy make doubly dear the bliss of your friend Agnes"
                  "Come," repeated the proud girl—"never! What! go to your stately dwelling, obscure, unknown, to see him received as the betrothed of another! Ah, no—that can never be. Poor, simple girl! one word from me, and all your brilliant schemes of happiness are dispelled as the fantasy of a dream. He loved me as even man loves but once, and did he know that I am near him, he would leave your side, and seeking to reproach, he would remain to love me still."
                  She crushed the note in her hand with such force that the nails pierced the flesh, and a drop of blood stained the paper. She grew pale, and shuddered; then smiling with an indefinable expression, she continued,
                  "Ha! 'tis well that I should recoil from the sight of blood. Pooh! I am a woman still, spite of all my efforts to overcome this weak shrinking from even the appearance of suffering."
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  IT was midnight: the pale stars of Heaven were shining over lawn and river, and silence wrapped the scene, save the soft murmur which ever rises from the great heart of nature. The ripple of the wave, the rustling of the foliage, and the faint chorus of the insect tribe, thrilled the dewy air with their fairy-like melody: Agnes Talbot stood beside an open window, alone with her own bright-fancies and happy heart. One fair hand rested on the strings of her guitar, which Huntly had brought in from the summer house and placed across the window seat. They had parted from each other but a few moments before, and she stood upon the same spot on which he had left her, wrapped in the delicious dream of a first love which she now believed was fully reciprocated by its object. A smile of inexpressible sweetness first parted her rosy lips, and there was so much innocence—so much trustfulness in that childlike face, that it seemed almost sacrilege to dream that the cares and sorrows of life should ever touch a being so formed for companionship with all that is bright and beautiful in nature.
                  The night wind sweeping over the chords o the instrument, aroused the young dreamer, and the smile upon her lip brightened as she murmured,
                  "Won at last! My triumph is complete. Until now, I never felt the value of this frail and fleeting beauty, for Edgar's eyes have told me that I am lovely in his sight."
                  Yet a sigh followed the smile, for she felt her hold upon the wayward heart of man to be feeble indeed, if beauty alone wove the spell she cast around him; yet hers might have touched even the heart of a stoic.
                  The figure of Miss Talbot was slight and fairy-like, yet preëminently graceful. Her complexion was of the purest shade of the lily—too fair, perhaps, but when excited, her cheek was eloquent of the emotions which swept over her soul. 
                        
                           "The various shades
                           Of sorrow and of gladness came and went
                           With almost every pulse; like the uncertain
                           And silent memory of dreams."
                        
                      Her hair of pale brown, hung in long curls nearly to her waist, and the wreath of natural flowers which drooped over her brow, harmonized with the delicate character of her beauty. Her eyes were of the deep blue of the midnight heaven, when no cloud dims its clearness; hers was that fragile loveliness which fades like a dream in a few fleeting years; but while it lasts, wields an irresistible influence over all who behold it.
                  Yet beneath that wild and placid exterior was concealed a depth of feeling—a power of endurance which few would have imagined. The calm waters of the lake, which mirror each passing object in their quiet depths, may be lashed in the fury by the storm; and the heart of that young and trusting girl may awake from its charmed sleeping to struggle with the tempest, with no voice to whisper to the billows of anguish which may deluge her stricken soul, "peace be still."
                  Yielding, gentle, and timid, with nerves so highly strung that they vibrated to the slightest touch of sorrow. Agnes was one to be cherished with the tenderest affection. The petted darling of her parents, the faults of her disposition had been fostered by the training she had received. Colonel Talbot regarded gentleness and submission as the loveliest traits of the female character, and as a woman he considered his daughter nearly perfect. He did not reflect that she who was so beautiful an illustration of a "meek and quiet spirit," was utterly unfitted to struggle with the many ills it might be her lot to encounter in her pilgrimage through life, for no fate is free from the shadows which the wings of old Time may cast, and woman's lot is often one of bitter trials, which even the most watchful affection may not have power to avert.
                  Until this night, Agnes had tortured herself with the belief that she might be wooed from interested motives. The one who had been preferred before her, haunted her mind, and she felt that it would be far better to be slighted by Huntly as she once had been, than become his bride while he shrined the image of his first love in the innermost sanctuary of his spirit; than to give her tender and devoted affection for the dust and ashes of a passion which the voice of interest had commanded manded him to bury in the grave of her who had elicited it. But on that evening when they sat alone, he had raised the vail from his heart—he bared before her all its weakness—all its suffering: he revealed the whole history of his unhappy passion for the brilliant being whose memory he freely confessed was still inexpressibly dear to him. The stunning blow her farewell letter had inflicted, so soon followed by her death; were eloquently described; but the suffering was past; reason and health had returned, and he bade her be just to her own attractions, and believe that the voice of affection alone had prompted his present choice.
                  Agnes listened, believed, and was happy.
                  On the following evening Huntly accompanied Agnes in a walk toward the Eagle's Nest, as far as the rustic bridge, which united the grounds of Talbot Hall with those on the opposite side. Agnes had talked much of her new friend to her lover, and a scarcely acknowledged feeling of interest had sprung up in his mind toward one so lonely and self-sustained as the fair recluse. Her name, too, sent a thrill through his heart, and many of the traits described by Agnes brought so vividly before him the image of her he believed sleeping in her quiet grave, that he felt an almost feverish desire to behold her.
                  Yet of this there seemed no chance, as Florence positively refused to receive visiters, and within the few days he had been at the Hall, even Agnes was excluded from her domicil. This evening she resolved to make another effort to see her, and Huntly promised to await her return near the bridge. As they parted, Agnes paused and said,
                  "We are now on enchanted ground; for this land belongs to the domain of the mysterious lady, as Miss Ellis is called in the neighborhood. I wish I dared take you with me to the Eyrie, but that would only insure my own dismissal."
                  "How long has this young girl resided there?" asked Huntly.
                  "About eight months."
                  "And you still know nothing of her former history?"
                  "Nothing—for there is a dignified reserve about her which repels curiosity. I am contented to know that she is refined, intellectual, and companionable—that is with me; and in spite of the mystery that envelopes her, I love and confide in her as if she were my sister."
                  "But how were you able to overcome her singular reserve, and form an acquaintance with her?"
                  "That was the result of accident. At first she was as distant toward me as to all others. One evening I had been walking alone in the park, and, as twilight came on, I hurried forward to reach the hall before it became quite dark. I saw a tall figure approaching me, which I knew at once was our new neighbor; to reach the bridge she must pass very near me, and I determined to linger that I might obtain a view of her person. I was so intent on my purpose, that I stooped carelessly; I was on a narrow path just above the brow of the cliff; and I lost my footing, and slipped toward its edge. Florence sprang forward, grasped my dress, and drew me back in safety. I was heartily frightened; but I did not regard that, when I found that the acquaintance thus commenced was permitted to ripen into intimacy; and even my father is now received on the score of his daughter's favor."
                  Agnes gracefully kissed her hand to him as she concluded, and sprang up the rugged pathway. Huntly watched her flitting figure winding through the narrow way, until she entered the cottage; and there was a feeling of bitter self-condemnation in his heart. He felt that he was practicing a willful deception on himself, and periling the happiness of another; yet the artless devotion of this beautiful girl was so great a value to his wounded and stricken soul, that he could not forego its possession; although the resemblance which appeared to him accidental, between the description of her new friend and the being he had lost, touched a chord in his heart that vibrated even to agony.
                  Agnes was determined to be admitted, and she at once entered the room usually occupied by Florence with no other ceremony than a light tap on the door to announce her presence. She found her seated beside the open window, wearing an air of suffering and languor, which at once aroused the sympathy of her fair visitor. Her rich bloom had faded to a marble-like pallor, and the inward struggle which had now continued several days, might be read in the drooping figure, and the expression of soul-weariness which rested on her expressive features. Florence had spent many hours in endeavoring to nerve herself for the meeting with her who would soon become the bride of Huntly; and no wonder that her cheek was pale, that her strong spirit was bowed to the dust before the iron grasp of a destiny from which she felt herself incapable of escape.
                  Exhausted by the conflict, she was now reckless of what might follow—like one in extremity who desperately strikes in the dark, she left events to work out their own fulfillment, while she remained a passive instrument in the hands of Fate. In the presence of this pale Nemeses entered the young visitor with cheeks glowing with exercise, and eyes radiant with happiness. She started back as her eye fell on the person of Florence, but in another moment she was beside her, with her cold hands clasped in her own.
                  "You are ill, my friend, and you have repelled me—refused to see me. Ah, Florence, was this well?"
                  "I am suffering from nothing more serious than a nervous head-ache," replied Florence, with a faint effort to smile. "Believe me, I shall soon be quite recovered. Sit beside me and tell me of all that has occurred at the Hall within the past few days. I like sometimes to hear of the world which I now never enter."
                  Agnes placed herself on a low seat at the feet of Florence, and with her bright face raised toward her, said—
                  "Ah, you know not how much you have missed by refusing to join us. Both my guests are very fine musicians, and much as you love sweet sounds, you would have enjoyed our little concerts exceedingly."
                  "And you were very happy, Agnes?"
                  "Happy! ah, was not one beside me whose sweet tones are sweeter far to me than the softest strains ever wafted to the ears of mortal?"
                  "And that favored one was your betrothed. Happy girl! This is the charmed period of your life; for the spell of trusting love is on it. Pity it is, that you should ever awake from its enchantment."
                  "If I am aroused," replied Agnes, with quiet earnestness, "it will be to the 'sober certainty of waking bliss.' Ah, it is my duty as my destiny to love him to whom I have been affianced from childhood. Twice have we met since those juvenile days, but until now, he was so cold, so neglectful, that I scarcely dared to yield to the dictates of my heart. But now all is changed. He follows my footsteps; dwells upon my words, and seems to live but in my presence. But, good heavens! Florence, you are ill—what—what is the matter?"
                  Well might she ask that question; for Florence had started up, and stood before her with cheek, lip, and brow blanched to the hue of death. With a gesture almost of loathing, she shook off the hand of Agnes, and her large eyes seemed to dilate with anger, mingled with feelings of a deeper and far more painful nature. Pressing her hand upon her heart, a faint cry escaped her lips, and she was forced to cling to her chair for support.
                  Agnes sat white and cold, a terrified witness to this inexplicable emotion. Suddenly she grasped the hand which had been almost torn from her grasp, and asked with tremulous earnestness—
                  "Florence, have you ever met Edgar Huntly? Yet why should I ask such a question; for once having gazed upon your matchless beauty, he could have no thought to bestow on me. Last night, as we sat alone, he described to me with impassioned eloquence the being he once had madly loved, from whom death had severed him; even as he spoke, your image arose before me, and I felt that a woman yet lived who could realize the picture he drew."
                  "And did you say so?" asked Florence in a suppressed tone, as she sunk back on her seat.
                  "Ah no—I had not then the courage to call your name, for, spite of my better reason, the fear was on my heart that if I breathed the thought that crossed my mind, he might seek, might love you; and I should be left desolate. But to-day I am more rational, and I spoke of you myself without reserve, and endeavored to interest him in you as my friend."
                  "Alas! alas!" murmured Florence, unconsciously; as she passed her hand caressingly over the shining hair of her companion; for her better feelings were touched by her artless words. Agnes started, and the color slowly returned to her pale cheek, as she said—
                  "Why should you say alas to me, dear Florence? Am I not one whose lot is bright with happy prospects for the future? The daughter of an indulgent father, who seeks my happiness alone, and triumph more complete, the chosen one of him I truly love?"
                  "I know not why I said alas," replied Florence, gloomily; "for your path indeed seems covered with flowers. Perhaps my heart is sad to think of its own desolate lot—perhaps my ominous glance cast over your future can detect the dark shadows from which not even the sun is free. It was my own fantasy. Yet tell me, Agnes, what your lover said of her he once had loved. Was it not strange wooing to dwell upon the praises of your rival?"
                  "I did not think so. He spoke of her as one of the most highly endowed, and brilliant among women. He loved her with the fervor of a first attachment, and that passion he freely confessed could never be entirely forgotten. It had left its lightning marks too deeply stamped upon his soul to be cast into oblivion; yet the remembrance of it, he declared, could not take from his affection for me one shade of its deep tenderness."
                  "Ah! said he that! Then has he indeed forgotten!" murmured Florence so softly that Agnes could not catch the meaning of her words. Turning to her visitor, she said—
                  "You will pardon my strange conduct, dear Agnes, when I inform you that this day is the anniversary of my mother's death. She was taken from me under circumstances of peculiar suffering, and the recollection of it comes back to me with such subduing power at times as to unfit me for all social intercourse."
                  Tears sprang into the eyes of the sensitive Agnes; for the memory of her own lost mother was fresh in her heart, and her voice faltered as she replied—
                  "I can readily pardon any emotion, my friend, that springs from so sacred a source. I will leave you to indulge your regrets in solitude, for that I know is best for those who keenly suffer. I will see you again tomorrow, and, before that time arrives, I trust you will be restored to your usual health and spirits."
                  Florence stood beside the window and watched her receding figure until she crossed the bridge and joined Huntly; and there was a feeling of irrepressible bitterness in her soul as the two lingered along the pathway, and finally disappeared beyond the brow of the cliff.
                  She threw herself back, and closed her her eyes that she might "meditate to madness" on the strange and wayward destiny to which she had devoted herself. A tap on the door aroused her from her painful reverie, and raising her eyes she beheld Colonel Talbot. In the dim twilight he could not note the expression of her features; but there was a tone in her voice which startled him as she demanded, to what circumstance she owed the honor of so late a visit.
                  "I have ventured to intrude," he replied, in his blandest manner, "in the hope that the presence of a friend may possess the power to dispel the gloom which I am informed has settled on your spirits. Permit me to hope, dear Miss Ellis, that for a few brief moments I can chase away the cloud that darkens your brow."
                  As he spoke, he drew a chair near her, and made an attempt to take her hand, but Florence drew it back so haughtily that he felt himself repulsed. He fully believed that flattery and perseverence could win any woman; but the scornful coldness of his strange neighbor had hitherto baffled him. Florence said—
                  "I am sorry that the clouds are too dense to be dispersed even by the presence of Colonel Trlbot. I am seriously indisposed this evening, and beg that you will excuse me. Some other time I may be more in the mood to appreciate the fascinations of your society."
                  The listener was accustomed to the sarcasms of his fair adversary, and was only strengthened by them in his determination to succeed in disarming them of future power to wound. He bowed, and replied.
                  "Nay, fair Florence, it is I who feel honored in being treated thus unceremoniously. But, before I go, tell me if you have reflected on the contents of the letter I sent to you this morning? Have you well weighed my proposal, and may I carry hence the hope so dear to me of——"
                  Florence interrupted him.
                  "Had you permitted me, I would have avoided this subject on this evening above all others. You could not have chosen a time in which my mind could be less propitious to your suit."
                  "Forget, then, that I have spoken, and I will await your own time. Let me hope for a favorable answer at least, and I can well undergo a probation with such a reward in view."
                  "I should be grateful for this unworldly offer," began Florence, in a subdued tone, which seemed to Talbot to be full of repressed feeling; and so it was, but of such a nature that he would have recoiled from its deadly meaning as from the fang of the adder, could be have comprehended the fearful struggle raging in her bosom. He interrupted her with much vehemenee—
                  "I ask not gratitude—'tis too cold a feeling for such as you to speak of. Tell me that I do not aspire in vain to win your love."
                  She shuddered, and a position of the truth seemed to force itself from her pale lips.
                  "No—no—no—love is impossible. I have had my dream, and its memory is with me still. You know not what you ask when you demand love of me—it would be like gathering flowers from the graves of the dead."
                  "I too have loved before; but never better than now. One passion exhausts not the fount of feeling in such wildly throbbing hearts as yours. Permit me to place you in that sphere you are so fitted to adorn, peerless Florence; you can not be happy in this solitude, with none to love, none to appreciate you as you merit."
                  "You judge truly, I am not happy. To become the mistress of Talbot Hall might be a temptation to some; but were I to become your bride, I should think of you alone."
                  "Thanks—thanks!" he rapturously began; but she coldly continued—
                  "You are premature in your thanks, Colonel Talbot. I have not yet said that I would be yours. Give me two days to reflect—do not seek me during that time, and I promise you that I will then give you a decided answer."
                  The lover murmured many thanks and protestations, and, spite of her efforts to withdraw it, he seized her hand and pressed it to his lips; but he almost recoiled from its icy touch, and he felt that it quivered and trembled in his grasp, but with what utter repulsion and abhorrence he little dreamed. He left the house in a state of great exultation, and his thoughts were full of bright anticipations of future happiness, as he strode along—
                  "I shall yet win this brilliant and imperious beauty," he mused. "There is a strange magic in her beauty which attracts me toward her with a strength I have no power to resist; yet at times there is a tone in her voice which startles me, and makes the blood leap quicker to my heart. It rings a sad knell on my conscience, and brings back the memory of a broken heart. Yet they are not alike: this creature, so full of passive energy and pride, has little in common with that blighted blossom of my mother's house. Ah, Florence, I must find the means of overcoming your indifference; for you must, you shall be mine."
                  It was a proof of the singular fascination Florence possessed, that this worldly-minded man was indifferent to the strange position she occupied: to the evident mystery which surrounded her. To win her on any terms, was all he asked.
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  AN unaccountoble gloom seemed to pervade the evening circle at the Hall. Agnes sat in the recess of a window, and Huntly lingered near her, silent and preoccupied. He vainly endeavored to arouse himself from the vague feeling of depression which sat as a nightmare upon his soul. The cloud that hovered over his destiny had already cast its shadow over him, and he felt its depressing influence. Uncertain glimpses of the future are sometimes vouchsafed in the shape of presentiments, but they invariably come to us in darkness. Hope tinges the unattained with hues of brightness which fade away as we draw toward its accomplishment; but Fear mirrors an obstacle in our path, and amid the mists of the future, it looms indistinctly as a giant spectre, striking gloom and terror to the soul.
                  Near a shaded lamp sat Colonel Talbot and Eppes, apparently absorbed in a game of chess; but a glance which the younger player occasionally cast toward the window, seemed to indicate that his thoughts were more occupied with what was passing there, than with the game before him.
                  Colonel Talbot spoke—
                  "Another such move more, George, and I shall checkmate you in five minutes. Where are your thoughts wandering? I never saw you play so wildly before."
                  "Excuse me, sir; I was thinking of the chances of being checkmated in a game of far more importance to me."
                  "Ah, indeed! A disappointment in the outset of life is often the cause of a man's after success. Let that console you."
                  "Thank you—that is a kind of philosophy I am content to leave to Job and his disciples. I have not the least desire to profit by it."
                  "Very few have, I believe. That last move gives me checkmate at once. Shall we play again?"
                  "Excuse me, dear sir. I am not in the mood."
                  Eppes arose and strolled toward the pair near the window. He was still ignorant of the true position of Huntly and Agnes toward each other, and he viewed the attentions of the former with a jealous and mistrustful spirit. He had known the depth and earnestness of Huntly's love for Florence better than any other, and he felt convinced that too short a period had elapsed to heal the wound her desertion and supposed death had inflicted on him. Why, then, should he be so lover-like in his attentions to Agnes?
                  Colonel Talbot arose, walked across the floor, and then said—
                  "We are extremely quiet this evening. Come, Agnes, give us some music. Perhaps it may break the spell which seems to be upon us all, to-night."
                  Agnes obeyed; she sang very sweetly, and accompanied her voice with the guitar.
                  "You have improved very much since you and Miss Ellis have practiced together," said her father. "Give us the last song you learned with her. Come hither, Huntly, and listen to this most exquisite melody."
                  Huntly arose and stood beside the chair of the performer, but his thoughts were far, far away; the first notes of the prelude were familiar to him, and he had no thought for the fair being who swept the strings with her slender white fingers. From other lips he had heard that melody, and the memories which had slumbered came back to his soul in all their vividness and power. The voice of an angel might have floated around him, and he would not have heeded it: the thrilling music of the tones that had first spoken to his heart was ringing in his memory—the brilliant face of his first love was smiling before him, and he felt as one suddenly cast out from light and hope into the lowest deeps of wretchedness and desolation.
                  Agnes finished her song, and turned with a bright smile to address him. Her eyes fell on his stern countenance, his firmly knit brow and compressed lips, and she saw that he was endeavoring to master painful emotion. She timidly said,
                  "The song does not please you."
                  He did not wish her to penetrate the cause of his gloom, and he made a faint attempt to smile, as he replied—
                  "The air is pretty, but the sentiment is untrue. The words seem designed to illustrate the truth of the French proverb, "On revient toujours à ses premiers amours," than which nothing, in my opinion, can be more false. I should have utter self contempt if I had not sufficient strength of purpose to banish from my heart the love that can no longer make its happiness."
                  The lips of Agnes moved, but she did not utter any audible words. She took a rose from her bouquet and presented it to him with a smile of such assured happiness that his heart smote him as he felt how little in unison were their feelings. He bowed over the fair hand, and pressed the flower to his lips with an air of gallantry which to one more skilled in the ways of the world, would have betrayed the absence of that heart-felt affection which is too sacred for outward show.
                  This silent expression of confidence and mutual understanding did not escape Eppes. He examined the faces of the two with the keenest scrutiny, and a shade of deep displeasure settled on his features as he marked the undisguised devotion of Huntly during the remainder of the evening.
                  "I will probe his soul this night," he thought. "If I am to resign her to a rival, I will, at least, endeavor to secure her happiness. I will speak openly to Huntly, and by the bright heaven above us, if he dares to trifle with her, he shall dearly repent it."
                  The two friends occupied adjoining apartments, and Huntly had scarcely closed his door, when Eppes demanded admittance. He walked up and down the floor several moments, at a loss to commence conversation on so delicate a subject. Aware of the secret of his own heart, he feared that his friend might misconstrue his interference.
                  At length Huntly laid his hand on his arm, and said,
                  "Well, George, what is it? That brow portends something, though I am at a loss to know what it can be."
                  "To be frank, then, I wish to ask you a few questions, which I fear you may consider impertinent."
                  "Speak freely, man; our intimacy may surely warrant a few liberties."
                  "Well, then, to begin. What has brought you hither? and what is your purpose in devoting yourself so assiduously to Miss Talbot?"
                  "I will answer you as briefly as you question. I came hither because it suits both my humor and my interests to be on this spot; and it is surely proper to devote myself to the woman I intend to make my wife."
                  "And do you mean to say that such are your intentions in reference to Agnes Talbot?"
                  "I do—and now it is necessary to make an explanation to you which I have hitherto withheld from delicacy toward Agnes. I have been betrothed to her from boyhood, but until very recently I have not given my own consent to fulfill the contract; hence you may understand my silence on the subject."
                  The struggle in the breast of Eppes was brief, but severe. Pride conquered the pang of knowing himself rivalled, and he seated himself near Huntly with more calmness than he could once have believed possible, while suffering from so severe a blow to his most cherished hopes. He earnestly said,
                  "Tell me truly, Huntly, have you recovered from the recent anguish you have endured sufficiently to appreciate, at its true worth, the devotion of such a heart as you are now seeking to appropriate?"
                  "I hope—I trust so, George; for Agnes is the choice of both my reason and my affection. I will not conceal from you that there are strong worldly motives for my union with Miss Talbot, but I do not think I have been unduly influenced by them."
                  Huntly then concisely related the history of the will, and all the interests involved in the accomplishment of the marriage, Eppes saw at a glance.
                  "It is strange," said he, "that I lived so long under Colonel's Talbot's guardianship and heard nothing of this before. My letters from college were often filled with anecdotes of you, and yet Agnes never once hinted that she stood in so peculiar a position toward you."
                  "Agnes naturally shrank from the mention of such an affair, and, to tell you the truth, I believe Colonel Talbot did not wish it spoken of, because he had a vague belief that I would never return to fulfill the contract."
                  "And you really had no such intention I presume, or you would not have thrown yourself at the feet of another, whom death alone prevented you from claiming as your bride."
                  "True—I preferred Florence to all the world—I would have sacrificed fortune to win her, and thought myself the gainer in the exchange. That is the dark page in my life, to which I do not willingly refer: that unfathomed mystery remains a doubt and a torment to me yet. At times, it seems to me impossible that the vivid existence should so soon have succumbed to our mortal lot, and passed into the forgetfulness of the tomb. Could my life endure an age, the remembrance of that enchanting being would never fade from my brain. Agnes is gentle and lovely. She is very dear to me, but she can never be to me what Florence was. Life with her will be passed as a quiet monotonous dream; but with the highly endowed, the intellectual Florence, my highest capacities—my most exalted feelings would have been called into action. O, my friend, I have striven to forget her, but even beside my destined bride, her brilliant image rises before me, dimming her placid loveliness, and destroying the music of her tones, as I recall a voice of more soul thrilling melody which one breathed to me the vows of love and constancy."
                  "If such are your feelings," said Eppes, gravely, "I grieve for both the fate of yourself and Agnes. Poor girl! The fair promise of her opening life will, I sadly fear, prove but the brightness of the lightning's glare which precedes the storm."
                  "You wrong me, Eppes. Agnes shall never know that she is not loved as I feel she deserves. I have not concealed from her the history of the past."
                  "And she, woman like, forgave all your past neglect; all your devotion to another. Well indeed may you believe she loves you," said Eppes with some bitterness. "Most earnestly do I congratulate you; for, in my opinion, Agnes Talbot will render you a far happier man than the wayward and exacting Florence ever could have done. Such spirits as hers were never formed for contentment: like the mountain torrent that dashes on its reckless course, destroying all that impedes its progress, her impetuous spirit never knew rest until the icy touch of death chilled its passionate fervor. Good night, Edgar, it grows late, and I will no longer detain you from your slumbers."
                  With a sigh given to the vanquishing dreams which had once played around his heart, Eppes left the apartment to reconcile himself as well as he might to the necessity of resigning the love of his boyhood and youth to one who gave her but the wrecks of a former passion, which death itself had been unable to extinguish.
                  Huntly passed the greater portion of the night in recalling scenes and events which his conversation with his friend had brought with renewed vividness to his memory. Vainly did he invoke the image of his fair betrothed to exorcise that of her rival. Florence bloomed before him again—her voice seemed to call on him in the silence of night, and tears of bitter regret for her loss were suffered to fall unheeded; for only the eye of Heaven was there to witness his weakness. Once in his troubled walk he paused near the window and chanced to look toward the Eagle's Nest. He saw a light gleaming forth, and he fancied that he could see a figure pacing to and fro, occasionally interrupting the tremulous line of brightness which streamed out in the midnight air.
                  Rivited to the spot as by some spell, he watched those uncertain motions, and felt an attraction toward the lovely spirit which kept sad vigils there, that he could neither understand nor overcome.
                  "I must see her," he said aloud. "The description given me of this girl, by Agnes, interests me more than I thought any stranger ever could again. O yes, I must see her."
                  With this determination he retired to bed, but not to sleep, and for that night, at least, he realized the truth of the proverb he had derided in the earlier part of the evening—"On revient toujours à ses premiers amours."
               
               
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  FRAGMENT of a letter from Agnes to a young friend:
                  "This is the first time for many weeks, my dear Ellen, that I have attempted to address you; and now it is a poor compliment to bestow my tediousness upon you.
                  This morning, for the first time for many days, I have risen with a cloud upon my spirits. This portion of my life will be remembered by me, as one of those bright spots which fate sometimes sends to the dreariest lot. Ah, these days have been more like one continued burst of sunshine to my happy heart, than the light and shade which usually checker the path of human life.
                  A few more weeks and I shall claim the promise made by you, to act as my bridesmaid, for I am about to be united to Edgar Huntly, with my own full and entire consent. How fortunate is that woman who weds the object of her first affection! No blight—no shadow comes to dim the clear truth and faith of such a love. Ah, I must not say that, for true love never existed without a little shadow of jealousy. It is so terrible to look into your own heart, and find there loyalty, devotion, and changeless love; then to look into the eyes of that one on whom they are bestowed, and find a vail between that soul and your own. How disheartening it is, to feel that we can never thoroughly know the inner life of another, however dear or necessary that other one may be to our happiness. A thousand fancies, hopes, and dreams, may be stored away in some deep corner of that heart we fondly claim as our own, into which we are never permitted to cast even a glance. Truly, we are a terrible mystery!
                  I know not why I am sad to-day. My spirits are too susceptible, and trifles which with others would have no weight, often carry a cold and deadly chill to my heart, for which I vainly chide myself. If "coming events cast their shadows before," this day must surely be one of dark augury to me, for there is a weight upon my heart which seems as if it will crush it.
                  Do you remember the description I gave you of our mysterious neighbor, Miss Ellis? Well, if I confess the whole truth, I believe my depression springs from an absurd fear, that Edgar may seek her acquaintance, and in her many fascinations, forget one whose only merit is her true love for himself.
                  Huntly has not concealed from me the history of a first passion, the object of which is now dead; but in the description of her he had loved, there was so much that reminded me of Florence, that my heart died within me.
                  Should he meet her—should he too recognize this resemblance, he would surely love her, and I——"
                  Agnes threw her pen aside, and leaning her head upon her hand, sat absorbed in painful reverie; this was interrupted by the entrance of her father, carrying a small parcel in his hand.
                  "My darling Agnes, why do I find you so sad and pale?" he inquired. "Hast had a lover's quarrel this morning? Speak, my child; why do you wear looks so little suited to a happy bride-elect?"
                  Agnes smiled, faintly.
                  "No lover's quarrel, believe me, dearest father, causes the cloud upon my brow. My spirits ever have been most variable; and when they should be most joyful, a vague feeling of sadness often falls upon them. I have been, been idly thinking that the day may come when Edgar's love will be less devoted—less tender than now."
                  "What then, silly child?" asked her father, playfully. Is not such ever the history of the heart? Perfect devotion you can not always expect, for what sayeth the poet?
                  "And still as passion sobers in its vow,
                  The angel darkens from the mortal's brow."
                  "What then?" repeated Agnes, sadly. "Ah, should he change, there is nothing left for me, but to lie down and die! I, who have been woed to his noble heart, have felt his smile to be the sunshine of my life; his praise the only music that I cared to hear. Ah! could I loose them, and yet live?"
                  "Silly self-tormentor," exclaimed Colonel Talbot with some asperity, "has he not sought you—won you to be his? What other proof of his affection would you require?"
                  "No other, my father, if it were not for that will which entails poverty upon him if he does not claim my hand. Ah, to be sought as the only means of securing what is his by every law of justice, is the dark shadow on my heart."
                  "My poor sensitive plant, what imaginary grief will you next seek, in the absence of any real cause of unhappiness? Raise your eyes to you mirror, my beautiful, and fell me if 'tis likely that she whose image is there reflected, could be wooed from any other motive than that of love?"
                  Agnes looked up, and a smile involuntarily stole over her features, as she gazed on her own loveliness.
                  "Ah, I see the argument is convincing," continued her father, with a gay laugh. "Come, Miss Agnes, and gravely incline thine ear, for I have that to unfold which is of deep concern to my own happiness."
                  The interest of Agnes was at once aroused, and she replied:
                  "I am all attention, dearest father"
                  Talbot paused some moments, as if uncertain how to commence his communication; he at length spoke, in a voice carefully modulated to express the feelings he wished to convey to his listener.
                  "My beloved daughter, you must soon leave me to dwell in another's home, while mine will be desolate without you."
                  "Dear father, can not Edgar remain with us? I have never once thought of leaving you in your latter days, in solitude. We can surely all dwell together."
                  "My latter days, indeed," repeated her father, with a slight frown. "Methinks you are not very complimentary, for I do not yet look like one stricken in years. My best days, I trust, are yet to come; and—and—listen to me, child, with attention. It does not suit the views of Mr. Huntly to become a resident beneath my roof, and I have therefore thought of a plan to console me for giving you up."
                  "I am rejoiced to hear it," replied Agnes, who was at a loss to discover his meaning. "Pray tell me what it is?"
                  "To follow your example, love; in short, to marry!"
                  Agnes sank back quite pale, and a pang of keenest agony shot through her heart, as she thought of her own mother, and felt that her memory had indeed passed from the earth, when the one she had so devotedly loved, had found another to console him. She felt that it was his right to do so, and probably the best course he could pursue, yet she could not help feeling it as the severing of the last link which bound the dead to the household over which she had once been the joyful presiding spirit.
                  Forcing herself to speak, she inquired:
                  "Who is the lady you have selected? or is your choice already made?"
                  "It is and she is one you both admire and love. Miss Ellis is the object of my preference."
                  "Florence!" exclaimed his daughter, in undisguised amazement. "Will she consent? I have sometimes fancied that she has not even a liking for you, father. Is Florence indeed your plighted bride?"
                  "No, not exactly plighted, but in a few days, I hope I may confidently hope to claim her as such. It is true, she is young enough to be my daughter; but years sit lightly on my brow, and I do not despair of winning her sincere affection. But in the interest of our conversation, I have nearly forgotten the purpose for which I sought you."
                  He opened the package he held, and disclosed two sets of jewels.
                  "Here, my daughter," he continued, "are the ornaments best suited to your delicate loveliness. These pearls will admirably become that fair and stainless brow; while these brilliant gems, that flash back the light of day, with a thousand gorgeous hues, are for my fair enslaver, the queen like Florence."
                  "For mine, dear sir, receive my thanks. I will wear them on my bridal evening, and they will be doubly valued by me, as your gift, and the ornaments which decked me as the bride of Edgar."
                  Poor, love sick child! with thee, all things refer to Huntly. Yet it is natural, for it is woman's lot to yield her soul to love's vision; all other sources of happiness are to her but a sealed fountain, which if offered to her thirsting lip would yield but bitter waters."
                  Having made what he considered an effective speech, Colonel Talbot left the room, and yielding to the emotion she had with difficulty repressed in his presence, Agnes burst in tears.
                  "My dear angel mother," she murmured, "there is now no heart to grieve for you, save that of the child to whom you were ever a blessed minister of joy and happiness. A few months hence, methinks I could have borne this better."
                  The entrance of the housekeeper, for some orders, aroused her from the indulgence of her grief, and the expressions of surprise and sympathy from Mrs. Simpson recalled her to a sense of the necessity of regaining her usual calmness.
                  Hastily drying her tears, she said she would walk, and the balmy air of a bright morning would doubtless soon dispel the depression from which she was suffering.
                  She was soon equipped, and drawing her vail over her face, went out at a side door to avoid Eppes, who was sitting on the front piazza reading. Huntly immediately after breakfast had rode over to a small village about four miles from the Hall, where he expected to find letters from his mother.
                  Agnes was peculiarly susceptible to the influences of nature, and gradually the bright sunshine, the carol of birds, and the many sounds which make up the melody of the deep forest, brought their soothing power to her excited feelings, as she rambled through the woodland which surrounded her father's mansion, without heeding whither her steps were leading her. Her mind soon reverted to the many tales of thrilling adventure, which had occurred on the ground over which she was threading her lonely way, and as she looked around, she wondered not that the red man had so tenaciously clung to the soil, where he had first unclosed his eyes upon as beautiful a country as the world may boast.
                  The narrow and rapid Kentucky wound its way beneath the high and beetling cliffs on which she stood, and the murmur of its waters over their rocky bed, first recalled her from the fanciful dreams, in which she was indulging, to a recollection of her 'whereabouts.' A narrow pathway, cut in the face of the precipice, was before her; and after a momentary hesitation, she stepped on it, and commenced the descent toward one of her most favored places of resort. Although alone, a faint flush passed over her cheek, for she knew that the cave in the rock was only sought because she had visited it on the previous day, accompanied by Huntly; and she blushed to think she only wished to stand on the same spot again, that she might recall the more vividly each word, each look of her lover, and in their recollection find the assurance that his devotion would forever remain unchanged.
                  This cavern, which was of considerable size, had been accidentally discovered by one of Col. Talbot's slaves, while in search of stray cattle. It was situated some distance below the brow of the cliff, and a pathway had been hewed in the face of the rock, which after many serpentine windings brought the entrance to it suddenly in view. Two massive pillars of rough stone had been placed on either side, and a rude door was fitted between them; this now swung wide open, revealing the interior. The cavern contained two apartments; the outer one measuring nearly fifty feet in depth, while the smaller one, which opened from it by an aperture somewhat larger than a door, was only about twenty feet wide. The drippings from the roof had formed glittering sheets of stalactite, pillars, tables, and several irregularly shaped chairs. Many Indian relics were scattered around, indicating that the place had been known to the aboriginal inhabitants, for these trophies were all found occupying their present positions, when the cave was first discovered. Several fanciful tables encrusted with a mosaic of moss, spars, and shells, the result of Miss Talbot's ingenuity, were placed in different parts of the outer room; and at the base of several of the columns nearest the entrance, where the light could fall upon them, were placed vases in which climbing plants were unbedded, and their trailing arms wound in verdant folds around the garceful supports thus offered. A couple of willow chairs of a fantastic shape, painted a vivid green, were near the center of the floor; but Agnes sought repose in neither of them. She approached the aperture leading into the next apartment, and after passing through a passage of only a few feet, she drew aside a curtain which hung over the door, and revealed a sofa, a table covered with books, and a reading lamp. This retreat was deliciously cool, and after the fatigue of her walk, she was glad to recline upon the sofa, and dream a bright waking vision of future happiness, which was only the more brilliant from her recent depression. Overcome by weariness, she soon fell into a light slumber, from which she was suddenly startled by the sound of footsteps in the outer apartment, and voices speaking earnestly, passionately, which sent the blood in a wild torrent to her brain, leaving her pale, tremulous, and helpless as an infant. Tones which she at once recognized as Huntly's, reached her ear, and she knew from the slight quiver in them that he was violently agitated. The voice which replied, was sweet and appealing, and with head bent forward, lips apart, colder than the rocky walls which inclosed her, the young and trusting Agnes steeped her soul in the despairing consciousness; that the doom which fancy had imaged forth, as falling on her in after life, had already overtaken her.
                  In the flush and brightness of her opening morn, the thunderbolt had fallen, and stricken her to the earth!
               
               
                  CHAPTER V.
                  HUNTLY set out from the Hall, on that morning, with his mind filled with the image of the mysterious Miss Ellis, who bore the charmed name, the sound of which could yet send a thrill through his soul, and awake feelings of regretful anguish, which he felt to be a sacrilege toward his professed love for Agnes, yet which he possessed no power to struggle against.
                  Weak, impressible, and easily influenced by circumstances, he had yielded to the wishes of his mother, and claimed the hand of Miss Talbot, while the memory of that first ardent affection yet left its deep impress in scathing lines upon his heart. Agnes had said to him, that his description of his first love resembled Miss Ellis, and a wild desire to behold any face that could recall hers, took possession of his soul. He must see her, and this determination only gained strength, as he rode toward his place of destination.
                  The expected letter from his mother was not there, and giving the reins to his horse, he yielded his mind to the thoughts which thronged upon it, until he reached the vicinity of the Hall. From the spot on which he found himself, he had a full view of the Eagle's Nest, and he paused to look at the white walls looming out from their background of rocky cliff, and stunted cedars. As he thus sat, a tall figure, clad in white, issued from the door, came slowly down the pathway, and crossed the bridge. Huntly knew from the direction she was taking, that she must be going toward the cave, and he dismounted, and secured his horse in a neighboring thicket, resolved to gain a nearer view of a person who had so deeply excited his interest.
                  Florence was closely vailed; but as she ascended the pathway leading toward his place of concealment, there was an expression about her whole person, which seemed painfully familiar to him; his heart throbbed with violence, and a cold dew broke forth upon his brow, though the cause of this emotion he could not have explained to himself; it was involuntary, and seemed to master his whole being.
                  With slow and languid steps Florence came along the open glade which lay close beside his place of shelter; unsuspicious of any one being near her, she suffered the breeze to flutter aside her vail, and a glimpse of her features came to the startled gaze of him who looked upon her with such uncredulous amazement, such pallid fear, that he beheld a vision which would fade as an unreal mockery, that even angels might have wept over the wild strife raging in his tortured bosom.
                  Suddenly Florence felt her arm grasped with violence, and, raising her eyes from the ground; she found herself face to face with Huntly! She uttered a faint shriek, and endeavored to conceal her features beneath the shrouding folds of her thick vail, but it was too late; he tore it away, and, holding her at arm's length, perused her features with an intense and burning glance which seemed to penetrate her very soul.
                  "It is—it is herself!" he uttered in tones so low as to seem almost the last effort of life. "I touch her breathing form, I gaze upon the living countenance of her I have believed in her grave! Florence, great Heaven! how could you wrong me thus? How could you torture me with a belief in your death, while you yet exist?"
                  Florence trembled, and looked at him with her magnificent eyes vailed in tears; and in slow and faltering tones she said,
                  "Because I love you unutterably."
                  "Inexplicable being! Should not that have been the best reason for a contrary course? Have you been mad, Florence, that you have acted thus?"
                  She made a gesture of denial; and he passionately continued—
                  "Then have you been a very serpent in my path. What shadow of excuse can you bring for wounding, trampling on the heart that beat but to adore you? Look at me—worn in mind, and emaciated in body, from the sufferings you have inflicted on me. I demand a reason for such conduct—you have said that you love me: in the name of that holy tie, I insist upon a full and candid explanation of all your motives for your most extraordinary conduct."
                  Florence regarded him mournfully—she spoke as if rather to herself than to him—
                  "And this is the reward of the bitterest sacrifice that woman ever made to love and duty! Look at me, in your turn, Edgar, and see if I too have not suffered. Think you that I resigned your love without feeling all the agonies of the keenest despair? all the anguish of a hopeless struggle, with a fate I could not conquer?"
                  "If this be so, why did you break your plighted vows? and what mean you by your allusion to Fate? We make our own fate, and then throw the evil result of our own misdeeds upon blind chance. Can even madness such as mine find any other excuse for your conduct, than an indifference to my happiness which, under the circumstance, was almost criminal?"
                  An approaching footstep was heard, and Florence hurriedly said,
                  "I am on my way to the cave. Come with me, and you shall hear such vindication as I now may make."
                  She led the way, and Huntly followed her, in his state of wild excitement still pouring forth questions and remonstrances, until they gained its shelter. She advanced toward the inner apartment, but paused before she reached it, and, pointing to one of the willow chairs, threw herself upon the other. Huntly rejected the offered seat, and paced up and down in front of her, in a state of mind language has no power to portray. To his vehement adjurations, she at length replied—
                  "I am aware that you are the betrothed of another. Why, then, will you seek to learn the causes of conduct which, however inexplicable to you, ever had your well-being most at heart? We are forever parted—let that suffice: suffer the vail of oblivion to shroud feelings and motives which 'tis now useless to divulge."
                  "Not so—not so, Florence. That very mystery would goad me to madness: would fill my days with fruitless conjectures, my nights with dreams as bootless. I left you with a trusting heart; no suspicion of treachery poisoned my confidence in you. I believed myself truly and sincerely loved, and letters came from you confirming that illusion. When on the eve of proclaiming my relinquishment of fortune to obtain your hand, I received your strange letter of farewell, followed, within a few days, by the news of your death. I refused to believe it, and followed the only clue to you, but to find a confirmation of what I had heard. While I bowed my soul in bitterest anguish over the sod I was assured rested on your adored form, you—you yet lived! What mean this falsehood and concealment, for I must and will know."
                  "It is no longer in my power to refuse the explanation you demand, nor is it now my wish to do so. The warning given by another has been acted on, but the intervention of a higher power has rendered it unavailing. Of one thing be assured: my love has never faltered in its purity and truth; nor were my regrets at our separation less poignant to day than in the first hour of its occurrence."
                  Huntly gazed on her some moments before he again spoke, and each impassioned word as it fell from his lips seemed to freeze the life-blood of the wretched Agnes, as she lay in her darkened nook, a terrified and enforced listener to avowals that wrung her heart.
                  "O would I dared place as implicit faith in your assurances as I once did! O, treacherous woman, with an angel's smile, an angel's face, thou art still loved with the wildest passion, in defiance of all my bitter wrongs—of my own vows to another! O, Florence, I could this moment pour forth each drop of blood from my tortured heart, and deem it a poor libation, could it win me the trusting faith I once had in thee!"
                  "Of what avail can it now be, to make an effort to convince you of my truth? Believe me false—it will be best—for you are soon to wed another."
                  "Never!" exclaimed Huntly, passionately. "Those ties are threads of gossamer to bind me. I dare not give to Agnes the shadow of my faith while the image of another reigns triumphant over my whole soul. I thought I had exorcised the phantoms of the past, and with that gentle girl I might yet be happy; but in an evil hour have you again crossed my path. Why—what dost thou here, and at such a time? When hope had once more thrown her bow of promise round me, why have you come to drag me back to wretchedness?"
                  His frantic emotion would have inspired any other woman with fear, but Florence was a stranger to such a feeling. She placed her hand upon his, and he felt as if that light touch could lead him through the world, a captive to her will; and when her low, earnest tones, so full of the heart's music, so touchingly desolate, fell upon his ear, he could have execrated himself for giving one pang to the wounded spirit they seemed to breathe.
                  "Nay, Edgar, I sought you not; by accident my well meant plans have been frustrated; for I thought not of meeting you again I will leave you now, and, if such be your wish, never see you again. I shall know that in another's love you are blessed; and that consciousness will enable me to bear the burden of my own hopeless lot."
                  "No, by Heaven! we part not thus! I must hear the reasons of your strange conduct. I doubt not your invention can supply such excuse as will make me feel myself the veriest wretch, to speak thus to such a piece of injured innocence. Ha! ha! I can laugh even at my own blind folly."
                  "O, Edgar, reproach me not in such accents," exclaimed Florence, imploringly. "All other suffering I can bear, but not reproach where I have only heard love's fondest tones. I will obey your wishes—come to me this evening, and I will relate a history of events which will wring your heart, and at the same time prove me not only free from falsehood, but careful of your honor and dignity, in all I have hitherto done. Will you come?
                  Huntly gazed earnestly on the face, alternately pale with emotion or flushed beneath his searching glance; and clasping the cold hand she extended to him, he fervently said,
                  "Come! yes—to death, perdition—any thing for thee!"
                  "Death! perdition!" repeated Florence, shuddering. "Ominous words! Yet come, I shall expect you."
                  She left the cavern with rapid steps, and Huntly paced the floor as if constant motion could give rest to the fevered rush of thought and feeling which swept through his soul. He tried to fix his mind on the consequences which must spring from this meeting—to fathom the strange mystery which surrounded Florence; but could he have lifted the dark curtain which shrouds the viewless future, he would have shrunk back appalled at the fate he had unconsciously embraced while listening to the syren voice of passion, forgetful of the claims of her who loved him with all the fervor of her innocent heart. Once he stopped, and, clasping his throbbing brow, spoke aloud—
                  "Wretched—wretched fool! to permit myself thus to become the sport of a woman who has once so bitterly deceived me. Yet—great Heaven! would I not give my life for the undivided love of such a being! Agnes, my poor Agnes, I have deceived myself, and what is worse, deceived thy trusting heart, to its own misery; I now know that I have never loved you."
                  With these words he rushed from the cavern, and hurried to the spot on which he had left his horse. Mounting him, he dashed his spurs in his sides, and rode rapidly toward the same village from which he had so lately returned. In the present state of his feelings, to return to the Hall was not to be thought of.
                  As the echo of his retreating footsteps died away, Agnes, with a stunned and bewildered feeling, attempted to rise that she might find her way home; but the excitement of the scene was over, and, with the first effort, she fell back alike insensible to joy or grief.
                  Some hours later in the day, the Hall presented a scene of strange confusion. A few lines had been received from Huntly by Eppes requesting him to excuse his non-appearance, as unexpected business would detain him in —— several days. The dinner hour approached, yet Agnes had not returned; and as such an occurrence was unusual, considerable uneasiness was experienced on her account. Messengers were dispatched in various directions in search of her, and Eppes bent his steps toward the cave.
                  The outer room bore no evidence of having been visited that morning, but on lifting the curtain from the inner division, he was shocked to find Agnes extended, apparently lifeless, upon the sofa near the entrance. He called her name in an alarmed tone; but she replied not; and, rushing toward her, he clasped her cold hand in both his own. She unclosed her eyes, and gazed on him with an expression of such utter vacancy that he was deeply alarmed.
                  "Agnes—dearest Agnes, speak to speak to me—tell me why do I find you thus? What has so suddenly reduced you to this condition?"
                  She uttered a faint moaning sound, and after looking on him as if endeavoring to recall his features, she muttered, in broken tones—
                  "No—no—it is not Edgar. He will come to me no more—no more," and the last words seemed to strike coldly on her heart; for she shivered, and appeared to shrink within herself; and, to his great alarm, she again relapsed into insensibility.
                  He hurried from the cave, and, rapidly descending the steep cliff toward the river, filled his hat with water and returned with it to the suffering girl. As he remounted the pathway, he fortunately espied one of the Hall servants coming through the forest, and, calling to him, he sent a message to Colonel Talbot informing him of the illness of Agnes, with a request that some conveyance should be sent for her immediately.
                  Eppes remained to watch beside the languid and nearly lifeless form of her he had loved from childhood, while many contending feelings warred in his breast. While he believed her happy in the choice she had made, he was willing to resign her to his more fortunate rival; but now that her disconnected words led him to the conclusion that she had been slighted—her love repelled in some unaccountable manner by Huntly, an intense desire to inflict retribution on the faithless one filled his breast. In the depths of his heart he breathed a vow to make her cause his own: to forget that the man who had injured so confiding a being as Agnes had ever been his friend.
                  Colonel Talbot soon arrived in great alarm, and, raising the slight figure of Agnes in his arms, with the assistance of Eppes, he bore her to the level land above, where the carriage awaited them. Placing her scarcely breathing form upon her father's breast, Eppes left her to his support during the remainder of the way. She continued in a species of lethargy until they reached the door of her home, and to all their tender inquiries returned no answer either by word or motion. As she was lifted into the house, she unclosed her eyes, looked around with a startled gaze, and said quite distinctly—
                  "Take me to my own room; exclude the light of heaven from it, that I may die in darkness as deep as the night which has closed on all my earthly hopes."
                  Her father endeavored to take advantage of this momentary gleam of intelligence, to elicit the cause of her sudden and violent attack of illness; but she sank again into the dull apathetic state in which Eppes had discovered her, and thus she remained for many days, while events fraught with deep moment to her future fate were transpiring.
                  The family physician was with her in a few hours, but he could only declare that she was suffering from some violent shock, and the tenderest care must be exercised to preserve life and reason.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  ABOUT half a mile from the cottage was dark and lonely ravine, over which the spirit of desolation seemed ever to brood. The rocky cliffs nearly met overhead, and a few pine trees cast their gloomy shadows over several mounds of earth, around which the hand of affection had reared a few richly looking flowers that drooped for want of the glad sunshine which never penetrated to this solemn resting-place for the dead.
                  The latter portion of the day had been overcast, and the dim and imperfect light which struggled through the gloom served to reveal the tall form of Florence, clad in the deepest mourning. She knelt beside the graves, with her long and glittering hair unbound and sweeping around her form, imparting additional wildness to a countenance on which the war of deep and terrible emotions was visibly depicted.
                  A footstep was heard descending the ravine, and she arose and advanced to meet Edgar Huntly.
                  "I have found you at last," he said. "I sought you at your abode, and was directed hither. Why have you chosen such a gloomy place in which to meet me? and what means this sable dress?"
                  "It is ominous of the tale you have to hear," replied Florence, with stern gravity. "I have brought you hither because what I have to relate is best told here. On this spot I spend many hours in thinking over the past; but not our past. This is no place for young romance to dream in, and weave its gayly tinted web of a future, which often brings with it anguish, crime, and death. I brought you hither to learn a story full of woe; of two hearts that once beat wildly as our own, crushed by that grasp of iron which despair lays upon the soul."
                  "What has that to do with our fate?" asked Huntly, bitterly. "I sought you not to listen to a history of the woes of others, but to seek relief from the tide of wretchedness which is flooding my own soul."
                  "This story of most foul murder, which I must relate, is intimately connected with my own, and it is necessary that you shall hear it," replied Florence, with impressive solemnity.
                  "Murder!" repeated Huntly. "Florence, do you rave, or is this mummery only designed to give effect to the tale you have to relate?"
                  "Listen to the story, and then judge," said she proudly. "Yes, it is really of murder, though no blood was shed. Is it no murder to pour the tide of anguish on one heart until its worn fibres break? For such cold-blooded cruelty human laws afford no punishment; and whither shall the bereaved mourner turn for retribution for him who was thus sacrificed? Edgar Huntly, I have brought you to the tomb of my parents, to hear their sad history. Will you listen to it?"
                  "Go on, I pray. Your wild looks, and words of fearful meaning, portend a terrible revelation."
                  "It shall yet be a fearful one to him who compassed the destruction of all my heart held dear; yet to you there need be nothing awful in it. Let us seat ourselves, it will occupy some time to relate all I have to reveal."
                  She placed herself on a fragment of rock overgrown with moss, and in silence Huntly seated himself beside her. There was a pause of some moments, and when Florence again spoke Edgar started; for in her deep and thrilling tones he recognized none of the peculiar ringing sweetness which distinguished her voice.
                  "My mother lost her parents at an early age, and was left dependent on her widowed grandmother. This lady was very old, and her mind weak and declining; beneath her roof resided the son of her eldest daughter, an imperious lad, who ruled her entirely; and as the cousins grew to maturity, he openly avowed his intention to wed my mother, and thus prevent the division of the estate which the old lady had bequeathed jointly to them.
                  "Her death took place when my mother had attained her eighteenth year, and it was then found that she was left to the guardianship of her cousin, and in case of her marriage without his consent she forfeited her portion of the property. I will not tell you how he pursued her—how he persecuted her, to gain her consent to become his wife: she at length ended the contest by eloping with one she loved, as she had every reason to believe his consent would never be given to her union with any other than himself.
                  "As right seemed clearly on their side, my parents instituted a suit for the recovery of my mother's portion, and this so enraged the baffled lover that he swore he would be avenged. Years rolled away, and still the cause was undecided: misfortune entered our dwelling—my father failed in business, lost his health, and retired to a small farm in the country, which was the only remnant of the independence he had once possessed. I was the eldest child, but two fair brothers shared my infant sports. My father faded slowly before the fatal breath of disease, and we were taught to tame our childish glee, and hush the glad voice of mirth to low, soft whispers, lest we should rouse him from his fitful slumbers.
                  "One evening our mother sat beside his couch while we played upon the lawn in front of our humble home: two rough looking men entered, and walked without ceremony into the room occupied by my parents. We had no fears of evil until sobs and remonstrances from our beloved mother brought us to her side. Those men were officers, sent to arrest my father for debt, at the suit of our inhuman relation. For years he had watched his opportunity to crush his victim, and we soon learned that he had availed himself of my father's difficulties to purchase all the claims against him, and thus had gained the power to tear him from his family, and cast him into prison, even when Death was evidently hastening to claim him as his own.
                  "Since her marriage, my mother had never met her cousin, but now she sought his presence, and humbled herself before him, to obtain the release of her husband. It was in vain; the long-contested suit had been recently decided in his favor, and his victim completely in his power. He mocked her anguish, spurned her prayers, and bade her find her wealth of love a current coin where with to live and shield her dear ones from the pangs of gnawing penury."
                  Overcome by her own emotions, Florence bowed her head upon her bosom, and remained silent some moments. Huntly did not interrupt her, for he felt the sacredness of her sorrow, and in truth he was awed by the mingled passion and anguish which every tone of her voice indicated.
                  She at length resumed:
                  "Finding all hope of moving her kinsman vain, my mother removed to the town in which my father was imprisoned, and took up her abode in a miserable lodging near him. The farm was sold under an execution, and every available source swept away; by incessant toil she earned with her needle enough to preserve us from actual starvation; for much of her time was necessarily occupied by my father, and the assistance I could render her was not of much importance.
                  "I can never describe to you the impression those gloomy days of suffering made upon me. They seem to have stamped themselves upon my soul in living characters of anguish and hopelessness, which, at this hour, are as vivid as if made a week ago. My mother could not bear the heavy burden laid on her, and her wasted strength and hollow cough soon betrayed that on her too the blighting hand of consumption was laid. But she was not doomed to die until more bitter suffering was yet hers; my brothers had always been delicate, and shut out from the free air in our wretched place of shelter, often with insufficient food, they sickened with a malignant fever and perished within a few hours of each other.
                  "They were laid in the same grave, and that night my mother, more like a phantom than a living woman, entered the room of my dying father. Her fortitude had at last forsaken her: she talked of the past—bewailed the misfortunes she had entailed upon those dearest to her, through the enmity of her stony-hearted relative; and exhausted by her emotions, she leaned upon the side of my father's couch an I prayed in faint but distinct tones. She invoked blessings on her husband, and prayed for retribution to her persecutor in words of such thrilling power that they seemed to me to demand the fulfillment of all they asked. Her voice died away, but still her pale face lay upon the wretched pillow, and so silent was that apartment of suffering, that I became alarmed at it—I called on her name, and when she replied not, I hurriedly raised her head: the overtasked heart was at rest—the moonbeams came through the grated window and fell upon the face of the dead.
                  "I shrieked, but the deep tones of my father's voice calling my name, seemed to stifle my anguish at his bidding. I bent over him, and taking my hand in his own, already cold with the dew of approaching death, he said,
                  "'Florence, my child, this is no time for weeping. Rather rejoice with me, that her sufferings are ended. A few hours more and I shall join her where man's oppression can no more reach us. The pang far worse than death, is leaving you, my daughter, a homeless wanderer on the face of the earth. Should he who has so mercilessly pursued us relent in your favor, refuse the bread purchased at so fearful a price; and in years to come, my child, remember that I bequeath to him the curse of the broken heart which has just ceased to beat.'
                  "A Bible lay upon the pillow from which I had been reading to him. I laid my hand on it and solemnly replied,
                  "'And it shall fall and crush him in his pride. I swear it to you, my father.'
                  "He was not naturally a vindictive man, but his sufferings had been too great for mortal endurance, and the faint smile that played over his features as the words passed my lips, assured me that they were welcome, though he would afterward have dissuaded me from fulfilling my vow. But I did not falter then, nor have I since.
                  "'Tis useless to relate all that passed on that terrible night. Just before the dawn of day, my father breathed his last, and side by side lay the lifeless bodies of my parents. Yet I feared not, nor did I call for assistance. A strange and stony hardness of feeling crept over me. I thought of him who had wrought all this wretchedness, and I invoked the most terrible punishment upon my own head, if ever turned from the path of retribution I had vowed to tread."
                  "Horrible!" exclaimed Huntly. "How can so revengful a spirit tenant such a form?"
                  "Ask me not, when you know that I sit here amid the graves of all my household. In the lone hours of night I have watched beside them, and breathed my vows to Heaven to suffer no weakness of my sex to turn me from the sacred purpose to which I dedicate my life anew."
                  She arose, kneeled beside the graves, and raising her hands toward Heaven, continued:
                  "Hear me, thou righteous—"
                  Huntly impetuously interrupted her,
                  "In mercy forbear. O, Florence, doom us not both to destruction! Madman though I be, your fate shall be mine."
                  Florence arose, and for an instant all the woman shone in her eyes, and in the transient flush that crossed her pallid cheek. She felt that such love as her impassioned soul was capable of feeling, was given her in return. The triumph was but momentary; tears sprang into her eyes, and her voice faltered as she replied,
                  "No, Edgar, it must not be. Would we had never met; the only weakness that my heart has known is its deep love for you; in your fiery soul I recognized a kindred spirit, and I deemed you a fit instrument to accomplish my revenge. Forgive the cruel fate to which I doomed you. I believed my heart to be so filled with one intense and ardent passion, as to be inaccessible to the softer one of love. I listened to your voice when you spoke of a bright future, until I learned to think its tones all music, and I became a weak, fond, loving woman. We parted, and the spell was broken. 'Twas then I gave you the strongest proof of my affection, for I resolved to die to you, to all who had formerly known me, sooner than doom you to a life of penitence; for the price at which this hand is won, is—blood!"
                  "Nay, Florence, this is madness! Why will you doom yourself to wretchedness and remorse for—"
                  Florence interrupted him in tones so solemn, that they thrilled to his heart.
                  "I have sworn it many, many times. Remorse would ever haunt me did I not avenge those who lie around me. Why, look! There are the graves of four as loving hearts as ever thrilled with life; they lie cold and moldering into dust, unconscious even of the gushing tide of agony I have poured over the senseless clods that cover them; while he who laid them there lives a proud, a happy, an exulting father. No—my soul can not be moved to relent from its purpose."
                  "And this man? Who is he? What name does he bear?"
                  "He is one, the sound of whose name will pale your cheek, and send the life-blood to your heart with a cold and sickening thrill; for by some strange fatality your destinies are interwoven. His daughter is your promised bride."
                  Huntly started from her side.
                  "Not Talbot! not the father of that gentle girl! O, Florence, this is too, too horrible!"
                  "Yes—'tis Talbot—the perfidious Talbot. Tell me not of his gentle child; was not my angel mother once as fair as she? and did he not doom her to the lingering torture of a living tomb? Did he not crush her—trample on her with remorseless cruelty; and shall I, her child, forget it? Never—never—but you—go to your plighted bride and shield her father from this feeble hand, if thou canst. Woman's though it be, the blow from it shall be dealt home, and carry with it death."
                  "O, Florence," said Huntly, with deep emotion, "my heart is wrung with anguish Beautiful demon, why do I not leave you, and have strength to denounce your purpose to its doomed object?"
                  Florence drew herself up to her full height, and a strange smile flitted over her features as she replied,
                  "Because you love me. Nay, start not—I know your nature, Edgar, and even such a trust as this you will not betray. But you have not yet heard all. Colonel Talbot knows me not under the assumed name I bear, and he has sought me for his bride."
                  "His bride! O, monstrous and unnatural proposition! Sooner could I avenge the wrongs of those who lie around me, than witness such a union."
                  Florence had expected such an avowal, but she replied calmly,
                  "I shall consent, and at the moment he stands beside me at the altar, dreaming not of death or doom, I will consummate my long cherished scheme of vengeance by plunging this dagger to this heart. Then reeking with his life blood, I will turn it against my own, and rid myself of an existence which has long been wearisome to me."
                  As she spoke, she drew from her bosom a poignard in a plain sheath, and held it before him. He made an effort to take it from her, but she eluded it, and again thrust it into its place of concealment. Huntly said,
                  "Florence, this must not be. Your own life is too precious to be staked against that of this doubly-dyed villain. My heart acknowledges your wrongs, but still it would incline to mercy. But you have not yet told me of the means used to baffle inquiry, and produce the belief that you were really dead."
                  "You may remember that I retained the ready money bequeathed to me by Mrs. Ilston, and as I was of age, Mr. Mildmay had it placed in the bank at L——, subject to my order. Your friend, Mr. Eppes, had learned my history, and the vague threats which in moments of great exasperation I had uttered against Colonel Talbot, deeply impressed him. He sought me, and by a few words forcibly uttered, showed me the certain wretchedness to which I doomed you if I tempted you to become the minister of vengeance. He seemed to have read my heart to its very depths, for be probed it more deeply than any one else had ever been able to do. I returned home in a tempest of anger and misery; but that night my resolution was taken to put it out of my own power to become the minister of evil to you.
                  "You already know how I evaded Mr. Mildmay's family. I took refuge, as you are also aware, with McConnel, who had once been gardener at Elmsly. I knew I could implicitly depend on his secrecy and fidelity, and his subsequent conduct fully proved that my confidence was justly placed. It so happened that a niece of his own had just come out from Scotland, and on the day before my arrival was seized with violent inflamation of the brains. In a few days it proved fatal, and as the girl was an entire stranger, it was easy to suffer her to die and be carried to her grave under my name; and a paper written by myself in an unsteady and, bequeathing McConnel a considerable sum of money, seemed to be the most conclusive evidence of my death.
                  "Through his agency this cottage was procured, and the remains of my family removed from the public burying ground in L—— to this spot, which was selected as their last resting-place, because its gloom is in accordance with their fate. My history is ended. Is there aught in it for which I have cause to blush? or has there been toward you one thought or feeling for which you can reproach me?"
                  "No, Florence," replied Huntly, mournfully. "Though your disclosures have wrung my heart, I can not feel otherwise than deeply touched by the love you have manifested for me throughout all your strange proceedings. I ask but one more proof, and then my life shall henceforth be devoted to you. Abjure your cherished scheme of vengeance, and in the dreams which youthful love may indulge, charm from your mind the hideous fantasy that mars its beauty. Leave Talbot to his conscience; that will be sufficient punishment."
                  "His conscience," repeated Florence, with bitter emphasis, while her haughty lip grew pale with repressed passion. "Speak of conscience to the prowling wolf that lurks around your dwelling—to the vulture that hovers over the scarcely fledged bird; to the lion when lashed into fury over his prey, and when you have proved that they can be turned from the fell purpose which animates them, then will I believe that the stings of conscience may be felt by such as Talbot. No—he dies! His body I devote to destruction, and his soul to the award of a merciful but a just Judge. Become the instrument of vengeance, if thou darest, and the hour that brings to me the certainty that my enemy no longer exists, shall give thee a bride, who, if she hates with intense fervor, can also love deeply and truly."
                  Huntly listened to the tones of that seductive voice, and for a brief instant stood irresolute. He looked on the face of the temptress; her beautiful eyes were fixed upon him, and he turned away. He felt that if he gazed on her he should forget every thing but the love she offered him.
                  "Florence," he at length said, "I can not do your bidding. Remember Agnes: she has never injured you. In pity to her gentle heart, her desolate future if deprived of him, can you not spare her father? My hand can never strike the blow which would recoil on the heart that I feel is devoted to me. No, Florence, I can not become the instrument of vengeance."
                  "Be it so," replied Florence, with lofty composure, though there was a small spot of crimson in the center of each white cheek, which spoke of baffied hate and disappointed love. "I find that I have rated your devotion by too high a standard—even by my own—and you have fallen short, O, how far short of what I could have dared and done for you. On this spot we part forever. I have explained all you have any right to know, and I shall soon be able to rejoice that your decision has saved you from a life of guilt, perhaps of deep repentance; for what I shall consider but the strictest justice, you would deem a crime. Adieu—seek me no more."
                  She turned as if to leave, and he exclaimed,
                  "We must not, can not part! O, Florence, without you life is aimless—purposeless. I can not lose you."
                  "Such has been your own decision, Edgar, Believe me, we part now and forever. Should you again cross my path, we meet as strangers."
                  Before Huntly could reply, she was already half way up the ravine, and in a few moments the dim outline of her figure had entirely vanished. He soon followed her, and finding his horse fastened near the entrance to the ravine, he mounted and turned his head toward ——— without any definite place of repose in view. He loathed the idea of returning to the Hall, for he felt the impossibility of concealing the change in his feelings toward its inmates; and after a few moments' reflection, he determined on resting at the small town of ——, and proceeding on the following morning to the residence dence of his mother. From thence he would write to Colonel Talbot, and inform him of his irrevocable determination to relinquish all claims on his paternal property, and at the same time waive his pretensions to the hand of his daughter. He did not despair of yet inducing Florence to relinquish her wild dream of avenging the wrongs of her parents, and in becoming his bride, forget the past with all its dark associations, in the brightness of a destiny which mutual love should bless.
                  The forsaken Agnes was banished from his mind, by her more brilliant rival; and while she lay stricken almost unto death, by the knowledge of his perfidy, he was dreaming of happiness with another!
               
               
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  THE residence of Mrs. Huntly, was about twenty miles from Talbot Hall, and it was late in the evening before Huntly reached home. He dismounted at the outer gate, and walked up the yard, for he feared his unexpected return might alarm his mother if he appeared before her too suddenly. When they last parted, it was with the understanding that he should no more return to Ingleside, until he came accompanied by his bride.
                  He scarcely knew how to break to her the news he came to announce, and he lingered beneath the trees endeavoring to arrange in his own mind a plausible excuse for his return, after so brief an absence.
                  "What will my mother say to all this?" he unconsciously muttered, as he recalled the pale face which had bent over his feverish couch in infancy, and smiled on him in his maturer years with that sad smile of patient endurance which expressed so much that was touching to the heart. He was unwilling to become the cause of new suffering to her, for he knew that she had one by one seen "her loved ones blotted from life's page," until he was the only link of the broken chain of sweet and deep affections which once had wound itself around her heart. He felt that the very existence of his mother was bound up in his welfare, for in the touching language of Scripture "he was her only child, and she was a widow."
                  Lights were streaming from the open window of her accustomed sitting room; he softly approached and beheld her seated beside a table with an open book before her; but she did not appear to be reading; she seemed buried in deep reverie, and Edgar pleased himself with fancying that she was dreaming of her absent son.
                  "How lovely she still is," thought he, as he gazed on the fair face, which was so sadly subdued in its expresssion. He could not remember ever hearing his mother laugh; she had smiled on him, but never had the sounds of mirth broken from those lips in his hearing. He leaned his head against the window frame and gazed fondly on her beloved features, while he recalled many instances of her devoted affection for himself
                  Though so many years a widow, Mrs. Huntly still wore the deepest mourning, which his mother. She looked around with an expression of alarm, and he instantly stepped contrasted with her fair and singularly youthful features. The bright golden hair which shaded her brow, was mingled with many threads of gray, but at a short distance they were not perceptible, and many times had her son entreated her to lay aside her widow's cap with its broad band of crape, which appeared so unsuited to her still lovely face. Yet hers was not so much the beauty of features, as of expression; a meek and chastened spirit beamed from those soft eyes, and the gentle melancholy of her manner, left the impression on the mind of one who had sorrowed deeply, but not as those without hope.
                  Huntly changed his position, and the rustling of the shrubbery near the window startled forward, "Do not be frightened mother, it is only I, I have returned from the Hall a little sooner than I anticipated, and having some curiosity to see how you were employed, I thought I would take a peep at you before I entered."
                  As he spoke, he placed his hand on the sill of the window, and sprang lightly into the room. Mrs. Huntly welcomed him affectionately, but she gazed earnestly, almost fearfully in his face, as she answered him:
                  
                  "Your words are light, my son, but I can not look on that face which has been familiar to me from childhood, and not read in it a heavy and perplexed heart; something unpleasant must surely have occurred, to bring you back so soon. Tell me, are all well at Col. Talbot's? and why have you left the fair Agnes? lovers are not now as devoted as when your father flattered me into the belief that I was dearer to him than all the world beside, or Miss Talbot will scarcely excuse such neglect."
                  "Miss Talbot will be more patient than the faithful Griselda, whose virtues are embalmed in story, and more forgiving than even her own gentle self, if she finds any excuse for me when she knows all," said Huntly gloomily.
                  His mother regarded him in silent consternation—and almost mechanically she said:
                  "All?—why what have you to relate, that can produce a rupture between yourself and Agnes?"
                  "Mother," said Huntly with desperation, "I may as well speak the truth at once. Circumlocution can be of no avail,—I can not marry Agnes"
                  "Not marry Agnes! and why?" asked Mrs. Huntly, growing even paler than she habitually was.
                  "Because I blindly, madly love another. Do not speak, but listen to me: I have not concealed from you my passion for Florence Elliot, but never—never were I to talk or rave to you an age, can you know the utter abandonment of feeling with which I worshiped her."
                  "My son, are you mad, that you thus return to a love of which the object has perished? at the peril too of your worldly advancement."
                  "No, no, I believed her dead, and in compliance with your wishes, I offered my hand to Agnes; Florence yet lives, mother; we have met and she has revealed to me a tale of iniquity, which has absolved her from all blame in my eyes for the strange course she has pursued, and at the same time deepened my aversion to a union which must so nearly connect me with so cold blooded a wretch as Talbot. I have left his house, and I shall never again enter it. I grieve for the wound I have inflicted on Agnes, but I can not marry her."
                  He could not judge of his mother's feelings at this announcement, for she held her hand raised so as to shade her face from the light, and he could not see its expression; but when she spoke, after a pause which seemed to him as if it would never end, her voice was so tremulous that she could scarcely articulate:
                  "My son, your honor is pledged. What will the world say to such conduct on your part? Nay, what will Agnes herself think? You can not accuse her father to her, and should you do so to others, in vindication of your own course, where are your proofs of ungentlemanly conduct? Believe me, you can not retract now. O, my beloved Edgar, listen to my prayer; banish this insidious Florence from your heart, and return the love which every word—every look of Agnes betrays for you. I regard her already as my daughter, and shall not my wishes have some weight with you?"
                  "In all other things, dearest mother, they should guide me, but in this, I must be the best and sole judge of what is for the happiness of both Agnes and myself. She would soon discover that my heart was not filled with her, and think you her sensitive spirit could survive such knowledge? Ah no mother, better be forsaken at once—better suffer the blow to fall at one stroke, than throw the mocking semblance of hope around us when we feel that despair alone tightens the grasp upon the straws to which we cling. Agnes is not one to be content with the mere semblance of affection. She will suffer, poor girl, but like the graceful willow, that bends to the blast, but to regain its former height and beauty when 'tis past, she will bow before the storm; but her affectionate heart will gradually learn to twine its reviving hopes around some other idol. Agnes will love again and be happy, while I can know but this one deep enduring attachment to her who is worthy to fill my whole heart. O, mother dearest, listen to the plans I have formed."
                  He seated himself beside her, and clasping her hand between both his own, allowed his sanguine spirit to sketch a future invested by his vivid imagination with a thousand charms, while Mrs. Huntly listened with that sickness of heart which words can never express.
                  "This place is yours, dear mother; I think you inherited it from your father. You shall continue to reside here, and I will bring Florence to enliven your solitude; she will prove a most charming companion, and you will love her at first for my sake, but when you know her well, much more dearly will she be prized for her own. The rest may go to Talbot, and if it enriches Agnes, it will make some amends for the heart I have given to another. Judge H—— has often told me that I might aspire to the highest station in his profession if I were not already so independent in fortune, as to render me careless to its prosecution I will resume my studies, and as soon as possible commence my career at the bar. Say, mother, shall we not be very—very happy?"
                  "It is a bright picture my son, but it may not be."
                  "And why not mother?"
                  She arose, opened a writing case which stood in one corner of the room, and unclosing a secret drawer, took from it a bundle of papers. As she again approached the light, her son was chilled by the expression her features wore—they appeared convulsed with painful emotion.
                  "Good heavens mother, what is the matter?" he exclaimed, "what papers are those?"
                  She motioned her hand for silence, and after the lapse of a few moments, she regained sufficient composure to speak:
                  "The hour I have long dreaded has arrived. I have prayed for this bitterness to pass from me, but my prayer has not been heard, and I must become the accuser of my husband to his son. These fatal papers I took out only this morning with the intention of destroying them, that the written record of shame might forever perish, and what is here revealed be buried in the hearts of the two who would be the most interested in concealing it; but something whispered me that it might be best to retain them until your union with Agnes Talbot should render this avowal unnecessary. Edgar Huntly, call not Talbot a villain, for the name, the fame of your dead father are in his power, and if you do not wed his daughter, he will proclaim that which to have published to the world, will kill me."
                  "In Heaven's name what is it?" asked Huntly growing pale in spite of his efforts for self-command.
                  "Look and read for yourself—yet no, give me the papers, and let me tell you the story with all its palliating circumstances, that you may not utterly condemn your father. Sit beside me Edgar, and listen to a tale that I would I had died before I was called on to reveal."
                  Huntly took the seat beside her in silence and after a brief pause, his mother commenced:
                  "When your father first sought me as his wife, he was without fortune. My parents were wealthy, but they gave nothing to their children until death deprived them of the power of longer withholding it. I went forth from my father's house, a portionless and a very helpless wife; for I had been as delicately nurtured as though the wealth of the Indies were to have been mine. The first years of our wedded life were spent in endeavoring to live on as little as possible, that the foundation of such an independence might be laid, as would enable us to rear our children in the sphere in which they were born.
                  I bore every privation without murmuring, for I loved my husband, and the end we had in view, would have nerved me to the endurance of greater evils than it was my lot to encounter; but it was not thus with your father. He fretted for me, and for himself; and frequently said that he had acted unwisely in marrying at so early an age, as to incumber himself with a large family while yet in the prime of life. All this I bore without repining, but my heart was often deeply wounded when I looked on my bright and promising children, and heard their father speak of them as the weight that kept him down, and marred his hopes of success in life."
                  "After some years thus spent, Colonel Talbot renewed with your father an intimacy which had been formed in early life. He had shortly before come into possession of an ample inheritance, and he proposed to Mr. Huntly to join him in a mercantile establishment. He gladly acceded, and from that hour my happiness was at an end: we lived in a larger house, it is true; my children were better clad, and I had money to spend at will, but I had good reason to believe that in the end it would be the worse for us. My husband was no longer the same being—he was scarcely ever at home, for his days were devoted to business, and night after night found him at the gaming table, in company with Talbot.
                  "At length a crash came; the firm was declared insolvent, and what was deeper, deeper sorrow, a discovery was made by Talbot, which, if known, would cover the memory of your father with infamy."
                  She paused and Huntly leaned forward with the cold drops starting from his forehead. He endeavored to speak, but the words died away in an inarticulate murmur. With a faltering voice, his mother went on.
                  "Finding his own resources unequal to the expense he recklessly plunged into, he had forged the name of his partner for many thousands."
                  Huntly started up as if to rush from the room, but his eye fell on the face of his suffering mother, and, without a word, he sank back upon his seat, and motioned to her to proceed.
                  "Talbot came to him, told him of the discovery which, fortunately, was known only to himself. 'I can prove these notes to be forgeries,' he said, 'but on one condition I will forbear. I love money, though not to hoard it; I love the gratifications it can purchase; but I have not patience to amass it. You are a good business man, and neglect alone has brought on your present ruin. Abjure your dissipated habits—bind yourself to me for ten years to conduct business for me in a proper manner, with a moiety of the profits as your reward, and I will take up these notes. No suspicion shall go forth against you. Refuse, and the law must take its course.'
                  "The alternative was gladly accepted, and affairs resumed their former course, except that your father was a changed man. He diligently pursued his business avocations, and wealth flowed in apace. My father died, and I came into possession of a competence, but when the sun was at its meridian, dark clouds obscured it. The children that my husband now seemed to prize as his own existence, were taken from us one by one, until you alone were left.
                  "He struggled through the ten years of bondage, and at their expiration found that he had realized an independence from the share accruing to himself. Talbot came to him again; his extravagance had kept pace with what was made for him, and he professed himself but little better off than when the compact was entered into. He stated that, if he were to die, his estate must be declared insolvent, and his only child be unprovided for. He still retained in his hands the proofs of your father's misconduct, and he refused to relinquish them except on one condition—the execution of the will which gives your hand or your fortune to Agnes Talbot. It was done, and almost in the moment of its completion, your father was seized with an attack of apoplexy which proved fatal.
                  "Then Colonel Talbot refused to relinquish the papers which proved his delinquency. He retained them that he might possess the means of compelling you to fulfill the contract, if he should desire you to do so. This package contains the narrative of what I have related; just before my husband breathed his last, he informed me where it was to be found, and the nature of its contents. My son I have done."
                  Her concluding words were so low and faint that Huntly was aroused from the varied emotions which raged in his bosom to attend to her He hastily poured out wine and held it to her lips, as he said.
                  "Dearest mother, this painful recital has been to much for you. I feel that we are in the power of one who knows no mercy; but be of good cheer—I will baffle him yet; and my father's name shall remain unsullied by the breath of suspicion. Thus perish the record of what might raise the blush of shame upon your cheek."
                  He held the package above the lamp, and bent over it until every vestige of the writing was destroyed. Then turning to Mrs. Huntly, he spoke with assumed calmness.
                  "We have had enough excitement for one evening, mother. I must be alone that I may meditate upon my future course of action. Send me a cup of coffee, and do not lie awake, fancying that I am too restless and unhappy to sleep. No—may your slumbers be light, and your dreams happy, beloved mother; for your waking visions have not been blissful ones. Good night—give me your blessing as in the days of my boyhood, for I need something to soften and humanize my heart tonight."
                  "May Heaven forever bless you, my beloved son," said Mrs. Huntly, fervently, as she imprinted a fond kiss upon his cold brow Her eyes were dimmed with tears, and she did not see the expression his countenance wore, or rest would have been driven as far from her heart as sleep from her pillow.
                  It was the last kiss Huntly ever received from his mother.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VIII.
                  TO DELINEATE the whirlwind of feeling and suffering that swept over the soul of Huntly on that night, were a vain effort. He felt as one in the vortex of a torrent, whose wild waves were hurrying him to a fate he had no power to avert: that all his struggles were impotent against the current which bore him to destruction.
                  His pride was humbled to the dust by the knowledge of his father's shame, which to him was not rendered less deep and indelible by its concealment from others. He thought of Florence, that strangely gifted being who had laid the spell of her beauty upon his soul, and bound him to her with a passion which he felt to be madness, yet which he had not the will to control; of the wrongs which she had so eloquently described, of the vengeance she had vowed agains the man who held him in bondage worse than that of death; and dark and indistinct thoughts of forever silencing the tongue that could proclaim a father's derelection from the path of honor, and at the same time of saving Florence from the perpetration of the crime she meditated, floated across his distracted mind.
                  Then the meek face of Agnes would arise before him, claiming sympathy for the suffering he was ready to inflict, and demanding it for her father he could find no soft relenting in his heart.
                  Exhausted by the conflict of feeling, he at length threw himself across the bed and slept. Day was breaking when he awoke. O that terrible awakening to the anguish which has been buried in the oblivion of sleep! The keen thrill of agony which darts through the heart as the consciousness slowly returns of what we would fain believe the fantasm of a dream, but which is all, all too real.
                  His first thought was of his mother, and in his present state of feeling he shrank from meeting her. She would read upon his haggard brow too much of the conflict that shook his soul. After writing a few lines to inform her that business called him away for several days, he placed his note in a conspicuous place on the dressing-table, and issued from the house, in the misty light of early morning.
                  He saddled his own horse and brought him forth to mount, and, as he did so, he saw a figure crouching under the shelter of a tree, and on looking closer at the bowed and shrunken form, with its bleared eyes and grizzled hair, he recognized old Sambo, now on the very limits of existence. He recalled the former prophecies of the negro seer, and felt annoyed at finding him upon his path. The old man grasped his hand and said with great earnestness:
                  "The hour draws nigh, and I could not sleep, massa Edgar, for thinking o' you; now I see your face, I know the warning was a true one. Stay back till the dark spell is gone, lad; for it's God's truth, if you go forth wi'de thoughts dat are now in your heart, dare will be blood upon your conscience which no time, no repentance will wipe away."
                  "Pshaw, old man," said Huntly, impatiently, "get back to your bed, and let such distempered fancies alone. I have business that ca  lls me away which must be attended to."
                  The old negro still clung to his hand and wept—
                  "Oh, boy, boy dat I ha' loved as my own child, do not scorn my words now: do not trample on de warnin' God sends by me. As surely as you leave this yard, before de day is over de curse o' blood will cling to you forever. Never again shall you stan' in your own house—never again look upon the mother who loves you as her life. Massa Edgar—massa Edgar, tarry wi' us till the sun goes down upon your wrath."
                  Huntly withdrew his hand, and said, decisively,
                  "This is mere drivelling. Let me pass, Sambo, and do you return to your bed and sleep—that is what you most need."
                  He passed on, and the negro arose from his crouching position and leaned for support against the tree, with tears streaming over his wrinkled features. Huntly mounted his horse, and as he rode away, turned to wave a farewell to the sable retainer of his family. Sambo was standing with his hands raised above his head, in an attitude of inexpressible desolation, as his aged eyes caught the last glimpse of his beloved young master, which they were destined to behold on earth.
                  "Blood—blood," muttered Huntly, as he spurred his horse forward in the direction of Talbot Hall, "ever the same prediction, and now 'tis likely to be fulfilled. Yes, Florence, I will become the avenger; even at so fearful a price shall your hand be won, and myself freed from this intolerable tbraldom."
                  While he urged the animal forward at its utmost speed, the instrument of retributive justice, he, over whose head the sword hung, suspended by a hair which the Fates were already severing, was dreaming of a future even more lavishly blessed than the career of successful pride he had already run. There came to him no omen—no dark presentiment which sometimes shadows forth the impending doom. As a thunderbolt from a cloudlesssky, it would fall and crush him, even while he was laying the flattering unction to his soul, that success must ever attend him in his pilgrimage through life.
                  Agnes still lay in a state of dreamlike unconsciousness, but after the first shock had subsided, Colonel Talbot looked forward to her ultimate recovery as a matter of certainty, and he began to be impatient for a decisive reply from Florence. Late in the afternoon of the same day on which Huntly left his mother's house, Colonel Talbot set out to walk toward the Eagle's Nest, hoping to obtain an interview with its mistress.
                  In this he was disappointed, for in answer to his inquiries, the servant said that she had been out walking some time. A belt of woodland lying on his own estate, and some distance below the Hall, he knew to be a favorite resort of hers, and he leisurely proceeded in that direction. Absorbed in his own reflexions, he had walked more than a mile in the heart of the forest before he remembered that he would scarcely find Florence so far from home. He turned at the thought to retrace his steps, when the sound of a horse's tread reached his ear. He paused, and shading his eyes from the slanting sunbeams which fell through the boughs of the trees, he saw a rider with bent head and bowed form, coming slowly toward him. In a few moments he recognized Huntly, but so changed—so pale and sad, the thought instantly occurred to him that he had heard of the illness of Agnes, and his fears for her caused his subdued and wretched appearance.
                  With this idea he advanced toward him, and I placed his hand upon the bridle of his horse before Huntly was aware of his presence. He started, looked up, and a gleam of such deadly fierceness lighted up his features that Talbot recoiled before it.
                  "Ha! well met, Colonel Talbot. I was just revolving in my own mind the chances of obtaining an interview with you, without again entering your house," he haughtily said.
                  "What do you mean, Edgar? Are you not on your way to see my daughter?"
                  "No, sir," thundered Huntly. "Your daughter and myself are henceforth strangers to each other. But with you I have an account to settle, which may not be delayed."
                  "Of what nature, pray?" asked Colonel Talbot, offended in his turn at this cavalier announcement. "Many days have you been my guest, and never before heard I aught of any cause of settlement between us."
                  "Because until within a very few hours the wrongs of a father were unknown to me. Tremble, false man, when I tell you that the evil wrought by your cold-blooded cruelty against the parents of the woman I love is known to me; added to which is the knowledge of the power you posesss to blacken the name of the father whose evil genius you were."
                  "Since the girl you formerly loved is dead you need not now seek to avenge her wrongs," replied Talbot, coolly. "And as it is in your power to render it as much to my interest as your own to keep the secret of your father's dishonor, it is also unnecessary to seek satisfaction for that."
                  As he spoke, Huntly dismounted and securely fastened his horse to a tree. He advanced toward his companion with the same expression of deadly determination on his features, and holding out to him a pistol which he had drawn from his pocket, he said,
                  "Since I am perfectly certain that in the contest about to ensue, I shall be the victorious party, I do not hesitate to proclaim to you that the girl I first loved is not dead: moreover, that she whom you seek for your bride is no other than the Florence Elliot, whose family you persecuted to destruction—the Florence Ilston I wooed and won, and the Florence Ellis who dwells at the Eagle's Nest."
                  Colonel Talbot's face underwent many changes while he thus spoke, and had he been suddenly smitten with the glare of Heaven's lightning, he could not have grown paler.
                  "Can this be true?" he shudderingly asked.
                  "It is as true as that your course is run, and the lapse of a few more minutes will behold you on that sod, a lifeless clod of clay. I have sought this meeting with the intent to fight to the death, and I feel assured it will not be I who will perish."
                  "But suppose I do not choose to fight?"
                  "Then I will fire on you as you retreat—for since I have betrayed the identity of Florence to you, it is necessary that you die. For her sake I would do much more than destroy the craven life that animates your body."
                  Colonel Talbot saw there was no escape He was constitutionally a brave man, and really feared death very little, but the recent revelation had completely unnerved him, and he felt that his tremu'ous hand unfitted him for entering fairly into the proposed contest. He glanced at the stern face of Huntly and said,
                  "Do you know that if I perish your act will be punished as murder? You waylay me—kill me without a witness."
                  "I care not—I am prepared for the consequences. I give you a chance for your life which is more than you deserve. As it is to be a combat à l'outrance, six paces will suffice. Advance one step—take aim—are you prepared?"
                  He paused an instant to ascertain that Colonel Talbot followed his directions, and then pronounced the word "fire" as he saw the eye of his adversary fixed upon him with that precision which indicated his determination to take a deadly aim.
                  Both pistols were discharged at the same instant, and Huntly stood unharmed—the ball had whizzed past his temple so closely as to penetrate the brim of his hat. Colonel Talbot had fallen on his back, and with a beating heart, Edgar approached him. He bent over him, took the pistol from his nerveless hand, and satisfied himself that his features were all ready beginning to settle in the rigidity of death. An expression of horror darkened over his features as he gazed upon the form whose subtle tenant had been so summarily dismissed by his own hand. The summer sun shone as brightly and softly as though no such deed had been perpetrated beneath its light—the birds chirped in the green shadows overhead, and the insects trilled their ceaseless pæan in glad thankfulness for the gift of existence, while the monarch of all lay stiffening in the life-current that welled from his heart, poured forth at the bidding of his reckless fellow man. Huntly felt that a human soul, with all its unrepented sins, had been hurled into eternity through his own rash act; and he mounted his horse and fled from the spot on which the terrible deed had been done. Even in the reckless and desperate state of feeling which had urged Huntly to the consummation of a crime from which he would have shrunk with horror only a few days before, the instinct of self-preservation impelled him to take such measures as would preserve him from suspicion.
                  He rode rapidly toward the ford which was some distance above the bridge, and dismounting, he bathed his face in the limpid water. Alas! its coolness could not allay the fever that scorched his brain. He cast a fearful glance around, to see that no eye was peering on him from the surrounding bushes, and drawing his pistols from his bosom, hurled them both into the bed of the stream.
                  "Thus perish every evidence of guilt!" he exclaimed, "and now to put on a mask which shall deceive the busy prying world."
                  Having obliterated some of the marks of hasty travel from his dress, he again mounted his horse, and by a circuitous route approached the town of —— in an opposite direction from that leading toward the Hall. He entered the hotel—conversed as usual with the landlord, and partook of supper—though each morsel was swallowed with an effort. How he passed the first night of remorse 'tis useless to attempt to portray—Eppes had well described his organization as too weak to bear the consciousness of evil committed by himself. How unutterably wretched and self-condemned he was, no language could picture—his imagination hovered around that stark form in the still and solemn forest, with none to watch over it but the far away stars—no voice to wail above it save the night wind as it passed in sad murmurs and whispered the terrible secret to the shadows of night. Then the scene changed—he beheld the search—the negroes bearing torches of pine, straggling through the forest—heard their shouts to ascertain the presence of him who never more might answer. Then arose the wail of woe when his body was found—and the sad procession bore back its fearful burden toward the Hall.
                  Ignorant of the illness of Agnes, he tortured himself with imagining her anguish when this terrible calamity should become known to her. At length worn out in mind and body, he slept, and dreamed of heaven. Strange contrast, and sent but to torture his waking hour by the memory of the angel presence which had floated around him during his brief slumbers. Suddenly he was aroused by the voice of the landlord, calling to him in a loud and excited tone.
                  He started up perfectly awake, and instantly the scene of the previous evening stood before him, in all its appalling vividness.
                  "What is the matter?" he hurriedly asked.
                  "O, Mr. Huntly, get up, here is the most terrible news. The strangest murder has been committed, and of one of the first gentlemen in the country."
                  Huntly had expected it, but still the announcement fell upon his heart with a cold and numbing weight. He forced himself to ask:
                  "Who is it? for God's sake speak quickly."
                  "O, sir, you will feel it keenly, for it is no other than your good friend, Col. Talbot."
                  "Col. Talbot dead! Good God! I left there only a few days since," exclaimed Huntly with well acted horror and surprise, and he descended the stairs and mixed with the excited crowd below, which the unexpected announcement had drawn together.
                  With unblanching cheek, and unquailing eye, he listened to the exaggerated accounts of the murder, and ascertained that not the remotest suspicion of the real perpetrator of the deed was abroad. A meeting of the citizens was called to devise means for discovering the criminal, and bringing him to justice; and this Huntly forced himself to attend, and exhibit that interest which would naturally be expected from one known to stand in so intimate a relation with the deceased. He sustained his part to the last, though it was with a sickened and revolted spirit that he felt the bitter bondage to which he had sold himself.
                  Late in the evening, he once more set forth with the avowed intention of visiting the Hall, to see if he could render any assistance or consolation to the family; but his thoughts were in reality tending to a different spot. His first wish was to meet Florence, and claim the hand for which so fearful a price had been paid. He knew that Eppes was at the Hall, and every arrangement for the comfort of Agnes would be made by him.
                  When he entered the cottage, he found it deserted; but a slip of paper was placed upon the table on which was scrawled in nearly illegible characters:
                  "Meet me at my mother's grave."
                  Huntly felt that one other heart was conscious of his crime. He hastily turned his steps toward the place indicated. The sun was setting as he entered the ravine, and a straggling gleam of red light played upon the figure of Florence, clad in bridal white, kneeling between the graves of her parents. She also had evidently suffered much, for her features were deadly pale, and the tremulous quiver of her lips indicated strongly repressed emotion. He uttered her name, and with a cry of welcome, she sprang toward him.
                  "O, Edgar, my savior, my preserver, you have come at last! I have waited, I have watched for you until I feared, I know not what."
                  "I have preserved you, Florence," he sadly replied, "not only at the risk of life in this world, but of my soul's life in that which is to come, after this 'fitful fever' has worn out the body. But my thoughts are not now of that. I fear that you may shrink from the hand which is polluted with the stain of blood; may refuse to share the fate of him, over whom a terrible punishment will forever hang speak, beloved, as I alone can love you, does not your heart shrink from mingling its deepest, dearest interests with those of a murderer?"
                  The cheek of Florence lost its pallid hue, as she replied in an earnest and faltering voice:
                  "And you can doubt me! You who have been capable of giving so great a proof of love, might surely be just to me. Know me henceforth as yours in soul, in spirit, even in death itself. Your fate becomes mine, should discovery—punishment overtake you, I will share your lot; proving, even in death, my devotion to you. In such an hour as this, I need not shrink from revealing all that is in my heart. To me you are no murderer, but the avenger of my dead parents, and as such dearer far—ten thousand times more closely knit to my soul, than when we spoke of such love as untried hearts may feel. No—no—give me your hand, Edgar, that hand which——you understand me."
                  She took his hand in both her own, and pressing it to her lips and heart, fervently said—
                  "It has given peace to my soul. The oppressor sleeps his last slumber, and we will now dream of a future, which love and hope shall bless. Smile on me, Edgar; I can not bear that gloomy brow."
                  "I am only thinking, dearest, of the best plan to follow, to insure our mutual safety, and as speedy a reunion as may be compatible with it. Your identity must remain unsuspected, for that might furnish a clue to the perpetrator of the deed, which would lead to destruction."
                  "I will leave this place to-morrow. The stage passes within half a mile, and I can easily go as I came with only the assistance of my servant. I will take refuge with M'Connel until you are in a position to claim my hand with safety. Write under cover to him, and I will join you at any place you may indicate, where our marriage can safely be solemnized."
                  "And I," said Huntly, "must leave my native state. I will emigrate farther west where we will both be strangers. As it is known that I have relinquished my property, this will occasion no surprise; for it is now necessary that I shall exert myself to obtain independence, and a newer country offers greater facilities for doing so. After a little while my mother can join us; and we can all be happy, I trust."
                  "Ah, doubt it not, my beloved—we shall, we must be happy,"
                  "While I look on you, Florence, and hear you speak, I can believe it; but when we are parted—when I stand alone and contemplate the abyss into which I have plunged, I own to you that my soul recoils before it."
                  Florence looked at him sorrowfully. She comprehended something of what was passing within him, and she shuddered as she recalled the words of Eppes. She earnestly said,
                  "Then let us not part. In twenty-four hours we can reach the Ohio, cross it, and be united without any one being aware of it. I can be ready to leave the Eyrie to-night, if you desire it."
                  In his present state of mind, Huntly could not bear solitude, and yet he shrank from all companionship save that of Florence. He eagerly acceded to this offer, and it was arranged that at twelve o'clock at night she should meet him at the bridge, and together they would strike through the woods in as direct a line for the Ohio as possible.
                  Florence returned home, wrote a letter to McConnell informing him that she was about to leave the state forever, and requested him to take possession of the property at the cottage; but by no means to appear personally to claim it, as it was more necessary than ever that her incognito should be strictly preserved. A stage coach going to L—— passed within half a mile of the Eyrie at ten o'clock, and the servant was dispatched by this conveyance with her letter, with ample directions for finding the person to whom it was addressed.
                  When left alone, she gathered the few articles of value she possessed, together with the clothing she wished to take with her, and put them up in a convenient form for her journey. Punctual to the appointed hour Huntly arrived with two horses ready caparisoned, and, in a few, moments Florence was quite ready to accompany him.
                  In the meantime, to evade suspicion more completely, Huntly had forced himself to call at the Hall where he learned the dangerous condition in which Agnes lay. On hearing the particulars of her first seizure with this painful illness, it suggested to him the best course for him to pursue. He sought an interview with Eppes, and, after some conversation relative to the late tragedy, throughout which he managed to retain his composure, Huntly referred to Agnes, and said very sorrowfully—for in this he was not acting—
                  "I am afraid, Eppes, that I can furnish a clue to this attack which renders me very remorseful. On that morning Agnes learned that I still cherished the memory of my first love—and—in short, the tie between us was severed. This, I fear, was the origin of the illness from which she now suffers."
                  "I feared—I suspected as much," replied Eppes, bitterly. "And for a mere dream of the past you sacrificed this pure and devoted heart. O Edgar, what retribution do you deserve for such shameful trifling?"
                  "Spare me, George—do not break the bruised reed; for I assure you I am very, very miserable. I feel convinced that Agnes will recover—she will forget me, and give her love to one far more deserving of her than I am—even to yourself; for I am well aware that you love her."
                  "And what course do you propose to take?" asked Eppes, a little mollified by his evident depression.
                  "I shall travel for a short time, and probably emigrate. I am a poor man now, you know, for I never intend to touch this property which descends to Agnes, even if she should refuse to receive it, which is probable, now she is uncontrolled mistress of her own actions."
                  "Poor girl," sighed Eppes, "if she should ever recover sufficient health and energy to act for herself, such will certainly be her course. Can I serve you in any way, Edgar? If so, command me freely."
                  "Thank you—I need a trifling favor which you can grant—I am in want of a good horse, and would like to get your Arabian, if you will part with him."
                  "Though he is a great favorite, I can not refuse you when we are on the eve of parting. Take him at the same I paid for him, and may he be as faithful to you as he has been to me."
                  Huntly had hesitated about availing himself of the means of procuring a conveyance for Florence; but he knew that it was his only chance to do so on so short a notice, and he therefore stifled his objections. After parting with Eppes, he rode over to —— and easily obtained the requsite caparison for a lady's steed.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IX.
                  AGNES continued for many days in the heavy dreamlike torpor which chained her faculties. Feeling the necessity of having some female companion for her, Eppes wrote to Mrs. Huntly as the person who would naturally feel more interest in her welfare than the summer friends who had fluttered around her in her hour of pride and gladness. Obedient to the summons, she came at once, and never did a mother watch over her own beloved ones with more tenderness than was lavished on the young sufferer by this warmhearted woman.
                  Gradually a slight amendment could be traced. Agnes seemed to awake slowly to what was passing around her—a tear would sometimes steal over her pallid cheek, and her lips seemed to syllable the name of Huntly, though no audible sound issued from them.
                  One evening Mrs. Huntly left the sickroom a few moments, and a slave who had nursed Agnes remained to watch over her during her absence. The daughter of this woman, who was warmly attached to her young mistress, came in to inquire after her, and the two fell into a whispered conversation beside the bed of Agnes. The late tragic event formed the subject of their comments; for both were impressed with the belief that the sick girl could neither hear nor understand them; but the crisis in her disorder had passed, and reason and sensation were slowly resuming their suspended functions. A few of their words fell on her ear with such startling distinctness that her chained faculties seemed at once freed by the terrible calamity they revealed; and she listened with a clear comprehension of all that was uttered. She thus learned the dire catastrophe which had occurred; and when Mrs. Huntly returned to the apartment, she found her in such a state of wild excitement that her physician was immediately summoned. That night was spent by her friends beside her couch, in the belief that, before morning dawned, the violent spasms that convulsed her frame must end life, and the sorrows that had darkened it.
                  A relapse ensued, and the most careful nursing alone preserved the existence of the deeply tried girl: it was cold and dreary winter before Agnes could again move about the house. A deep melancholy seemed to have settled on her mind, and summer came and nearly passed away again before she could be induced to walk forth and visit her former haunts. In the meantime Mrs. Huntly remained principally at the Hall; for Agnes, in her weakness and desertion, clung to her as almost her only friend; and as her own home was lonely in the absence of her son, she remained month after month in the desolated house with the bereaved orphan. Agnes refused to leave it so long as it might lawfully shelter her; for Eppes had undertaken the settlement of the estate, and she knew that ere long the home of her parents must pass into the hands of strangers.
                  Mrs. Huntly received letters from her son at long intervals, which filled her with uneasiness: he seemed to be constantly traveling; for they were rarely dated twice from the same place; and, in them, he spoke of his health as precarious, and a tone of melancholy pervaded them which touched her deeply.
                  It may seem strange that no suspicion of his guilt had ever darkened his mother's mind; but she was too noble, too pure herself, to suspect evil in the being into whom she had labored to instill her own principles, or to believe that any temptation could induce him to perpetrate this terrible crime. The deepest mystery continued to shroud the murderer; every exertion had failed to discover a clue to him, and the mysterious girl who inhabited the Nest had also passed from among them, as a shadow of which no trace remained.
                  Save in one heart, not the remotest suspicion of the truth existed, and she turned shuddering from the terrible thought when it arose before her in all its appalling horror. She would not believe that the upright and noble spirit with which she had once truly linked her own had consummated this deed of blood: in her own breast she buried the secret of the identity of Florence: she had never breathed to any human ear the cause of her illness, nor the meeting she had witnessed in the cave.
                  Her attachment to Mrs. Huntly seemed to borrow additional tenderness from her own fears of the terrible revelation which at some future day might come to her; and Agnes prayed earnestly that she might be preserved from this crowning evil of her life.
                  One evening in early autumn when the bright sun seems brightest, and the forest leaves are only beginning to don their gorgeous livery, and the bland air seems to impart a new sense of enjoyment to the spirit; on such an evening Agnes for the first time acceded to the earnest prayer of Eppes, and consented to walk out, and view the scenes of her former happiness. She wished, yet shrank from visiting her old haunts for the last time; for in a few more days the Hall would pass into the possession of others: the estate had been declared insolvent, and, with blighted hopes, and faded beauty, and ruined fortune, the daughter of Talbot was to leave her native home and seek amid strange scenes for the kindness and sympathy her wounded spirit needed.
                  She no longer bounded with light and joyous steps along the familiar pathway, and the smile of patient sadness that dwelt upon her lip, Eppes scarcely dared to regard as an assurance that Hope was once more throwing her magic ray over the future.
                  He turned in the direction of the cave.
                  "Let us not go there," said she, gently. "I can not so soon hazard my newly-acquired tranquility by recalling the agony of soul I once endured on that spot."
                  This was her first allusion to the painful past, and Eppes imagined that it referred to the last interview which Huntly's parting words had led him to suppose took place in the cave. He asked—
                  "In which direction do you wish to walk, dear Agnes?"
                  "The river seems to be unusually low; let us descend the pathway and cross on the rocks. I believe I would prefer walking to the Eagle's Nest."
                  "I am afraid it is too far for you."
                  "O no—I am quite strong, and I shall feel better for the exertion."
                  By crossing on the rocks, which the low water had left bare, the walk was shorter and the way less precipitous, and, without feeling much fatigue, Agnes soon stood at the gate of the lonely house which had remained unoccupied since the departure of Florence. They found ready ingress, for the latch had fallen and the gate hung partly off its hinges—the yard was filled with weeds and long grass. As they strolled around the building, Eppes saw something white hanging in the branches of a wild rose bush that grew near one of the windows. He reached out his hand and found that it was a lady's glove. He was about to offer it to Agnes as a relic of her lost friend, when he turned the hem down to see if the name of the owner was written in it. Florence was distinctly traced, but the name which followed it had been obliterated. This seemed strange, and he looked more closely at it; he was almost sure that the following name commenced with an I, and ended with an n—a vague suspicion which blanched his cheek caused him to crush the glove in his hand and thrust it into his bosom, for closer inspection when he returned to the Hall.
                  The curiosity of Agnes was soon satisfied, and they descended toward the river. When they reached the ford, she complained of extreme fatigue, and, as it was still early, Eppes insisted on placing her on a rocky ledge to rest, while he went across the stream a short distance above to obtain some brilliant flowers which hung from the cliff.
                  The river, from long continued drought, had shrunk to a narrow and limpid current which murmured over its rocky bed, making a pleasing music in the hush of evening. Eppes obtained the flowers, and, as he returned with them, his eye was attracted by a dark object lying in an eddy in the stream. Another keen glance he cast at it—it was—it must be a pistol! and a fearful thought drove the blood in a torrent to his heart, leaving his brow pale and cold as marble. In another instant it was in his hand, and he recoiled as if a violent blow had been dealt him. A few feet further on lay a second pistol, as if both had been hurled together into the bed of the stream.
                  They were well known to Eppes, for they had been a gift from himself to Huntly, while classmates in college, and he knew that they had been constantly used by him from that time. He staggered toward the shore, and, in alarm, Agnes came to the water's edge to meet him.
                  "Why do you look so pale, dear George?" she asked. "You have found a pair of pistols I see; but why did you throw away my flowers after all your trouble to obtain them?"
                  "Do you recognize these?" he asked, extending the pistols toward her.
                  "Certainly not—why should I? Ah, now I do remember seeing Edgar Huntly fire at a mark with them. How came they there?"
                  Her voice almost died upon her lips as she asked this question; and, alarmed at her extreme paleness, and the trembling of her frame, Eppes became conscious of the imprudence of which he had been guilty. He led her back to her seat, and, placing her tenderly upon it, said,
                  "Sit here and listen to me, Agnes; for I have said enough to arouse suspicions in your mind, and it seems best to tell you all I believe at once. Have you sufficient firmness to hear him you have loved charged with crime?"
                  A pause of several moments ensued before Agnes raised her head. She was still extremely pallid, and her lips quivered; but she spoke with firmness.
                  "Speak—I can hear you. I am not now the weak shrinking girl you once knew. Suffering has taught me a lesson of endurance; go on with your revelation while I am calm enough to understand."
                  Slowly and cautiously he unfolded to her all the circumstances of her father's murder, and then drew from his breast the glove he had so recently found.
                  "I swear to you, Agnes, that until this evening I never suspected the friend of my youth of this deed; and it wrings my heart to do so now. Behold this glove—examine the obliterated name, and see if it is not Florence Ilston—behold the pistols of Huntly—link the two together, and the clue to this long-concealed murder is found. Agnes, I now read the cause of your long and hopeless depression. You ascertained the identity of this girl with the one Huntly had loved on that morning when I found you so nearly lifeless in the cave. That caused your illness and the unacknowledged fear that this discovery might occur, has crushed your spirits. Speak—is it not so?"
                  "It is," said Agnes, faintly. "But you have no positive proof that this is true. Spare him for his mother's sake—for the sake of the love I once bore him, spare him. I can not see him proved my father's murderer and live: leave me that doubt, it will be my only solace."
                  "Agnes, there is no doubt, and when you are calmer you will see that there is none. I would do much for you; but this deed can not pass unpunished. The murder was too unprovoked—have you no sternness in your soul when you call to mind the wantonness of the act? perpetrated at the bidding of a revengeful woman. From his hand the deed is doubly accursed; and when the chain of evidence is once completed, I will pursue him even to the death. He was my friend, and I loved him truly—I surrendered the woman I loved to him without a murmur; for I believed him honorable and capable of rendering her happy. False—false, and guilty he has proved himself, and I abjure my friendship for him. Infirm of purpose I ever knew him to be; but the cool calculating murderer his act has proved him, I scarcely thought he could ever become. How Florence Ilston evaded the inquiries of her friends I can not imagine; but, furnished with the first link, I will follow it up until I have traced her mysterious course throughout."
                  Agnes wept silently; but she offered no further remonstrance. Eppes gazed with deeper tenderness than he had ever before felt upon the statue-like features over which the flitting shades of color, which once gave brightness to her beauty, had altogether ceased to play; and he thought—
                  "When time has brought healing on its wings, she may once more dream of happiness and find it in the love which has never for one moment swerved from her. O Agnes sweet spirit of endurance, may mine be the privilege to soothe your heart into forgetfulness of the dreary past."
                  They returned home in silence, and Eppes retired to the apartment once occupied by Colonel Talbot, in which he had been employed during the morning in looking over old papers. Among them he remembered a roll inscribed with the name of Huntly's father, with the word "important" written beneath. He recalled dim memories of old time gossip concerning the relations existing between the former partners—the singular will—the sudden death of Mr. Huntly; and he now determined to examine those papers, to see if they would cast any light on the motives which prompted Edgar to commit the fatal deed; for that he had perpetrated it at the instigation of Florence alone, he could scarcely believe.
                  The bundle was readily found, and as it was simply tied with tape, he did not scruple to open it. The evidence of the forgery, with a detailed account of the means by which it had been effected, was before hid; he was deeply engaged in reading this new proof of the guilt of his former friend, as this furnished a motive for the deed, when a light tap was struck on the door, and the voice of the wife and mother of the two criminals required admittance.
                  Eppes hastily put the papers aside, and admitted her. She appeared much embarrassed and distressed, and several moments elapsed before she spoke. She at length said—
                  "I have a letter from my son, in which he informs me, that continued ill health will preclude his return to his native state for an indefinite period, and he has requested me to claim some papers of importance, belonging to him, which were in the possession of Col. Talbot. I can easily identify the package."
                  Eppes was terribly embarrassed; he could not surrender the papers, for they would furnish a most important part of the evidence against the murderer; and yet how could he refuse them to the unfortunate woman, for whom he felt the deepest compassion? The struggle passing within was visible on his features, and Mrs. Huntly seemed on the point of fainting, as she grasped his arm, and said:
                  "You—you have not read them—you have not dared to violate the sanctity of a seal. But what matters it now? the grave cancels all crime, and this has long since been expiated. I know you to be too generous to——"
                  She paused, her figure grew erect and rigid, and her eyes appeared to dilate with horror, as they dwelt on some object which seemed to have power to turn her into stone. Slwly raising her finger, she pointed to the rusty pistols which he had laid upon the table, and forgotten until this moment. Words seemed to force themselves from her lips rather than to be uttered by any volition of her own.
                  "My son's pistols! How came they here, and thus rusted?"
                  He would have evaded her inquiry, but her eyes were fixed upon him with an expression of menacing command he had not believed them capable of assuming, and she imperiously added—
                  "The truth, the truth, as you have a soul to be saved! I must, I will know where they were found."
                  "Within the hour, I discovered them lying on the rocks in the river, where they had evidently been hurled," he briefly answered.
                  A shriek that thrilled through every fibre of his frame, burst from the lips of the wretched mother, and grasping his arm with a degree of force that was almost painful, she said—
                  "Tell me—God of mercy have compassion upon me!—tell me had he time—could he have reached that spot in season to accomplish the accursed deed? O, I see, I feel it all; I sent him forth to brand his brow with the mark of Cain. What my son—my bright, my beautiful—he over whose infant conch I have watched and prayed, whose infant voice first learned to lisp its half-formed accents from my tongue; can he be that thing they call a murderer? His soul stained with the crime of blood? O, no—no—no!"
                  And with the last words uttered in tones of such heart-thrilling anguish, as well might chill the blood of her agitated listener, she fell in violent convulsions.
                  Mrs. Huntly was conveyed to her apartment, and a physician was instantly sum moned; every exertion was made to administer relief to her sufferings, but they had a deeper source than human skill could reach; in that moment of unutterable agony, when the dreadful truth burst upon her mind, the heart of the wretched mother had broken. Throughout the night, the deep suffocated sobs which broke the stillness of the apartment, and the low faint moans of anguish, in which the name of her son was often heard, mingled with muttered words of terrible import, warned the physician that the lacerated spirit was beyond his skill to medicine to rest.
                  She had been a woman of many sorrows, but the last blow had been final. The sun arose on the corse of the broken hearted mother, and Agnes wept beside her, with a feeling of utter desolation. In the wide world, Eppes seemed the only true friend left to the orphan girl.
                  With every mark of respect, Mrs. Huntly's remains were conveyed to her own estate, and interred beside those of her husband. Eppes removed Agnes from the Hall, and placed her with a connection of his own, who resided in L——, where change of scene, and pleasant companionship, might perchance obliterate the sad impressions of the past year, and restore her to something like her former lightness of heart.
                  These duties attended to, he followed up the evidences of Huntly's guilt, until proof on proof accumulated in his hands, and no shadow of doubt remained. With slight difficulty he ascertained through whose agency the furniture of the Cottage had been removed, and discovered that M'Connel had employed the person who did it. He then went to the house of the Scotchman, and found only his wife at home; convinced that she must have been privy to the whole transaction, as Florence was asserted to have died under her roof, Eppes was not sorry to find her alone. The result of the interview was entirely satisfactory; Mrs. M'Connel became alarmed at some of his revelations, and thought it best to confess the whole deception. It was not difficult to trace her course afterward, and in a few weeks the whole series of facts necessary to sustain the charge were obtained, and a warrant issued for the arrest of Edgar Huntly, to answer for the crime of murder, committed upon the body of Col. Talbot.
                  Guided by the date of his last letter to his mother, an emissary had been dispatched in pursuit of him, and a communication from his agent informed Eppes, that Huntly was at that time ill in a small village just below the mouth of the Ohio. He had wandered over several of the western states, ostensibly in search of a suitable place in which to remain permanently, but really because he was too wretched to remain on any spot long. An intense desire to tread his native sod once more at length seized on him, and he came to this obscure village, under an assumed name, and rented a small cottage, far enough removed from the town to insure privacy.
               
               
                  CHAPTER X.
                  THE evening was winding to its close. Bright crimson clouds lay piled up in the west, and the atmosphere had that hazy glow peculiar to Indian-summer. The burnished rays of the sun's last parting flash were reflected from the windows of a small frame dwelling, situated in the outskirts of a picturesque village.
                  The curtains of the principal apartment were so arranged as to exclude the glare of light from the river, which swept past within a few rods, and on a sofa drawn into the center of the room reclined a young man apparently in feeble health. He was sleeping, but not in peace; the pale brow was knit in many furrows, and words were occasionally muttered as if struggling even in his slumbers, with some terrible and agonizing remembrance.
                  A young and very beautiful woman leaned over him, with her hands clasped, and her lips apart, as if seeking to gain the sense of his incoherent mutterings, and the pulses of life seemed to standing still as she listened.
                  "Off! slave! wretch! how dare you touch me! What, do you accuse me? Blood—blood—a murderer! no—no—these hands are pure. O, Florence, thou art mine, but fearful was the price. Look, there's blood around —above me! O, God! I stifle in a sea of crimson waves."
                  With a wild bound he sprang upon the floor, and stood staring vacantly around him. Florence approached him, half fearful, and laid her hand upon his arm—
                  "Edgar, dearest Edgar, what has thus excited you?"
                  Huntly was still under the influence of his dream, and he threw her hand from him, with shuddering violenee, while he exclaimed—
                  "Off woman! sorceress! I have sold myself to perdition, for thy vindictive heart; and what avails it, now I possess it? Can it take from mine the sting of guilt? Can it allay the remorse which haunts me like a fiend, both waking and sleeping? Thy love! O, mockery! that only makes me feel how madly I have listened to the syren voice that tempted me to evil."
                  Florence listened with blanched and quivering lips, to the first reproach which had ever been spoken by her husband. She sank on a seat without uttering a word, with her hands clasped over her heart, as if to still its agonized throbs. Huntly could not witness the suffering he had inflicted, without the keenest remorse. In a moment he was beside her—
                  "Forgive me, my own—my beloved—I knew not what I said. I was still mad from the horror of that dream. O, Florence, let not our lives be embittered by dissension; there is enough real unmitigated wretchedness in our lot, without increasing it by our conduct toward each other. You know that I love you better than my own life; that in my calmer moments I do not repent the past—Florence pardon, and look on me once more."
                  Florence thus adjured, raised her head, and turned her eyes upon him, but he was startled by the fixed expression of despair he read in their depths—she slowly said—
                  "For weeks I have struggled with the terrible thought, that will not be driven away. I feel that I am becoming loathsome to you, as the instigator of a crime, which embitters every hour of your life. I feel and know, that it must be so; yet with the strength of despairing love, I have clasped to my soul the fond hope, that a small portion of happiness might yet be ours. Even that is now wrested from me. I have watched your slumbers, and the words that broke from your unguarded lips have too truly assured me that for the guilty there is no peace—no hope. I bear with me the eternal consciousnes that mine was the voice which tempted you to the commission of crime, and yet I live—live to the unutterable wretchedness of knowing that I have brought misery to the only heart that loves me! The first reproach has been uttered; henceforth our hearts are deprived of the sad belief, that no suffering could wring a bitter word from the lips of either. As remorse preys on the soul, they must become more frequent, and thus the fatal love which once united us, will become a recollection fraught with bitterness. Henceforth our lot is but an eternity of evil."
                  Huntly shuddered as he listened to the cold and measured tones with which words of such fearful meaning were uttered; and their deep truth he felt in the inmost depths of his being. He attempted to reply to her, but his words faltered on his lips, and starting up, Florence rushed from the room.
                  A mountain of agony appeared to be pressing upon her heart, and careless of observation, she hurried toward the river, and wildly paced up and down the sandy shore, which the shrunken stream had left smooth and dry. She gazed on the placid waters, as if their very calmness were an irritation, and reproach to the tumultuous state of her own feelings. Once she paused, looked wistfully on them, and muttered—
                  "O, would I dare to take that final plunge. O, God, can I live, and meet that withering glance again! I know—I see it all. He whom I have so loved, will learn to loathe my presence. Nay, already he begins to fear my eye—to shrink from me, as the fatal cause of crime and evil to him. 'Tis but a plunge beneath these calm and lucid waters, which seem to woo me to their cool embrace, and this feverish strife that consumes my heart will be forever ended. O, Edgar, could penitence place thee as I found thee, the angels of heaven would not be more pure."
                  While she thus ventured her emotion in passionate mutterings, she did not observe a boat which shot from beneath a group of trees on the opposite bank, and rapidly drew near the spot on which she stood. The dip of the oars in the water first aroused her from her bitter reverie, and looking up, she beheld it within a few yards of her; besides the man who rowed, there were three others, two ordinary looking persons in coarse clothing, the third had the air and appearance of a gentleman.
                  A single glance at him, informed Florence that she beheld Eppes, and why he was thus accompanied, she at once surmised. Her first impulse was flight, and swiftly running up the bank, she pursued her rapid way to their abode, forgetful that she but drew suspicion on herself, and compromised the safety of Huntly, by pointing out their dwelling to their pursuers, thus depriving him of all chance to seek safety in flight.
                  Huntly had resumed his place on the sofa, and in unavailing remorse was thinking over the last year of his unhappy life. For a few brief months the love of Florence, her varied powers of interesting and soothing his mind into a temporary forgetfulness of the past, had partially concealed from him the precipice on which he stood, beneath which yawned a gulf of infamy and horror he dared not contemplate.
                  But remorse will not long be cheated of its victim; a terrible nervous disease gradually fastened upon him, the fantasies of which he had no power to dispel. Often when his beautiful Florence bent over him and smiled, it seemed to him that a fiend was mocking him from those ruby lips, and if her bright tresses swept across his cheek, he shrank from them with a shudder, remembering the fable of Medusa and her serpent locks. These terrible fancies he endeavored to conceal from his wife, but he could not dispel them, and he already felt that death is the only welcome solace to the spirit weighed down with guilt.
                  He was meditating even to madness on the scene which had just passed, when Florence rushed into the room,
                  "They come—they come, to bear you to infamy and death!" she exclaimed, "Fly Edgar, while it is yet in your power!"
                  "Who comes?" he asked starting up trembling, and white with terror.
                  "Eppes, your friend—no, no, your worst enemy, I should say, for I know—I know he seeks you for no good purpose, conceal yourself Edgar, while I—I will meet them."
                  By a violent effort for self-control, Huntly regained calmness; he said,
                  "Florence be more composed; why should Eppes seek me for evil? He has ever been my friend. Perhaps after all, you may have been mistaken."
                  "No, no, no, I would know him among a thousand, and I saw that he too recognized me."
                  "'Tis too late now to evade the meeting," said Huntly, "for they are coming through the yard. I must face him as I can."
                  He sank back upon the sofa utterly unnerved, and Eppes had entered the room and advanced quite near him before he could decide on what course to pursue during the interview. When he beheld the friend of former years standing almost beside him, his first impulse was to offer his hand to him in friendly greeting, but Eppes waved it back, and said with mournful emphasis,
                  "I can not touch that hand, Huntly, which has been so often clasped in truth and honor. I came not hither as the friend of him who has taught me to blush that the name was ever bestowed upon him, but as the avenger of crime. I bear with me the authority to arrest you for the most foul murder of Col. Talbot, perpetrated at the instigation of that woman who stands beside you, whom I am informed is now your wife."
                  Huntly started up, and exclaimed in a loud and irritated tone,
                  "How dare you bring so terrible an accusation against me? and what proof can you possibly have to sustain it? Methinks my own abode should he a protection against such insult. Why should I murder Col. Talbot?"
                  "To save your father's name from infamy, to preserve yonder syren from a crime the punishment of which she might have to endure. Denial will not avail you; the proofs are complete. The papers which criminate your father have fallen into my hands, your pistols were found by myself, lying where you had hurled them, and the dying words of your mother threw a terrible light upon the causes which prompted you to this awful deed."
                  "My mother dead!" gasped Huntly, "yet I am thankful, for she is spared the anguish of this hour. What caused her death?"
                  "If ever a broken heart laid the head in the grave, that fate was your mother's."
                  Huntly could well surmise the cause, and he sank back with a deep groan. During this scene Florence remained standing as rigid as if carved of stone, with no hue of life upon her features, she had no power to move or utter a syllable in extenuation of the crime with which Huntly was charged. She had but one thought, one feeling—she had destroyed him! Her's had been the tempting voice, yet his would be the punishment. Not even the quiver of an eyelid showed that life was in that statue-like form, until Eppes addressed her,
                  "For you, madam, whose fatal beauty, and talents shamefully misapplied, have enabled you to accomplish the ruin of a once noble heart, I have also a warrant of arrest as an accomplice in this most heart-rending tragedy. Methinks the friend of Agnes Talbot might have rested satisfied with luring her lover from her, without adding cruelty to injury. My researches have enabled me to follow you through the whole of your tortuous path, and that you both are implicated in the murder I can not doubt."
                  A faint streak of crimson crossed the cheek of Florence as he thus spoke, and gradually the color returned to her lips; elevating her figure to its utmost height, she raised her hand to heaven, and attempted to speak; the effort was vain, and the next moment she fell senseless at his feet.
               
               
                  CONCLUSION.
                  MANY dark and dreary weeks elapsed Huntly was placed at the bar, looking more like a shadow of his former self, than a being of flesh and blood. He saw a crowd of faces all turned toward him, but among them, not one seemed to have sympathy for the murderer. With quiet apathy he heard the charges brought against him, and replied not, except to relate the actual circumstances of the meeting between himself and Col. Talbot, and the species of duel which had taken place. This changed th feeling of men toward him, but it did not essentially alter the features of the case. His confession exonerated Florence from all participation in the deed, and the indictment against her was dismissed, but she remained in prison with him at her own request. Huntly saw his doom approaching with a stony hardness of feeling he would once have shuddered to believe possible; the crushing sense of guilt and disgrace, seemed to have deprived him of all thought or feeling. He was pronounced guilty, but was strongly recommended to the clemency of the governor, and friends interested themselves to procure his pardon.
                  He appeared indifferent to the success of the application, and it was only when alone with Florence, that the sensibility which once gave a charm to his character again shone forth. Their love seemed to have revived in its first intensity, and touching was the devotion they manifested toward each other—many fragments of true poetry written by Florence, and responded to by him, during their sojourn in that dark prison-house, have been preserved by those who were interested in their fate; and they breathe a depth of tenderness, a true perception of the nobility of perfect love, not often found in the productions of genius, which has made itself a world-wide fame.
                  It was the night before the day appointed to witness the close of this dismal tragedy. Huntly leaned back in a large chair placed near the grated window of his cell. The glare of a lamp was thrown on his wan features, and attenuated form. He suffered from constant inward fever, and his appetite had so completely deserted him as to induce the jailor to believe that he was endeavoring to escape public punishment, by starvation. But such was not the case, it was simply a loathing of life, and all that could sustain it in his spectral frame. Few who had formerly known him would now have recognized the elegant and accomplished Edgar Huntly, in the feeble being who sat with his hands clasped together, and his large clear eyes beaming with almost supernatural brightness upon the altered person of his wife.
                  Florence no longer brilliant, no longer an object of attraction to all who gazed on her, but pale, woe-worn, and wretched, lay upon a couch placed within a short distance of his seat. Her eyes were closed, but she did not sleep. O, no, the terrible day that was approaching—the scene that was to be enacted, were too vividly pictured before her, to suffer her over-wrought senses to steep themselves in the forgetfulness of slumber. Suddenly raising her head, she spoke,
                  "Edgar I shall not survive you, I know full well; but death does not wing his arrows swift enough; I must help his lagging hand, for I can not, I will not live to see the light of that day which is to consign you to everlasting darkness. No, no, I must put off this mortal coil, before another sun sheds his mocking beams in the prisoner's cell. I have laudanum; Dr. Baily gave it to me, and told me to take a sufficient portion to produce sleep. I will obey him—ha! I will sleep well—so well that this deadly pain which sickens my heart shall be quieted forever. There is the vial on the table beside you; give it to me, dear Edgar. I have brought death and doom to you; requite me in kind. Be thou the hand which offers me the means of escape from the horrible to-morrow."
                  "No, my beloved Florence, I can not do this," replied Huntly sorrowfully, "I am already sufficiently stained with crime, and death with all its terrors will come soon enough to the guilty, without hastening its approach."
                  Florence raised herself, and leaning forward addressed him with some of her former energy of manner,
                  "Have you yet realized all that is to come? The sea of human faces, wearing only an expression of curiosity at the spectacle of a human being hurled suddenly through life's portal: the hangman's touch—the rope—the infamy? O, Edgar, how can you think of it, and not anticipate the doom they have awarded you?"
                  Huntly shuddered, and covered his face with his hands, as she thus pictured to him the close of his earthly career. She arose, took the vial, and approaching him, continued,
                  "Have you not courage to shorten the miserable remnant of existence that remains to you? Here, take it, Edgar—I waive my right to the doom it can purchase. Take it, best beloved, as the last favor granted by her, who, of all the world alone, clings to you in your isolated condition. Trust to the mercy of God, my husband; it is greater than that of man."
                  At this passionate adjuration, Huntly raised his hand to grasp the deadly drug, but at her last words it dropped nerveless upon his lap, and a bright beam of resignation gleamed over his wasted features. He said,
                  "God's mercy endureth forever; therefore will I trust in it, and not again outrage his commands by committing that which I know to be wrong. Methinks my mother's image hovers over me now, and breathes into my soul the power to sustain the wretchedness of the few remaining hours of existence left to me."
                  As he thus spoke, Florence drained the contents of the vial, and dashed it in fragments on the floor.
                  "O, Florence, why have you done this?" exclaimed the unhappy man, as he threw himself forward, too late to prevent the deed. With something of her former fierceness, she replied,
                  "Can you, Edgar Huntly, ask me such a question? Think you that I, who pursued my enemy with relentless hate—who tempted the man I love to take the life of my enemy—that I have not courage to die by my own hand, sooner than live to infamy and wretchedness? No—welcome death! Though young in years, I have already lived to feel the nothingness of existence when unbridled passions have blotted out the sunshine of a peaceful conscience."
                  She drew near him, knelt at his side, and clasping his hands in both her own, spoke in a softer and clearer tone.
                  "Pardon me, my unhappy husband, for I have deeply wronged you. Selfishly have I shrunk from beholding your last hour, but we meet soon upon the shores of that dim and distant tant world, whose shadows are already around me."
                  Thus she continued to utter passionate bursts of eloquence and affection, until the numbing influence of the potion she had swallowed mounted to her brain—then, when the faltering accents died away—when the respiration became fainter, fainter, and finally ceased, Huntly felt that he was indeed alone—the world with its myriads of human souls, but one vast desert. He threw himself beside the inanimate form: he parted the bright curls from her rigid brow, and passionately invoked her by the fearful bond which had existed between them to answer him. The marble halls of Death had claimed her as their inmate, and their cold, unanswering walls had forever shut out the voice of human woe from those within their embrace.
                  During the progress of the trial, many friends of the unhappy pair had assembled in L——, but they steadily refused admittance to all of them, with the exception of Dr. Baily. Florence remembered his former kindness, and she induced Huntly to receive him. On the morning of the expected execution, the good doctor came toward the prison with a more cheerful face than usual. He was accompanied by two gentlemen—one was a clergyman, and the other a messenger, who had just arrived from the capital, bearing a reprieve for the condemned, which it was fully believed would very soon be followed by pardon for the crime he had committed.
                  The door unclosed, and the party remained mute for a brief space, regarding the scene before them. Florence lay upon the couch, and her glittering hair swept in shining waves to the floor. Huntly kneeled beside her, with his pale cheek pillowed upon that silken sheen, and his arm thrown over her form—the rigid outline of both figures, as the morning sun fell through the prison bars upon them, informed the visitors that they looked upon that sleep from which there is no awakening. The mercy of man was now of no avail; they had gone to a higher tribunal to receive the award their acts had merited.
                  
                  Dark has been the record of crime and its punishment, but one solitary gleam of light glances athwart the gloom. The fate of the gentle Agnes was finally a happy one. Several years elasped before she consented to bestow her hand on him who had so long and so ardently loved her, but the home of Eppes was at length blessed by the presence of his bride.
                  The fair brow is a shade more thoughtful, and the lips smile less frequently than in days of yore, but the face has lost none of its placid beauty, and kind and gentle words dwell not less often upon the lips. Eppes is a very happy man, and Agnes is sometimes surprised that she could ever have done otherwise than love him as fervently as now.
